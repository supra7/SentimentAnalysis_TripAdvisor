Things have been steadily going downhill our last few trips and hoping for it to get better was obviously a mistake. First of all. This hotel is EXTREMELY noisy! The clientele is loud, obnoxious, and crass. Afterall they are likely paying $40.00 a night. So while we get a comped suite, our neighbors are the polar opposite. Good luck trying to sleep. Second, the beds are perhaps the worst beds we have ever slept on. One would think their \"suites\" would be better outfitted. Nope. Oh I almost forgot. The roller-coaster. If hearing screaming every 3 mins from your room until 12am is your forte you will love the NY NY. Lastly the casino is tight, tight, tight. Slots payout nothing. Table limits are high for a hotel that charges $40.00 a night for their rooms. I would have given an extra star for the theme, but sadly they stripped the theme about 2 years ago and replaced it with a club scene. I guess 22 year old college kids spend more than someone who makes 120k a year.

We wanted to go to Vegas for the fun of it but also wanted a day or two of sitting around the pool relaxing. We were told at check in that there was no pool, but to compensate for that they gave us a voucher for 2 free drinks. BUT there was still the 18.00 a day resort fee. Sorry but in my opinion a \"resort\" means ammenities other than really spotty WiFi...the 18.00 resort fee includes WiFi and their fitness center. We knew about the resort fee going in, but didnt know about the pool renos. They should have waived the fees during this time or offered some sort of other compensation other than \"two free drinks\". We were advised that we could use the pool at the Excalibur or MGM in place of their pool. Tried the pool at the Excalibur but when we got there, one of their pools was down as well , and they only had their small one up and running and it was packed with kids...no thanks. Did not feel like walking all over the strip to get into a pool to \"relax\"...just doesnt make sense. Other than that, the room was very clean...perfect location (they put us in a room that was situated so we didnt have any rooms on either side of us). Was worried after reading some of the reviews on here that the room would be old and worn but ours was quite lovely. Its an older hotel so you have to expect some wear and tear. The cleaning staff was awesome. Very friendly and always smiling. And our attendant took great care of us. Restaurants are very expensive but so is most of Vegas. You have to expect that when you go to eat. We did love the feel of this hotel but the pool not being there and the resort fee still being charge in full after this put a bad taste in our mouth about staying there again. We go to Vegas once or twice a year and always try a new hotel, yet still trying to find \"our\" hotel in the process.

Pricing on the room was fair/moderate. We had a Park Avenue room with a view, looking out towards the Tropicana. I would consider myself frugal; normally would try to find the cheapest option available (without getting a roach motel or something). I spent some extra on NYNY mainly for location and with the deal we got on the in-house Cirque show it was worth it. We knew the location of things on the strip and NYNY offered a great central place to head out from. The free tram was at Monte Carlo just to the north; that tram runs to the center of the strip. Excaliber has the tram that runs to the south. It's Vegas; if you leave your hotel be prepared to walk...a lot (or pay for rides). We enjoyed the atmosphere of the casino and restaurants. People and staff were friendly. Really all we didn't care for was the bathroom as it was a bit small and the tub was really high to step into. We knew about the bathrooms ahead of time based on other reviews. Keep in mind, my wife and I wouldn't much enjoy an upscale resort. Too stuffy IMO; we walked through the Bellagio a lot because of the tram. It was beautiful, it smelled great from the flowers, but I would feel I would need to spend all day there to get my money's worth, lol. Bed was super soft, room was clean, fun view, service at the casino was solid, nothing really to complain about. We went to 6 shows in three days and NYNY gave us a couple hot showers a piece each day and a place to get a quick 4 hours sleep each night without issue As with anything, you will find complainers everywhere.

On Monday morning our group decided to go to New York, New York to ride the roller coaster, and then have brunch. And so we did. This is the first time I have reviewed a roller coaster, and I would give it 6.5 out of 10. Pretty good, though we felt there needed to be another swoop or bump towards the end. Then we decided to look for some brunch. We wandered around the fake streets of Manhattan under a painted sky looking for some breakfast. We passed Starbucks, a Tex Mex restaurant and a burger grill. We stopped and asked the receptionist at the Tex Mex diner if they had a buffet breakfast anywhere - after all Vegas is famous for its buffets - and she looked me dead in the eye and said, 'We have 17 restaurants here, we don't need a buffet.' Oh dear, I thought, well where can we get a traditional breakfast? Cafe of the Americas was the answer and so we went past the deli, the pub, and the Italian restaurant until we found the Americas. We queued briefly and then went inside and were seated under a magnificent model map of the USA. Then a charming hostess got me a spicy Bloody Mary, and coffees and Mimosas for the others. She was very polite and amusing and that was the only good experience. The food was below average, tasteless and served as though it was coming out of a military canteen. I had corned beef hash, one of my favourite brunch dishes, and it came alongside an identicallly-sized slab of hash brown. No garnish, no attempt at presentation, just two fat slabs of food dumped on the plate. Two of my friends ordered a 'Bagel Mania'. Dear God in Heaven, they couldn't even get the various bits of sausage and egg and bagel to stay together, the 'manias' had collapsed and looked dreadful and greasy. So, as I was finding the food so unpleasant to look at, my eyes started to wander and fell upon the cocktail specials menu left over from St Patrick's Day. I am scanning and attaching it to this review as I doubt many readers will believe what I am about to write. The special cocktails were, an Irish Mojito, and Irish Spring and... are you ready for this? An I.R.A. Yep, that's right, the special cocktail in the New York New York hotel for this year's St Patrick's Day is named after the organisation that murdered men women and children in the UK and Europe and played on the fringes of conflicts in Croatia and Colombia. How divine, how charming, I hear you say, now what was the recipe? Well should you wish to enjoy a terrorist-inspired cocktail it is made with, 'a chilled shot of Jameson Irish Whiskey, Apple Pucker, and a wee bit o'cranberry'. Maybe the cranberry is there to represent the blood spilled when the IRA bombed the Remembrance Day Parade at Enniskillen killing thirteen people and injuring 63? We had a discussion afterwards about it, and I also asked online what other cocktails this sick mixologist might like to add to the menu. A Flaming Osama was a popular choice, or maybe Laden Litchi Martini? I can assume a level of ignorance and stupidity led to this, and that it was a mistake, but just think of the outrage you'd get from an American tourist if a British hotel was selling Al Qaeda cocktails. It's not acceptable and demands a very public apology. I won't be going back. Oh, and one final note: the receptionist was wrong.

I'll be sticking with Expedia for booking from now on, have never had any troubles with them. The rooms are okay, a little on the dated side and not as clean as I would have liked. I have to say out of the other hotels I've stayed at in Vegas the rooms were my least favorite (when comparing to Mandalay Bay, TI, PH Towers, Plant Hollywood and MGM Grand). That being said, I will say that the location is great and there is lots of variety for entertainment and dining in this hotel. We have some good meals and some good times at Il Fornaio, Coyote Ugly, America etc. Coyote Ugly is pretty entertaining- we got there during happy hour when drinks were cheap and ended up staying most of the evening. Even though my husband isn't really a big bar person and we didn't know anyone else there we had a great night! One bonus is that the Wi-Fi was included in the resort fee. If I recall correctly almost all of the other hotels we stayed at had the $14-15 resort fee PLUS charged anywhere from $10-$16 a day for internet. Overall we had a good stay here. I would recommend it based on the fact that the location is great and there is decent variety of things to do here. Our favorite spot on the strip is always going to be PH and PH Towers though!", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice atmosphere, great new York feel.\u201d", "Author": "elmoaf", "ReviewID": "UR126518743", "Content": "This was a nice hotel, we ate hitdogs in the downtown are they were great.

We were able to find a deal that packaged the Zumanity Cirque Du Soleil show and a room here. Overall this hotel/casino could use a refreshing. I do not consider myself overly picky, but there definitely seemed to be a stale and grungy feeling to this hotel overall. The room was not much to speak of. It definitely did not give me that wow factor that made me feel as if I was in Vegas. Yes I know that it is Las Vegas, and you are supposed to be out and about. But you still like to come back to a room that adds to that experience(no matter how little you may be in there). My room's claim to fame was being in front of the roller coaster. I could have done without that. The food cart in the hallway and small section of the wallpaper falling down did not help either. If it was not for the show/hotel package, I would not have thought I got a decent value. The things that knocked down a star from what would have been an \"average\" rating is the service. This ranged from conflicting information from the front desk and the box office on how I was being billed, to just overall slow service(food, front desk, etc...). Unless I got a heck of a deal, I would probably not stay here again considering the many other choices in the area. I understand that this establishment has been around for a while and may not be as glamourous as some of the other newer properties in Vegas. However, there is no reason that you can't have outstanding customer service to balance that out(if not exceed it).

The elevators are not clearly marked or distinguished from the other towers (there are several sets of elevators). Seriously awful planning on the hotels part.

The line to check-in was ridiculously long - it took us approximately 20 minutes of standing in line to get to a clerk. After spending several hours on a plane, it's very frustrating to wait so long in a line with so few clerks working. There's just no excuse for this! We were given a wonderful room on the 34th floor of the Chrysler Building which was a completely different experience than what my siblings encountered in the Century Building, where guests were making a ruckus at 4:00 AM and Security had to be called. Our room was very nice and the bed very comfortable, although there was a light out in the bathroom and the TV remote needed new batteries. The bathroom toiletries were of lower quality than one would expect given the hotel's overall rating and the shower pressure just awful - which in NYNY's defense is common in many hotels in Las Vegas and can't really be held against NYNY. Food and drink prices throughout the resort are extremely pricey, although the food quality was very good. Even with a \"Buy One Get One 50% Off\" coupon, 2 hot dogs, drinks, and french fries were over $16.00 at Nathans. We ate at America twice and although the prices were steep there as well, the food quality was really excellent - likewise with Il Fornaio, although my father ordered a martini at Il Fornaio and was handed a highball glass full of vodka and ice - what the heck? It took ten minutes for them to bring him what he ordered after the mistake was pointed out. Minor, but at those prices, excellent service is a MUST. All our meals at NYNY were delicious. We were not allowed to charge room service meals to our room however. Good thing we had cash on us that first morning when they arrived! We asked why, but the room service server was not able to explain, as her English was quite limited. She simply shrugged and gave us a receipt that she had written \"Cash Only\" on. We ended up paying cash for the three days that we ordered room service for breakfast. My sister however was allowed to charge her meals - an odd inconsistency that we found a little annoying. We tried to swing by the front desk to ask about this, but never saw any fewer than 5 or 6 people in line, and did not feel it was important enough to wait in line to determine why. The casino is quite nice, although a bit dark and the ventilation rather poor. We visited many casinos over the course of our visit and several members of our party agreed that NYNY was a lot more smoky than other casinos. The servers there were all very friendly and talkative. One of the video poker machines died while I was using it and the attendants were very quick to repair it. The main reason we would not return is in part due to the fact that the pool was closed for a remodel and we were not informed of this either when making our reservation or when we checked in. When we looked out the window and saw a land mover where the pool was, our hearts sank. We were told we could use the pool over at MGM Grand. For us, this was not a adequate substitute for an important amenity that we were not told beforehand would be unavailable during our stay. It would take 20 minutes of walking with our swim gear to reach their pool, and quick trips back to the room not possible. Had we known this, we would have made a reservation elsewhere, as a resort's pool is one of the main draws for us while vacationing. Additionally, the wifi was extremely poor, and did not work much of the time we were guests. To be charged $18.00 a day for poor quality wifi, a newspaper we had to go out of our way to locate, and a gym that we could not use due to a disability was extremely frustrating. People should be allowed to decide whether or not an amenity is worth paying extra for, and people with disabilities should not be forced to pay for amenities they can't even use. The entire \"mandatory resort fee\" issue is price gouging, plain and simple ... we will definitely vote with our dollars and choose a resort-fee-free facility the next time we travel to Las Vegas. NYNY is a really nice, big, full-feature resort. The rooms are comfortable, the food good, and the casino fun. But it is overpriced for the value you receive, the amenities provided are not worth the additional fee charged, and overall we just did not feel the love at this hotel.

I have returned from a family vacation in New York New York in December 11, just before Christmas for a week. I think 4 days is more than enough in Vegas. The previous reviews provide decent feedback of the hotel. It does cater for children more than some of the larger hotels, it has several fast food places within, including a fish and chip, Pizza (delicious) and Pasta restaurants, which was convenient, especially for children aged between 5 and 9 including a Ben and Jerry\u2019s which we frequented often. I was at the Starbucks for my daily coffee. The Rok nightclub at the hotel looked good but with the kids, I was out like a light by 11 PM. The location is good at the top of the strip, close to MGM and Luxor. To get to the main part of the strip it is a good 10/15 minute walk, with a pharmacy and Walmart type shop, where we got most of our general food. There is a food court with all the fast food type restaurants approx. 5 to 7 minute walk over the bridge past MGM. The better, newer food court, at the other end of the strip, was opposite The Venetian on the top floor above the shopping mall. The main Walmarts are several miles off the main strip. We travelled most places by Taxi, averaging $15 to $20 per one way trip. We went to the Town Centre, a typical \u201cAmerican town\u201d which was quite quaint with boutiques and an up market grocery store (quite expensive), We went to see Tin Tin (3D) movie at the cinema there, with great Cinema food available. I must admit, I am a fussy customer and would say the hotel is an upper 3 star hotel, possibly 4, which is reflected in the lower price in comparison to the Aria and Bellagio types of hotels of the world. After a long flight from London, you don\u2019t need a long queue, but on Friday night there is a long wait when checking in and there are no free upgrades, eventhough the hotel were advised it was our wedding anniversary, having said that the rooms were ok, spacious, recently renovated, 2 comfortable queen sized beds with a large flat screen TV, but still a little worn in places, in need of extra lighting and dated. No coffee/tea making facilities, no fridge or bar in the room. We had adjoining rooms, so with the 5 of us, the 2 bathrooms came in useful. The bathrooms are dated too, in need of modernisation but the shower pressure was fine. Maid service was good but general service was mediocre. The wifi was intermittent but free. There is a charge to use the roller coaster at $18 per person (a bit expensive for one ride). The hotel has an Arcade on the first floor, with fun fair type games and activities. Children are not allowed to stand in the Casino area at any of the hotels, when they tried, as the adults played the slot machines, security were onto us in 2 minutes, asking for us to take the children off the casino area, apparently, if authorities see children in the casino area, the hotel could get fined $250K. Vegas itself, is becoming less kid friendly, but if you have them, it\u2019s worth going to Circus Circus (great roller coasters at the adventure drome), Bellagio Fountain show, Mirage for the Dolphin show, the Shark reef at Mandalay Bay. The Hilton off the main strip does not have the Star Trek ride (which I went to in the late 90\u2019s, that was brill).

But I am there to see the sights, shows, gamble, etc. Not sit in room and look out the window. The room was of decent size, 2 full beds, a desk, two chairs for lounging, armoire, and dresser, with a large tv, which had plenty of channels to choose from. There was no coffee maker in the room, but what I have been told, you won't find them in any rooms in Vegas, but there is a Starbucks on site. Our only complaint about the room was the water pressure in the shower was very weak. Also had to ask for another bath towel, as only 3 in the room, and we each use 2(hair&body), towel was delivered within 10 min, and never had to ask for another, as 4 were left on each remaining day. We stayed in the New Yorker Towers. Floor 11. Non smoking room which was an actual non smoking room. Beds were super comfy, with also a comfy padded headboard which made it nice to sit up and watch TV. Vending machines on floors run $2.00 for drinks(pepsi products), and $1-$2 for snacks (chips, candy bars, snack cakes, candy, etc.) 2 Ice machine/Vending locations on each floor. The vending machines are cheaper than buying sodas in the shops($3). Every restaurant we visited had great food, was not disappointed. We ate at The burger place, America's, Scirros(Pizza), the fish & chips place, Nathan's hot dogs, and chin chins. Note: we are huge Coca Cola fans, and it was inpossible to find Coca Cola anywhere, and were told you can not find coca-cola at any of the casinos right by NYNY. When you eat at any of the Fast Food Type places in NYNY, note they only have one size softdrinks which is equal to a McDonald's size medium for $2.95. It is the same everywhere. There is no Buffett, but if you are looking for something quick and close, the Excalibur had one that was quite good, great variety, and yummy deserts if you can get past the very outdated decor, which makes it seem dirty, but upon a second look, is quite clean. We went for lunch($16), but they offer an all day pass, which we didn't take, but thought was a great idea if you were going to stay there the whole day, you could come and go as you wish. There is a little shopping place next to MGM(which is across the street from NYNY). It is a convenient store with a Subway inside which had great Coca Cola fountain sodas. The store had 4/$4 sodas(20oz), Beers, and waters, and cheaper snacks. If you are driving in, do what I saw alot of people do, bring 12 packs of soda, and cases of water, and a cooler for ice. Will save you tons. The casino floor was very neat and clean, and the smoke wasn't bad at all. But The Casino was much to be desired!!! Very bad payouts, and alot of the Slot mchines were old, very few progressive games. The one table game we liked was open the first day we arrived and then never again, and we stayed 5 days. We gambled at a variety of places, and found the Excalibur to have the best payouts on slots. Ended up playing there strictly on the last 3 days. Did not frequent any of the nightclubs at NYNY, as that is not or thing, but loved the outdoor seating throughout the casino by all the restaurants. You could sit and people watch, or sit and listen to the entertainment from inside the sports bar. ( They have a singer/saxman at happyhour who is quite entertaining, and dueling pianos in the evening, which is so fun!!! All the staff was very friendly throughout NYNY. No complaints there, they also recommend using the business center(free and open 24 hours) to check in your flight and print your boarding pass, as we did and when we arrived at the airport, the line to check in with United(6am flight) was over 100 people deep, saw several people miss other flights due to lines. Saw Cirque du Soleil Love, and Elvis. Love was amazing, very entertaining, and if you are a Beatles fan you will Love it even more. Viva Elvis was good, the acrobats and stunts they did were great, but their basic dancing needed improvement. The NYNY is a quick walk to alot of things, makes it a great location!!! Make sure you realize if it is a windy day, you may not be able to do things like the Stratosphere, and The Eiffel Tower ( Note: Paris had an amazing french pastry shop which was to die for, a must do!!! Highly recommend the Napolean, and the Pistachio Mousse with Strawberries!!!) Loved just checking out all the different hotels, and their themes. But all in all loved the vibe at our hotel, which I would say is 60 and under, lotta younger people, and families(they also have a fun and big arcade on the 2nd floor which is great for the kids( you win tickets to redeem for prizes). They also have an old school diner up there whch was good, along with the rollercoaster entrance. Make sure you check weather daily(channel 6) as one day it said 78 sunny before bed, and ended up being 58 partly cloudy with 60 MPH winds by morning. Definetly stay here next time!!!

It took us 15-20 minutes and we were at the front of the line. - $18 mandatory resort fee gives you the internet, gym, and pool. The pool is a pile of rubble right now. I think it's a ripoff to have to pay the resort fee. There is no place to sit outside and still be on the property. - Basic room doesn't have a closet. No, really. No closet. So your luggage is going to have to be out in the room. - Basic room doesn't have a fridge nor does it have a coffee maker - TV channel selection is bad. On demand movies are $13. - Spa prices are pretty bad. I was quoted $60 for a 25 minute express pedicure. - If you're going to use the convenient bus system that takes you to the airport and all around the strip and to downtown, you have to walk to a pickup. The Tropicana is a stop on all bus routes and is much more convenient. - Night staff was really loud, hollering to each other in the hallways in the early morning (1 a.m. and 5 a.m.) - In room toiletries were cheap, cheap, cheap. Not a big deal EXCEPT that they insist on calling themselves a resort and charging a resort fee. If I'm gonna pay the fee, I'm going to expect the level of service that goes with it. - The shower in our bathroom had no head, just a tall spout that poured water.

Room service was fast and food was decent, table was removed promptly. Parking in the garage is super convenient and a short walk to the Empire elevators. It can\u2018t get any easier for a large hotel on the strip. Everything about the room was great except the bathroom. It was huge but form a design-standpoint it had inexplicable flaws. The sink was a tiny little thing, and it was jammed right against the wall so you\u2019re literally rubbing elbows with the wall when you use the sink, with all this huge space to one side (why not center it a little more?). The plug for your blow dryer is right above the sink so your cord is dangling in the sink (dangerous!). The shower was also cramped. None of this made sense because the bathroom was HUGE and they could have easily made the sink and shower much bigger. I think it MAY have been a handicap-access design (?). The casino is great fun, not smoky, the arcade is way cool and huge. I was able to go old-school and play my wife in Ms. Pacman, taking it back to my childhood of the 70\u2019s-80\u2019s arcade days.

I wasn't offered the strip view option. So I'm thinking, \"well this is gonna be great\". We get to the room, and I find out that the window is really a porthole, that, no kidding has a view of an outside wall no less than 2 feet from the outside of the building. So, I go back downstairs. Talk to the the desk manager and get my original room back. As it turns out, our \"cheaper\" room had a much larger bathroom than the more expensive room with the obstructed view. Of course, when it came time to check out, they had forgotten to remove the upgrade fees. No big deal, except that with all the initial check in problems, it made my hour long check in ordeal seem like time that was not very well spent.

It's probably time to lose the coyote ugly theme though. The piano bar is still pretty nice, great players with nice talent. The gambling is \"ok\". The craps tables turn to $15 tables a little to early. Seems like there was a lot more smoke this time in the casino area than in our previous trips to this casino.

My husband and I had a 10 night stay in Las Vegas. We stayed in 3 different hotels during our stay. First 2 nights we stayed at the MGM Grand (have stayed here over 5 times). Next 3 nights were at the New York New York Hotel (have stayed here over 5 times). Our last 5 nights were at the Encore (have stayed here 3 times). The encore has far nicer rooms than the MGM and New York New York. The Encore is at the complete opposite end of the strip from the first two hotels. We enjoy changing hotels and getting a different vibe from the different hotels. MGM has fairly large rooms but the views are always terrible. The casino is HUGE. The foodcourt is lively and very busy. There is a nice stroll to shopping facilities as well as many restaurants. When we checked out all we had to do was walk across the bridge to get to New York New York. New York has a younger crowd vibe (we are in our early 50's). The rooms are a little smaller than MGM however compared with other hotels in the U.S.A they would be classified as high end. We have always had good views from our stays at New York. Given a choice I would stay at the New York hotel over the MGM hotel. Casino is smaller and during our Friday Saturday night stay very lively. There is a dual ling piano bar that is very popular and fun. There is also a Irish Pub that is a great place to get a Guinness. Food is reasonably priced at the food court and very good. The deli sandwiches, fish and chips and deserts were particular favorites. We planned our trip that we would not walk any farther than halfway down the strip (we used the Flamingo as our stopping point. When we checked out of New York New York we decided to walk to the Encore (we have made this walk many times on previous holidays so we did know how long it was). Our intention originally was to take a cab but we were energized that day and had no problem pulling our 1 suitcase and carrying our 1 back pack. If you do decide to do this there are many places to stop and sit for a minute if your feet get tired. The vibe at the Encore is immediately so different from the first two hotels. Much more staff attends to you and they really do make checking in and checking out a delight. Much more efficient than the first two hotels. The grandeur of the encore immediately takes you aback. Beautiful, beautiful red decor. Rooms have floor to ceiling windows so views are great. We were on the 28th floor and were offered a upgrade to a higher floor for 20.00 more. We declined the offer and we were very satisfied with the view that came with our room. We ate at the Wynn buffet twice during our stay and upgraded the meal to 10.00 each for all you can drink champagne (there are some other drinks available at that price but we chose the champagne). Someone in another review stated that some of the food was not fresh. I would have to disagree with that statement. Everything was great and all was fresh. We intended to try some of the other restaurants at the Encore but it did not work out for us with the shows we were going to see.

Before you go further, please note that I do not drink, do not gamble and do not \"party\" (what a bore, right?). This Hotel was wonderful. The standard rooms are good sized, really clean and the non-smoking room was really non-smoking not masked by spray. Access to the rooms was not through a smoking noisy Casino.

The decor was top notch and very appealing. And quiet! I felt like I was in a luxury Hotel at a very reasonable rate. Parking was free and plentiful with easy access to the Hotel registration. Anyone who has been to Vegas knows that parking can be quite a hike to the reception desk. The staff throughout the week were exactly what you would expect at a top tier hotel, where everyone greets you in the hallway, as well as at the front desk and in the lobby. The service was superb, even when we needed to make some changes on the spot with our reservation due to a mix up made by our corporate booking, not the Hotel's fault. They managed it with no issue whatsoever. I only had an opportunity to eat at one restaurant, but it was the best meal of the week at Il Fornaio. The price was modest by Vegas standard and moderate anywhere else. My guests had pastas but I went for the New York steak. Cooked perfectly and seasoned in the Tuscan style. I think the three of us polished of three baskets of the fresh bread and Olive oil. Now, I won't dread my stays in Vegas, so long as I can stay at the New York, New York Hotel.

Its no Bellagio or Venetian but its better than the CIrcus Circus The Imperial. I would say its right inline with tthe MGM and is a great place for the middle of the roaders.

Parking is very convenient, especially from our elevators (Century). It was almost as easy to go to the parking garage as the taxi stand. Overall the property was well maintained, no rough edges, but I would have liked to see a cheaper price especially since nothing was going on in Vegas of any significance and the rooms are just OK. Check-in was slow (7:00 p.m.), only two people working the desk and it only takes one person with a lot of questions to bring the whole process to a halt. I stood for about 20 minutes waiting for 3 others ahead of me to check-in. No pool, but we hadn't intended to use it. It was being taken out with dozers and jack hammers. What will replace it is a good question but it won't be any time soon I would guess. Like every other casino, prices were ridiculous. A can of beer, $6.00, a soda from the convenience store, $3.00, a bag with 6 mini doughnuts for breakfast, $3.59. Go across the street and for $4.00 you can get 4 Miller tall boys, Miller lite 6 pack around 8 bucks. Of course if your in the casino find a bar girl and get your drinks free if your playing, of course a tip of a buck or two is appropriate. Saw David Copperfield, how does he do it? KA, the wife and my daughter said it was good, Zumanity, funny, a bit raunchy but nothing to get uptight about, and Jubilee (topless) was very well done. Register for the M-life card before you buy tickets, we saved over 30% on all tickets and not just back row, we were front row for Jubilee. Our room faced away from the strip with a view of the parking ramp and Monte Carlo resort. Not a problem! Bed quality was great, very comfortable. My son was Staying at Luxor and didn't get a single good night's sleep. Bed quality there was horrible he said. Our safe did not work when we arrived and it took getting security twice before they got the locksmith who had it fixed in under a minute. We were close to the elevators and didn't notice any noise. I can only take Vegas for a few days at a time so if, or when I return I will probably look elsewhere since there are so many places to see.

Gonzalez y Gonzalez is a gem of a restaurant. Never any wait, EXCELLENT chips and salsa, and the best chicken fajitas my wife and I have ever had. Prices were reasonable for Las Vegas and MUCH better than the trendier looking \"Diablos Cantina\" that was on the strip near the Monte Carlo. All in all, this casino is fun and is located in a great area. I would have liked more quick breakfast choices (Starbucks was the only thing open every morning outside of sit down meals), and a coffee maker in the room, but all in all - a great hotel and a great time! - One word on the roller coaster. Every review on here seems to mention it, and it is a big part of the outside casino. We were right smack in the middle of coaster, on the 5th floor, but had no issues with it.

There was a short line for check-in but we stood in line for close to 10 minutes. We were charged a $18 resort fee for internet, newspaper, and other crap we didn't need. I asked if we could opt out of the resort fee if we didn't use the wifi and were told we couldn't. Don't know if that was true or not. Also, our magnet key card malfunctioned twice. The cheapest room (Park Avenue Deluxe) is very, very basic. I was surprised that the room did not include much amenities. There was no fridge, no water (H2O in the vending machine was available on my floor for $2), no kettle with coffee or tea like in most hotels I've stayed in around the world. I guess this is common for Vegas but it made me regret choosing New York New York on my first night. I ended up liking the hotel more once I found the faux Greenwich Village (stop by at the Fulton Fish Frye for cheap fish n' chips) and compared its casinos with other hotels on the Strip which didn't seem as chic and inviting. In short, it is a good place to play and an average place to stay for Vegas standards.

Here are some additional details: Checking In: We arrived at the hotel at about 11:00 pm on a Wednesday night, so there was a very minimal wait. When checking in, the person showed us a picture of our room (same picture as on the website). The room that we had was the \"Park Avenue\" room which is the smallest. Considering there was three of us sharing the room, we almost decided to upgrade, but good thing we didn't because the room was very big. Since my other friend wanted his own room, I called to request an adjoining room. Unfortunately they could not accomindate us, however my friend had the room right across the one we had, so this was no problem. After checking us in, the person directed us towards the elevators (watch out there are at least two sets of elevators, make sure you choose the correct one). Room: As I mentioned above, we was almost going to request a bigger room, but the one we was assigned was very spacious. Even for three grown men, the room was very accomidating. There was a desk and the closet with the television in the middle of the closet. There was no refrigerator (I think there is a extra charge for this) and the internet was included with the resort fee. The bathroom had adequate space. We had the farthest room from the elevator so noise was not a problem, however getting to the room from the elevator was like walking in a little maze. The view we had was of the M&M store across the street, since we was on the 7th floor, we did not have much of a view. Location: The NYNY hotel was in a great location. Across the street was the MGM and from the MGM you can catch the monorail to the other hotels. Also across the street was the Excalibur hotel. Roller Coaster: The room we had did not have the roller coaster right outside the room so it did not bother us. Negatives: -The negatives we had, was right outside the window was a light shining from the roof below up on the side of the hotel. This meant if we did not close the shade, the light would be shining into the room. This was not a problem for us, but others might have a problem. -The resort fee ($18 per night) was a minor negative. Even though we knew about it and we did use the internet access, I wish the newspaper would be dropped off or you can not receive it and get a little credit. Same thing for the fitness center. Either you use it or if you don't, get a little credit. -This is not a negative, but make sure if you don't want to walk far from the elevator, please make sure to tell the front desk person. We had the last room on the one side and the walk was couple minutes to get to the elevator. Overall: The NYNY hotel was excellent. The room was very spacious and it had the amenities we needed.

Gym, was clean and organized. Wasn't as well equiped as one would have liked but it clean enough and organized enough to be satisfactory. Now for the not so impressive parts: POOL WAS CLOSED!!!!!!!

The bathroom in the room was on the aged side but thats no excuse for the shower heads looking like Jack Frost was there the night before. There was calcium and lime scale all over it.

I wouldn't stay here when it gets hot because there was just one little A/C vent way over on one side of the room way up high on the wall. We don't gamble, so we see things from a different perpective. The complex has several opportunities for \"entertainment\" if you're into drinking. We went to Rok(only open Thurs.-Sat.), a dance club meant more for the under 30 crowd, but early on, this late 50's couple was wowing the crowd with real dancing. A young gal grabbed my husband and I had to finally force myself away from a guy 20 years my junior after \"dirty dancing\" for 20 minutes non-stop! So everyone was accepting of our presense. and there were other older people there. The Irish Pub had the best food. The real homemade sausage made me break my mostly No Meat rule. Very good. We found a buffet in a hotel adjoining ours (by a connecting walkway) most to our liking. The Piano Bar looked boring(unless you drink). The Oxygen Bar was OK and included a mini back message. Coyote Ugly has no dance floor for patrons, just floor space for oggling the 2 female dancers on the bar at any given time. The dancers were repetitive. which got boring in one song. because nobody else was dancing. Too bad. because they do play good music of all genres, not just Country Western. If they had a big dance floor for everyone else, it would have been fun. NYNY is big and it takes up a lot of time going from your room (in one of the \"towers\") to one place to another, lots of walking. Bring everything you want in your room for your stay all at once because it is A LONG WAY back to the parking garage. We found the best afternoon entertainment in Paris before we went up to the top of the \"Eiffel Tower\". NYNY is Nothing great for shopping.

We stayed at the hotel New York, New York for four nights. It would have been 5 but we missed check in at JFK by 2 mins, so make sure you are on time ! Hotel room good size for us. Two queen beds - wow. Casino a lot of fun, very user friendly compared to some of the other ones on the strip. Piano bar duel was great the first night but got repetitive. Fish & chip shop great. Watch the calories though as you can really pile the weight on. You must go to the Grand Canyon by helicopter. Try and sit at the front on the way there. We flew with Maverick and it was such a laugh. Pilot is your tour guide. We went for a sunrise flight so landed and had a champagne ( sparkling wine!) breakfast. Friends got married at the Elvis Chapel while we were there - must admit I was impressed. Just make sure you get the tall Elvis and not the little chubby one. Hired a limo to take us to the chapel, then for another two hours run around. Quite expensive and would only have done it because it was a wedding. We bought a two day bus tour ticket. Automated tape which took away the spark of having a real live tour guide. We used the bus as our transport up and down the strip. Went to the Stratosphere and bought an all day band for $25. The staff were not the most friendly and didn't really expect us Brits to stay for the day and get our monies worth. Must admit not too impressed at all. Better places to see. If you want a bit of bling and sparkle then try Las Vegas, 5 days is enough. You must go down town and sample life there. Not as up market and showy but a lot cheaper and a real laugh. Freemont street is fun fun fun and live music on street corners. The New York New York is a safe and sound hotel. Try to avoid weekends as the price can easily treble. Breakfast is good there but not cheap. Go across the link bridge to MGM and order one breakfast to share - more than enough ! One piece of advice the hotels are very much the same inside so don't waste your time going round as it will take up the majority of your holiday. If you want the real architecture go to the real places - this is vegas ! They are set out as a shopping centre - the Venetian was a massive let down. Take photos of the outside, then do the casinos and the shows. In Vegas they know how to put on a show ! Everyone has to do Vegas at some time and you will have fun !

We didn\u2019t get in until 10pm so we were a little worried, but we were in good hands. She gets a gold star for helping us out - The parking garage is really easy to park in (easier then the Valet in my opinion). Park on the 3rd floor near the cross over - The pretzel shop is the best place in the hotel for a snack. We stopped at Wal Mart on Tropicana for little snacks, soda and water. If you don\u2019t have a car like we did, you should walk to Walgreen\u2019s which is about a block away - There is a resort fee. We didn't mind the fee as most hotels in downtown areas or vacation destinations charge one. We used the internet each day and got a couple newspapers so it was fine with me. We suggest using the wired connection in the room as the wireless was hit and miss and much slower. - Food could be expensive so we ate elsewhere being as cheap as we are. Ate mainly with restaurant.com gift certificates or off strip. This is the best hotel for eating at In and Out Burger as it is right down the block off of Tropicana. Overall a great stay and I would stay here again. If you are wanting pure unadulterated luxury then pay triple the price and stay at a hotel that specializes in that. If you want a smoke free hotel, then book one. If you don\u2019t want a resort fee, the book a hotel that doesn\u2019t charge one. If you want a hotel in center strip, then book one.

The room was fabulous! 1200 square feet of luxury. We loved the spaciousness and cleanliness. The bed was very comfy and the ammenities where suffice. Downsides? Room did have some wear and tear. Towel holder coming out and wall paper pealing on the corners. TV's where still CRT. Did have Bose stereo though. It was very clean and neat. Did not use the jacuzzi tub, but would have loved too. Just ran out of time. Saw Zumanity there and had a great time. Very funny and entertaining. Heed all warnings! Not for kids or the prude. Tried a couple of the restaraunts. The burger bar was good but overpriced. The staff was great. Al Fornios was great and so was staff. Food was good quality, a little dissapointed in the calamari. Sevice was excellent. Nathans hot dogs upstairs was.....well a hot dog. No complaints. Had a late night steak dinner at Americas and the food and service where great despite it being 2 am. The breakfast buffet (which is the only buffet offered) was good, a little overpriced. The only thing I was really dissapointed in at NYNY was the casino staff. They seemed very cold and bored. Not very helpfull or willing to assist. Believe it or not the best \"casino\" time we had was at Imperial Palace. The dealers where very fun and helpfull. We went there every day. Dont reccomend staying there though.I will stay at NYNY again, just not gamble there.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201clow quality hotel\u201d", "Author": "larry j", "ReviewID": "UR124223722", "Content": "the room decor has low taste. heating system is poor. whether too hot or too cold. restaurant is small. sports betting room is small and not inviting. lobby small stores were gear to children. dancing girls behind the black jack tables were very attractive and professional.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "elkford", "Title": "\u201cNY\u201d", "Author": "jsrelkford", "ReviewID": "UR124211363", "Content": "Very clean.

The one drawback was an inexpensive place for breakfast. We would have to leave the hotel to find one. Again no big deal. We have no rwal complaints about anything or anyone at the hotel.

Used research from tripadvisor to make the decision to stay there, and was not disappointed, but....a few things that may help someone else. 1. This is not a four star hotel. More a three, three in a half. What's the difference? Linens, pillows, towels, soaps (cheap), hair products (cheap), bathroom size, faucet, shower head which was corroded, thermostat, room furniture outdated, dings and dents through out, etc. -stayed in room 1228, which is the most basic room. Four star should start at the most basic room to the nicest. 2. Great location! Walk over a bridge to MGM. Within five minute walk of at least 10 other resorts. 3. If given a complimentary buffet...Go to Aria's!!! Wow! Too much to choose from. Well prepared, delicious. Prime rib alone was worth it. $6.00 unlimited mimosa's! What!!! 4. Casino....needs more black jack tables. Every one was full most of the time. Center Bar in the middle of the casino could've been cleaner ie..ashes and sticky. Yuck. Terrible Kettle One and tonic. Much better at MGM's Centrifuge bar. Must've been the tonic... -Gamble at Centrifuge rather than, Center Bar. For .25 cents a hand vs $1; they're free, you get better drinks, better service, cleaner, prettier people, and the drinks are free! 5. Get a Mlife Card if you don't have one, and charge everything to your room. We did and stayed for free! First time ever did that, and it really paid off... 6. Chin Chin restaurant was great! Had a spicy black bean seafood noodle dish. Off the chain! -wanted to charge to our room, but couldn't because check-in was at 3:00. Told to call a 1-800 number to have added, but M-F and business hours. We checked in on a Sat... 7. Pizza place down stairs was aweful! Don't go. It's all about the sauce! and theirs tasted cheap. NY style pizza wasn't cooked properly. Gooie crust. Told the manager. She didn't care. Go to the one upstairs, I think NY Pizzaria. Great! 8. If a beer fan, go upstairs to 24 I think it was called and get a flight of draft beers. 6oz glass of 6 beers of your choosing for $19. Get them one at time or they will get luke warm. 9. Pretezels upstairs were the best I've ever had. 10. Rok is the smallest most expensive club in the world. Seriously I thought I was on an episode of House Wives of Orange County. Random, I know but bare with me. They hand out cards with discounted admission written on them. Wait in line.....to pay $20, regularly $30 for maybe a 1300 sq ft club, which most is roped off for VIP (what a joke), which leaves a small dance floor of couples and 40 somethings. Spend your money at another club no matter your age or marrital status. 11. Roller coaster looked cool, but ran out of time. Overall this is a beautiful, cool, fun, money making machine.

The hotel is at the far end of the strip so it is a bit of a hike, but it would be a bit of a hike to walk all of the strip regardless of where you started. The pool was closed in November, so you had to walk across the street to a sister resort to swim, not really a big deal. You're permitted to smoke in Las Vegas casinos.

We traditionally stay at the Excalibur and are thoroughly satisfied with them, but the offer my husband received from NYNY was just too good to turn down, so to mark my 50th birthday we gave them a try. I LOVE NYNY! Our plane arrived in Las Vegas at 9:30 am and there was a limosine waiting for us at the baggage claim. We reached the hotel at about 10:30 and managed to check into our room immediately in the VIP lounge. We were given the Roosevelt suite on the 43rd floor of the Empire Tower. Gorgeous! This suite actually has its own doorbell! Ensuite bathroom has a large jacuzzi tub and separate shower, and two vanity sinks. In the bedroom, a very comfortable king size bed, big poofy pillows, comfy large chair, flat screen tv, blueray player and drapes that were operated by a switch on the wall as well as large armoire closet space, robes, slippers and a safe. In the livingroom, we had a bigger flat screen tv, blueray player, sofa, wing chairs, dining table with 4 chairs, desk area, wet bar that was stocked with soft drinks and water daily, and another half bathroom. There were 5 telephones in this suite, including one in the bathroom! The only amenity missing was a microwave which would have been nice to have since the food portions are so large here that you often come away with doggie bags. The view from the livingroom overlooked the MGM Grand, Excalibur and out to the airport. The view from the bedroom looked up the strip towards Paris. I could have lived in this suite for the rest of my life! After checking in and getting settled we met with friends for my birthday lunch at the MGM Rainforest Cafe. After lunch we returned to our suite to find a room service tray just inside our door with a bottle of champagne and a cheese/fruit/nut platter from our hostess, What a nice touch that was. Our first meal here was at America. We liked the food so much, that we had many more meals here. I believe it is open 24 hours also, which most of the eating establishments are not, many closing at around 10 pm. We also ate at Fulton's Original Fish Frye, Nathan's Hot Dogs and Ben & Jerry's. No complaints at all, and there are so many other choices, surely something for every taste. The casino was good to us too. Nice variety of slots and not so big that you spend all your time walking around aimlessly searching for your spouse. The only thing I might mention is that in the early morning hours, about 3 a.m., it took 20 minutes for a slot attendant to notice the service light on my broken machine. Not a lot of floor staff on at that time I guess. The location of this hotel is nice. We took the free tram from Monte Carlo next door up to the Bellagio to save a lot of walking and by doing this we managed to cover quite a few casinos on the way back to NYNY. We were given a late check out on our final day and kept the room until 5 pm. Upon checkout we had a zero balance thanks to the fantastic comps. Not even the dreaded resort fee that everyone here complains about. The limosine appeared on time to take us back to the airport and so ends our time in paradise. The NYNY hotel will definitely see us again, hopefully sooner rather than later.

We didnt really eat in many of the restaurants within the hotel as we wanted to explore the strip. We did eat breakfast and dinner in America though and I thought the food was average and the service very slow. We are not big gamblers so cannot comment that but the casino I thought had a great vibe. We would sit at the central bar and have a drink and just people watch. Our room was lovely, think we stayed in a Madison room. Big King size bed which was very comfy. Nice big flat screen and all the wardrobe space you could want. The view from the window was of a wall but you could see the roller coaster as it was about to drop which was good but we wasnt really bothered about the view as we didnt really spend alot of time in the room! Thought the location of the hotel was good, was close to everything. Yes its at the bottom of the strip but easy access via monorail to all the other hotels or the bus, we sometimes even just walked as the weather was very pleasent for December. The monorail I think was $12 for a 24 hour pass which I thought was very reasonable and I think $7 for a 2 hour pass. We didnt do many tours but we did do the coach trip to the Hoover Dam which was amazing to see. It was $63 each for a 5 hour day. Well worth the money if thats something that interests you. We also caught the bus to freemont street which is well worth the trip. You can get a Corona for $2 in any casino, plus the light show when it gets dark is great.

In the past we used to stay at the MGM Grand due to the free comps and size of the casino. In 2008 we decided to head over to the NYNY due to a large event at MGM. We've been loyal ever since. The Rooms: We've received comp'd rooms since 2009 and typically try to obtain a Spa Suite but have stayed in everything from Park Avenue room to the Marquis Suite. The Spa Suite is my favorite and has a large spa tub in the room. The Tub fills up quickly but drains slowly. In the past the room always had a ton of soaps and personal items but on our last trip (December 2011), there was only a bar of soap on the tub. They've definitely scaled down on the little things. The rooms are always clean. The beds are okay but not as comfortable as the beds at the MGM. The Casino: We always play at the Let it Ride table. The dealers are typically fantastic and have a great upbeat attitude. The cocktail waitresses are very sweet and very efficient but be careful during shift change--you may have to wait a bit. The Restaurants: We really don't come to Vegas to eat so have only tried two of their restaurants at NYNY. We've had breakfast at the Chin Chin and it was very gross. The food had a strange taste to it and the buffet was lacking. The America restaurant is always delish! The burgers are great and you can't go wrong with anything on the breakfast menu. Their Mac N Cheese is to die for! Also, I've ordered room service many times and it's always hot, fresh, and delish. As long as I continue to receive comps from this casino, I'll continue to stay and play here.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cExceeded expectations\u201d", "Author": "MLinMA", "ReviewID": "UR123039296", "Content": "I usually try to get a good deal on a 4-1/2 or 5-star hotel in Vegas, but since I was visiting during the Consumer Electronics Show I had to \"settle\" for New York, New York.

I must recommend Coyote Ugly. I consider that to be one of the best bars in town. The girls dancing on the bar work very hard to makes sure everyone feels welcome. -The quality of the rooms is great. They are very well furnished, and all the rooms come in room safes. A big plus for anyone bringing valuables to Vegas. Also the free bars of soap and shampoo that come with the room have funny jokes on them which is a nice touch. Very nicely done bathroom, and nice beds. -The overall decor of the hotel they really nailed down the New York theme. -Great Location, very close to many other famous properties like MGM, Excalibur, Monte Carlo, Luxor, Mandalay Bay, and City Center. -A large arcade on the property for the kids. In fact its one of the largest arcades in Vegas. -A must is the roller coaster. If its your first time in Vegas its well worth the 14 bucks to ride it at least once.

For the most part they have all been worthy of the price I have paid and the stars they are rated. To be honest, I'm not one to write reviews for things that are anywhere near satisfactory, only exceptionally good or exceptionally terrible. So, take this review as you will... My wife and I checked in on 12/21/11 and where checking out the next morning at 4 am for a 6am flight out of Vegas. Upon waking up we came to realize that we had no running water. After calling the front desk we were told that a letter was left in our room warning us of this scheduled maintenance (11pm-6am, almost the entire time we were in the room) and they would be \"happy\" to bring bottled water to our room. As polite as they seemed at first, I almost said thanks, until realizing that they knowingly sold us a room that didn't have running water without warning us of this fact at check-in. I then asked for a refund and they said no. After a couple minutes of me explaining my situation and asking to use another room that had running water to shower in they said they would refund my $15 resort fee, but \"that is all we (they) could do\". The whole resort fee is also BS when the pool is closed in the winter anyway, which I also explained (Normally I'm not one to complain about that due to the reasonably low room prices in the winter, but while I was on a roll I figured why not). I have had better service, more reliable basic utilities, and had more honest hosts everywhere from hostiles in SE Asia to truck stops in Mexico for <5% of the cost. In a lesson of fairness, I should note; they did return the resort fee, as promised. And to those NYNY hotel staff whom I spoke with that morning and the manager who thought leaving a letter without requiring notification at check-in was a good idea... I didn't have to add this relatively small detail; I just did because it is the right thing to do. With that said, We will not be staying at NYNY again and will sincerely consider not staying at any other MGM owned properties (google M-life for the list) in Vegas again.

It is in a good location and is very clean. Beds are the comfiest ever. Bedrooms are a little dark and bathrooms are small but overall no complaints. Overlooked roller coaster but it did not keep us awake. Ate breakfast every day in Excalibur hotel next door as all you could eat and drink buffet is only 15 dollars and was good value for money. Had nice evening meals in Denny's and in Freemont Street and had fantastic meal in Outback Steakhouse opposite hotel. Bought 24 hour ticket for Deuce bus which was a bit of waste of money as buses were crowded and we could not get on. Took the Westcliff Airport bus to North Premium Outlet direct and only cost 2 dollars each way. Fantastic bargains there. Went to Cirque de Soleil Michael Jackson which was out of this world and also did David Copperfield which was good but drinks prices at MGM Hollywood Theatre are extreme-11 dollars for a water!! If you get the time, visit Big Elvis at Bill's Gambling Casino. He is on infrequently but is very good and it's free. We went to the Ri Ra pub in the walkway between Mandalay Bay and Luxor and was completely ripped off. Charged over 7 dollars for a pint which actually came in a half pint tumbler and also charged 2 taxes plus an entertainment tax cos someone was singing at the back of the pub. Do not go here- there are far nicer and cheaper places to go for a drink. The upstairs bar in the Venetain does Happy Hours every day from 3-9 and beers are only 3 dollars and wine 5 dollars and it has a lovely atmosphere. I will not waste space or time writing a review about the appalling flights with Virgin as I will be taking this matter up with them direct, just be aware it is the worst plane and journey I have ever been on and I have visited lots of cities worldwide over the last 2 years and used various airlines.

There was a nice Italian place and Gallagher's steakhouse which looked really nice.

Big 24ounce Miller Lite, Coors Lite, Bud products for $2.99 each. Can't beat it beers are $7.50 for 12 ounce Miller lites at the bars. I WOULD RECOMMEND STAYING ON THE HIGHEST FLOOR POSSIBLE.

I went to the hotels website to check availability and there are rooms available for over $250 a night but they are available.

I inquired how the hotel could be sold out when there are still rooms to book online.

I pointed out to the rep that I did read my voucher/email and nowhere did it mention anything about a restriction except for the 1 year time limit. I was informed it must be on there somewhere. I have read the email sveral times and nowhere is there any restriction. The rep said I should send the voucher/email back to guest relations and they would look into it further.

For fantastic views take a trip up the Eiffle Tower and watch the Belagio Fountains from up there - so romantic.

Extra pillows etc were provided in the drawers, and there was also a free safe.The bathroom was nothing special, but clean and a good size. Our room was cleaned every day and was of a high standard.

There are a few restaurants at the hotel, the only one we really liked was the Italian and the American restaurant which did good breakfast. But there is so much choice in hotels nearby that you are bound to find something you like within a 5min walk! NYNY is at the south end of the strip,and it is a little bit of a hike to the north end of the strip where Wynn etc are, but there is so much to see enroute! Although there are other hotels further south than NYNY, e.g. the Luxor, Mandalay and Excalibur which I would feel are a little too far out. We also discovered the monorail which runs the length of the strip, it leaves from MGM which is just across the road from NYNY and goes as far along as Wynn. The day ticket was $12. Also we did have to pay the resort fee, but if you do your research before you go you shouldnt be too shocked at this. Plus most of the hotels on the strip charge it. A few of the reviews mentioned the pool being closed - the pools are closed at all the hotels in December, so it doesnt matter where you stay! We really enjoyed our stay at NYNY.

The location is on the South end of the strip. My wife was less than thrilled after the 1.5 hike down to the Venetian Casino. If I had to do it over I'd stay at a more centrally located hotel along the strip, then you can walk North or South and check things out. This is really my fault for not knowing the area.

Although the hotel states that it has recently been upgraded, I think that is a bit misleading for the room that we stayed. Overall value, was probably on par as to what we got. Check in: Checked in on a Thursday night around 10:00 PM. Maybe I\u2019m used to the expedited check in of the MGM or other Vegas hotels that seems to have people appear from the back room to assist when the line gets over 4 deep. Not so much here. We waited probably around 20 \u2013 25 minutes, it seemed that everyone had issues before us. When we finally checked in, it took us about 5 minutes. Rates: Since this is an annual for fun trip, we look for the best rates months in advance. I reserved this hotel room 3 months in advance with the following rates (not including tax or resort fees): Thursday ($56), Friday ($76), Saturday ($85), and Sunday ($59). Resort Fee: $15.00. Includes internet access, fitness center, daily newspaper (but you need to show your key at the gift shop to get one), domestic long distance phone call rates if $0.10 per minute, unlimited local and 800 calls, boarding pass printing, notary services, faxes. Internet Service: WiFi worked fine. Room: Stayed in 2673 taking the Chrysler elevators. 450 square feet, Madison Avenue Room. I am not sure if the square feet is a new selling/marketing point, but in this case it shouldn\u2019t be. The room was an odd \u201cL\u201d shape, with a ton of wasted space (i.e. a small alcove with nothing in it \u2013 probably a kid\u2019s dream for hide and seek!). Definitely not for business travelers, the desk and chair are uncomfortable (good for quick checks of email) and lacks enough plugs around the desk space (finally found one on the side of the desk). On the plus side, it had two wall mirrors (a bit odd since they were almost side by side) and in the armoire there was a full length mirror. Did have a nice TV and iPod docking station. However, no mini fridge or microwave (and trust me, there was plenty of space for such amenities). Temperature control in the room was decent. Shower: Low volume, high pressure. Not my favorite, but workable. Also the shower had a shower door. I only took notice because I had to step just a bit higher to get into the shower/tub. The majority of the rooms that I have stayed in the past have had shower curtains. Toiletries: Basics: shampoo, conditioner, lotion, hand soap, body soap. The brand was: Revitalize \u2013 perhaps from their spa collection? I\u2019m not sure.

The hotel seemed to offer a wide variety of fare from its traditional restaurant with reasonably priced buffet to other delights that you would probably see in New York (themed restaurants) these offered snacks like fish and chips to slices of pizza. A crowd draw and pleaser were at the Piano bar - 6 Budweisers cost me $40 but I won this back later at the roulette wheels (AWESOME). If you are like me and dont understand gambling games then the polite staff will help you and drinks are provided free by some of the most glamorous waitresses on the strip as long as you are gambling either on the slots or on the tables. There was a nightclub in the hotel but this didnt seem to be open. :( There was also a cabaret \"COYOTE UGLY\" and although the other guys were impressed by the sexy dancers all I was thinking was it cost me $30 to get in to pay for more expensive rounds of bud!!. Still it was very commercial. We also had a little bit of a setback during our stay and the staff at reception were really helpful when we asked for help providing the numbers for Police, hospitals and bail-bondsmen. If we hadn't of had some of the drama we all planned to go on the roller-coaster which runs through the hotel.

Never really stayed here before because it was a bit over my budget (college student with school loans you know...) but I got a really great deal with Mlife Players club. I spent about $179 for two nights (Friday and Saturday) with a high Strip View (25th floor). Check in was a breeze - - I cannot remember the girls name at check-in but she was great, took my remaining balance and sent me off on my way (no more than 10min for the check-in process). Rooms... well these are the standard rooms I would say. I got the Park Avenue Strip View, I believe the Luxor Tower Rooms are a bit bigger than these but well let's just say the Luxor isn't really at a prime location(don't get me wrong I really like the Luxor especially because I always get a free upgrade from the Pyramid to the Tower Rooms (Thank you Mlife)). The bathrooms were small, Excalibur and Tropicana bathrooms are bigger, BUT the Excalibur does NOT have a tub though. The New York New York do have a tub so great for bubble baths. New York New York's casino area is not the biggest but it's great because of the bar at the center of the area (great music!) I didn't play much on the slots because they have never payed well (a bit tight). Played $10 Craps and Pai Gow, with all the time I spent gambling I got upgrade to the next Mlife tier (so if you stay at any of the MGM Resorts I highly recommend you get the Mlife card. It's free and you get soo many great things with it (Casino Rated rooms and Comps)). Coyote Ugly is always bumping and always a good young fun crowd there. Nothing bad to say about the NYNY Resort (aside from small bathrooms). I will definitely stay here again once I work myself on all the MGM Resorts on the south end of the Strip (next one Hotel/Casino I will stay at is the Monte Carlo). Oh and before I forget, this location is Kid FRIENDLY (like the Excalibur). There is an arcade area for the kids to stay while one goes and plays at the casino.

There are plenty of places to eat at the hotel - \"America\" was my fave - the mac n cheese was great! The hotel is huge, but I never had any problems getting around and I never got lost. I arrived just after 1pm and I was checked in right away (with no extra fee charged). I had asked for a quiet, non smoking room. I received that. My room was about as far from the lift as you could be on my floor, but it only took 2 minutes to walk there, and it was clearly marked. The rollercoaster was near my window - I had a partial view of the strip, but it wasn;t even running all the time, and it didn't really bother me when it was running. Sure, I could sometimes hear the screams from people on the rollercoaster, but I never heard them after 10:30pm and they never started before 10am. The aircon/heater was quite loud if you turned the fan on medium or high but I didn't have a problem with it as I'm used to \"white noise\" (bonus, it kinda drowns out the screams on the rollercoaster if you want it to). My room had 2 queen beds. They had three pillows each. The pillows were not the best. They seemed a little old, but they were comfortable enough, and the bed was also confortable. Housekeeping seems to ignore any \"do not disturb\" signs unless you actually call the housekeeping number and ask them to not come into your room, which was one negative. The hotel thankfully didn't smell like smoke - I had been worried about that after reading some reviews, but it was fine. I mean OK if you were playing the slots next to a smoker, then yeah you're gonna smell the smoke, but in general it was fine - as were most hotel/casino's on the strip (and this from someone who is very sensitive to the smell of cigarette smoke). As I mentioned before, I ate a few times at \"America\" - a diner type restaurant at the hotel. I really enjoyed it.

You can hear the screams and the noise of the roller coaster from the room, but when I went to bed the coaster was no longer running. The bed was comfortable, which is the most important thing to me.

It was our second stay at the establishment. That and the fact that we got 2 comp buffet tickets per day were the reasons we selected to stay at NYNY. The buffet tickets were a nice touch. Although NYNY does not have a buffet, we had a choice from seven MGM Entertainment Casinos that we could go to for lunch. As well, the tickets were supposedly worth up to a maximum of $20.00, but we went to the Thanksgiving champagne brunch at the Aria, worth $30.00, and were not charged extra for it. We also sampled the MGM, (2 times), Monte Carlo and Mandalay Bay buffets. Check in was smooth and quick. The registration desk personnel we friendly and helpful. Our check out was 11:00am on Friday but it was extended to 2:00pm on Friday so that we could take advantage of our free Friday lunch buffet. The information desk was also very helpful and provided us with good, friendly service. Housekeeping also was frendly and accommodating. We had booked the King Park Avenue room. We were on the 4th floor and we had a great viiew of the roller coaster. We could have upgraded to a Strip View room but we felt the extra $ wasn't worth it. We were also offered to upgrade to a newer and larger room for $15.00/night more which we also declined. Our King Park Avenue room was spacious enough and clean but I must say that this class of rooms are begining to show some wear. Our floor had a large stain next to the bed that had been cleaned but the process caused a bleaching of the rug. The King bed was comfortable. For the most part the hallways were quite and safety was not an issue for us. The NYNY is not a large property so it seems like there are always a lot of people and action. There are a number of on site restaurants which provide guests with a variety of menus and price ranges. There are actually two Starbucks on site. We recommend the Nine Fine Irishmen Pub for a change of paced and a pint or two of Guinness. They serve a very good homemade seafood chowder. The faux New York city streets makes for interesting browsing. We also like NYNY because it's centrally located on the south end of the strip and is close to many of the south strip casinos. By utilizing the South tram from Excaliber you can get to Mandalay Bay or utilizing the north tram from Monte Carlo you can travel as far as Aria, City Centre and Vdara. Further locations can be reached by the Duece bus of regular public transportation. The airport is a short $15.00 ride. My wife and I were very pleased with our stay at NYNY and would stay there again. We feel they try hard to please. However, I still have an issue with the large resorts charging the resort fee. For $15.00 at the NYNY we got a newspaper, which turned out to be the US News and World Report which one can get from the gift shop. However, I observed that anyone can walk in and get a copy free! At least a couple bottles of water a day would be nice!

My point was, and remains - the resort fee was not disclosed when she booked and pre-paid her trip, is NOT universal for all resorts in Vegas and offered us no value - so, in our eyes, they gouged us for an extra $50. Now, considering that there are a number of other properties in teh same price range that do not charge this fee - we'd have done just as well to spend an extra $50 on an upgraded room somewhere else and not feel gouged. We wont EVER stay at another MGM resort for THIS very reason. Actually, the resort fee made us angry enough, with the exception of the cirque shows we couldnt see anywhere else, we took our money elsewhere every chance we got. Second problem, despite my wife's booking information clearly showing a single king bed and, it being confirmed when we checked in, our room was two twins. Nu-uh. Back down to the lobby & back through the 30 minute line. They made a big deal about putting us into an \"upgraded\" room at no additional charge - except, when we actually got there, it looked pretty much exactly like the room we'd just seen, save the bed difference.

There is no balcony, small windows, and the room is more noisy with the sound of roller coaster and ambulances. Dont eat pasta at the America restaurant. Too expensive and not very good. This hotel is on the strip and not too far from action and other big hotels. Take the shuttle dayly pass for 7$ to move from on place to another. Zumanity is excellent. No kids allowed, thank god! In Vegas: Dont miss any of Cirque du soleil show or Phantom at venitian. Skip cheasy magic show unless your right there and get in free. Dont get caught with the timeshare scam, they're everywhere on the street offering free tickets for show that are already free, and 75$ free money to spent on casino, or cheap entry at shark reef. To get this you have to take a shuttle and spend 3 hours of your precious time in a hotel south of vegas listening their selling speech.

The casino was fine and I am totally appreciative of lower limit tables - it allows money to last :) One suggestion (and I guess this is the same across the strip) - many of the dealers need to go through soft-skill training. I'm sorry but when your job is to deal with tourists, it doesn't hurt to be nice every now and then!

As usual we were a bit wary of the hotel due to some of the reviews but have been pleasantly surprised. Check in was a breeze, and after 16 hours of travelling just what we needed. We were asked whether we would prefer a non-smoking or smoking room. The desk clerk was polite and efficient and within about 10 minutes we were on our way to our room. We had a Park Avenue Deluxe and were not disappointed. The room was spacious, with two Queen beds, HUGE TV, and most importantly (for me at least) a pristine bathroom. The room had a view of the MGM Grand, Tropicana and the rollercoaster. We had read that some people who had rooms near the rollercoaster had said that the noise had disturbed them, but we can honestly say that we were not in anyway disturbed by the noise, yes we could hear it running and yes we could hear people screaming but it was a muffled sound and didn't spoil any time we spent in the room. We can recommend the Pizza place within the casino (sorry the name escapes me) and the 24hr Starbucks was a godsend especially when we were waking up a silly o clock due to the time difference. If you want to see any of the exhibits or attractions we found that we could purchase 3 of these for $54 (we got the tickets in the MGM Grand). Given that most of them are $20 per person its a great saving. We went to the Titanic exhibition in the Luxor - absolutely brilliant and very humbling to see the possessions of the people aboard the ship, there is also a large section of the ship itself in the exhibit; Shark Reef at the Mandalay Bay - very good and The Secret Garden at The Mirage - very good. The other must is the fountain display at The Bellagio, this is on the hour and is amazing. We used the Deuce bus as well to get up and down the Strip. Its $5 for a 2 hour ticket, $7 for a 24 hour ticket and $20 for a 3 day ticket. You can hop on and off and it takes you from one end to the other. You can also use it to visit Fremont Street which is the downtown area of LV. It is a totally different experience and you can see \"old Las Vegas\". You will certainly see some characters there that's for sure. We also went to Town Square shopping area. This was not what we expected at all and we found it a bit strange - to put it into context think of The Truman Show and you will understand!! We stayed about 30 minutes. If you want some shopping we can recommend taking the Deuce bus to one of the premium outlet malls.

I asked them to recheck several times and the lady, getting frustrated, said to me with a hint of an attitude \"I can only tell you what I see on the screen.\" With much attitude I said to her \"well you need to tell me somthing else.

I was advised they ask for ID but don't make a copy of it. Finally she went in the back to consult someone else. When she returned she explained that my reservation had accidentally been combined with the reservation for those two men. I finally got a room. Room very small, no coffee pot, windows extremely small. I did have a view of the roller coaster bt it felt like jail. Now I know its Vegas, but my room and the foor where the conference rooms are smelled HEAVILY of smoke. I and several of my co-workers complained of the air being extremely dry. My nose, eyes and mouth felt like cotton the whole time I was there. In the evening I went to the Venetian and made note that not only was the air not dry there, but even IN the casino area the smell of smoke was not that heavy. There was also a hint of a light pleasant fragrance in the air. My conclusion is that New York New York Hotel must have a cheap ventiliation system. The casino is right on top of the lobby. There is not the huge expanse of lobby/front desk area like most Vegas hotels, with the casino being a ways away. There is nothing about this hotel that I enjoyed.

There's also plenty to do within the NY NY complex itself. The room itself was fairly average, with a view over the air conditioning unit. My colleagues who had other rooms on the same booking had views of the roller coaster, all of the rooms were fairly noisy, due to either the roller coaster or the air con unit being so close, I'd suggest asking for a higher floor if you're a light sleeper - it wasn't a huge problem for us, but worth mentioning. The cleaning and maintenance of the rooms was carried out to an exceptionally high standard which was great.

We got there at the precise check-in Time (1pm) and we asked for a room upgrade. For only $10 per night we were given a strip view and let me tell you this was a fantastic view. We were on the 34th(of 36) floor on the corner of the Chrysler Tower. We could see Monte Carlo, PH, City Center, Orleans, Palms, Rio, and even the HIlton way off in the distance. it was pretty amazing. The room seemed a bit small but we did have two beds. the Bathroom was marble tiled and very large. Our Maid was very nice. The beds were comfortable. We liked the NYNY because at about 10pm the restaurants and casino really start to get hopping. on friday and sat. nights it is Packed with people and really allot of fun. the casino is much smaller than most places, but the MGM is right across the street and the tram to Mandalay bay is also across the street. Other reviewers on TA here said we should ask for breakfast vouchers but this is not an option at the NYNY and we were not given any. The NYNY has lots of places to eat and drink, including two Starbuck's and two pizza places. It is very kid friendly but I would advise parents to take their kids to some place OTher than Las vegas for vacation. I heard they are trying to get away from Vegas being a \"Family Destination\" (Family's simply do not spend the $$$$) Players Club Cards: the M-Life card works for ALL the MGM properties and we were able to get more than $100 comp'ed off of our room charges. They allow you to \"Link\" Cards if you are married and have the same mailing address. also, when you sign up for your card, make sure to get some extra ones. This is handy if your friends do not have m-life cards, they can play with yours and the points can seriously add up. Getting to NYNY: If you are driving on I15 take the Tropicana Exit of course. There are Two entrances to the hotel; one from Tropicana Ave. and one from LV Blvd. The East bound Trop. entrance is a little tricky because it is a super long Left turn lane so after you take the Eastbound Trop. exit, make sure to cut all the way over to the left very quickly otherwise you will miss it. (if you do miss it, just take a left on LV blvd. then the next left into the hotel, only problem with going this way is the nearly 45 different speed bumps, lol.)

Please keep in mind that I am a rather picky traveler. I was worried at first after reading some of the reviews of NYNY Las Vegas but we were extremely pleased. We stayed in the newly renovated Madison Avenue rooms. It was a LOT nicer than the regular rooms there that we looked at on their website. We asked them for an upgrade when we arrived, which we they let us have free of charge since it was my birthday and first time in Vegas. The King size bed was super comfy and we had a large flat screen TV. Our room was very comfortable. NYNY may not be the fanciest place to stay compared to extravagance of Bellagio and Venetian but it really was awesome for us...we loved it. The location on the strip is right in the middle of everything. There are plenty of restaurants and places to grab a bite to eat in the casino and a few gift shops. Starbucks, Nathan's Hotdogs, NY Pretzels, a steakhouse, an asian bistro, a Mexican restaurant, Irish Pub, 2 Pizza Places and a Burger place. We ate at the Mexican restaurant which was VERY good. I had a watermelon margarita and fresh guacamole...both delish! We also ate at one of the pizza places for a quick bite....it was pretty much like Sbarro and I loved the pretzels from the pretzel stand..yum! It was an easy walk to MGM Grand (across the pedestrian bridge). We could hear barely the roller coaster from our room---which was right outside our window---but if I paid VERY close attention I could hear it....and there were times when I could hear music from our room....but it wasn't loud or annoying. The only complaint that I have is that the entire hotel was smokey and stuffy. It wasn't unbearably smokey, but I'm just not used to that and I do realize that anywhere you stay in Vegas will be smokey if it's in a casino.

On the plus the parking garage is located in a very convenient area to get in and out of Las Vegas Blvd. and there is a variety of restaurants to choose from as well as a fun atmosphere to stroll around in. The room itself is pretty average and compared to other similar priced hotels on the strip-- more basic. The carpet and furniture were worn and the wallpaper was peeling in several areas. My biggest dissappontment was the bathroom--plastic tub and shower door with faux marble. There was a long counter with one sink but the toilet was up against part of it so only one person could stand at the counter at a time. Small soap, shampoo/conditioner and lotion--no shower cap so I used the liner of the ice bucket for my hair. If I was staying at a budget motel this would have been fine but my expectations were higher for a known hotel on the strip. There is also a resort fee (which really gets you nothing extra other than wi-fi)--when booking, I just assumed that was standard practice for all of the big resorts.

We checked in around 4.30pm local time and even though I had a Players Card and could have used the VIP Check-In Lounge the main desk was clear so I went straight ahead and got our group of 4 checked-in quickly and efficiently by a very helpful young lady at main reception. I have to say wondering around the hotel later in the week at various times throughout the day the lines were LONG! We asked well before departure from the UK for the same room as last year and Chase my casino host ensured this was fulfilled as it is a corner room and has great space and equally good views up and down the strip. The room was always immaculately cleaned whilst we were there and if we had a lie in the Housekeepers Office would call to confirm they would clean the room later when we had left for the day. We visited all the bars with Nine Fine Irishmen yet again doing the trick for good food, drink and evening entertainment. The Bar At Times Square with the dualing pianos is also a must and never fails to draw a good evening crowd intent on fun and laughter and the piano players ensure everyone leaves happy and more than a little hoarse after all the singing. A new thing this year was the introduction of a crooner in the afternoons so if you want to stroll in grab a table and a beer and be entertained for an hour or two then this now an option. And in less crowded conditions as the evenings. Whilst there we ate at Il Fornaio the Italian Restaurant which is always a nice relaxing experience with high quality food and service. You can people watch from an outside table as the patio faces onto the casino floor. Gallaghers Steakhouse was once again visited and we have learnt that no matter how hungry you may be it is best to order a main course only, with one of the various steak options a must, with vegetables and potatoes or fries and leave off the side dishes. This is if you want to be able to move around freely again within two hours as the portions and quality of the food can render you no more than a beached whale when washed down with a bottle or two of a good red. In other words a top drawer place with good food and service. It can run a bit pricey but you are on vacation and it is Vegas. America is one of the best 24 hour food places you could ask for. It's like a good friend who is always there when needed. We used it at all hours of the day and night and I mean all hours and we always enjoyed value for money and have no complaints. Whilst snacking between gambling and partying in the later hours Sirricos Pizza and I must admit the other fast food outlets served us up tasty, warm food at a very reasonable price. The general bars (Centre Bar & Pour 24) offer a different kind of a place to enjoy a relaxing drink as one is a circular bar bang in the centre of the casino and the other, Pour 24, looks down onto the casino from a busy thoroughfare. Both are great for people watching though on occasions I found the music down at the Centre Bar a little hard to take as the volume was just a little too loud but only on certain occasions - can't remember but it may have been at the weekend. Heather at the Centre Bar has become a good friend due to my regular visits and once more Heather was there on the 'graveyard shift' to serve us and newcomers with her usual smile and friendly chat and banter. In the early hours it's nice to have a place to go to get a second or third wind and to relax over a beer or cocktail whilst having a nice chat. One of the things we found again to be a bit of a negative is the happy hour/early entrance to Rok the hotels nightclub. You can be given tickets and told happy hour is on and that it is a top class place to get into. It probably is but at between the hours of 5pm and 6pm it is nothing more than an empty room with never more than 5 people in not including we 4 and the drinks prices didn't make me happy. The lights are pretty much on full so as stated it turns out to be nothing more than an average, overpriced bar we have fallen for it twice now but not next year. At proper nightclub hours it is a bustling atmospheric place with great lighting and visuals and it should probably try to remain just that and not try and contend with the proper daytime bars. We checked out via the Players Club Lounge which was once again fast and efficient though I have to say I felt the comps were not as good as last year. I feel I gambled more yet received less comped back but that could just be me. Although the casinos have been struggling in recent years so maybe it's a tightening of belts even further. In saying that I still recommend the M Life Players Card. I am already planning my trip to NYNY for October 2012 so you can say I have once more enjoyed myself enough to head back. As I stated in last years review head to Vegas with an open mind but with the intention of enjoying yourself. It has a bit for everyone and the trick is to find the bits you like and move on from the parts you don't then sit back and enjoy the ride. Finally when booking a show pre-departure we went for the biggest name available and managed to get tickets for Elton John and believe me he was outstanding. What a show, what a showman, what an entertainer and what a pro. I liked his 70's and 80's stuff way back but lost him late 80's onwards but this show covers the whole career with some of his original band and with a fabulous set and back drop. A must see!!

Our first time to Vegas was a lot of fun, we both found so many things to do. The wax museum is worth the $25 or prebuy for discount. Look for drink & food deals especially 2-5 o'clock happy hours, you can save a lot. A pint of beer & a hot dog for $2 on Freemont Street. Do you really need a souvenier cup with your drink for $14-$17? You can find other slushy drinks with plain plastic cups to go for $3.

The room was large and clean, with windows along two sides of the room looking out over great the MGM Grand, Tropicana, airport and Excaliber down to Mandalay Bay and the mountains beyond. The only downside of our stay was the pillows 'sweaty' we asked for replacements at reception (which were prompty delivered), and although better, still were a little stale. There are plenty of places to eat. We ate a breakfast and a dinner at the America diner which were ok. The Mexican restaurant was nice, and Galaghers Steakhouse served the best steak I've ever had! It was reasonably pricey restaurant (approx $50 for a steak and sides) but it was worth it, and the servers were great.

Room was larger than a normal hotel room (Broadway Premium View) with decent view on 16th floor. Next problem was the in room safe did not work. Called downstairs and a service man came up but could not fix it so he called another man who could not fix it either so they both disappeared saying they would be back. Rang reception after 15 minutes to be told that they were looking in to it whilst my wife and kids (11+8) who had been ready to go out for half an hour waited impatiently. After another 15 minutes reception rang back to tell me that the safe could not be fixed and that they would therefore be upgrading me to another room. All well and good but by this time it was 7.30 (3 hours after we arrived) and we were also moved into the room that i had initially tried to pay to upgrade to. We were told the keys would automatically change over but I was not surprised when i had to make another trip downstairs to get new keys, AGAIN!! So by 8pm we had a room with working safe and took 2 very tired kids out for dinner. Now that i have stopped ranting.....

It took us almost an hour to check for 3 rooms (1 of which was actually ready). The room was beautiful (Marquis Suite). Our 2nd day (Wednesday) my sister and I realized that we had large \"pending\" charges on our room ($2200 on rooms that should have cost $1100). When we went down the front desk we were told that they were pending and would be released at check out. The next day (Thursday) my sister had another charge of $80 from this hotel. When we returned to the front desk to say wtf?? the front desk staff were very confused for what the charge was for. At that point they called our credit card companies to release all the pending payments and we paid in full for our rooms. Upon arriving home I checked my statement to make sure that the pending charges were released and what do I find? ANOTHER charge for $50.40 charged to my card. When I called the front desk I spoke to Larissa (no clue) and then Deana (mgr), I was told that they \"accidentally\" charged my credit card but refunded it back right away, I thought it was nice that Deana threw her co-worker under the bus by saying it was someone else and not her (Deana) who made the charge. As a manager I think that Deana needs more customer service training and that the front desk as a whole need more training, there is total pilot error in that place. The worst part was that upon check-in we wanted to pay in full for our rooms & they could use the CC as a hold for \"incidentals\" and we were told \"NO, that they didn't do that\"...of course they don't because why pay the actual price when they can jerk you for double??

If you thinking about it then just get on get booked! The New York, New York is very well positioned on the strip and actually is not as big as you perhaps would think it is. For Las Vegas a couple of thousand bedrooms in a hotel is small! We found the reception staff very friendly and the room we had was absolutely fine (Park Avenue double). Clean, plenty big enough with plenty of hot water and shower facility over the bath which worked particularly well. As you would expect the bedroom is air conditioned and considering there is a casino below you, when you closed your bedroom door you couldn't hear a thing! One minor detail for a major coffee drinker - I would have appreciated coffee making facilities in the room, but no big deal. More restaurants in the hotel than you can shake a stick at plus of course you can walk into any other hotel and use any of their restaurants, so no shortage of food. Prices for meals are literally from inexpensive to wow that's a lot! So you can enjoy a meal to suit your budget. Hotels close by include the MGM Grand, Excalibur, Luxor and Mandalay Bay, but really any hotel is easily accessible by a short taxi ride (There are plenty of taxi's in Vegas!) Shows to see - many and I recommend you use the ticket kiosks on the strip as they do offer cheaper theatre tickets plus cut price entry into exhibitions. For example we went to the Cirque du soleil show in MGM Grand - Ka. The production is brilliantly done and I have never seen a stage that has been able to move to a totally vertical position before! A masterful performance to go and see. We also went to the Titanic exhibition in the Luxor which is really interesting and so it goes on... We did have a little flutter on the tables, but I have to say that this appears to be an incredibly serious pastime and the croupier's seem to have no sense of humour whatsoever, but I guess this is how they are supposed to be?! One of your night's should be allocated to a trip up to Freemont Street. Here are shops, bars, casinos all along a street which has a roof - not just any old roof but one with millions of lights in it which are used every hour for a very effective show to music. There are live bands on stages in different parts of the street and the atmosphere is just wonderful - get down there! Finally, one of the greatest highlights for us (we were a group of 6) was to fly out to the Grand Canyon in a helcopter. We did this with Maverick helicopters and were collected from the hotel, down to the airport and set off in a 7 seater helicopter. Good views from wherever you sit in it and once everybody settled down for a few minutes, it really was a thrilling experience. You fly over the Hoover dam, then land in the Canyon, glass of champers and a small bite to eat, before setting off again. Everybody has earphones so you can chat to each other and the pilot talks you through the scenery. Great trip and really worth doing... So with so much happening and so many things to do, you can see why my heading is 'you don't have to love gambling to love Vegas!'

Having stayed before we knew it was cheaper to book the upgrade room before arriving and also to look out for the sale offers and compare offers, as at the same time the sale was on the hotel were also offering a Facebook Friends discount but the sale price available to all was still cheaper! I've seen some of the prices other people quote as paying and am quite shocked as I wouldnt have paid that rate. Think it averaged about $80 a night for our 8 night stay. Stayed in a Broadway Deluxe room on the 22nd floor, didnt bother with Strip View, I'm not there to look out the window at it, so had a pool view and got to see the evening sun sets over the mountains instead. There is a faint noise from the coaster, but certainly not enough to disturb sleep! Rooms are huge (when you are used to UK and European Hotels!) with two beds, a double closet, plenty of drawer space. Only thing I did remember to do from my previous visit was to pack some spare coat hangers, hotels rarely have enough. Bathrooms are a good size, with plenty of towels and room for toiletries etc. (a girls must have!) Though the shower heads are located a little low for anyone taller than about 6 feet!! One thing I would change and that to have a coffee machine in the room. I do miss having any coffee/tea making facility in a room, but it seems that this isnt as common in the USA as elsewhere and NYNY like to make the profits from their coffee bars on the casino floor! They certainly did from us tea drinking Brits!! Outside the room, the pool area is pretty small for the size of the hotel, and you have to be queued when the pool opens or certainly within 30 minutes to get a lounger but as early birds with jet lag it suited us! Also the sun doesnt hit the whole pool area until after midday, so plan for that if you only want a few hours morning sun.

Upon arrival at 3:00 AM, we inquired about getting a room early, as we had originally only booked Saturday the 24th. We were accomodated and put in a room on the 23rd floor which was horrible (2308 to be exact). The room was dirty, incredibly smoke-filled and the drapes, linens and carpet had been permeated tremendously. Also, most of the channels on our television did not work and kept showing \"weak signal - check cable\". Also, the bathroom floor was extremely dirty and quite frankly, a bit scary. My husband went downstairs the next morning and voiced his concerns and they happily upgraded us to another room for $100.00, which was amazing (room 1954). My husband is a high stakes gambler who enjoys throwing down $500 chips on roulette games, crap tables, etc. After spending all day gambling Saturday, we asked for a recommendation for dinner and Gallaghers was suggested. Although we had no reservation, the hostess took our name and we were seated within 20 minutes. Our waiter Norman was amazing and recommended the steak & lobster dinner, paired it with wine, suggested the shrimp cocktails, spinach salad and creme brulee. Both my husband and I maintain it was the best dinner, steak & lobster, shrimp cocktail we have ever had. In fact, we enjoyed it so much, we went back yesterday again (2 days in a row) and repeated what we had the night before. Although it was pricey ($600), it is our new \"go to\" restaurant when we get to Vegas again. I must say, when we go back, we will only ask for Norman. The difference in the service on Saturday night with Norman versus the service we got yesterday (not sure of his name) was night and day. I'm not sure I would stay in the rooms again, however, the Casino was fine (a bit loud) and the restaurant was fabulous.

The Greenwich style food village is highly recommended and we enjoyed getting breakfast every morning from there. The games arcade is a must see for kids too. I had a car and the car parking (free) was just behind the hotel and less than 5 minutes walk to reception - the same cannot be said of other Vegas hotels that's for sure. Location wise, you cannot go wrong - its the perfect location for the Southern end of the Strip (Excalibur, MGM Grand, Tropicana, Luxor and Mandalay Bay, Coke World and M&M World nearby) and if you wanted to, you can walk to the Bellagio fountains in about 15 minutes.

Based on our reading alot of the reviews, when checking in we requested a non-smoking room, close to the elevators and asked for a complimentary upgrade, all of which we were accommodated with (we, of course, mentioned reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, so maybe that helped). We found the negative comments in the reviews about the roller coaster noise to be unfounded. This was right outside our room on the 24th floor and we could barely hear the noise, plus it stops at midnight and doesn't start up again until 10 am. Also comments about the rooms needing updating, especially with flat screen TV's was not the case for our room was very modern and had a very large flat screen TV. Another negative comment was about the long wait to check in--we were about a half hour early for the 3 pm check in and the line was very long, but our wait was only about 15 minutes, check in went very quickly and we were in our room by 3 pm. We found the comments about the smoke smell in the casino were correct, but that was pretty much the case in all the casinos--wish Las Vegas would join in the 21st century push to eliminate smoking inside public buildings. The village was a fun place for food and entertainment . . . but warning, prices are very high all over Las Vegas--no more $10 lobster and steak dinners! A Manhattan at the casino bar cost $14!

We dined in Gallaghers steak house one night which was beautiful and big portions, but probably not the best idea to go there straight after a ride on the hotel roller coaster!!! We also ate in Chin Chin oriental restaurant and this was definitely our nicest meal on site, a lot more affordable than Gallaghers and I can HIGHLY recommend the tangerine peel beef.

Greatest hits. Flops and Near Misses. I bought the room on Priceline for about $280 for four nights. Tax included. Mind you, this was in August when Las Vegas is like a mini bake oven. The heat hits like a wall but in LV you move from hyper-heat to AC. No one walks more than a quarter mile at a time. Pack water, use sunscreen, have sunglasses and venture forth. We arrived at the hotel to find, at 11 pm on a Tuesday, 1 clerk and a line of 25. Message received. 'We are not a hotel. We are a Casino. Deal with it. Wait in line for forty minutes to get your room key.' Not the message I wanted to hear after 13 hours of travel from New Hampshire. Not a great start. The room was fine. You are in Las Vegas. A bed, a and a bathroom are what is required. We had a view of the roller-coaster from our window. The Spa at the hotel is not to be missed. Sauna, steam bath, hot tub in a calming atmosphere. That was superb even though it does cost $10 above the $15 'resort fee' that the hotel charges for each day of your stay. I complained about the check-in wait and the resort fee was waived. The lobby floor of the hotel was filled with the casino and surrounded by New York type bars and restaurants. If Fornaio was excellent. Go there.The breakfast is worth twice the price. Avoid Gonzales Gonzales. Taco Bell quality in a sea of noise. The Nine Fine Irishmen was a profound disappointment. I have returned 2 meals in my life. The bucket of hamburger and potato at the 9 Fine was one of them. My dining partner had a gristly cut of steak. Stick to the Guiness and the HD sports. The food truly does what the wind does. (I can't say blows). But it did. The Deli was great. The burger place was average. The breakfast buffet, also average. Visit other hotels and casinos there are better buffets elsewhere.... If you are going to gamble; the best odds are the craps table. Bet the pass line or the Don't pass line. Avoid the other sucker bets. The house has only a 1.4% advantage on the pass line. Know that however you gamble, the odds are ALWAYS against you. Figure what you can happily lose, bet that and walk away if it's gone. I budgeted about $50 per night for gambling. In the end, I made about $40 but I had a good time and walked away happy. The hotel is at the base of 'the strip' which is aptly named. The Strip is about 4 miles of hotels/casinos that have been beamed down into the middle of the desert. It is an oasis of faux in the middle of heated sand. It is a place for those who believe in luck more than in math. It is the devil's dream: Garish, Obscene, Fun, A return to the playpen, a hard lesson, and a place that is willing to have you let your wild side take a walk at your expense. Las Vegas is an act. Put on your costume and roll them bones..... Indeed, Why not. New York New York was a workable place to stay. The rooms were, uh, hotel rooms. I had a low-end room but it was fine. I slept well. The bathroom was done in marble.... Best of all, I walked outside and the rest of the strip extended further than I could see. Get the Deuce bus ticket for 24 hours of travel along the strip. The half-off shows booth is across the street. Save some $ and buy show tickets there. I really liked the old casinos on Freemont Street. It is where the locals go. Las Vegas offers gambling, food and shows. I don't care about people prancing around on a stage. I saw Andrew Cools, an amazingly rauchy hypnotist perform at the Paris. I was very happy that I did not volunteer...... Vinny Favorito at the Flamingo was an excellent comedy show. Definitely worth seeing. The best thing that I did in Las Vegas was to take the GC Flight Hoover Dam tour. A 9 hour day which included the dam, a buffet, and a tour of a chocolate factory/desert botanical garden where I took some nice photos. Don't miss this. Call the company and the rate should be about $70. The tour also included free show tickets which more than covered the cost of an amazing day.

We requested early check in and they said that none of the room we booked was ready but for $10.00 extra per night we can upgrade from Skyline (basic room) to Park Ave room and no early check in fees. When we got there, the room looked renovated, but in a cheap way- there were cigarette holes in the sheets, and stains, and hair. The shower head had lime rust and some yellow goo- we asked to change rooms, and the conditions were slightly better. There was also layers of dust in corners. I felt the need to disinfect room surfaces and shower head with sanitizer just in case. The pool was not efficient- because of the tall buildings around- sun hits the pool at 11:30am only and height only 3.5 -4ft. Crammed sun chairs no cushion provided. *** Buffets were a good deal except beware: they explained that the buffets would charge to our room and in the end hotel will credit us back at checkout. The catch was that the normal prices of the buffets of breakfast/lunch were $15-$17 but they charged us $19-$20. When we checked out they deducted $20 per person but kept the tax on- there was nowhere on the voucher that says excludes tax but they have space to write in bold that tip is not included! We had to speak to a manager to get the taxes removed (total $45.00 approx). Buffet choices were good (I recommend Mirage and Mandalay Bay- NOT Circus Circus and MGM).

The casino is nice and has the super high ceilings that most casinos don't have so it feels more open. We enjoyed the new automated video Craps game they have there. Only $1 minumum, and it has real live jumbo dice that you press a button to roll. I was sad to learn ESPNZone closed, but it has been replaced by Sporting House who kept all the old ESPN seating with all the big screens and booths, etc. It seems half the games at Sporting House upstairs are gone, but still some to play using their game card.

We wanted non-smoking, which they didn't have the first night, so they moved us the next day into a non-smoking room. The room was clean, basic, but nice. We enjoyed going down to the casino level and eating at the restaurants. Gonzolez Y Gonzolez is an excellent Mexican restaurant...they make fresh guacamole at your table...delicious! Also \"Chin Chin\" has amazing sushi and sweet and sour soup! MMMM.....Also try the pizza at the pizza place....very very yummy!! Didn't have alot of \"luck\" at the Casino, but I sure enjoyed playing the \"Sex and the City\" slot machine...very fun and played for hours. The location of this hotel is excellent! We would totally stay here again, but will probably try another hotel next time for variety. Not a big fan of the resort fees. 15 bucks per day. My husband used the fitness facility daily and we used the wi-fi which is included in the resort fee. Really, they should just include it in the price, and honestly, I think we might choose a hotel without resort fees next time. The fitness center should be included at all hotels...really, why not? I enjoyed a pedicure and a shrink wrap at the spa...very nice spa...steam room, sauna, hydrotherapy tubs...relaxing...prices kind of high, but that's a Vegas Hotel Spa. All in all, a great holiday!

This was our second trip to LV this year and my second time at time at NY NY. We chose to stay at this hotel because of the vibe and the great selection of food. We also got a great deal through M life so we were able to stay in one of their Marque Suites. Check in was a little longer than expected. I think they were having some staffing issues because there was only one person checking people in and the people in front of the business center were helping out. But all things considered we didn\u2019t have to wait that long and check in went smooth and the room was as requested. The walk to the elevators was not far and the room was exactly what we had expected. Good size with a nice spa tub and a view of the roller coaster/strip. We really enjoyed the room, the bed was very comfy and when we did sleep we were never bothered by any noise and I know the first night we were there the hotel was almost 100% occupied. We ate at several of the restaurants while we were there. The first night we ate at the sports bar (old ESPN Zone) and had great service and the food was good. It certainly served the purpose of grabbing something quick before we started our gambling and drinking. The next night we ate at Gallagher\u2019s, which is fantastic. I do not know how they get their steaks to tender and tasty. If you want a great meal and great service stop by here. This was our second time eating here and it just gets better. Our third bigger meal during our trip was at the Nine Fine Irish Men pub. We sat at the bar and had a great service and really enjoyed our beers, fish and chips, and Sheppard\u2019s pie. We also grabbed a few late night snacks at the pizza place buy the piano bar. Highly recommend the deep dish pizza and the garlic bread. Definitely helps soak up some of the booze before bedtime\u2026LOL We hung out at Coyote Ugly one night. Both my wife and I enjoyed the show put on by the happy people on stage and on the dance floor \uf04a Also had a few drinks at the lobby bar. This place is seems to be a nice quite spot to hang out with good bartenders. Now the only bad thing I have to say is about the Center Bar. I sat down here and several of the bartenders walked past me and did not acknowledge me. I had to get up and move to the opposite side before anyone would ask me if I needed something. This is the only poor service at a VP bar I encountered during our entire trip. Gambling at the NY NY was disappointing. Didn\u2019t seem like anyone was winning so we spent most of our time gambling elsewhere. The cocktail service there was also slow. The cocktail service didn\u2019t bother me so much because I usually sit at the nearest VP bar and like I stated earlier I usually have great service except at the Center Bar. But it does annoy my wife who likes to play that slots but can\u2019t get a drink or even a glass of water. Slow cocktail service seemed to be a common theme and we always tip $2-$3 per drink. The only decent cocktail service was at Mandalay Bay. Overall NY NY met our expectations and we would not hesitate to stay here again. Oh, and we had no problem with our maid service except we ran out of wash clothes one night and we called and they never brought any up. The next day a caught a maid in the hall and requested more, when we returned to our room later in the day we had lots of them.

We had enough of going back and forth to the front desk so we had security come and let us in, but not before we sweated our heads off in the halls. The temperature in that hotel varied from floor to floor and hour to hour. We were disappointed there was no buffet, but did have a couple of good meals at the steak house and burger bar. Not impressed with the fact that minors were allowed to roam the casino floor. Plus, even if you were a guest at the hotel, you had to pay $20 to ride the rollercoaster. Staff was polite, but did not acknowledge that we had experienced numerous problems while there. They could have offered some vouchers to comp part of the room or something, anything, and we probably would not have taken it. It is just the principle of the matter that they did not document or care enough about all the problems we had to acknowledge them in some way. We will not recommend to our friends or anyone else for that matter.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice and Clean, Good Value\u201d", "Author": "zerokarma", "ReviewID": "UR115127546", "Content": "We stayed here in late June as sort of summer getaway/be-lated birthday present. When looking for a place to stay it was mainly between NYNY, Monte Carlo, Paris and Planet Hollywood. We ended up choosing NYNY because at the time they had a really good Summer sale and we got the Spa suite for an extremely good price plus some other freebies, overall the room deal was better than the other places so we went with it. The Spa suite we had was very clean and updated looking, room air was a little stale but did not smell of smoke. Most if not all of the Spa suites are corner rooms I believe, the view was fairly decent and quite, you do not hear any noise from the rollercoaster. Keep in mind the rollarcoaster goes around the entire resort so it will be seen from most every room. The Spa/hot tub worked great and was nice to relax in. The maid service was excellent while we were there. The NYNY hotel in general is very clean, the ceiling in the casino area is high so it doesn't feel as claustrophobic as other hotels, feels more open in there which is nice. The restaurants are sort of expensive in there, but we did have breakfast every day there at the italian place as we had a 2-for-1 deal. The pool area is small and pretty sub-par compared to other hotels in Vegas, if a pool is important to you I would stay elsewhere. Overall I had a pleasant experience with NYNY however next time I would probably try staying at a different place not because there was anything wrong with the place but rather I think next time I want to be further up the strip near the Bellagio/Paris area. For the money though NYNY was an excellent deal and we enjoyed our time there.

Only complaints would be the hassle from pros whenever I drank in the bars on the casino floor (and a few of them had hygiene problems) but I imagine this to be common in other hotels too.

Arrived on 6/26 and the problems started. At check in I was informed that I had to pay an extra $15 per room (2 rooms) per day for a \"resort fee\". This resort fee allows me to use the pool and their high speed internet and some other \"amenities\". So this cost me an extra $16.80 per day for four days (times 2 rooms) for a grand total of $134.40. The pool was ok, but the \"high speed\" internet was pathetic. If you are planning on doing some remote office work during your stay, plan on doing a lot of waiting. The extra $134.40 resort fee surprise you will get at check-in is the kind of shady practice you expect from a low end car dealership. The second problem is two persons per room gets a free breakfast or lunch buffet each day. The first morning my entire family went to the breakfast buffet at Chin Chin's. They have a big sign that exclaims \"BREAKFAST BUFFET\". But guess what, this particular breakfast buffet isn't eligible for the free breakfast. You have to walk across the street over to MGM or one of their other properties to get a free buffet. So back to Chin Chin's - the breakfast buffet at this restaurant is terrible. They use mirrors to make it look larger than it is, but it consists of some eggs, breakfast meat and some dried out pastries. Needless to say, we walked over to the MGM for the breakfast buffet the remainder of the vacation. So Chin Chin's hideous buffet cost me $69.95 ($14 per person) because I evidently missed some fine print on some document they gave me at check in. My third complaint is the casino itself. The slot machines at NY NY are so tight that you would be better off using your money for toilet paper. If you stay here, take a cab, the bus or high-speed monorail and head north. You will pay for transportation, but you will be money ahead. And if you want a \"free\" drink, plan or waiting a long time at NY NY. The cocktail waitresses are few and far between. The closer to downtown you go, you will actually have a chance to win some money and get a few free drinks. The first day, I ordered two domestic beers at the circular bar at NY NY and the tab was $14. Ridculous. The next problem is NY NY has a roller coaster wrapping around the hotel. So all night long you hear people screaming riding this thing. It is hard to enjoy LV and the surrounding attractions when you can't get any sleep because of people screaming on a roller coaster. So to wrap up, while checking out I stated my dissatisfaction with the charge for the Chin Chin's restaurant. I informed the person conducting the check-out process that nobody in my family were aware this \"restaurant\" wasn't included in the free buffet. So she takes out an adjustment form and lays it on the counter, and then proceeds to talk to what appeared to be a manager. She comes back and tells me again that Chin Chin's isn't eligible for the free breakfast buffet. I guess that manager didn't think that waiving a retail charge of $70 (about $5 wholesale) was the right thing to do.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel to experience 'The Strip'\u201d", "Author": "TravelTheRock", "ReviewID": "UR114927369", "Content": "I had a 3 night stay en route to the east coast to experience The Strip.

I tend to go through Priceline for my hotel bookings, so it was nice to actually pick a place on my own for once. I am not too fussy about hotel accomodations, but I wanted to splurge a bit this time since it was Vegas and there are many great hotel resorts throughout the city. Check-in is probably the hardest thing to do when you are staying a Vegas hotel. The lines tend to be very long. NY NY is a good hotel, but not one with the best profile so the line was not too bad here. Checkout is super easy though. You can even checkout using the TV! I checked in at around noon so the room I wanted (king bed/non-smoking) was not available. Rather than wait for a room, I checked into a 2 queen bed/smoking Park Avenue Deluxe room for my first night. However, I was able to change over to my desired room on the following day. I just called reception to request the change. Once the new room is ready, you will get a message from them about where to move. No need to go downstairs to change your key card though. Just use your current card to enter the new room. I have to say that staff was very professional and handled my request with grace and patience. The rooms here are stylish. The marble tiles in the bathroom are classy. It really does have a New Yorker cosmopolitan vibe to them. The Park Ave rooms are quite spacey at 400 sq ft. and are located on a high floor. Because of that, you take a different elevator to get to your room than guests staying in a Skyline room. The room amenities are kind of basic though. Expect the usual of fragrant toiletries. But no coffeemakers or mini fridges. There is wi-fi access here and it is included as part of the $15 a night plus tax resort fee. That resort fee gets you a daily newspaper and access to the pool and gym. As for hotel attractons, the casino here is okay. The slots are kind of stingy. Knew I did not like Monopoly's Mr. Moneybags. Restaurant selection here appeals to a general audience and priced moderately. There are a quite a few cheap/affordable fast food options here too. And they have serval places here like Nathan's in which you can try NY food fare as well. Location is on the south end of the Strip. I would have liked to stayed closer to the middle so I did not have to walk so much. There is a free tram at the Monte Carlo next door that you can take to the Bellagio if you want to rest your feet a bit and the Monorail is across the street at MGM. Overall, I liked NY NY and enjoyed my stay.

You can do better on the strip in Vegas so I wouldn't stay here unless you get a SERIOUSLY low price... like $89 a night or something. OK- the room: We paid a little extra for a \"Broadway strip view\" room which was a little bigger, had two queen beds and had a view.\" The view was NOTHING. It looked out over the roof toward the NYNY roller coaster and Statue of Liberty. Pretty much all we could see of the \"strip\" was the MGM grand across the steet and the Tropicana across from that. I guess rooms on the other side of the all looked away from the strip so was this better than that...? I dunno, it sure wasn't much of a \"view.\" The room itself was fine... it was a decent size, not cramped. The bathroom was small... one sink. The tub was super deep and hard to step in with a gross sliding glass door that showed its age. The room wasn't super outdated but was definitely aged in appearance. The carpet was clean so that was good. The ice machine on our floor was broken, that was not convenient. The pool at this hotel is pathetic... small and jammed in with lots of shade (meaning ice cold water) for most of the day. The roller coaster goes over the pool... it isn't really all that relaxing there and you can' swim and party because it is shaded and the water is freezing cold. The service was holiday inn quality- it was fine, but nothing that would grab your attention at all. The air in the main casino area of this hotel has the smell of cigarrette smoke hanging in it... which isn't uncommon except that we did notice the other casnios seemed to have better air filtration systems (Bellagio or Monte Carlo) and the air smelled a lot better over there than at NYNY.

Also quite worryingly there was NO security on the lifts..which meant anyone could be roaming around on your floor. The pool area was tiny for such a big hotel, and only got the sun from about midday onwards. There was a severe lack of places to sit and relax with a drink - and when I say relax I mean comfortable chairs not stools at a bar ! The one bar that had comfy chairs restricted you to sitting there with a minimum of two drinks !!! Their excuse for a buffet was absolutely awful, and buffet wise I fully recomment MGM as it's only a stones throw away and well worth the walk ! The Irish pub inside the hotel was always packed to the rafters and usually standing room only - which isn't my idea of fun !

The hotel was at times confusing, however the fine dining they provided made up for it. The Chin Chin has an excellent breakfast buffet, and would definitely go back. The America restaurant kind of has slow service but what I order turned out good. The amenities this hotel offered were good, the High Speed Internet was lighting fast and the Roller Coaster was incredible. Would probably not stay again, try and book a hotel in the middle of the strip.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kalamazoo", "Title": "\u201cWe'll stay again next time in Vegas!\u201d", "Author": "travelbobKalamazoo", "ReviewID": "UR111257374", "Content": "We hit Vegas for the first time and gave new York, New York a try.

I wrote an email to their customer service department about the results of our trip and also completed their online survey. Both times I have requested contact. Nobody from the hotel chose to respond. My Wife and I booked this trip online and it was paid in advance. This trip was a Birthday celebration for me and she wanted it to be perfect. She was disappointed from the moment we arrived. We had requested a Park Avenue Deluxe room with one king bed. After all, we are married. She had called prior to our arrival to confirm and was informed that even though this room was already paid for, the king bed rooms are provided based on availability upon arrival. Our flight didn't arrive until 7pm so we were initially unable to get a room with a king bed. We were provided a room with two queen beds. When we entered the room, we noticed the comforters were both wrinkled and it appeared as if someone had rested on top of both queen beds. We called down to the front desk to speak to a customer service rep about our room and were informed that they could put us on the \"king bed\" list for the following day and that they would call us if a \"king bed\" room became available. Later that night, my wife needed some hand lotion. The small bottle of hand lotion had already been used and appeared dirty. We stayed out until around 4am to mostly gamble in their casino. When we returned to our room, we noticed that we did not have a \"do not disturb\" sign for our door. We went to bed and were awoke by house keeping numerous times that morning. The following afternoon we contacted the front desk and were informed we were still on the list for a \"King Bed\" room. Since I did not want to spend another night on a queen bed, I asked to upgrade to another room. They had a special to upgrade to a spa suite for around $30 extra dollars a night. It did have a king bed so we took the offer. The room was much nicer. The room appeared to be clean, the television was modern, and most of all it had a King Bed. We stayed out that morning until around 4 am again. We returned to our room and hung the \"DO NOT DISTURB\" sign on the door. We were woken up about every hour after 9am by house keeping who would try their key card to the room followed by an attempt to turn the door handle. At around 11:30 am, house keeping actually called into our room waking us both up asking if we wanted our room cleaned. This defeats the reason for placing the \"DO NOT DISTURB\" sign on the door. We again gambled the next morning until around 4am. We again placed the same \"DO NOT DISTURB\" sign on our door and were waken every hour after 9am by house keeping. I can appreciate them wanting to get your room clean but I did not chose to stay in Vegas to receive an early bird cleaning special. The same house keeping activity took place on the next morning as well. Cocktail service - Cocktail service the first night we stayed was positive. The waitress came around to check on us frequently and was speedy with the drinks. We always tip our waitress well and usually play in the same slot machine areas for a fairly long period of time. The next three nights, drink service was terrible. They didn't appear to have near enough cocktail waitresses. If you could find one, service was very slow. We were gambling a considerable amount and should not have had slow service. (We gambled at numerous other casinos on this trip and New York New York had the worst cocktail service) (MGM Grand had the best and was very busy at the time) Our last night in the hotel we had received a message on our hotel phone talking about fast checkout. The message stated we could check out of the hotel the next morning via the television or the telephone and simply leave the card key in a drop box near the elevator. We chose to checkout the next morning via the television. We selected the checkout feature on the television which prompted us to wait a few moments while our final bill was prepared. After waiting well over ten minutes, we decided this option was not working properly. We checked out via telephone which only took a few minutes. Our experience with bell service the morning of checkout was positive. They were very friendly and quick. I would have notified the front desk of the issues we had during our stay, however, the lines for service were exceptionally long and they appeared short staffed. I was already frustrated with this hotel and chose to not wait any longer.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warrington, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cso much under one roof\u201d", "Author": "jepoyzia", "ReviewID": "UR110784897", "Content": "Booked one of the rooms with a view, well worth it.

Our friends booked for the upgrade which was a larger room but on their arrival they were told it was over booked so had to down grade, I thought they may have offered an upgrade due to their error but no. Loved the casino, one issue was the later it got the less servers there was and even to the point where we could not see any. There was a point when we ordered drinks and no one returned after 30 minutes so we left.

Also went in coyote ugly, the bouncer\u2019s was very nice and let us in for free because it was our wedding day. I was not overly keen as was not completely hammered but was still entertained for a short period. The pool was clean hired one of the cabanas which was nice as it is so hot and you do need to spend time in the shade. It was expensive but worth it for the one day. One issue was that this hotel is at one end of the strip although it is not far when you are tired you cannot be bothered walking. Lots of choices for food in the hotel or over the road is a food court. If you like roller coasters you need to go one this, I did not but my husband did and loved it. We wanted to see a show and when staying you get a discount on the Zumanity. I would not recommend this as I felt very uncomfortable watching it at times a bit like soft porn.

My package was supposed to include an upgrade to a Park Avenue room but I got the smaller Broadway room instead. In fairness, I checked in early and didn't want to wait several hours to get my room. I do like this hotel a lot. The room was small but comfortable. I love their bathrooms and showers. No tub but the shower is good, with nice water pressure and places to put your stuff. Pretty good counter space too. My main disappointment was the temperature. I like my rooms really cool, almost cold, and the room was a little warm for my tastes. The thermometer wouldn't let me set it lower but once I closed the drapes, it was fine. I usually like to leave them open so I can look out but my view was of a rooftop so I didn't miss much really. A huge plus is the availability of places to eat that are reasonably priced, at least by Vegas starndards. America is a good place to find a meal in the $20 range and the service was much improved over my last visit. My favorites, however, are the Greenwich Village eateries. There's a large variety of types of food to choose from. My favorite is the deli. There's a place with pretty little desserts too. I like to get one to take back to the room and indulge myself while recuperating. Its location is on the south end of the strip but you have fairly easy access to the bus by crossing over to MGM. There's also a free tram to Luxor and Mandelay Bay at Excalibur, which is easy to access from NYNY. NYNY is the only MGM hotel I stay in. MGM is pretty stingy with comps for the low rollers but they'll give you a discount on your room. While Harrah's properties will let you book comped or discounted rooms online, MGM makes you call, which can be a pain. They also have a resort fee, something else I don't care for.

We usually stay across the street at Excalibur but decided to change things up a little and stay at a little nicer place this time. We booked our reservation online on the hotels website and received a rate of $44 a night plus tax and that included 2 complimentary drink vouchers and 2 complimentary roller coaster passes. We later decided to stay an extra night so we booked a second reservation to stay an additional night. A week before we checked in our rate went down. I contacted the 800 number on our confirmation and the representative and supervisor were both rude. They advised me that we would not be receiving the drinks or passes that we had been offered when we booked our room. Since it was more than 48 hours prior to our arrival I decided to cancel the reservation. The more I thought about it the more mad I became. I found a phone number for the hotel directly and spoke to a nice gentleman who said he was the manager. The manager sided with me and reinstated our reservation and the lower rate, noted our record that we should receive the free drinks and passes and also waived the $16 resort fees for our stay. I will admit that I was impressed with this manager and I did feel he was very genuine and sincere. We arrived at the hotel on Tuesday May 24th and that is where things really started to go wrong. I advised the front desk clerk that we had 2 reservations back to back and asked if we would have to check in again when our first reservation was over or if we could link the 2 reservations together. The clerk advised me there was no need to come back down after our first reservation as he would tie everything together . When we checked in I was given a piece of paper to sign that confirmed the per night rate and that would be charged to my credit card. Usually I do not pay much attention and sign whatever is presented to me but something told me to read what I was signing this time. The paper showed that our room rate was now $96 a night. I quickly pointed this out to the front desk clerk and he called a manager over. The manager said I was wrong and that our rate was $96 a night. Lucky for me I was traveling with my iPad and I pulled it out and quickly pulled up my confirmation email showing the lower rate. The manager relented and said he would change the rate to reflect what I had a confirmation for. The front desk clerk then attempted to collect the resort fees from me, again the manager was called over and again put up a slight disagreement but after again reading our reservation decided that we should not be charged the fees as promised earlier. The rest of the check-in seemed to go smoothly and we were presented our room keys and a map and pointed on our way to our room. I inquired about our drinks and passes and again I got the deer in the headlight look. Back to the reservation they went and a few minutes later we received our 4 vouchers and were on our way to our room finally. The room itself was pleasant. Nothing overly fancy or tacky. We were on the 36th floor and had a nice view of some of the other hotels on the strip and the beautiful mountains to the west. We requested a king sized bed but instead received 2 queens, not a big deal or disappointment. The beds themselves were horrible! The mattress varied depending where you laid on them. On one side it was as hard as a rock, on the other side all you felt were the springs. We tried both beds and found both to be similar in comfort. Our room did have an ice maker but it did not work. I did report this to the front desk manager and she said that maintenance would come up and fix it, they never showed. The ice maker was in the weirdest place I have ever seen, in the bathroom almost up against the toilet and under the sink. I am not a germaphobe but I will say that this did weird me out a bit. If you opened the ice maker door it slammed right into the toilet. When you sat on the toilet your leg hit the ice maker. In all of my travels all over the world I have never seen anything like this. The only reason I can come up with for having the ice maker in the bathroom is for a water line and in case it leaked. I would much rather have walked down the hall and gotten my ice from a machine, it just mentally seems more sanitary to me. We did spend 2 days laying by the pool. The pool is nice but a little small. There were average lounge chairs but you did have to get there early to claim one. It was hard later in the day to find a place to lay as the deck area is not very wide and can only hold 2 rows of chairs. The pool is in shade until about 1200 and then the sun comes out over the entire area. There are also 3 hot tubs located a few steps above the pool area. The hot tubs are nice size and it was never a problem getting a seat in one. The one big disadvantage to the pool is that there is a volleyball net across the middle. It is almost impossible to swim from one end to the other as there was always a game going on. There are plenty of options for night life. We went to the Times Square dualing piano bar. If you decide to go make sure you go on Wednesday nights as there is no cover charge that night otherwise you will be paying $15 a person just to walk in the door. The crowd was nice sized and it was a fun atmosphere. The two piano players that were playing the night we were there were good. They knew almost every song requested and they interacted well with the audience. My only complaint would be for them to turn the sound down a bit. The club itself is not very large. There are several speakers mounted all over the bar. They had the sound up so loud that it distorted the music and made it hard to sometimes understand what was being said or what song was playing, I have been to this club on previous trips and have never heard the sound turned up as high as it was this time. Overall, the piano bar is a great place to have some drinks and listen to some good music. Our original 2 day reservation ended and our single night was supposed to begin on the 3rd day. As I mentioned earlier we were informed that we didn't need to do anything as our reservations were tied together. We went and had brunch at MGM Grand and returned to our room around 1230pm to find we were locked out. We tried both of our keys and found neither one worked. We went down to the front desk and stood in line for 30 minutes and were informed that our keys did work. Wrong! Once again my temper boiled. The new manager was again called over and very coldly and rudely inquired about the problem. By this time I had had enough. I respectfully and professionally spoke my opinion of the hotel to the female manager. She wanted to argue every point I made. She made it seem like there were no problems at all. We were offered a further $50 credit toward food purchase, new room keys, and were assured that our ice maker would be fixed. The ice maker was never fixed. We decided to use our food credit the last night at the America restaurant in the hotel. They have a late night special of ribeye starting at midnight. I would recommend America as a place to eat. The restaurant is large and open. Our food was good. The cut of and quality of meat were excellent. Since it was late there were not too many people in there so the service was quick and attentive. We checked out on our last morning around 1030am. The line was long but did go quickly. We were given our bill and at the bottom it should in bold faced type that there was an amount of approx $156 due. I questioned this amount and the clerk made it seem like I was asking her too many questions. I told her I didn't think the amount was correct and she kept insisting that it was and if I had any questions to call back later to dispute it. We had to get to the airport for our flight home so I decided to take the bill and leave. As we were leaving we were greeted by the female manger from the previous day. She did thank us for staying there and I informed her we would never stay there again. Once we arrived at the airport and I reviewed the bill I was still baffled at the amount charged. I called the hotel and spoke to a representative would kept insisting that it was correct that we were charged $156. I had the representative go over the numbers I was looking at and she could not come up with how they were charging $156 either once I pointed everything out to her. I was once again connected to the female manager who went over the bill. Guess what? I was actually entitled to a refund of $142. The accounting at NYNY is horrible! They use a system that even their own employees can not understand. In closing let me say that I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. We will never stay there again. Their customer service is the worst I have ever seen. I was not looking to get anything extra or for free, I only wanted what I was entitled to and promised. In my opinion the hotel is very deceitful. I do understand that mistakes happen but too many happened to us for me not to think that some of it was on purpose. I will be contacting the NV Better Business Bureau on Tuesday morning and filing a complaint. I feel this hotel does try to cheat people out of what they deserve whether it be a free drink or a room rate. My best advice to you would be to read everything before you sign and know what you are entitled to. Next time we go to Las Vegas we will be staying across the street at Excalibur where the rates are lower, the poo is larger, and the customer service soars above it's sister casino across the street.

The pool was open until 6:00 p.m. There are several good restaurants located in the NY NY complex. We liked the breakfasts at the \"Il Fornaio\" restaurant. We used the \"Buy-one-get-one free breakfast\" coupon in the NY NY coupon booklet for breakfasts at \"Il Fornaio\". We also used the 20% off NY NY coupon and ate a few good meals at the \"America\" restaurant where we had a delicious dinner that included an 8-ounce steak, crab legs, baked potato, mixed vegetables, and rolls for $14.95, which was an amazing price for Las Vegas. We also ate a good meal at \"Nine Fine Irishmen\" restaurant. We used the coupon that was in the NY NY coupon booklet for a free appetizer which was enough for four people. I'd suggest sharing entrees, since the servings were very large. The ceiling of NY NY is painted black, so the inside of the entire complex is very dark and depressing. I would prefer seeing a ceiling painted blue with while clouds or another light color. On Friday evening the casino area was very noisy due to the band playing. We had to go to a different casino due to the loud noise. The economy has surely not affected Las Vegas. The pedestrian and motorized traffic was sometimes overwhelming. Thank goodness for the upper level pedestrian walkways above the streets. We were amazed by the number of trucks that traveled up and down the strip carrying large, flat-panel advertisements for various shows, casinos, etc. I would think the high price of gas would curtail this activity. We purchased a 24-hour bus pass for $7.00 and went downtown to the \"Fremont Street Experience,\" which consisted of four blocks of Fremont Street that were covered with a 90-foot tall metal structure. A sound and light show takes place each hour starting at about 8:00 p.m. and lasts less than 10 minutes. It was quite entertaining. There were also a couple of bands playing for the crowds, and a zip line that you can ride above Fremont Street.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida", "Title": "\u201cJust Ok\u201d", "Author": "jonojemma", "ReviewID": "UR108537683", "Content": "Just got back from a week stay in vegas...NY NY Hotel has great places to eat, hmmm thats about it...I spend over $100 a night for a thurs frid night stay..Ok I get it frid is busy, our room was so FAR from the elevator it was a joke..I counted, it was 163 strides from the elevator to our room..Are you kidding me!

I immediately reported the theft to NYNY security and asked them to look at the tape from the camera in hopes that this would help reunite me with my stolen property. The man who took my report was polite and he did call \"upstairs\" to ask if they could do this. After \"upstairs\" learned I was not staying at the hotel, they refused to assist me. It was really frustrating to know that they reserve customer service only for people who are hotel guests. My friends and I made up a large group, celebrating a birthday. We were in town for 5 days. We ate in the hotel several times, rode the rollercoaster, saw Zumanity, and gambled there. We spent more there than it would cost for a room. My purse was stolen the day we were leaving, and getting home was a huge hassle due to having no ID, which was also stolen.

Staff was great, and processed us very efficiently. We spent most of our days out at the pool & we were very impressed with the way the hotel allows ONLY the pool guests into the pool area unlike other strip hotels. Again, another plus .... hotel guests could only save their pool lounges for other guests for a period of 30 minutes (signs posted & enforced) unlike other strip hotels where guests come into the pool area, leave towels & belongings on the lounges, then leave the pool area and do not return until later in the day. This way everyone gets the use of a pool lounge.

The wireless internet worked well on our Iphone during our stay. Our room faced the Monte Carlo hotel and we used the Chrystler elevators just off the food area. It was a good \"ward\" of the hotel; close the food and not a far walk to the casino floor. We looked at the pool but did not swim. We did not try the rollercoaster. We did not visit the clubs. We saw Zumanity, the show showing at NYNY previously so we did not see it again. We ate at the pizza place. broadway burger; which was good (onion rings not so good), breakfast at Il Fornaio twice (it was yummy, good service on the patio). We enjoyed walking to the nearby hotels and visiting those casinos too. We went to the Luxor two mornings to play in the \"cheap\" ($35) poker tournament and one morning to the Monte Carlo to play theirs. NYNY does NOT have a poker room but the hotels around it do so no biggie. You do not get MLife points (or whatever they're called) for playing poker (excpt at Aria, so we're told), so it didn't matter where we played poker. At NYNY the casino area was VERY loud at night (until about 2 or 3am) with all the bars in the hotel with their different kinds of music playing loudly. But during the day, or quieter times, it's a very enjoyable casino to play in, high ceilings so the smoke doesn't bother you too much. Servers offering drinks on a regular basis (tipped $1 each time). The \"rapid roulette\" is fun (and pretty cheap at $2.50 min a go). We got very fair comps from NYNY (at least we thought they were) for the amount of time we felt we played with the MLife card at the various MGM family hotels. We got all of our food comp'ed (including a meal we ate at Monte Carlo) and our resort fees so we only ended up paying for our hotel nights, which was fine b/c we had planned to pay for those anyway.

With so many hotels to chose from we used Trip Advisor to find the one best suited to us. In the end we ended up choosing between three middle of the range hotels. The New York New York, Planet Hollywood and the Golden Nugget. In the end we chose the New York New York. We flew from Dublin to Chicago and then from Chicago to Las Vegas. We got a taxi from the airport to our hotel for less than $20.00. It takes less than ten minutes to get to the strip from the airport too which is great. We arrived at the New York New York and walked across the casino to the check in counter. We were in our room and all with 5 minutes. We booked a package trip with a local tour operator and so our room was pre selected. We had a Broadway Deluxe room. It was pretty basic and a little dated. There were no upgrades available and so we didn't end up with a good view (some of these rooms have a view of the strip). To be honest we were not that bothered as we didn't plan on spending much time in the room. The hotel itself is amazing. The sheer size of all of the hotels on the strip takes some getting use to. Each one seems to try and out do the next which is great for the visitor! We were four days in Vegas and we were still only getting use to our hotel. The ground floor consists of the casino, a good nightclub, replica New York streets and multiple quality restaurants. The upper floor has shops and a disco bar (Coyote Ugly). The top level is where you get the roller coaster which you have to do if you are staying here. The pool area is small enough but well kept and a nice place to relax for a bit. The place is spotless and all the staff are very helpful and friendly. The hotel is ideally located at the southern end of the strip. There's the Mandalay Bay, then Luxor and then the New York New York. Directly opposite is the MGM Grand. As you walk north you come across the rest of the famous hotels, such as the Bellagio, Caesars Palace, The Venetian etc. Bring good walking shoes as there is so much to see and do here. The weather as you would expect was lovely and fresh in the day (not too hot) and nice and cool at night. A trip to downtown Vegas is highly recommended. It takes about ten minutes in a taxi and costs about $15 - $20. This is where the Golden Nugget hotel and the famous Fremont Street are located. Its much smaller than the strip and easier to get around, but there is still a lot to see and do here. Its also much better value for money. Two beers in most places on the strip were costing us between $12 - $14 which is not cheep. The food is a little pricey on the strip too, but they way we were looking at it was they put so much effort into the premises and service you don't mind paying a bit extra. The way they light up Fremont Street at night is also work a look. The hotel and everything about Vegas exceeded our expectations. The whole place is so clean, friendly and trouble free. Despite it being a 24 hour non stop city we never seen any hint of excessive drinking or trouble of any sort. You could easily bring kids here and have a good time (as long as they could manage the long flights). When I booked this I said it would be a once in a lifetime holiday, after this holiday I can definitely say that I will be back in Vegas sooner rather than later.

We booked the hotel over the phone a few days before the time, while in USA, and everything was done smoothly, efficiently and when we arrived at the hotel, our booking was in order and our room ready. The hotel clerk offered us various upgrade options which we declined (we were just going to sleep there afterall) but then he still upgraded us from a Standard Room to a Park View Room (not sure what the difference is...) which was nice of him. It was on the 16th floor which was a bit of a bummer as the free wifi signal was slow and intermittend - we got a much better signal on the ground level. Also, the \"park view\" was a view over a parking lot at the back of the hotel. It was a bit of a drag having to queue up to book in - there was quite a queue and after 1000's of km's on the road we were just wanting to get to our room, take a shower and veg out. This was not the situation only at NYNY though - we previously stayed at Excalibur and the same thing there. Queue and wait your turn... The room was spacious and clean. The furnishings and linen was in an almost new condition. The King size bed was HUGE! The bathroom was a bit cramped, but it had a bathtub as well as a shower, which was welcome. Our handcreams and goodies were replenished every day and our room cleaned to look like new again. We had more than enough towels, although they were quite small. In spite of the lack of a view, we had no complaints about the room. Although it lacked personal service, the hotel is well maintained and staff responded very quickly en efficiently to any requests. (One late night when we returned to our room, someone was sick in the hallway and hubby called the reception desk to let them know. Within 10 minutes, they were up there, washing the carpet). I guess it is difficult to get that personal touch in Vegas with so many thousands of people in the various hotels at any one time, but we still felt very well looked after. The NYNY is good value for money, although not the cheapest of the hotels. The Americana restaurant is open 24/7 and serve good meals at good prices, and always with a smile. Very few hotels actually offer free wifi internet (free internet does not equal free wifi internet - most of them are dial up for which you need a cable linked to a laptop). The free internet at NYNY is wifi and although we had a dodgy connection most of the time, we could go down to the ground floor, have a drink and surf the net. It was not super-fast, but not too bad either. When you stay at the NYNY you almost would not need to leave your hotel (if it was not for so many other attractions outside the doors!) The Bar at Times Square has a lively vibe for old & young alike. At some of the places in Vegas, you tend to feel a bit out of place if you're on the wrong side of 40, but this pub was just lovely. At the one night we were there, they had two guys playing pianos (two pianos head to head) and would play & sing any requests, obvisouly, like everything else in Vegas, at a generous tip - the higher your tip, the more likely they'd get to your request and the highest tip wins the closing song. After a few too many, someone paid $60 for the closing song which I can not even remember the name of. Between songs, the two guys would do a few comedy stints and even made fun of the songs they were signing. It was great entertainment, and everyone joined in the singing -even got up dancing! We did not want to leave, but had a show to go to. I'm not even going to try and comment on the decor - it was just brilliant (like all the resort hotels on the strip).

I booked this hotel b/c the price difference was significantly lower than MB and I had a large number of family members meeting us out there. I have to say that I was not entirely impressed with the hotel. Just be prepared - this hotel is noisy. If you book a room at this hotel, you need to decide what type of background noise you prefer - rollercoaster and screaming or a helicopter flying extremely close to your window. The NyNy hotel is quite impressive so there are constant helicopter tours flying close to and around the entire resort. The roller coaster is constantly going so you have to combine the noise of the actual rollercoaster plus the noise of the passengers screaming. Needless to say, we stayed on the 29th floor in NYA and ended up with the pleasure of both noises. I'm not a fussy traveler and I'm from NJ so it really didn't bother me but it did upset a lot of my other travelers who were not used to hustle and bustle. That being said, the pool has both so there is no relaxing poolside. The restaurants/bars at NyNy were FANTASTIC. The NY pizza restaurant was fabulous and not overpriced. The Japanese buffet had one of the best breakfast buffets I had ever eaten with an odd combination of egg foo young and fresh fruit. Il Fornio was a little fancier but the menu was a typical menu of an Italian Ny bistro. The Irish Pub was fantastic and has an outdoor eating area where you can still hear the live music. The only complaint I had with regards to any of the restaurants/bars was the atrocious sound of the singer at the dueling piano bar. I don't know what favor this hotels owes him in order for him to stay employed. I couldn't drink enough for him to sound decent. Nonetheless, it added another memory to the trip! :) Rok was also a very good nightclub and is highly recommended. NyNy is centrally located and is in walking distance to almost everything. ***Very Important - do not buy anything from NyNy's concierge desk!!!!! We wanted to go see Cirque du soleil's KA. We went to the concierge and they told us that it was $ 170.00 pp for these not so great seats. My husband whipped out his iPad and the tickets were $ 60 online and also available at the MGM concierge. For better seats, we bought the tickets for $ 60. Sidenote - 'KA' IS A MUST SEE!!! If you do anything in Vegas, see this show! Another Side note: I was planning this trip for a large family vacation and was very excited to see this hotel listed for $65pn. I booked a large amount of rooms and upon arrival, I learned that the hotel charges a 'resort fee' of $15 per room per night. This is a mandatory fee so make sure you are aware of this. It was my own fault that I did not read the fine print but ended up dropping an unexpected additional $ 60 for a 4 night package upon arrival.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Bend, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cTypical Las Vegas Hotel\u201d", "Author": "smonroe13", "ReviewID": "UR106503469", "Content": "I came to New York New York for my Wedding/Honeymoon We have reserved a Spa Suite about 4 months before our trip.

Ok, so I'm a dinosaur...I have grown out of the gambling craze and usually go to Vegas with my wife or family just to get out of town and take a break. But I am one of those people who like to \"watch people\" more than spend money. I do not get as much thrill out of gambling these days as I do in watching other people go by or try their luck at the tables, slots or other diversion to be enjoyed. It's true that if you don't play you can't win. But it is just a certain that if you don't play you can't loose! I accompany my wife during her winning trips or dues paying trips to \"sin city\" as a reward for still working so hard during every other day or hours to make a living and I enjoy spending my time contemplating everyone that passes by. I am fascinated by all the various nationalities, sizes, actions, interactions, looks, interest, characteristics, attitudes and on and on. So what do I do for fun in Vegas, for relaxation and to come home with a pleasant memory? I go to the spas at each and every hotel that we stay in. And , for an hour or two I experience from beginning to end the wonder of being treated very well\u2026VERY WELL\u2026for very little cost. At having my own private or semi-private Steam Room, Dry Sauna, Jacuzzi, Shower, and special place to relax and ponder life or just unwind. All while getting some health benefits out of it and simply relaxing my cares and troubles away. Since I found this holistic therapeutic nirvana, this great tension reliever\u2026and \"happy place\" and since I made the decision that I was going to take mental notes, absorb, evaluate and review each one. I have visited three in the Vegas area. Oh, sure I have gone to others in the past in Reno, Tahoe and elsewhere and probably even in Vegas. But that was some time ago and this is a new venture and a new enterprise and with the scarcity of visitors I have encounter at these wonderful places. I feel someone should reintroduce people to them and/or spread the great news about them. One has to begin somewhere so I am starting with my last three, most recent, visits. I believe in the KISS principle of Keep It Simple Stupid...so I will use these evaluation tools. 1- Great 2- Very Good 3- Good STAR POWER ** Places Visited to Date: Orleans MGM Grand New York, New York New York, New York SPA \u2013 Positives \u2013 All Spas are great places \u2013 but here are a few Pros & Cons Pros: Easy access, 1 $10.00 to use if you are staying at the casino 1 Located near the pool 1 Located off the gym 1 Service 1 Locking System Digital Snacks & Amenities 1 Sandals 1 Towels 1 Showers 1 Cons: Size 3 Feeling of Privacy (your happy place) 3 Floor Plan 3 Storage for gear 2 Attitude of Staff 2 Dry Sauna 2 Wet Sauna 2 Evaluation \u2013 For the price you cannot beat this one\u2026it is as with \u201cevery spa experience\u201d I have had over the last year or so...a good one overall\u2026and a great way to pamper yourself for an hour or so. After you follow the signs to the Spa you enter the office, are greeted, sign in, pay, walk through another door, turn left through a small portion of the gym facility turn another corner and enter the Spa area, were you are greeted by someone who will take your receipt, give you a pair of sandals, show you the lockers and how to work the locking mechanism and explain the facility. After that you are free to roam and enjoy as long as you like and return if you so desire or if you have the inclination. The floor plan here is pretty simple and smaller than the other two i have visited. The dry sauna, wet sauna, restrooms and showers are right next to the entry and attendants desk (which is why a # 3 for floor plan) which does not give you that inner or personal sense of being in \u201cyour\u201d private space but more like being exposed to him/them and other entering new visitors, during most of your Spa experience. I would put that reception area out in the weightroom to provide the autonomy most people like if it were me. Further back are the lockers, mirrors, TV area and snacks and furthest back still is the Jacuzzi; which do offer more autonomy to the spa-surfers. All the other amenities for hygienic issues are there for use in the showers, changing and sink areas. The dry sauna was not quite hot enough as when you are in there you want to have it rolling off you body, but it was clean and acceptable. The wet sauna automatically regenerated itself but the benches/seats were lower than usual and kept you beneath the real wet heat that is most people want when using a sauna. All in all however, as I said earlier, all spa experiences are something to be enjoyed and savored and I certainly enjoyed this one and highly recommend its use. Yet in the big picture evaluation of the three I have enjoyed so far this New York, New York experience would fall 3rd or 3.

Only 3 people and I was at the desk in minutes. The clerk was very friendly and answered all my questions with a smile. I asked how much to upgrade from a spa suite to the Marquis and it was $20 a night. Big deal. The same room I had here would cost me $500 a night at home in Vancouver. A bargain. Great room. clean colorful huge comfortable and quiet. The hotel itself is a good location to explore the south end of the strip. Good overpasses and some trams at neighbouring hotels which make it quite easy to get around. As mentioned I did not spend a lot of time here but I did try the Black and Blue burger at Broadway shortly after arriving and it was delicious. I am going to have another. I did not go to the pool. I can do that anytime anyplace so it is not a big attraction for me. And why go to a crowded hot tub when you have one in your living room? I am 50 and did not really want to spend a bunch of time with the 20 somethings. My only complaint - and it is a minor one - is one night after lots of walking I was looking for a quiet place to unwind and spend a few bucks on the slots. I could not find an empty bar seat anywhere. It was spring break so I guess that was to be expected. Busy all over town. Anyways, I was very happy with my choice of hotels.

Secondly the facilities are also perfect. People have complained that there are no tea and coffee making facilities - but why do you need them when there is a Costa IN THE HOTEL. Every morning, my husband would pop down and get a coffee and Earl Grey Tea - perfect. The room was lovely and we were on the 34th floor. Did not have a strip view but that was not a problem because you have a fantastic view as far as the eye can see. The room was kept spotless. The Casino, and the New York street effect are just fab. Yes, the Casino looks dated but I think its trying to be that 'seedy New York' style and worked well. The restaurants and bars are fab too. Neither of us smoke and I thought that this would be a problem - but because the ceilings in the Casino's etc are so high, and the air conditioning is so good you did not even notice. We requested a non-smoking room and that is what we got. No problems checking in or out. We were offered an upgrade to Broadway Delux for an extra \u00a310 per night which we took.

We wanted a reasonably priced themed hotel on the strip. Arrival We took a taxi from the airport, plenty waiting outside. It cost $14 (without tip) and took about 5-10 minutes. We asked him to go via Tropicana Avenue as we heard they try to go via the tunnel which costs more. Location The location of the hotel is not right in the centre, probably about a 15/20 minute walk to Caesars Palace. It\u2019s opposite the MGM Grand, M&M World, Coca Cola shop and The Hard Rock Cafe. Hotel The hotel is huge, lots of bars and restaurants, casino, amusements, shops, swimming pool, events desk. It was a very clean hotel and even though smoking is permitted inside it didn\u2019t really smell of smoke. There is a resort fee of about $13 a day, apparently this is for use of the swimming pool and internet of which we used neither. We knew this before we went so were expecting it but I still think it\u2019s a con as not all hotels charge it. Room Our room (2262) had a view of the strip to the left and the MGM to the front. It was a nice sized room with 2 very comfortable queen beds. There was a television, safe, ironing board, iron, hair dryer and alarm clock. A downside was there were no tea & coffee facilities or a fridge/mini bar in the room, however there were vending machines just down the hall. There was an adequate amount of storage space. There were a few toiletries provided in the bathroom. The room had climate controls which were easy to use and efficient. Food & Drink There\u2019s a New York pizza place upstairs, ideal for a snack after coming back from a night out. Plenty of other places to eat, all looked pretty good. Drinks inside aren\u2019t cheap, same as the other hotels. Little kiosks outside the hotel sell ice cold beers for $5 each which you can take inside. Staff The staff at the reception desk were very welcoming and polite as were most of the hotel staff. Some of the croupiers and bar staff could be a bit rude but again this was typical of most of the hotels on the strip. Miscellaneous - The roller coaster in the hotel was excellent, $14 each but well worth it. - Bellagio fountain show was excellent, starts after 3pm. - We watched the volcano show at the Mirage at 11pm then went next door to Treasure Island, their show starts soon after at 11.30pm. - We went to The Wynn for a champagne buffet after our friends wedding. It was about $65 each but was excellent quality. - The \u201cwelcome to fabulous Las Vegas\u201d sign is about a 25 minute walk down the strip from the hotel.

The restaurant America was awesome, we drank momosa's in the morning with eggs benedict - delicious!! And failry priced. The pizza joint is also great and quick. CONS: Security is at a minimum. In all the other hotels I have stayed in, you needed to show a card to get to the elevator - there was no security on any of the nights we went out and came back and I ran into two young girls on our floor who had got out of the elevator and been followed by some guy who tried to follow them to their room. Another CON, the room was not clean - our room was at the part where the rollercoaster goes up the hill and we could barely see it because the windows were filthy, the edges of the room were filthy with dust build up and on day two I had to chase down house cleaning to give us clean cups and towels - they seemed annoyed. The staff tried to upcharge the last group that came in and when they declined, they gave it to them for free anyways - nice jesture but just a note to take if you are going out there. The bathrooms are not the 'Vegas' bathrooms I have seen at the other hotels I have stayed at. We took the deuce down to Freemont, then realized on our way back that it was cheaper to take a limo back with our group. HIGHLY recommend ziplining through Freemont - what an amazing experience for under twenty bucks. It was my first evening experience on Freemont and I would not recommend going by yourself - it is very entertaining, but a little shadey. We celebrated the bday dinner at Houe of Blues and enjoyed great food, great service and awesome blues music. We were sad that we missed them singing Happy Bday as we had to leave to get to the next event. There are SO many things to do in Vegas and NYNY was a great location, especially for first timers as it was on the four corners of Tropicana, Excalibur and MGM. I don't think I would go back to NYNY as I did not find there was anything really special about it that made me feel like my stay was appreciated. The security and cleanliness was an issue for me too...had I been looking for a romantic weekend away, I would suggest MGM. I did use the gym and it served its purpose. It overlooked the pool, which was empty, so I assume work was being done on it (resort fee was charged).", "Date": "April 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cThe Kids were entertained at the Huge Arcade while we gambled\u201d", "Author": "tripmakerNtaker", "ReviewID": "UR103340006", "Content": "We enjoyed everything at this hotel from the choice of restaurants to the entertainment for kids.

We were 15 minutes before 12pm and they went through the entire booking before they told us they were charging us the extra money. Apparently 12pm is check in time without getting charged. Thirdly, we asked for two queen beds in our room. When we got to our room it was a single king. Not a huge deal but a little annoying after the two previous incidents. Fourth thing was we had called down to guest services the afternoon before to get a late check out. Of course that was another $20. Then the last day as we were getting ready in our room the cleaning ladies came into our room! Aside from the \"pleas don't disturb\" on the outside of door shouldnt guest services had let them know about late check outs?

We ate at the hotel most evenings and although a little expensive at some places the quality of food was very good, and if your looking to save money just accross the road there are loads of fast food places such as Mcdonalds, burger king, subway etc... The pubs and clubs at the hotel are also really good only downside to the coyote ugly bar was there was no toilet inside the club and you would have to venture downstairs to the casino for this and if your like me when you've had a few beers this turns into a frequent occurrence and kind of spoils the night. The nine fine irishman well what can i say a truly good pub with an amazing atmosphere, they had a fundraising event while i was there to raise money for childrens cancer (St Baldricks day) and this just showed the hotel's spirit and generosity.

When we got there, the self parking is adequate, very quick walk to the hotel and registration. They didn't have a room for us, so they bumped us up from the Park Avenue Room to what they call an upgraded room to a Broadway Room. There was no difference between the two other than the decor. Well we got to our room, it was okay in size, very drafy, the bathroom was something out of the 1980s, brass EVERYWHERE. We called to complain that the shower was a little small (being tall and all) and they said that for an additional $78.00 per night we can upgrade, well we decided not to, because that was more than what our deal was and wasnt worth it.

Her exact words were \"Here are 4 drink coupons PER ROOM for the ROK club\" and then she waived our resort fee. However, after waiving the fee she took our resort coupon book back that had coupons for restaurants and shops and only gave us 4 drink coupons total and not 4 per room.

The people next to us weren't loud in any way, just talking with one another, so it startled me. I didn't stroll into our room until the wee hours of the night, so the neighbors being up at a normal hour, forced me to wake up earlier that I would have liked. But the room was very nice other than that and the casino was a lot of fun. We ate at some of the small restaurants there in the hotel and all of those were good. Overall I really enjoyed our stay here, just wish the walls were a bit thicker in the rooms. I was traveling with a friend so we were there to party so it wasn't too bad.

The driving access is easy, on Tropicana and right off I-15. Our room was in the Park Avenue section, which is very easy access off the main lobby by the casino section. We liked that the casino is there, but you aren't forced into it at every turn as in some Vegas hotels. What we loved best was the \"Village Street\" section, which is really the food court but laid out as a street scape (a bit like Main Street at Disneyland - but all indoors!). There are \"sidewalk\" tables everywhere so you get what you want and find a table that suits you. We tended to sit near the Times Square piano bar in the evening because you could hear the music. The piano bar itself is half seating --which must be reserved and paid for -- and half standing. Standing is free, and actually the better spot if you get into the music and want to dance. Starting at 8pm, pairs of players/singers switch off regularly in what is supposed to be a sing-along atmosphere, but we found some pairs more entertaining than others. (So if you don't like what you're hearing, wander back later -- it may be different!) The \"street\" area is also a fun place to people watch for the crowds going to/leaving from the \"Zumanity\" show. New York-New York also has sit-down restaurants. We had dinner at Gallagher's. Filet mignon was $40, so comparable to a good steakhouse price where we come from (Phoenix). The place is much bigger than it looks, fortunately, because the front rooms were very noisy but we were seated in a quieter back room. We also had breakfast at America, which we really liked. The food was good at a fair price and the service was good and personable as well. This too is a much bigger room than you would guess from the lobby. The hotel is well-located for accessing the other hotels at the south end of the Strip. We walked to the Monte Carlo across the street to get the free monorail to the Bellagio. This isn't well-publicized and is a bit of a walk through the Monte Carlo, but was easy access at the Bellagio. New York-New York does seem to have \"room\" issues. After reading things here, I called the night before to be sure we had a nonsmoking, one king (vs two queens) room, but when we checked in it was as if I hadn't called. We wound up with a nonsmoking two queen on the 34th floor, which we were happy with.

We walked down the strip one day and took us an hour to get to Caesars Palace and by that time we were tired and drunk from drinking while walking in the blaring heat and just headed back. We paid quite a bit in cab fares heading out to clubs at night because cabs won't stop on the strip and insist on taking back roads which takes longer.

Also, we lived off of room service which was actually really good food and reasonably priced. We would just leave our food cart in the hallway when we were done and it would be gone in no time! The hotel wasn't bad, there was definitely a lot to see, but it was too far from the centre of the action.

The casino is a bit small, but it's more than made up for by other amenities, such as several excellent restaurants, a live piano bar, a great nightclub, the Zumanity show, and other amenities such as Crispy Creme, Starbucks, Il Fornaio cafe & restaurant, etc. It's a 5 minute walk next door to Monte Carlo where you can catch the free tram to City Center hotels or Bellagio. We also spotted Bill and Giuliana Rancic walking by while we ate dinner at Gallagher's, so \"celebrities\" apparently frequent this place as well. My only complaint is a minor one, which was a room service table with half-eaten food left outside our door for 2 days, but they promptly discounted my room for the inconvenience.

Between myself and my boyfriend, we spent about 100 CND on food/drinks and coffee for the day, which we were both feeling crappy about eating fast food all day. On the second day, we decided to go over to Excalibur for their Buffet (Roundtable Buffet -$25 for the whole day), we went over there at about 7am and they gave us a wristband and we kept coming back all day, it was well worth it and the food exceeded my expectations. We ended up going back on our last day as well! Another thing I looked at was the age group of the people writing the reviews, so Im 27, I dont Party or Gamble. This hotel has something for everyone.

I let the check-in guy know that I had booked a king bed almost 2 months ahead of time, and he actually got annoyed with me and went on a spiel about how they don't guarantee anything when I book. After I started getting annoyed myself he finally told us we could have the wheelchair accessible room, which had a King sized bed, and the only difference was it had railings in the bathtub. Fine. Also, 2 nights in a row around 6pm, we had hotel staff walk right into our room without knocking. Even though the room was already clean. We went straight down to the front desk and he let us know that sometimes management comes to inspect the rooms to ensure they've been cleaning properly. Thankfully it never happened again after that.

The parking is free but remember where you parked. On parking up we couldn't find where to check in straight away as there are so many entrances. There was a big queue at checking in and checking out too. Beware of the compulsory daily fee per day per room (around 12 USD). But this applies to most hotels in Vegas. Supposedly covers the wi-fi, which is handy. The room is spacious, could easily fit a third double bed. The room did smell a bit smokey though and you can hear the roller coaster until it shuts at 11pm. The casinos are much of a muchness compared with all the other hotels. The spa facilities looked nice but unfortunately the jacuzzi was only available for the males to use??!! They also cost extra so better to use the other nearby hotel's facilities - similar price but better than NYNY. I recommend that you plan which shows you want to see before you decide which hotel to stay in as Vegas is so big, that we only saw half of it in 4 days. So make sure you can get to the show easily. Hotels normally have discounted tickets for their guests. The roller coaster is good but is 14 USD per person per ride. The arcades nearby are also fun and we did manage to win an ipod. If you like shopping, stay in the Venetian or Caesars. Not really close to NYNY. But the out of town shopping is better and is a short cab ride away. Great choice of restaurants for snacks/dinner but not if you want a breakfast buffet. The Coyote Ugly bar and the clubs are definitely worth a visit. Free champagne for ladies from 10 to midnight :) There are excursions to the Grand Canyon although they are not cheap. Approx 350 GBP for a helicopter ride, 250GBP for light aircraft/helicopter.

I thought the coaster noise would be bad, but it was never a problem. I also had huge spotlights a few floors down that lit up my room at night!! Didn't have to worry about having the curtains open, though, because I wasn't really into my parking garage view. As far as cleanliness, it wasn't bad except for the fact there were men's hairs around the back of the sink. It looked like he had been shaving and the maids never cleaned it properly. There was also a cigarette burn in the comforter (in a non smoking room), but I will admit there was NO cigarette smell in the room OR on the 8th floor!! On my 3rd day there, I had forgotten to put my diamond stud earrings in. I returned to the room between gambling and the Superbowl, only to find that the glass they had been placed in, was GONE. I had specifically placed the glass with my other (cheap) jewelry on the side of the bathroom counter, with the necklace draped around the glass. I freaked out and ran out to find the maid, who was down the hall. She played stupid for awhile and showed me a cart full of dirty glasses, and pointed to all the \"dirty\" ones to show that my earrings weren't there. After about 5 minutes, I made her show me the glasses in her cleaning cart (where she already looked) and I found them still in the glass. I visited the spa and had a facial (traffic stopper) and massage (pure bliss). The facial was WONDERFUL, but the massage was nothing to write home about. There was also a steam room, dry sauna, showers, and beverages available. I absolutely LOVE the casino and that is the reason why I will stay there again! There is a good variety of slots, and the tables are WONDERFUL. All of the dealers were wonderful (minus one). It's nice to go to a casino year after year and see the same dealers, and have those same dealers remember you. There seems to be a lot of loyalty to that casino with the dealers. Many of them have told me they have been there since day one, and intend on staying there until they retire. Pit bosses are great as well (especially John, Oliver and Jackie) and do their job well. I visited many of the MGM-linked casinos on this trip (and prior trips) and this casino was by far the best. I also didn't mind getting to watch the Buckeyes game while playing poker! Was given free admission to Rok and Coyote Ugly. Never cared for CU and this trip was no different. This was my first time in Rok and it was very small, but had decent music. I'm not into rap, hip hop, techno or r&b so I guess that's why the music didn't much bother me. There was some of that mixed in, but there was a lot of rock/old school stuff also. Not a bad club if you aren't really the \"club\" type, but unless you are in a VIP there is no place to sit. If you're looking for luxury, this probably isn't the place for you. Try Aria.

The TV in our room did not work right from the start we only got certain channels called has maintenance come it but nothing changed still only got a couple channels. The front desk personel were wonderful when we checked and checked out and they gave great customer service. The ring was mother's who is deceased so had sentimental value also. The fact no one has contacted me makes it 10 times worse. As much as we have enjoyed staying here in the past and have recommended NYNY to others I will make sure to not recommend or stay again.

When we found out about the road closures in & out of the Strip, we went to the reservation desk the day before to see if we could get a room for just the one night. There was no way to get one night on line, but we were told we could by calling. We paid a fortune for one night, $295 plus tax, etc for a Broadway room. It was so worth it for the one time we will do NYE in Vegas. Our view was of the Statue of Liberty, Mandalay Bay, the Luxor and Excalibur. The room was small, as was the bath counter for makeup, etc, but I managed. We were able to go back and forth to the room several times during the day and evening for changing clothes, etc. Also, noise free zone! We heard one person's voice from the hallway, one time, the entire time we were in the room! Zumanity was incredible! Very baudy, adult entertainment, and just loved it! Dinner at Il Fornaio was a terrible disappointment. We ate on the patio and that was nice. Our waiter could have cared less about making our dinner enjoyable. When our salads came, he put mine in front of me, and handed my husband's salad to him. There was no offer of cracked pepper, although we saw him offer it to other diners. He also didn't offer it with the entree, and he saw my husband struggling with the pepper shaker. When he brought the olive oil for the bread, he did not include the vinegar, but he did at other tables. The menu was limited for the evening, not the normal menu. The prices were also higher than normal. We were in and out in 28 minutes, feeling very rushed. $97 for 2 salads, 1 glass of wine, 1 bourbon and 2 entrees.

We wanted a good midlevel room with a king size bed. The first thing we noticed when we walked into our room was that it was NOT the room we ordered, in fact it was a dirty, double queen sized bed room. I called reception and they could not care less. I asked for the manager to complain and she told me she started to blame Expedia. I could not believe she did not care that she shafted us on the room. All she offered was a smoking room with a king size bed. Both my wife and I are non smokers. I told her I was pissed off, but she continued to blame Expedia. What Expedia has to do with New York/ New York has to do with falsely representing their rooms on their own website is beyond me. So we were forced to stay put. Next the internet did not work althought this is advertised. The TV was from the nineties and the Ipod player did not work either. As we walked outside our room to go for dinner we noticed a cart with dirty dishes and half eaten food. Believe it or not that cart and other trays on our floor were left there till Sunday night and in fact were never removed during our 48 hr stay. On Sunday I went to ask a question at the reception desk regarding a shuttle, the girl working there despite not having any customers in front of her ordered me to stay in line until she calls me, despite the fact that there were NO other customers.

This time with 3 friends, one of which celebrated his big 40 on the Saturday of our stay. Once again NYNY did the business so I have stayed loyal to them and already booked flights and hotel for October 2011 with the same group of guys. I do believe us Brits in the most part set our sights slightly lower in regards to their expectancies for 4 and 5 star hotels in comparison to our U.S. friends but for my stay I am sure the most critical of traveller would have had no complaints about our treatment and service from the hotel and all its staff. Room was superb with great views and cleaned daily with no intrusion from the staff at any time and as usual if you do have a lie in they call to confirm you want the room cleaning when you head off for the day. We once more enjoyed all the hotel has to offer. The 40th celebration dinner was in Chin-Chin and we enjoyed great, friendly service which was matched by the quality of the food. Later we had a table booked at The Bar At Times Square for a good old knees up and the musicians/singers ensured the 40th birthday boy had a night to remember. It costs $25 each for a table but you do get waitress service and sit right next to the pianos and see close up the talents of the musicians. They did a 'job' on the birthday boy which was great fun. Everytime I have visited this bar it has always been full of people determined to have a real go and let their hair down with nothing but fun in the air. We ate at the new Sporting House Sports Bar, Gallaghers, Nine Fine Irishmen during our stay as well as the other fast food areas and I have to say all were excelllent value. My favourite bar in the world is the Nine Fine Irishmen and many a good night has been had here with great food and drink and a live band to match. The hotel has definetly livened up its casino floor in recent years with the Centre Bar and louder music and this year included dancers over some of the tables. This to me is targeting a younger more vibrant crowd and although not a teenager anymore I still like a bit of life in a place and for the more reserved there is still plenty of choices down the strip for the cocktails and piano lounge folk. One piece of advice to newbies is definetly take out a Players Club Membership if you are doing any gambling at all. If not you miss out on some very generous comps. I didn't bother with this for my first 4 trips but believe me it is worth it. I have a Casino Host (Chase) who has been brilliant in taking care of my rooms for the last 4 trips and is always there if needed during your stay or if you have any questions or requirements prior to leaving for Vegas. You also have a dedicated check-in/out area. Finally I must mention the bar Pour 24. Through my regular visits I have got to know the staff quite well and I recommend this bar for a chilled out drink at anytime of the day and night. It looks down on the casino and I have spent many happy hour talking with Heather the night shift bar maid who always makes me feel like a returning long term friend when I arrive each year. Which indeed she has now become. To me Vegas opens its arms and doors to every traveller and it's upto that traveller to embrace that and dive in.

The valets also did a great job as far as getting our car in a timely manner and giving directions. Both were tipped well for the service. The only restaurant we ate at in the hotel was America. They had a nice midnight special steak dinner for around $12.00 I think. The dueling pianos at the bar at times square was fun, also had some drinks at Pour 24. We did the roller coaster and had a blast. The casino was just alright to us. All in all I would put NY NY at the high end average.

We chose New York New Yorkas our hotel because we wanted to stay in someplace that is upscale and chic, but without having to break the bank per night. We could have easily booked Imperial Palace, but because this was my first time in Vegas, I wanted to arrive and leave with a good first impression, so I suggested that we find someplace that's a little more modern and not so run down. We booked the hotel room online directly through the website, because we were able to get an online promotion code where for an additional $5, we were able to get an upgrade to the Premium view, where we could see the Las Vegas strip. We came in on Monday, during the week of Remembrance/Veterans Day, so it wasn't too busy nor did it take too long to wait in line to check in, albeit with only two check in clerks working at the desk. Nevertheless, the staff at the front desk and bell hops were very friendly and helpful and accommodating to make our check in process as smooth as possible, and they were also very flexible to allow us to check out of our room at 11am and still able to leave our bags with the bell hop so that we could enjoy our last full day in Vegas and still get our bags later when it was time to head to the airport. We also got a free coupon book for a complimentary cocktail per person and a free newspaper, and for a discount on shopping. The coupon book is the one area that they can improve on, as in the past I've received well over $200 worth of coupons when i stayed at the Rio Hotel and Casino in Macau over two years ago. My breakfasts were well covered for 4 days and I also received about $50 to $100 worth of gambling coupons for the tables and the slots. However that was when I got a double upgrade from economy to super deluxe at that hotel. The room we stayed in was the Park Avenue Premium suite, with two queen sized beds. I recommend booking it online directly through the website, (there is a resort fee, but you do get some amenities such as high speed internet and using the hotel fitness centre) and if you sign onto New York New York's email list, you can get your online promo codes that you can use to get your room discounts and special upgrades for your room. We had a direct view of the MGM Grand across the street and also down below where M&M's World and the Coke store is, but as far as the rest of the strip, because NYNY is on the south end of the strip, most of the view you can see however, is only to the south towards the Tropicana and McCarran International Airport. The room is clean and neat in appearance, it has a closet for your jackets, ironing board, electronic safe for your valuables, an iPod clock radio (I had issues at first trying to shut off the alarm at 1:30 am, but figured it out), and the TV was also in the same pantry as the closet. Not much for TV channel selection, other than just what we needed for catching the weather, the local news, and the events channel on what to do and where to go in Vegas, and the in room pay per view movies. But then again, we did not come out to Las Vegas just to watch TV either when there was lots of things to do out in town. The bathroom floor and tiles have a nice, light glossy marble grey finish, and the bathroom sink counter has a beige white matte finish on the surface, with stainless steel faucets in the sink and shower, a low consumption flush toilet, and with energy saving compact fluorescent light bulbs (health hazard or not, is still debatable in my book). All the soaps, shampoos and lotions have a nice, ginger orange scent to them, and the bar of shower soap has some nice massaging beads on the surface. The queen size bed was comfortable, although it did have the slight sag on the edge where it feels like your going to roll onto the floor, but otherwise very comfy and cozy. The room temperature controls were a bit finicky to adjust to the happy medium between warm and cool, as it was only seasonal to slightly below average for Las Vegas weather, but otherwise sunny throughout the week. The only other one complaint on my first night stay other than the unexpected alarm clock going off at 1:30 am was being awakened at 2:30 am an hour later by the night construction crew doing a building implosion of an old section of the Tropicana across the street. This is no fault of NYNY by any means, nor is this anything they can control, but to the construction crew across the street, PLEASE, please save that for the daytime. Not everyone in Vegas is always away partying onto the wee hours of the morning, especially for those who have travelled far and wide to Las Vegas. Outside of that, however, the next two nights, I've slept like a baby. The location of New York New York is essential and convenient as well for shopping and transit. The MGM Grand was right across the street from us from where we stayed, as well we had close proximity to M&M's World and the Coca-Cola store, and also to easily catch The Deuce transit bus and to buy half priced tickets for oncoming shows for the day or evening. For the casino, the whole Times Square theme and every other New York themed aspect was nailed down to a T, from the mock manholes to the Chrysler tower elevators that took us to our room. For restaurants, I highly recommend Gonzalez Y Gonzalez and their chicken fajita burrito. It will fill you up like it's nobody's business. Plus they give you plenty of tortilla nacho chips and two bowls of mild or medium salsa. And for drinks, I recommend the Coco Loco Margarita. The other restaurant that's good and is open 24 hours is America, where we ate the first night. They have Coors drafts on for $3.00 (if you really want the same beer for a steal of a price, check out O'Shea's near Bally's and the Flamingo, they have drafts for 99 cents a glass) and because it was late and it was after we just checked in, I had the Philly Cheese steak with Idaho grown potato wedges. They also had all you can eat pancakes during the morning, but I think we just missed it after 11. Most of the breakfast entrees came to about $7 to $8. For a really economical breakfast, I recommend La Salsa Cantina across the street near M&M's world for $3.95 till 11am. Other restaurants that are in New York New York, that are available but haven't tried because of shortage of time, are Chin-Chin, an all you can eat Chinese buffet and Asian dining, Gallagher's Steakhouse (a bit pricey), Il Fornaio Italian restaurant, and The Sporting House Bar and Grill. For bars, there's Nine Fine Irishmen, The Bar at Times Square and the Centre Bar. We tried getting into Nine Fine Irishmen, but it was a bit crowded so we went to the Centre Bar, which is located, of course in the center of the casino. For night clubs, there's ROK Bar Vegas and Coyote Ugly. Even though clubs are not quite my thing, I'd sooner go to ROK over Coyote Ugly because I read in another review that you have to pay a $10 cover charge just to get in. As for the casino itself, it may be a bit spread out, and scattered, but if you can find the right slot machine or table that you wish to play at, it'll be there. We were hoping to find more penny slots but whatever ones we could come across were close by the 50 cent Corvette slots. That was was the very first thing that greeted us when we got into the hotel. And if you sign up for the MGM Players Club card, you can collect points as you play either the slots or the tables, and use it towards any possible discounts off of your hotel bill, and can used at any MGM owned resort property. It'd be nice to have a universal setup to use your point collector's card at all casinos, since all the others are using the point system anyways. And as long as you're constantly still gambling at the tables or slots, all drinks are complimentary, All in all, if it's your first time to Vegas, and if you want to get the best bang for your buck without the sacrifice of luxury or extra cash, and for the closest proximity to get where you need to go, and to have the best experience and leave with a great first impression, New York New York is the place for you. The only improvements and suggestions to make it better, offer more perks with your coupons when your guests choose an upgrade package, have your housekeepers take that one extra step of double checking the alarm clocks to ensure the alarms are disabled, and to streamline the arrangement of your slot machines and offer more penny slots. For my next return trip to Las Vegas and to my next choice of hotel accommodations, to coin Ace Frehley's lyric in his song.......\"I'm back....back in the New York Groove.\" I will return.

GREAT massage, very relaxing and worth every $. the casino area is filled with smoke (i realize this is vegas, and i'm not anti smoking - but other casinos seem to be doing a better job in handling the smoke situation). the area seemed clean but i had no desire to sit down and play blackjack or spend a lot of money in there. the casino just doesn't have a fun vibe like others do in my opinion. for the price i paid i could have stayed at the TI (they had a 2 for 1 special going on for the time frame i was in vegas). i didn't spend all that much time in the room and i had a fantastic time in vegas, but i'm not reviewing my vacation but the HOTEL, and in closing i'd have to say that the NYNY was mediocre at best - definitely not a four star \"resort\" (oh yeah, and the resort fee is ridiculous!). i had so much fun with my lady friends and will definitely return to vegas next year! just not to the NYNY....sorry!", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cstay elsewhere\u201d", "Author": "chicagotoots", "ReviewID": "UR82789393", "Content": "Stayed there on a promotional rate of 79/night but they added the \"resort fees\" which still brought the price up to around $100 per night.

We wanted location, cleanliness, great price, convenience to rooms (i.e. not having a hike through the casino to get to the room), great food and definitely on the strip! I went through all the comments on Trip Advisor, talked to friends and checked the bed bug registry and narrowed it down to a few hotels. I searched for promo codes and joined any newsletters I could find on these hotels. You can usually find these on the hotel website. Whenever I'd find a promo code, I'd plug it into the site to see the deal. Once we found a great deal we liked, we booked online. It says they cannot guarantee a non smoking room so my hubby called to be sure since i have asthma. We ended up paying $110 for the Saturday night and $55.00 for Sunday-Wed night for the Park Avenue Deluxe room this September 2010. When we checked in, I inquired about an emailed deal I received right before I left about an upgrade to a spa room. She said there were no spa rooms for the Saturday night but I can check on Sunday. She said she either has the room we booked (a king size bed) or a room with two queen beds with an amazing room of the strip. She said this was a great room that is usually an upgrade. When we seen the room, we knew we wouldn't inquire about the Spa Room. It was a corner room with a full view of the strip and roller coaster out the side window and a partial view of the strip out the front window. We had tons of windows and it felt very spacious! We were near the end of the hallway on the 24th floor. I think the room number was 2470. We had a bit of a hike from the elevator but not too bad. It was nice to be near the end because we heard absolutely no noise from the hallway. We worried that the roller coaster would be noisy but we didn't hear it at all. Overall, we were extremely impressed with the room. The shampoo, condition, etc was replaced daily and the towels and beds were great! Free internet hookup which aloud us to keep in touch with the kids back home. All those windows and tons of light BUT with great curtains which blacked it out make for a perfect room! The checkin desk is conveniently located and close to the elevator to the rooms. You don't have a huge hike through the casino to check in or to get to the elevators. We didn't eat a lot at our hotel, but did enjoy the coffee and muffins at the little cafe in the \"streetscape\". We did enjoy pizza the first night at New York Pizza. It was really good! We are not into the bar scene and prefer shows which we seen three. One night we did stop and sit outside the bar in the \"street\" and enjoy the piano playing while having a drink. i cannot comment on the casino as we only played a few dollars at each hotel just to say we played. We actually spent about $40 and won $70! The stores were great and we found lots of neat New York items! I wanted a plane pillow with New York on it. i seen other hotel ones and though I would find one at my own hotel the last night, but was disappointed i couldn't find one. All they had was Las Vegas ones. Not a huge deal, but really the only UGH moment at this hotel. We went to the pool one morning and thought it was great! Its in shade in the AM and full sun in the afternnoon. The pool was a bit cold since we were there in the AM. I'm sure its refreshing in the hot PM sun but I thought it was too cold in the AM. We stuck to the hot tub. There are 3 hot tubs. The lounge chairs seem a bit dirty but I think they were just stained. Not attractive but there are nicer chairs that can be rented. Not a great view of the parking garage and the roller coaster runs over top. If you are going to relax, maybe not a great spot for it.

Check-in was a breeze and finding my elevators were easy as well. I was on the 21 floor, at the furthest room to the north (2183). From the elevator to my room, it was approximately 200 yards and involved taking almost 20 turns. The room was okay, large but stained carpet and old school tv. The bathroom was nice, but had this horrible blue/gray marble throughout. I was disappointed in the main casino area, my last visit it was still designed to look like Central Park. It has been renovated and looks very modern/contemporary. Best advice, tip the valet when you drop off your car, they will leave it up front so you don't have to wait for it when you need it. The pool area is extremely small considering how huge the hotel is and was always crowded. Overall it was a nice stay, but I would try some of the other large Hotel and Casino's first.

The food at the Italian restaurant and the Mexican restaurant were both fantastic. The breakfast buffet however was a bit average so we opted for just a bagel the remaining days. We hired a car from the hotel - the lady at the desk was unbelievably helpful. She gave us great tips and was a perfect example of amazing service. We drove to the grand canyon for a few nights (5 hours each way). It's an easy drive and well worth it. NY NY seems to have a younger crowd than some other hotels, but we would def'ly recommend. We took the free craps lesson at the hotel (well worth it to those like us who have no idea how the game works) and then enjoyed many sessions thereafter. The casino itself is smaller than some of the others on the strip, but friendly enough and had everything we wanted. The rooms were more than big enough, and to anyone used to europe sized hotel rooms they're enormous. Tried the rollercoaster - half price to anyone staying at the hotel between 11am-12. Well worth $7 each, but I was covered in bruises afterwards. Don't be put off by some of the other reviews on this site - the hotel is great and if I get the chance to go back to vegas, I'll def'ly stay there again. One tip to pass on - the taxi to the airport from NYNY is cheaper than two people in a shuttle. (The hotel is down towards the end of the strip closest to the airport). cost of taxi should be $10-12ish.

I was given a hotel extension number to ring the front desk for the room number of the third room to check when it would be ready and the woman who answered was downright rude with no customer service attitude \u2013 there is no excuse for this. The second thing that annoyed me was that despite the fact that I had booked and paid for the room in advance I was then told that there would be an additional \u2018resort charge\u2019 of $12.95 per room per night, which was a total charge of $155 that I had not been expecting, as there had been no mention of this previously.

It also connects by footbridge to MGM Grand and Excaliber / Luxor / Mandalay Bay, so you do not have to venture too far outside if it is hot.

Although I have stayed in several hotels on the strip, this was my first stay in this hotel. I had always passed up the opportunity to stay here in the past, becuase I feared that the roller coaster noise would bother me. When I checked in, the check-in staff member informed me that I was going to receive an upgrade. After check-in, we went up to our room up on one of the high floors. Upon entering the room, I was greatly impressed by the view and the gorgeous decor of the room. This WAS definitely an upgrade from their sister hotel next door, the Monte Carlo. We looked out and saw the roller coaster. I will have to say that the noise from the roller coaster could be heard, although it wasn't bothersome. I do not recommend this hotel to families with children. The pool is good enough for many adults, and was certainly adequate for our needs. There were three hot tubs next to the pool. I really liked it that the hot tubs were in the shade. The pool was in the shade throughout the morning, although if you are a sun seeker, you can still get some sun on the pool deck if you want to. If you have children, I would recommend the Monte Carlo, since they have more pool activites than this hotel (lazy river, wave pool, hot tub, regular pool). If you are an adult who would like to avoid noisy children and splashing, the New York, New York hotel is for you. The pool area is much quieter, and we saw very few children. One of the good features of this hotel is the food court. If you aren't into buffets, you have the convenience of having some casual food court choices on the ground floor of the casino. The casino has a game room for the children. I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would ask for the upgrade. It doesn't cost that much more. I will also say that as an adult without children, I would stay here instead of the Monte Carlo. If you are interested in having the all-day buffet, you can walk over to the Monte Carlo and get that. They do not have a buffet at the New York, New York. The hotel is located on the south end of the strip, which is the closest place to the airport.

It's near the end of the Strip, but it is part of the MGM Mirage group of hotels and has easy access (via bridges or free trams) to the MGM Grand, Monte Carlo, Aria/City Center Complex, Bellagio, Excalibur, Luxor and Mandelay Bay. There are lots of restaurants to choose from at NY NY (the American is open 24 hours and has tasty food at reasonable prices), as well as little eateries in the section of the hotel made to look like Greenwich Village. NY NY is kind of like the city it's named for - it has pockets of activity that are quite different from one another and its different areas appeal to different types of people, so that most people can find something that they will enjoy. Our room was an average size, but it was very clean, the bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was large enough and well lit. We thought it was a little strange that a room that had a king-size bed and was obviously for two people would only have one arm chair. There was a hassock-type of bench that could also be used for seating, but at the end of the day, two arm chairs would have been better. That was really our only complaint. They, like most of the hotels in Las Vegas, charge a daily resort fee, but as well as fitness center access, it includes free internet access in your room and free access to the business center where you can check in and print your airline boarding passes for free. We could see the roller coaster from our window but were not disturbed by any noise from it - they did a very good job of sound proofing the rooms. The package priced included two tickets to a show of our choice at one of the MGM Mirage hotels, so we saw the Lion King. If you haven't seen it yet - go. We were both really glad we chose it as the show we went to see. Check-in and check-out were both quick and easy. The casino was noisy, as one would expect, but the noise stayed in the casino.

The cake was perfect, better than I thought it would look it was a master piece and was delivered right on time as I requested. The have an arcade, the Coney Island Emporium which is huge and has many great games to play and also games the reward tickets to purchase small toys. There are even some carnival games as well with prizes. There's also the Manhattan Express which is their roller coaster. The Village Eateries have many little restaurants for food on the go. We tried both Nathan's which was good and Sirrico's Pizza which not only had pizza by the slice but lasagna and garlic bread too.

I'm a budget traveler and their prices were more than I wanted to pay. When I got an offer to stay there for just under $40 a night, I decided to give it a try. I was in the Empire Tower. I've heard the rooms were really small but I didn't find mine to be overly small. It wasn't large but I didn't think it was as tiny as I'd heard either. I found the room to be very comfortable. One thing I like about MGM properties is that they put spare pillows in the closet. I like a lot of pillows so this was a big plus. There was a big stand alone shower (no tub) that I liked a lot. I was on a high floor and the water pressure was fine. There was a nice assortment of lotions and such as well. The towels were soft and absorbent. One odd thing: there was what I thought was a mini fridge under the bathroom cabinet. After putting a couple of cokes in to cool, I discovered that it was actually a tiny freezer. One of the great things about NYNY is the food court. It's my favorite in all of Vegas and can't be topped for the variety available. I especially like the deli but every place I've tried was good. I also like their souvenir shops better than any other I've been in. I do wish they hadn't toned down the New York theme of the casino and food court. The only quibble I had with the food was at America. The food itself was fine but the waiter was only minimally attentive. I don't want them hovering over me or expect pampering but it would be nice to have him check to see if I need a drink refill or anything else. I suspect he thought that, as a single female diner, I wouldn't be tipping. (I did but less than I would have if he'd put more effort into it.) I say this because he did seem to be more attentive to his other tables. I was also not pleased with the addition of a resort fee. Most of the things it was supposed to cover were useless/unnecessary to me and, I think, to the average tourist. I'd have been more put out with it but it did cover internet fees.

Good size bathroom with basin in bench, toilet and shower over bath. Free self parking in multi storey garage or paid valet parking.

The Staff at the front desk were helpful, well it was 8pm and very quiet, we were told they would sort the problem out in the morning, so we went to our room, well we tried, they gave us the wrong directions, finally found the lift, on the 18th floor, must of upset them at the desk as our room was right at the end of the corridor, it was like a pac-man maze, room was nice, 2 beds, bathroom was dark, shower leaked a little but not too bad, small safe and limited tv channels, nice view of the mountains and rollercoaster though. Well day 2 was fun, had an argument with the hotel and travel company in America, there about as useful as a fart in the wind, think the wife mentally scared some of them, she even scared me and I've seen her in a bad mood, think of the exorcist (they basically told us that it was our fault and our hotel voucher was worthless). Anyway it took 2 days to sort out a simple wrong booking (would like to thank North American Travel and Chris Mcfadden Travel, who were excellent back home during our whole stay, without them we would of really got in a mess). The hotel then moved us to a lovely corner room, good size and very comfortable, same dim light in the bathroom though (so remember if you want a good room, wind your wife up and withold chocolate for 24 hours then send her down to reception). The casino is nice, smaller then a lot of the other ones, but has a good selection of 1 cent machines, yes I'm cheap. Watch out for electric static shocks, I got loads in each casino. The food options were very dear for the quality, we often ate out or bought food back to the hotel, Ben and Jerry's was excellent though, not cheap but you got a good filling. Went on the rollercoaster, expensive but gives you a rush. The hotel is a little out of the way, flamingo or Planet Hollywood is more a central location, the Vegas Outlet Centre just passed Mandalay bay is excellent and good value, well not if you take your wife. Ask a taxi driver for the direct route to where ever your going, don't say the fastest or you'll pay more. Went to see Zumanity on the last night (or that's what we thought), the show is brillant, yes they show skin but the skill behind the show is amazing and the comedy was excellent, just don't sit near the front or you'll be sorry. Now this is when it went wrong and my reason for giving this hotel an average rating, we got stranded for an extra week because of Icelands attempt to sink there island so they dont have to pay us British back the money they owe us, this gave us a chance to see what other hotels offer and compare against New York New York. We then had to stay in 3 different hotels until we left, 1st was South Point, hmmmm yee harrr I think is the right words for this place, cowboys need only apply, next was the Royal Resort, north end of the strip near Denny's, very small and was very nice, small pool but very private, only stayed there 1 night, last was The Orleans, stayed there 3 nights and it blew the New York New York away, the price was good, the staff was on a different level and it had amenities that kept you interested all hours of the day, the wife would like to apologise for the dent in the bowling alley though, don't try lane 26, come to think about that don't try lane 25 either, she bounced it well (got stuck on my thumb, yeah right, more like a fast bowler in cricket). Try Fuddrockers, amazing!!!, they also have a free shuttle to the strip as your slightly off it, comes every 20 to 30 minutes, if I go back then I'm picking this hotel and making sure there are no live volcano's. Must See's: Bellagio Fountains, Miracle Mile, MGM Lions, Venetian, Volcano (the fake one), Zumanity.

Most people stayed in the MGM Grand, but my husband and I chose to stay in the NYNY due to a great internet deal. And I'm thrilled that we did. There's a walkway that attaches MGM to NYNY, so from the moment we got there some friends were able to dash over while we checked in. Our room was a good size and very clean. A basic hotel room at the end of the day, but the decor was a little flashier since we were in Vegas afterall. The view from our window looked out over the pool, parking garage and some of the city. At night it was lovely. By day it was OK. When we met our friends we headed straight to the roller coaster. There was a deal going on while we were there where, for $54, you could get three tickets to any of 5 local attractions. We chose the roller coaster at NYNY, Titanic exhibit at Luxor, and Shark Reef at Mandalay Bay. The roller coaster was cool! It went so fast that my eyes were watering and I ended up shutting them for most of the ride since I couldn't see. Therefore I was surprised later when I discovered that the coaster actually went back through the hotel! Must have missed that part. But what fun. Then we all ate at the little Mexican place inside NYNY, and headed to the dueling piano bar where the rest of our group met us. That was a fun place, but we were there early enough that it really wasn't very crowded. That night my husband and I met up with some friends who are locals and they took us to some great spots around town that most tourists never get to see. Very fun. Next day we had breakfast at the Italian place in NYNY (fantastic bread and latte's!). Then we went and looked around Monte Carlo next door. Very nice! Afterwards we went out to the pool at the NYNY. This is where the hotel is lacking. The pool is a grand total of 4 ft. deep and it's really not very big. There's no outdoor food area, so you have to wait for the waitresses to come by and take your order. Oh well, it's not like either of us went to Vegas to spend the whole day at the pool. Later we went to Shark Reef. That was a cool exhibit. Having sharks swimming over your head, and a glass wall that you could walk right up to to see them. Everyone had cameras out the place was so neat. Afterwards we got a drink at Areole (sp?) in Mandalay Bay. This is the place where the girl is raised and lowered with pulleys to get your bottle of wine. The guys at the bar were fantastic! We were wishing we'd planned to spend more time there and are seriously considering staying at Mandalay Bay next time we go just because of the atmosphere there. When we met our friends at MGM that night it turned into a long evening. The guys went and played poker, and the wives wandered off to have drinks and late dinner. Even though one of the wives was staying at MGM we had a hard time trying to figure out our way around the place. It's enormous! It made me really appreciate the NYNY more since it's easy to navigate and there's plenty of good restaurants and gaming tables. The next day we spent the day at the MGM pool (which is fabulous!), then I went back to NYNY to get a massage and facial. Great spa, very relaxing, experience people, worth every penny! The only downside is that the room I was in for my facial is right next to the weight room/fitness center, and some musclehead was in there lifting weights that were too heavy for him so he was dropping them to the ground every time and I could hear the crash in my spa room. By the way, the Titanic exhibit in Luxor is great. Very powerful, but incredibly interesting! Not sure I'd want to stay in Luxor, but that exhibit is well worth a walk through. Overall, I'm thrilled we stayed at the NYNY. The size of the hotel was good for me being smaller but having the feel of a larger hotel. If you're the type of person that values a pool then MGM or Mandalay Bay might be more your speed. And if you're a big poker player NYNY doesn't have a poker room. But if you just like to gamble a bit, have a few drinks, and eat at really good restuarants, this place is perfect! And being in the middle of a popular area means that it's just a short stroll to visit other poker rooms, fancy bars and other exhibits if you don't like what's offered around you.", "Date": "April 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, friendly staff, nice room - definately coming back\u201d", "Author": "nannybailey", "ReviewID": "UR62792703", "Content": "I have just come back from a 7 day trip to this hotel and before we went I was slightly concerned about some of the comments I'd read but loved the hotel the moment we set foot in it.

The hotel may look like it is a short stroll from the centre of the strip but it is not. There is a regular bus service in Las Vegas called the Deuce which you can ride for $7 all day and there is a stop right outside this hotel BUT the bus is pretty much useless for the following reasons: 1) The traffic on the strip is bumper to bumper eg it took us 90 mins to travel 5 miles 2) The buses are always so full of people that unless you get on and one of the first stops, the buses will drive right past you at the bus stop as they can't fit any more passengers on the bus. So, if you want to be doing things in the centre strip and you cannot walk very far or very well then pay the extra money to stay in a centre strip hotel. NYNY will simply be too far away for you.

We ended up in room 1726 and the view was beautiful... some people have complained of the zig-zag hallways and I think they just need something to complain about. I've also herd reports of small bathrooms but found the entire room adequate for my spouse and myself. We didn't win big in the casino, but didn't loose big either. The one complaint I could have is the lack of Cocktail Waitresses. It was rather tough to get a drink, nomatter the time of day. The elevators were nice and never had to wait long for one up, or down. They moved pretty rapidly. Chin-Chin had a nice breakfast buffet but not much variety for the price - service there was awesome. Maid service was excellent and seemed to predict any needs we may have. Kept our room nice and tidy. Ran into one issue with the \"resort fee\" - upon arriving to our room we tried to get online with our laptop only to be notified there would be a $14.99/day fee. After discussing with front desk found that the access is already rolled into the resort fee and even though you must accept the daily fee you will not be charged for it on top of the resort fee. All-in-all it was a beautiful hotel with an interesting theme. We loved our room and will definatley plan a return visit.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sault Ste Marie, ON", "Title": "\u201cAwesome week long stay at the new york new york!\u201d", "Author": "kevinthecheesehead", "ReviewID": "UR60906995", "Content": "Cant say enough good things about the new york new york, got a great price on it while booking so my expectations were lowered a bit but i was extremely wrong after being there for about 5 minutes.

We hang out out Pour 24 bar which is a GREAT spot to people watch while hanging out and having a few drinks.

We had views of the Las Vegas strip out the front of the room and a view of the southern end of the strip from the side windows. Worth the extra $$ to have the views. Loved the casino area, it was very easy to manage our way around. The food court has some pretty good choices. We had the pizza the first night. We also ate at the deli and it was very good. We had the turkey sandwich and the homemade chicken noodle soup. Excellent. We also loved the location of the hotel on the strip. Close to other major hotels/casinos. I would highly recommend staying here over the other higher priced hotels and you can just walk your way to whichever casino you want .

We booked with Airbridge tours and for $130 per person, we really had a great time. Took around 3 hours to get to the canyon. We had approx. 4 hours on our own at canyon.

We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others who aren't expecting a luxury vacation. The Room: We stayed in a Park Avenue Deluxe room (the second cheapest). The room was adequate. It was pretty small, but we didn't spend much time in it, so it really didn't matter to us. The room wasn't as clean as it could have been. There was an empty water bottle by the window and a long hair in the bath tub when we arrived. There was also a really large stain on the bench/luggage stand. A lot of the fixtures were obviously worn. The room was pretty nice if you just didn't look too close. The bed was very comfortable. There was no coffee maker or mini fridge, both of which seemed oddly out of place for a hotel of this level (four star). The bathroom was fine, although it didn't have a fan which made it pretty stuffy when I showered. Also, the shower head was very low. I'm about 5'8\" and had to really bend down to get my hair wet. I can't imagine how hard it was for my husband who is 6'3\". The water pressue was fine, though. Our room had a view of the roller coaster which was pretty loud, but stopped running by 11pm, so it didn't bother us at all. The hotel itself: The casino was nice enough, but we didn't have much luck there. We had a much better time at the Monte Carlo and Bally's down the strip. The inside of the hotel is very cool. It's modeled to look like the streets of New York, but kind of old fashioned. There are lots of little shops and restaurants. There is small-medium arcade upstairs which was kind of fun to goof off at. We also rode on the roller coaster, and at $14/person I would suggest you skip it. It's very rough - I was not impressed. There is a shop that has a lot of generic gift shop stuff like purses, watches, and scarves and everything is $10. The resort fee of something like $10/night was annoying but expected. Be warned, it is in addition to the room rate. Parking was free and convenient. We didn't use the pool because it was too cold outside, but it looked fine. Food: Dining at the hotel was pretty good. We only ate at one of the sit down restuarants at the hotel (Gonzalez y Gonzalez) and it was very good. The prices seemed pretty average; I think it was about $45 total (with tax and tip) for two average priced entrees and one giant margaria (the kind that comes in the two foot long plastic cup that you can get refilled all over the strip for about $10). We also ate at a counter service burger restaurant in the Village Shops within the hotel, and it was average in both price and food quality. If you are trying to save money I would strongly recommend going right accross the street to the \"food court\". It has a Subway, Panda Express, Wendys, and several other places to eat and the prices aren't much higher than you'd pay at those restaurents at home. We also ordered room service one night and it took about 45 minutes to get our food. The food was pretty average. I woudn't suggest it. Service: The front desk was very nice, although a little too friendly, when checking in. What I mean is, the person who helped us kept getting off on tangent conversations while a line was building up behind us. The housekeeping was consistent and adequate. Location: New York, New York is located at one end of the strip right accross the street from the MGM. It was a good location for us because we didn't mind walking all the way to the other end of the strip for things like the Bellagio fountains and Madame Tousauds, but if you don't want to walk a lot you might want to stay at the other end of the strip or more in the middle. One final note about generaly travel to and from Las Vegas: if you are coming from the South and plan to go over the Hoover dam, be warned that traffic can be horrible. The traffic was so bad it added 2 1/2 hours to our drive there (we took a different way back).", "Date": "March 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cNice, but not worth four stars\u201d", "Author": "mmb616", "ReviewID": "UR59735561", "Content": "We booked this trip after staying at the MGM in January.

Our room was near the rollercoaster, but that didn't bother us. At check in, we asked if we could have a king size bed, which they quickly said they could accomodate. The staff was nice and friendly. The not so good: We had a deluxe Park Avenue room. The photo on the website is inaccurate to say the least. The photo shows a modern room with rich earthy tones. What we got were cheap linens and a scratchy bed spread with green leaves all over it. The bed was okay. I have slept in worse, but after MGM's bed, this one was a downgrade. The walls are very thin.

At times inless you got up off your table to go look for a waitress, you will be left waiting and thirsty, so what i recommend is this, if you are goig to Vegas to gamble YOUR MONEY and in return want decent drinks service to YOUR table, for which YOU will tip YOUR own money, avoid this hotel at all costs.

Easy to navigate. Noticed not all the table games were open at one time. Saw waitresses who provided drinks to gamblers, but we were not once approaced while we were playing. Restaurants: Fine selections, some priced well - a few were overpriced in my opinion. the mexican was good and a great value (see my reviews on all restaurants we ate at under my name). Bars: Several to choose from. Pour 24, the only bar we actually went to in the hotel, had a really neat bar top. Coaster: not worth the 14 dollars, but glad i did it. Hotel itself was very easy to navigate compared to other hotels we wandered through. Everything was kept very clean and I was never overwhealmed by smoke. Pool: nice, but still cold when we were there, the hot tubs (3 total, only 2 were open) were great though. Pool provided towels, but you can't take them back to your room, so I had to dry off completely prior to leaving the area. Location: Not bad for a first choice. Monorail station is right across the street at the MGM. If I go back I would put myself a bit more centered on the strip. Value: I thought the hotel/airfair combo was very very good compared to some of the other places I looked at prior to booking. Other thoughts from a first time visitor We wandered many of the other hotels while there. Many were very very cool and I would love to stay in them. However, 2 hotels we wandered through I was very glad we did not stay in. Excaliber- was cool to look at, especially at night but seemed cramped and dirty to me when we went in. Tropicana- very dated looking and smelled like perfume everywhere. this was especially bad as I am highly allergic to strong perfumes... Day trips.. definately do one. we did a grand canyon tour (see my review under my name about the trip). Shows: see a show. there are 100's to pick from. we saw KA over at the MGM. see my review.

Granted it was Friday night and maybe booking it through US Airways had something to do with it, we accepted it. The receptionist told us to call in the morning and they could switch us into a King Bed. The boyfriend and I were also a little too nervous to try the $20 trick, so we were happy with what we got. We got a 6th floor room through the New Yorker elevators, all the way at the end of the hallway. Room was decent, no complaints. View was of the MGM sign, couldn't see much being so low. We called first thing in the morning and they told us that they couldn't do room changes until 1-2pm in the afternoon and that we should go out and explore and check back. We were OK with that. But then 5 minutes after we hung up, they called right back and said they had a room ready for us. Same floor, just all the way on the opposite side. And that trek to the elevator was LONG. But we're pretty easy going people, so we didn't mind too much. Better room with a King Bed. The side of the room with the TV Cabinet was ALL WINDOWS, with a view of the Roller Coaster. And the other wall had another window with a view of Excalibur. Clean room, no problems. Didn't hear the coaster at all, and it was literally right outside our room. Internet says there is a fee, but with the new resort fee, they waive the internet fee on your bill at the end of your stay. LOVED the casino. Small in comparison to the rest of the hotels on the strip, but I loved that it had an open design and wasn't your typical Vegas decorated casino, with gold and cheesy chandeliers everywhere. Very modern and \"hip\" LOVED the food court/New York Village. Reasonably priced food and Greenberg's Deli had THE BEST sandwiches. We didn't try any of the restaurants because we were on somewhat of a budget. Bars were a lot of fun. The piano bar was always busy, and I loved that the music carried into the casino. Coyote Ugly and Rok were also favorites. Overall, I loved staying here.

The staff was all very friendly and our room was cleaned to wonderful standards on a daily basis. The eateries were varying in quality of food - the pizza left alot to be desired, but the fine dining was excellent. We found quite a bit of our interests within this hotel, including a Starbucks, Ben & Jerry's and a Harley shop! Also, for sports fans, there is an ESPNZone inside. Really, a little bit of everything for everyone. A quaint Italian cafe provides fantastic pasteries and coffee for breakfast. We attended the in-hotel show, \"Zumanity\". No recommended for the prude at heart, but great humor and fantastic acrobatics that will amuse and amaze! Very enjoyable and worth the ticket price. Only other problem is location of this hotel. Everything else we wanted to see and do was on the opposite ends of the strip...thus requiring LONG walks or a taxi.

We decided to stay at New York - New York mainly because her parents were staying there and we wanted to stay at the same hotel; we knew very little about the property beyond what their website had to say. We left very impressed with NYNY and with the intention of staying there the next time we come to Vegas. We booked a prepaid room through Expedia and got the 3rd night of our 3-night stay for free; this was especially valuable because the 3rd night was a Saturday and thus the most expensive (the promotion was for the 3rd night regardless of which was more expensive). So we paid under $300 for our Thurs-Sat stay, including taxes and resort fee, which is apparently a significantly lower than average price. I would consider our price to be a very excellent value, but even the standard price would be acceptable to me. We had a Broadway Deluxe room (3rd tier from the bottom) on the 27th floor, facing away from the Strip; we still had a nice view of the Monte Carlo and the mountains, though, and I wouldn't have wanted to pay extra just for a better view. The casino was excellent; we visited many of the Strip casinos and liked the one at NYNY the best, which worked out since we gambled late into the night every night. They had a good selection of slot machines and I liked the layout of the casino. Drink service was a little spotty, but not notably worse than at other casinos. We also liked our room. I'm not sure what other people were expecting in terms of amenities, but ours was comparable to a good Holiday Inn or Hilton Garden Inn room. It was clean and everything worked. The TV wasn't the newest or fanciest model, but who comes to Las Vegas to watch TV in their hotel room anyway? We were also not too far from the roller coaster but had no noise complaints. You could hear riders screaming if you were paying attention, but I don't think it would have kept us awake. I can't say for sure because we were out late every night. Again, it's Vegas...I wasn't exactly planning to go to bed early anyway. They had a good selection of restaurants, too; we ate at America and Nine Fine Irishmen and liked the food at both. We felt we got great service, too. We were able to check in at 11am even though their check-in time is officially 3pm (and I'm surprised to hear that someone in a previous review expected a guaranteed room by 11am; 3pm seems to be a very standard check-in time even if some hotels will accommodate earlier check-in). In any case, the bellman checked in our bags as we arrived and would have been able to store them for us even if we couldn't get into our room until 3. I wasn't expecting anything beyond having our bags stored, so it was a welcome surprise to get into the room early. Additionally, there was an option to check out via the television and have a bellman come up to the room and take our bags down to storage (since our flight didn't leave until the evening). We opted to do this to avoid standing in line and would do so again. In general, we found the service to be excellent. We loved the NY theme and thought this was one of the coolest looking hotels on the Strip. The location was good, too, since it was very convenient to check out a few other casinos nearby without having to walk too far (though we also chose to walk way up the Strip). To sum it up, we were impressed with NYNY and based on the rooms, the theme, the location, and the casino, we expect we'll stay there again on our next Las Vegas trip. The price we paid this time was a great deal, but even at $120-$140 a night I would consider it a very good value.", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo, MN", "Title": "\u201cIt served it's purpose\u201d", "Author": "byost1717", "ReviewID": "UR54923295", "Content": "We stayed at the New York New York in October 2009.

Now the positives. Location: It is nearer the south end of the strip, but actually near the center of the \"main\" casinos, being between the Luxor and Mandalay Bay on the south, and the Bellagio to the north. It was about a 40 minute round trip walk up to the Bellagio and perhaps 30 minute round trip to Mandalay Bay, but you can do part of this on the tram. The casino is nice, but not extravagant. We saw Cirque de Soliel's Zumanity here and really enjoyed it, but don't bring your Bible along... We did not eat at the New York, New York, but enjoyed Buffets at the Bellagio (9/10 rating by us), Mandalay Bay (6/10) and at the Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood (8/10). The sushi at any buffet is not worth your time, as it gets dried out sitting around for who knows how long. Parking is free and easy, once you figure out how to get to it. When coming north on Las Vegas Blvd, you'll see the NYNY on your left. Just as you pass it, there is a left turn lane with a stoplight that you use to get to the parking. It is quite a walk across a walkway to the casino and eventually to your room, but who cares when parking is free and right at the resort. Make sure you go enjoy the fountain show at the Bellagio and the Volcano show at the Mirage. The outdoor sound system with the fountain show at the Bellagio is very nice. We basically used a Vegas resort as a base (cheap vacation package) to make our way with our rental car up to Zion National Park in Utah...2:45 drive from Las Vegas and well worth your time if you like to hike and enjoy \"non-urban\" scenery.

Check in only took around 5-10 mins, we had a park avenue deluxe room and we asked for a king bed which was no problem. Our room was on the 22nd floor in the Century Tower, the lifts were very quick, we had a view of the roller coster, MGM and Tropicana hotel and although you could hear the roller coster it was not loud enough to cause a problem for us, in fact the people in the next rooms children were much louder, luckily they were only there 2 nights.

My biggest pet peeve was the fact that check in wasn't until 3PM, so for people like us, who caught an early flight into Vegas, the hope of being able to check in early like the traditional time ( which usually is 11AM for most hotels, or the majority of hotels I have stayed in since my birth), we had to kill the better part of 6 HOURS. Not fun and not cool. After that long wait, the room wasn't even that great! Compared to other places, the beds were not very comfortable, there were holes in the blankets, the bathroom was fairly small, and at least where our room was located, right by the escalating roller coaster, we heard faint screams & whooping any time we were in our room. The other half of my pet peeve came from the fact that check-out was 11AM. I don't have a problem checking out at that time, but there are always people checking our earlier so why can't check-IN be the same time? I'm sure one day someone will explain that one to me. The perk of staying there was we got a great deal on Cirque du Soleil ZUMANITY tickets (2 for $99, instead of 1 for $130) and if you are a girl who likes to dance, you can usually get on the guest list for the Rok Nightclub (which is fairly decent).

I had originally booked a Spa Suite with the special three-nights-for-the-price-of-two promotion, so it was already a great value. When I checked in, the woman at the front desk told me that for just $30 more a night, I could upgrade to an 1100 sq. ft. Ziggurat Suite, a room that would have cost us roughly $900 during the dates of our stay, but because of the 3-for-2 promotion and the $30 special upgrade, we got the great suite for about $300 total, that's $100 a NIGHT! It was a pleasant surprise. I especially enjoyed the spa tub, robe, slippers, and all the extra toiletries offered in the suite (I've stayed in a regular room at NYNY before). The casino robbed us pretty clean (as casinos often do), so I really appreciated the low-cost options for food in the hotel. We ate at the pizza place almost every day (great value!) and my husband enjoyed the fish and chips place. We easily could feed the two of us (with a soft drink) for under $20, which is rare in Vegas. We also love the hot pretzels. I ordered room service two nights in a row because I'd read good reviews on here, and it was delicious! The breakfast buffet at Chin Chin is definitely a pass. There were not enough options (not even toast!). You're better off ordering room service or eating at America (the 24 hour restaurant). It was cheaper than the $12.99 buffet and had a much better selection. The one thing I will add that didn't really affect our stay, but may affect the stays of others, is that because of the atmosphere at NYNY, this hotel probably gets the most children out of any of The Strip resorts. The arcades, roller coaster, and cheap food makes this place a big draw for families, so be forewarned, but it really didn't affect us at all, as they aren't allowed on the casino floor, just in the lobby areas. Overall I've read a lot of bad reviews on here about this resort but I really enjoy it and this was my second visit. The value can't be beat, and I'd definitely recommend it to friends.

We loved that the casino was easy to navigate, it was easy to get out and across the street to Excalibur, MGM Grand, and Tropicana, and that the d\u00e9cor was fun but not overly cheesy with painted blue skies with puffy clouds. Our room was very nice with sort of somber d\u00e9cor and our view out on the strip beautiful. We were on the 18th floor in a Park Ave Strip View. It was a lot of turns from the elevator but didn\u2019t mind that too much. What I did mind was the huge smear of what appeared to be pink nail polish on the bedside table which appeared to chip of quite easily and yellow stains on the corner of the bed linens by my head. I called and asked housekeeping to rectify these things in the morning and instead they just made the bed. I had to call again in the evening before we went out to dinner and they finally cleaned things up. After I filled out a post-trip survey, at their request, someone did contact me and offer me an upgrade to s spa suite room if I stay with them again within the next year. While I might stay there again if I got a 2 star hotel rate, I certainly would not pay full price, which has an additional resort fee of $10.07 slapped on top of it. They rationalize the resort fee by giving you a couple coupons for two free cocktails, a news paper, and a discount on souvenirs but don\u2019t give you anything of worth that you may actually want such as a day pass to the spa.

Was my first stay there. Check in was a breeze, but noticed that at times the lines can get pretty long. I only waited about five minutes. I checked in at around 3;30 on a Wednesday. Some of the front desk staff that had been there for years REALLY knew the layout of the place and could tell you, in detail, what type of view each room had. I was in one of the Park Avenue Premium View rooms. Total room rate was about $380, though two of the weeknights were \"comped.\" My room was on the 28th floor and had a straight-on view of the Strip, looking directly across at the MGM Grand. The roller coaster could barely be heard and didn't bother me at all. Window has a \"vent\" you can open for fresh air, but doesn't really \"open\" the window itself at all. Good air flow though. AC worked great, and didn't blow directly on the bed as some do in other hotels. Some rooms have connecting doors to the rooms next door, and you can hear what's going on if your neighbor is loud. I had a quiet neighbor most nights. Used room service three times, mostly at night or in late afternoon. Each time it was just great. Food was hot, good, well-presented, and never took more than 20 minutes. Also ate at the Chinese restaurant one night, just off the casino floor. A bit noisy, but food was real good. The \"American\" cafe food was okay, but not fantastic. A lot quieter though, as it's off the casino floor. The pizza place was also good, as others have reported. I really liked the \"Times Square\" recreation, just off the casino floor. Lots of activity, and the bars are hopping after 9:00 every night. Good for people watching if you can handle the noisy atmosphere. Hotel had a decent selection of shops for clothes. A Harley store is also on premises. It was bigger than most I've seen and had TONS of biker t-shirts and other clothing. Didn't go to the Irish pub, but it looked like fun. There's also some other bars there as well that I didn't go to. Drink service on casino floor was pretty good. You could order doubles as well, which was nice. Went to see Zumanity as well. It was a great show, though not for kids. It's an adult show, with both guys and girls in it. Live band (though sort of \"hidden\") at the show was GREAT, as were the singers. Not like any other Cirque show I've seen. I like the Cirque shows for the most part...except perhaps \"O\" which is \"pretty\" but \"slow\"; and actually it's just \"pretty slow\" I guess. More for the synchronized swimming crowd in my opinion. Zumanity was much livelier. Sit in the center rows if you can as you will see more. On weekends the show will sell out to get your tickets prior to arrival to Las Vegas if you want a good seat. Dollar rent-a-car is right in the lobby off the front desk. Had a good experience with them. Parking garage is less than five minutes from the Dollar office and front desk. Noticed that returning the car at the hotel is much cheaper than returning it up at the airport. Casino is pretty lively. Had a good run at the craps table. Craps dealers were friendly. One of the BJ dealers was not so nice though. I guess she was having a bad day. I still remember HER after three months. That's not a good thing! Never smiled at ALL. Overall had a good stay.

There was a HotTube/Jacuzzi, King Bed, seperate vanity area, a nice bathroom with one of the most powerful showers i have used (!), a dining/lounge/kitchenette open plan room. There were several large wardrobes and the added touch of having our own robes and chocolates on the bed was priceless! Other complimentary items included bath crystals, hand brushes, flannels, shampoos, shower gels, shaving cream and razors and liquid and solid soaps. There were several tvs and little extras like surround sound which made it that much better. There is a minibar too - with complimentary pepsis...7ups etc. One of the best bits was the view - we had a strip view as standard and the only very slight down side was that the windows were emerald green, although you would only notice in the morning and the rollercoaster noise was barely noticeable!

I had read the previous reviews online, but wanted to come here with an open mind, prepare for the worst and hope for the best! Arriving at the hotel, the front desk was extremely nice. There wasn't a long line and it was relatively painless. Because I had read previous reviews on the rooms, I opted to upgrade to a nicer room for only $10 per night which was said to be remodeled. When I entered the room, I was like, there is no way this is a 4star hotel and thank goodness I upgraded. However, the room was very noisy, every thirty seconds I thought I was hearing the roller coaster. Imagine hearing the coaster at Space Mountain pulling in, that is the exact sound. So I called down to the front desk and asked them what time the roller coaster stops running and they told me at 11pm. So I was fine with it because I wasn't planning on being in the room during the day, just wanted to make sure I would be able to sleep. However, while I was on the phone, my bags arrived from the bellman and he informed me that was not the roller coaster I was hearing, it was the elevator shaft. So I asked to be moved. They were very accomodating. The room I am not in (at this very moment as I write this). The room is quieter, but you can still hear the elevator shaft. In speaking with people that work at the hotel, they tell me they wouldn't stay in one of the rooms either and \"what were they thinking when they designed the hotel and the rooms\". As for the aestetecs (sp?), they did attempt to remodel or better stated, update the rooms. For a four star hotel on the Las Vegas strip - they missed the boat. With all the new hotels going up, getting completely revamped, I am afraid the NY NY rooms look and feel about as old as the Statue of Liberty. Popcorn ceilings, parquet paneled armoire (really, who would have thought?) and hideous bedspreads that look very worn. Sorry for the long write-up on the room, just want to let you know what to expect if you do stay here. If you can live with the forementioned, you will be in good shape. The staff is very very friendly throughout the hotel, casino and restaurants. Absolutely would recommend gambling hear if you want to play craps or blackjack. The table limits in the morning are $5 and by 11am move to $10, depending on how busy they are. Compared to many of the other 4 star hotels, this is great if you want to play low limits. The other hotel minimums I experienced were $15 and not as friendly. Huge shout out to Calvin at the Craps table, he never missed a bet and chatted everyone up. The nightclub is ok, no line. I think this is more an indication of the economy and the location. The club at the Encore is the hot spot in Vegas at this time. And the NY NY hotel is at the end of the strip, down by Excalibur, which is not an ideal location for me. And, I can't forget, LOVE LOVE LOVE the Dueling Piano Bar. Went there all three nights and always had fun! Always met fun people and really enjoyed the variety of music. BTW- I'm not a huge roller coaster fan, but got talked into going on it. It is SOOOOO much fun. However, everyone in lined agreed that it wasn't worth the $14 per person. Which if you are traveling with a family, can add up quickly. In summary, recommend coming down to NyNy for a little gambling and the Dueling Piano bars.

I picked this hotel because it was the cheaper than many others and is conveniently located. The hotel is just the same as the big hotels on the strip. While it is okay it has some really annoying things which infuriated me. In fact, I was totally fed up with it to be honest. First, while there is free parking, to get to your room is an arduous task with suitcases. You park in the self park area; then you lug your cases out of your car; then you get the elevator to the walkway; then you walk the walkway; then you get the esculator; then you fight through the floor of slot machines and poker tables; then you get in line for check in; then you lug your cases back through the casino and get one of the elevators up to the floors of your room (anything from 20+; then you walk corridor after corridor to get to your room. Then you find there are no coffee making facilities; I am addicted to coffee; I find it outrageous that you can check into a Best Western motel and have microwaves; coffee machines; fridges etc and pay a reasonable rate yet in this much more expensive hotel you don't get a coffee maker forcing you to have to leave your room, back down the elevator; through the casino to one of the coffee shops for which a medium coffee can cost about $5 - ridiculous. i noticed that at Wallgreens across the strip they were selling coffee makers for $18 - if I would have found that the first day I would have just bought a coffee maker. Then, no free wi-fi. Instead you have to pay $15 for 24hours. Again, in comparison with Best Western this stinks. Hey, the hotel has a roller coaster which is great. But, $14 for one ride is simply outrageous. It's ridiculous. What makes it worse is that as a guest at the hotel you don't get any sort of discount for it. I hate the money grabbing 'trap' that you fall into when on the strip.

The room was thouroughly cleaned daily, and was a good size. we stayed in a park avenue deluxe room and had a view of MGM grand, the rollercoaster, and Tropicana. We were on the 17th floor and rarely struggled to get an elevator/lift quickly. Another nice thing about the room was the Bose Ipod dock. would have liked a flat screen TV but not really fussed since we spent very little time in there. It's true the decor could be better but its hardly outdated/run down. Bed was comfy and never noticed noise coming from any of the rooms near us (contrary to peoples comments about thing walls). Shower pressure was great. Other thing to note on the room was that we never heard the lift or rollercoaster - probably because we were on such a high floor and at the opposite end of the hotel to the lifts so not really in a position to comment on peoples complaints about them. Check in was very fast (wednesday afternoon at 2pm) and the woman was very helpful and friendly. The staff in general in the hotel were excellent and more than willing to help you out if you need anything the casino was great and a nice way to finish the night off after a night out. the slots were fairly generous (i won $150 of a $1 bet!). the cocktail waitresses come round very often ifyou tip them a dollar a drink and even faster if you tip more (generally i tipped $5 for two drinks). me and my partner are by no means high rollers but we did get a $75 room service bill comped from the players club even though we didnt really gamble much money. You can spend hours in the casino on $20 drinking as much as you like. the trick for us was to stick to the low end slots and bet minumum. we never expected to win anything so to walk away with more than you put in was always an unexpected (and very welcome) bonus. mixed feelings about the poor. on the good side it has an atmosphere, good bar, nice jacuzzi, and lots of sun loungers. on the down side, it doesnt get any sun till about 11 and by which time it gets very busy. also the music they play is a bit repetitve. overall i liked it because i was able to plug in the Ipod, sip on a cocktail, close my eyes, and recover from the constant hangovers in peace. Food at the hotel is a mixed bag too. the steak house (gallaghers) is truly excellent and good value. never ate at ESPN as its not my kinda place. the village eateries are great too - especially the Deli and the 50's style diner burger place (near the rollercoaster) and they are a cheap and easy quick fill if you dont want to bother with a restaurant. I must be the only person who thought the pizza place was overrated since it always had a huge queue. also, avoid the buffet place in the morning as it just reminded me of left over chinese food. Nightlife at the hotel is among the best in Vegas. Cayotes is great, and Nine Fine Irishmen is my favourate bar in Vegas.The live band they have there are very entertaining (listen out for them playing 'seven drunken nights', or find the clips on youtube). didnt bother with the bar at times square so cant offer an opinion on that, and the same applies for Rok nightclub. the 24 hour bar overlooking the casino has a great view but watch out for the drinks prices! Overall, i love this hotel. it always has an atmosphere and its perfect for younger couples, lads, and girls holidays. if you want a quiet place in vegas, stay elsewhere as this place is full of life. the location isnt great but its opposite MGM grand which has a monorail stop for easy access to the rest of the strip.", "Date": "November 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire, England", "Title": "\u201cThemed Hotel right in the action in Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "bryanuk72", "ReviewID": "UR48917424", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel a few times over the years and it is a great base for exploring the Las Vegas strip.

It also promoted a cheap price on a tour of Vegas sights but we didn't really see the need and it is definitely not essential to use to get this deal.

Check in was smooth with no problem except that our room was not ready. It was an early check-in so it wasn't their fault. However, they still offered us a free upgrade to a bigger room on the 34th floor with a view. The room had a long hallway before getting into the sleeping area which they justified as more square footage. Though the hallway was georgous, it had no function. The actual location of the sleeping area and sitting area was quite small. The TV was <26\" and was located way across from the bed. So watching TV from bed was difficult. The bathroom was a good size with a walk-in shower, no tub. The showerhead was an older type and didn't spray out so well. There was what looked like a fridge under the sink area. It was actually just an ice maker. It didn't make any ice but made a loud humming sound every 10 minutes. The best thing about the room was the view. Their were 4 large windows facing West. There was a backdrop of a mountain range, the Orleans casino and what seems like a residential community. During the day it wasn't much but the sunset and night view was well worth it. FITNESS CENTER: The fitness area was one the other side of the property on the 3rd floor. It cost $25 to get in. The provided free bottled water, fruit and towels. The lounge area was clean and nicely decorated. Had about 6 treamills, 2 ellipticles and 2 stationary bikes. All with individual TV monitors. Also, had Olympic freeweights. Staff at the fitness center was friendly and helpful. FOOD AND BARS: Many of restaraunts at the hotel. Food was good. \"The America Grill\" charged your for every little item. Can you believe... $1.50 for a side of ranch? Otherwise food was good. The bar at the \"Dueling Pianos\" is a major rip off. Charged us $9 for a domestic draft beer in a plastic cup. Better place to drink is back at the \"America Grill\". BEST THING: Best thing I liked about NY, NY was the location on the strip. You are across MGM, Tropicana and Excaliber. All connected via a pedestrian bridge. WORST THING: The thing I hated about the hotel was the front desk reps. You always get a different answer from them. We were trying to stay an extra night. The night before, a rep said it would be the same rate as we paid for the previous nights ($109). Then when we came down to book the extra night, a differenct rep said it would be $149 and wouldn't budge. Then that night, we decided to take the $149 and they said it was gone. So we figured we were SOL. That morning another rep said, \"Oh, no problem you can stay another night for $79.\" So frustrating. No one could get their stories straight. Bottom line...

I was very happy with my choice - the four nights I spent there were very comfortable and entertaining. I have seen a few reviews that complain about long check-in lines - since I arrived at 1:30AM I didn't have this trouble. I think the receptionist could tell I was very jet-lagged and ready to drop so he just quickly confirmed everything, showed me a map of the hotel (my hotel needs its own MAP?!) and pointed me in the direction of the correct elevator. My room was on the fifteenth floor of the New Yorker tower and had a view over the roller coaster to the Monte Carlo and some parking lots behind. With two queen beds and a whole lot of extra space it was very comfortable. The air conditioner was a bit noisy but I ended up turning it off - the room kept its cool quite well overnight if the air con was run during the day. I did hear a little \"noise\" from the room next door one morning but it was faint and I say good luck to them. ;-) The marble bathroom was really nice, with a good bath and shower. I was a little bemused though that despite all the signs asking for the conservation of water through reusing towels, the maid changed my towels every day no matter where I hung them. As someone from a dry climate I was really trying to be environmentally friendly but the maid service wasn't cooperating. Perhaps it was because I went in the late afternoon or perhaps it was because it was outside main holiday season, but I didn't think the pool was small and crowded like some other reviewers. I would have liked it to have a deep section (it is 3 feet for most of the pool and 4 in one small area) and perhaps to be a bit cooler given the hot outside temperatures but it was lovely to be able to kick back with a margarita in the pool or on a sun lounge in the late afternoon. I didn't go to Vegas to sit beside a hotel pool all day! Perhaps my one criticism would be of a hot dog place I tried late one evening - it had to be the most pathetic and revolting hot dog I have ever had, coupled with burned fries and a \"root beer\" that tasted like cough medicine. My bad for going down to the lobby half asleep and choosing the first hot dog stand I saw - I think the better one may have been near the bar! I also tried to get room service breakfast on my final morning but on my first two attempts got no answer at all and on the third attempt gave up after waiting on hold for 5 minutes. New York New York is a fun hotel to stay in. It's convenient to the rest of the Strip (although not central - if you don't want to walk, catch the bus or monorail), the casino section is reasonable but not so enormous you get lost and it has great facilities.

Our room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Those are the two things that we were looking for in our stay (most people visiting Vegas don't spend a lot of time in their room). The location was nice and we pretty much walked down the strip during the day. I loved all the food options in the different parts of New York in the hotel. One of the few negative things I could say about this hotel was the fact that our room was pretty much at the opposite side of the hotel and it took a few minutes to walk to our room. I'm not sure if that happens in a lot of other hotels but you pretty much needed to make sure you had everything when you left the hotel room for the day. The pool was also closed when we went (last week of February) and opened the day we left. There was only one pool and it was pretty small, too. I have seen other hotels that have several pools that are open for most of the year. We had problems checking in (the computer said we didn't have a reservation upon check-in), but I don't blame the hotel, that was the fault of the travel site we booked our trip through. The front desk and manager promptly and politely helped us figure things out. I would probably stay somewhere else on our next trip to Vegas, but only because we want to see what the other hotels are like on the strip. This is a good hotel for families with children - big arcade/games and a fun roller coaster. We ended up getting a room that overlooked the roller coaster but there wasn't much noise since the roller coaster closed at 11 p.m. This hotel is great for anyone who wants to stay on the South end of the strip. We found the staff great and never had any problems.

Check in - Possibly the slowest check in I've experienced ever! We arrived about lunch time to a check in queue of about 10 couples and it took 20 mins, simply as they only had 2 receptionists on! Customer service not particularly good, they were definitely just going through the motions. We were asked if we wanted a room with a view for $15 a night more, which we declined as we had not come to vegas to look out the window! When we got to the room we had the best view ever, which made us think we were going to get that room anyway - sneaky! Room - We stayed in room 2480 in the Century Tower on the 24th floor, with a view straight onto the strip facing MGM Grand across the road - amazing view! Bed was very comfortable and very big. Room was a decent size, clean, with a decent bathroom too. The only issue we had with the room is that it has an inter-connecting door with the room next door. This means you can hear everything from the room next door through the door frame! Our first night involved hearing a screaming match between two women for 30 mins at 2.30am! Called security who promptly came up and told them to keep it down. Luckily they left 2 days after and we got a quiet couple next door! Location - New York New York is south strip and a little out of all the action. We constantly used The Deuce buses (stops across the road and outside Monte Carlo next door). Everything looks close, but believe me it isn't! It's just everything is so big! Plus it was 100 degrees constantly, so not good for lots of walking. When I go back to Vegas I will be staying mid strip around Bellagio/ Paris. Pool - It is tiny in relation to the size of the hotel and it was dirty! Loads of bits floating in it, including birds feathers! I didn't even see a single bird in Vegas! Needless to say we only used it once! Restaurants - There is lots of places to eat at New York New York but no buffet restaurant. We ate in America and El Fornaio - both meals fine, but again not fantastic. However the bakery does amazing chocolate croissants! There is plenty of bars at this hotel and places for snacks - there is a frozen daquiri bar that do fab daquiris! Tip - The check out queue was always very long, so I would reccomend express check out through your TV! Vegas was absolutley fantastic, but New York New York was just... ok!

My husband is a theme park fanatic and said he'd only take me to Vegas if I booked a hotel with decent attractions! I origionally booked the Strat but was put off when they didn't reply to any of my e-mails and when I got a letter from my tour company saying that some of the facilities were closed at the strat and the area is a bit run-down. I chose NYNY as my friends were in Vegas at the same time on their honeymoon in the MGM Grand and I wanted something that was sligtly more up-market than the Strat but not as prices as the MGM. The upgrade I was charged was the best \u00a3100 - odd, that I've ever spent! We spent the week going in and out of most of the hotels on the strip and I actually felt a bit smug as we kept saying that we preferred nearly every aspect of our hotel than the others and we were glad we didn't splash the cash on the MGM as it was very, very, crowded and far too big for us although lovely just to visit for a few hours. (Having said that, had a great night in the West Wing Bar there) We had a Park Avenue Deluxe Room and even though it was a smoking room it was still big, comfortable and well equipt. Didn't expect I-pod dock! & we had a great side strip View of the Monte Carlo and even with the Rollercoaster going past all the time, we couln't hear it at all. All the hotel facilities were great and good value too. We hired a cabana on one day and found it to be great value for money. We were also given a list of promotions on at the NYNY & Monte Carlo that helped a lot money-wise with Discount on the Restaurants and bars and also show tickets & Rides etc. There are some great places to eat and drink at NYNY too which was part of the attraction for us. and we ate at the America restaurant on a few ocassions as the food was excellent quality and value in great surroundings ($17.95 for a 2 course steak dinner and a beer in a strip hotel is a bargain!) I also can't fault the service in any of the establishments, the staff in America, The front desk and by the pool were efficient, smart, knowledgeable and attentive, there was one exception to that on the casino floor, but he was just my bad luck charm and a cue to stop gambling away my holiday spends! I loved Vegas, and i will be back when I can afford it and would reccomend NYNY to anyone, we are glad we splashed out but decided that when we go again and the budget might not stretch that far, we liked the south side of the strip and would also consider Excalibur and Tropicana as cheaper options.", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Kilbride", "Title": "\u201cHotel good, would probably stay elsewhere next time\u201d", "Author": "lyndseyEK", "ReviewID": "UR41867605", "Content": "My partner and I were in Las Vegas to get married.

Dined in Gallaghers and the Italian restaurant both were really good. The pool area was really busy and very cramped with NO space between loungers. Most of the pool area is shaded until at least 12 noon. But once the sun hits there is no sun brolleys for shade. Good waitress service for food and drink at the pool. Another good thing is that if the pool loungers are unattended for more than 30mins the lifeguards remove the towels and allow others to use,So it stops people \"reserving beds early in the morning and not showing up till lunchtime\" All in all this hotel is ok for a few nights stay but if you are expecting 5 star luxury go somewhere else.

We booked the Summer Escape package that got us a Park Avenue Room with a few extras (2 for 1 on many coupons). Upon arrival, we were greeted by a warm front desk attendant Jessica. She had upgraded us to the Broadway Room on the 17th floor in the New Yorker Tower. There are many towers to the hotel, as it's designed like NY Skyscrapers. Broadway Room: The room was very spacious and had a great view of MGM, and the hotels around it (Hooters, Excalibur, Luxor, Tropican, Mandalay) and the roller coaster. Bed was firm and the sheets were alright. I think I found a cigarette burn, but I didn't pay too much attention to it (Noticed it on the last day). The bathroom was marbled floor and counter with a sliding shower door. An Armoire with coat hangers. My complaint was with the 25\" tv approx 15-20 ft from the bed on an angle. Nothing major, since we didn't go to Vegas to spend time in our hotel room :). The room is about 450sq.ft about a bit bigger than the base room at MGM (Grand Tower). Food: We ate at the following places in NYNY Hotel. Il Fornaio (Breakfast) - Service was fairly fast. Had the Corned Beef Hash with poached eggs, while my gf had a veggie omelet. Both were excellent and very fresh. This was part of our deal and we got it at 2/1 deal. Sirrocos (Snack) - Typical pizza place, nothing special. Loaded pizza with toppings, wasn't as thin/crispy as I would like it to be. Ate here twice, was fairly satisfied. Greenbergs Deli - Rueben with Matzoh Ball Soup. Both meals were a great way to end my trip and left me mighty full for the day. America's - If you order the turkey burger here, please ensure it is fully cooked. I had to return mine once as it was still a bit red inside. However, the waitress was more than accommodating and offered us a bowl of Chicken Noodle Soup (very filling). If you are there and looking to eat on the cheap, take advantage of their cheap eats (AYCE Pancakes, 11.99 16oz Ribeye, 14.95 Ribeye/crab legs). I had the Ribeye and it was one of the better steaks I've had. The nachos as well are filling and loaded with your typical toppings. Casino: Always a machine available, casino seemed to be quite slow at times. A fair bit of tables ranging from $10 and up including a rapid roulette table that takes your credit card. Daily slot/blackjack tournaments if you are a players card member (Free to sign up). Drink service is fairly decent for a casino of that size (I've seen worse at MGM or Mandalay) and there's a cigarette lady walking around as well. Nightlife: Bar at Time's Square has dueling pianos which they take requests (for a tip) and will play your favourite songs. LOTS of fun and a group can have a great time. Did not check out the clubs as that's not my scene. Also if you are a beer lover, check out Pour 24. An amazing selection of beers from all over America. My favs are Alaskan Amber Ale and Black Butte. From what we were told, Zumanity is an \"Erotic\" show, so if this is not your type, look into Love or Ka or O. All of which you can get for a good deal at Tix At Half, located by Planet Hollywood. Overall I did enjoy my stay here at the hotel, more than I did at MGM.

We had a spacious room with a giant bathroom, but (although lovely decorated) very uncomfortable bed, the matress was way too firm. The pool is (as said before) too small, another downside is that is located between buildings what makes it impossible to get a little breeze. Being European, I dont really like big portions and lots of meat, but the restaurants in the nyny only provide food like that. To get some decent healthy food you will have to go to the MGM on the other side of the road. At checking in, the woman at the desk will probably ask you to provide a second credit card, but make sure to provide only 1.

The bathroom was nice, great space, marble flooring. We had 2 queen beds (very comfortable), a desk, 2 chairs, and a nice wall unit for a dresser and tv cabinet.

We toured around Las Vegas for a few hours, and when we returned we checked in with ease, and picked up our luggage in minutes. The Hotel was nice, millions spent on the interior to make it resemble New York. The night club ROK was ok alot of younger people, but that is to be expected i guess. They were running a promotion while we were there, that gave us free entry to the night club and free drinks for the ladies. I think the guys had to pay a $25.00 cover charge to get in. We only ate one meal in the hotel itself, and it was extremely disappointing. We ordered burgers from the \"American Diner\" in the hotel and it was disgusting!!!! It was very obvious that they did not make it fresh to order, as it was so dry and you could barely choke it down. We demanded a refund, and they reluctantly gave it to us. Only big complaint about the hotel is that there is no buffet. A number of different restaurants, but no buffet. So we only ate one meal there. Our room was clean and comfortable. We had an ice maker right in our room, no coffee maker though. I suppose it is because they want you to go downstairs to star bucks and pay $5.00 for a coffee. A coffee and a muffin was almost $9.00. Casino is huge, we didn't check out the pool at all, as there were too many things to see, in such a short time. Our room was cleaned everyday. FYI, don't leave your change on the night stand, the cleaning lady might think it is a tip!!! I left about $10.00 in change on the night stand, and the cleaning lady took it. It was no big deal. Just a little surprising. LOL Check out was smooth, and again we left our luggage with the Concierge, as we had to check out at 1 pm and our flight wasn't leaving until 6.

The bathroom had a bath with shower attachment and solid sliding shower doors on the bath - pressure to the shower was very good and all the usual toiletries were provided as well as ample towels & face cloth. There was a vending macine and ice point on our floor and an ice bucket was provided in our room. Wi-fi and hard wired internet was available although you didi have t o pay for this. No complaints about the room at all - we were very comfortable during our stay although we did not spend too much time in it - just showering between various tourist visits and for sleeping. The rest of the hotel was a real WOW factor for us - being our first time in Las Vegas we were absolutely gobsmacked with the entrance, the casino and the decor throughout. We really felt as if we were part of the gambling capital of the world and it exceeded all our expectations. The choice of dining within was very good - posh or fast food - make your choice and the prices were very reasonable. The Italian restaurant IL FORNAIO was so good that we ate there for two evenings - the second time after we had been through the Excelsior and Luxor looking for something to eat but nothing appealed. The food and service was exceptional and although there was a queue on both nights to get in - this moved very fast. The pool area was well kept and big enough. The casino had a good variety of slots and other gambling available and was very lively. Our check-in went very smoothly and we did not have to wait long at all (it was a Monday that we checked-in) and the reception staff were always very helpful when we asked any questions. We used the ground transport service (SHOWTIME) which you will see as soon as you go out of the arrivals door onto the airport concourse - there are several ground transport companies there. We booked a return ticket with them as it was slightly cheaper to do so - you call them back when you check in to your hotel to arrange your return pick-up time; we had trouble getting through to them because they had a fault on their phones but eventually we did get through and the chap I spoke to was very curtious and booked our return with no problems at all. I beleive that if there are more than 2 of you travelling it is cheaper to get a taxi - we paid about USD 15 each for our return fare.

Our rooms were cleaned daily by the maid and beds were made up to, the only thing that lacked in the Broadway Room was there were no Tea/Coffee Facilities or a Mini Bar to get a quick drink or snack to eat. The bathroom was nice and clean and also had a powerful hairdryer that I didnt need to take with me. Also you can use the room telephone to ring local numbers and will not be charged any extra as you already pay $3.00 per night compulsory.

The New York New York Hotel is breathtaking itself as it has tall buildings and so much to do just inside as well as outside, the casino is really big inside and they have several bars, shops, and clubs. The pool is fairly busy but in July its too hot to sunbathe so many people do find themselves under some shade or in the pool. We both enjoyed the roller coaster at the hotel so make sure you definetly do this during your stay and visit the Ben and Jerrys own store to enjoy a lovely ice cream. I would advise to take light clothing in July, plenty of Suncream and sunglasses, it is very hot, the tempertaures were around 46 degrees each day. Also you can make Las Vegas as cheap as you want or expensive as you want so just spend with your means and you will still have a fatastic time.

If I was going back I'd probably try to go for one of the other casinos like the Palms or even Caesars as they have better shopping, are mid-strip, and have cooler bars.", "Date": "August 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "York, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cA fun hotel and casino with great food options.\"\u201d", "Author": "Crash412", "ReviewID": "UR36281736", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at NYNY and I really enjoyed it. I'd previously stayed at MGM Grand and TI (Treasure Island), and NYNY was equal to or better than those two (and I have nothing bad to say about either one!). We came for a wedding of 2 friends, and many of their other friends also stayed at NYNY, and this is how it really shined. It's many restaurants and bars offered us ample meeting places. ESPNZone became our de facto headquarters, and I enjoyed great food and drink at Nine Fine Irishmen. 24 Pour offered a good beer selection 24 hours a day, and the Bar at Times Square was a fun piano bar to hang out at.. Even the pizza we grabbed from a stand on the casino floor was excellent and we enjoyed a great late-night meal at \"America\", its 24-hour restaurant. (I highly recommend the Mac & Cheese) The casino staff seemed very friendly, particularly at the sports book, where they took the time to explain to us how the odds worked and to bet against the spread. Our room was attractive but unspectacular, but was comfortable and very clean. We had a view of the roller coaster and worried about noise. It was not an issue for us, though I speculate it may have been noisy for patrons further down our floor. The casino has a very nice fitness center attached to its spa. It's $20/day to use, comparable to or cheaper than the gyms at the other Vegas hotels I've been to. Discounted multi-day passes are available, and I believe it's included if you purchase spa treatments. Selection of fitness/weightlifting equipment was very good and the treadmill I used was nice. Temperature of the fitness center was a bit high for my personal comfort level. NY NY's only real drawback, in my opinion, is its location near far south end of the Strip. If you plan to spend most of your time at NY NY, Excalibur, MGM Grand, Luxor, Monte Carlo, and Mandalay Bay, it's perfect. Be prepared to hike or take cabs or the monorail from MGM if you prefer things in the middle or north end of the strip.

Hard to fault it really - it has similar weaknesses to other resorts on the Strip I think. The room was well furnished with quality furniture and a nice comfy yet contemporary theme to it.

The pricing is a little steep (no suprise there) but I guess my complaint would be the portions were too large. I'd have been happier if they charged me less and got less as a result. The two things I really didn't like though: Long queues at reception to either check in or out (although from what I hear this is common at most resorts on the Strip).

Further it was a reasonable price for the room (mid-pricing level for the strip). We stayed for 7 nights so I our experience was a bit longer than most. So first the good: Whoever said the walk from the parking deck was long must have been 90 and carrying an oxygen bottle. It was EXACTLY 100 paces from the vestibule of the parking deck (entrance to ENCLOSED walkway is on 3rd floor of parking deck) to the actual hotel and another 30 paces to the escalator which drops you right next to the registration desk. Registration was quick (Friday afternoon, approx. 3PM PST) and effortless. They had all the right information, including the rate and gave us a room on the 20th floor of the Century Tower (closest tower to the registration desk, I might add). Room 2077 was a bit far from the elevators, but they'd asked us what we wanted and I chose to be farther away from the noise of the elevators. And it was QUIET! The room (Park Avenue room) was no better/bigger than you would get at a Courtyard, but we also didn't pay more than you would at a Courtyard. Room was clean, smoke free (requested), appointments were appropriate and comfortable, and maid service was EXCELLENT! Despite not getting enough shampoo towards the end of my stay, they were quick, polite, and very courteous. We called for a 2nd blanket the first day and it was delivered within 10 minutes. I'd say that the \"hotel\" part of the property is fabulous! As for two restaurants worth mentioning, Greenberg's deli was great for lunch and Scirraco's pizza was awesome (even for a Chicagoan who loves his deep dish!). Dueling Pianos at Times Square was fun! Rollicking good time! I'd suggest paying the extra $$ to get preferred seating if you plan on being there a long time. Now for the bad: The other restaurants are overrated and have very odd hours (can't get a donut at Stadium Snacks until after 11AM??!?!?). Hotdog stand not open late to get a quick dog, nachos, or pretzel. The breakfast buffet at Chin Chin's was very VERY disappointing! Very small selections, no omelet bar, pastries were VERY stale; not a deal at $16 per. Il Fornaio (shop, not restaurant) was okay for something quick (bagel, croissant) but not great. ESPN Zone was terrible. No other way to describe it (if I wanted a microwaved hamburger, I'd have done it myself!). Chin Chin's (dinner) was a glorified (and expensive) Panda Express, and the waiter could have cared less whether we were there or not. America is adequate for breakfast, but pass for all other meals (soup was COLD!). The pool is SMALL!!! I MEAN SMALL!!! DID I MENTION THE POOL IS VERY SMALL???Other than the hottub, no other amenities at the pool except for a volleyball net spanning the middle, making it difficult for anyone to do laps. It's also mostly shaded, not much sun hitting the pool area. Note that they post that no outside food/beverages will be allowed, however I brought (4) small bottles of water in with us and nobody gave me any grief. The casino has nice atmosphere (open, high ceilings so you don't feel claustrophobic) and unique design. Sports TV's over each table is nice touch. Cocktail waitresses come by often when playing at the tables (not so much at the machines). Dealers, however, were quite rude, not caring whether you were there or not. Not fun (Excalibur Blackjack dealer-Jimmy....HE was fun!!!). Didn't tip too often (despite playing Pai Gow for about 6 hours one night). Shopping stinks unless you want Harley gear or cheap Vegas souvineirs One word sums up the NYNY, however: CROWDED! \"Streets\"/aisles are too narrow to get around without bumping into EVERYONE! By day 5, couldn't take it anymore. (Why would you put a post for the roller coaster right in the middle of two popular food stands and on the way to the main bathrooms?!!??) Way too many people crowding into that place. Need to figure out some crowd control/traffic control. Overall: Hotel good.

It was the worst service I have ever experienced. We booked 3 rooms total.

When we finally got the keys the room that one of us went to was in the basement! All the windows were blacked out and it felt like a prison. So we went back up to trade rooms they gave us another room but when we got there it was dirty! So we went back down and they said that they would clean it but that it would take 2 hours. So we waited 2 hours and when we went back up it was still dirty! They did upgrade the room but we basically wasted a good amount of time dealing with this. The second thing that happened was in our room. We had gone to bed late but were awakened at 8am by drilling and hammering above our room. We tried to sleep through it but it was ridiculous so I called the front desk to ask them to stop because we were sleeping she told us she would take care of it. It stops and then starts again after 5 minutes. They didn't even give us a call to let us know what was happening! Long story short we got compensated one day and moved rooms. This would've been good but when we went down to pay for the rooms they charged us more for the rooms then they quoted like $30 more per day per room because they average the room rates. Also the third room we got did not lock properly and we also passed people in the hall whose room keys did not work and had to go down to front desk to have it fixed.

When I got to the room, a desk clerk came running to tell me that security had already opened the safe and my items were at security. When I went to claim them they told me there was no cash, only jewlery and my camera. I complained to everybody but no one listened. I told them security should not have opened the safe without me present, but they said another security person was present. They would not give me any names or explain anything to me. They treated me like a liar and told me they had no liability. They never returned my money. I will never go to this horrible hotel again.

Check in was very straight forward, we were upgraded without asking and at no extra cost which was a nice surprise. Our room had a view of the MGM with the mountains in the background - lovely. The TV was very old, and the selection of channels limited however we weren't there to watch TV so this was a minor comment. The bathroom was clean, large, the shower was ideal (not the pathetic trickle I've experienced in some hotels), and there was plenty of shelf space to store our toiletries. The service at the hotel was great. We had difficulty operating the safe (those who had vacated the room before us had not left it unlocked). We called reception and within 10 minutes someone was up to fix it, including joking with us that we could split the contents (there was nothing in it though!). My bag was delayed and I received a voice message (as I was out of the room at the time of the call) to say that my bag had arrived. I called the baggage desk and again within 10 minutes my bag was delivered to the room. Room service was another pleasant experience (although the charges added were very high - as is the case with most places in fairness). Food was lovely, large portions, and was delivered within 40 minutes (we were advised of this when we ordered). One thing to note is that the hotel is the $21 phone charge that was applied ($3 per day for a 7 day stay). I used the phone three times (to check up on my bag), and obviously there would be a charge for that but it appears this charge applies regardless. $21 is not a big deal, however when you are in Vegas you may have gambled all your money away before checkout! The location of this hotel is not perfect, but its not awful either. There is a bit of walking involved if you want to go to the Mirgage/Ceasers etc (about 30 minutes, but the heat is impactful). There are plenty of air conditioned casinos along the way that you can pop into to cool down. Overall I think this hotel is great, although I would be tempted to stay further down the strip next time. For tourists please note: I looked online into buying tickets for a few shows and the prices were very high. There are numerous \"Tickets for Less\" booths along the strip that offer great deals.

I stayed in the NY NY once in 2003 and it was great - exactly on par with the Paris - one of Vegas's really fun \"theme\" hotel/casinos. I stayed again in 2009 only to find best part of the casino area had been completely ripped out (the Central Park themed bridge and trees) and replaced with abstract gaudy neon swirls and a pit of slot machines. The New York theme was pretty much lost as a result (though once you venture out of the casino area into the restaurant section, the theme becomes evident again with the tenement style buildings, delis, pizzarias, etc.). The rooms are spotless but haven't been updated (e.g., projection TVs). However, the price did reflect this decline (at $79, the room was about $40 cheaper per night than the Paris). As an aside, it seems like Vegas, generally, is moving away from theme hotels/casinos like the NY NY, Paris, Venetian, etc. to just super-luxury (the Wynn, etc) and the action is moving further north on the Strip. The bottom line is the NY NY was a great value (very clean with good location and fair pricing), but it's a bit disappointing to see it starting to decline, even if the price has been adjusted accordingly.

We booked through MGM Vacations which included a complementary upgrade to a Park Avenue room (didn't try the $20 trick - from reviews I read online they haven't accepted it in 2009). We were offered to upgrade to a Spa Suite for $50/night extra but declined. The room was sufficient but on the smaller side... can't imagine what their \"basic\" room is like! I will say the bathroom was amazing. The shower had PERFECT water pressure and a huge sink to spread out all our \"stuff\". That was probably the best part of the room! We did mention on our reservation that we were celebrating our 1-year anniversary and without asking received a beautiful south-looking strip view.... basically looking out over the statue of liberty's head. That was a very nice gift from the hotel! We did use the pool one afternoon and had a great time. It's smaller, but not as \"basic\" as some reviewers make it out to be. I've stayed at the Flamingo two other times, so I can say this is not the best pool, but we were able to get chairs (we went out about 2:30pm...after we'd lost our money for the day!) and were even talked into a game of pool volleyball. Drinks are expensive, but as to be expected (we brought waterbottles of our own mixes, but those ran out before we left). We didn't try the Monte Carlo pool, but overall the area at NYNY exceeded my expectations. We ate three times at the hotel - Americana for breakfast which had good food but was a bit too expensive for our taste (about $40 for two pancakes and two coffees), the Hot Dog shop which was quick and tasty, and the pizza joint, Sirrico's Pizza. This was the BEST value! $17 for a large, doughy pizza which served as dinner one night and breakfast the next (hey! we're young). OH- we also had ice cream scoops at Ben & Jerry's which were huge and a nice splurge to end our vacation. The location of NYNY was just \"ok\" for us. We spent some time at MGM and Planet Hollywood, which are a quick walk, but the majority of our visit we were farther north (Bellagio, Ceasers, Venetian) and up to Fremont St. Next time we'll stay higher up the strip so we're not spending 40 min walking every time we leave the hotel!", "Date": "June 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "tasmania", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel casino\u201d", "Author": "tasmaniabula", "ReviewID": "UR33416003", "Content": "before we went read some bad reviews about thishotel casino,my wife and myself and freinds thought it was great,staff were freindly rooms clean,every thing you needed was there if you did leave the casino afoot bridge took you to the mandalay bay excalibur luxor casinos,some people must be very hard to please we loved it and would recommend.", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bakersfield", "Title": "\u201cWe were disappointed!\u201d", "Author": "chuckg2", "ReviewID": "UR33238911", "Content": "We stayed at the NY-NY Hotel after receiving an internet offer for an upgraded room at a rate lower than the rates offered at our favorite hotels (Paris, Plazzo, and The Hard Rock). Check-in took about 30 minutes due to only one counter being open. There were approx. 20 people in line when we arrived at 2:00pm, but when the line increased to about 40 people they opened 6 more counters. The room on the 25th floor overlooking the pool was clean, the bed was very comfortable and had a partial view of the Las Vegas Strip. The room could only be described as average, however, being very small with a small bathroom. We could observe the roller coaster from our window, passing by every few minutes, but could not hear it so it was not a problem at night. We also didn't hear any noise from the adjoining rooms that previous reviewers had complained about. We did have a problem both nights with the DRUNKS in the hallways returning to their rooms around 3:00am yelling, laughing, singing, trying to open our door with their cardkeys, slamming doors, and anything else they could do to make sure everyone was awake. Our major complaint about the hotel was the casino. This hotel, as well as several others seems to have removed the traditional types of slot machines (with bars, cherries, jackpots, etc.) and replaced them with newer video game types of machines. Even if we could figure out how to play these new video machines they require larger bets, so instead of losing 1-3 credits each time, you now can lose 15-375 credits each time. (The casinos switched over their slot machines a few years ago to accepting only currency and not accepting coins). Our second complaint was the old style television in the room. Also the selection of channels was very limited. (We didn't go to Las Vegas to watch TV, but it would have been nice to have FOX News, and HBO/Showtime movie channels like the hotels provide). All these changes in the casino caused us to do our gambling at other casinos, thereby causing the NY-NY to lose our business at their restaurants, souvenier shops, shows, etc. We highly recommend the Mon Ami Gabi restaurant at the Paris Hotel. The prices are very reasonable by Las Vegas standards, the food is great, and if you request a table outside on the patio (go after dark, because of the summer heat) you get a great view of the water fountain show across the street at the Bellagio Hotel). One major improvement at the NY-NY (as well as the Paris and the Rio) was that they seem to have gotten rid of the annoying \"Time Share\" sales people that endlessly harrassed the hotel guests and visitors. We keep hearing how the bad economy is hurting Las Vegas, but the crowds on the sidewalks at night are still there (even during mid-week). Maybe the visitors are staying outside enjoying the free sights, rathering than venturing inside the casinos to try and figure out the new confusing slot machines.", "Date": "June 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, QC", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at the NYNY\u201d", "Author": "happy_honeymooners09", "ReviewID": "UR33194351", "Content": "We stayed at the NYNY for 4 days and had a great time.

We enjoyed the atmosphere of the Times square food court area. We ate at Fornaio and Gonzalez Y Gonzalez - both were good. The Chin Chin breakfast buffet was not bad, but could have had more choices (and the coffee was awful compared to the Fornaio). We checked out the pool one morning - unfortunately it doesn't get the sun until later in the day so we didn't stay there long. There was also a strange sewer smell sometimes (maybe it's near their garbage?), but we seemed to be the only people bothered by this so maybe it depends on which pool chairs you pick.

The hotel offers wireless internet for $14.99 per day which I had to use for my business. The meeting room area was very nice and wi-fi did work in the rooms, which was nice. I've stayed in some hotels before where the hotel wi-fi does not work in the meeting rooms Depending on what tower you are staying in, the meeting rooms can be a hike to get to. During 15 minute breaks you have to move quickly if you want to get to your room and back. Although this is nothing new as my experience staying in the Rio was similar. Overall, the hotel was great, the casino offered a ton of different restaurants to choose from and staff was helpful.", "Date": "May 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay, convenient location, would stay again\u201d", "Author": "polarbear123", "ReviewID": "UR31021260", "Content": "Got a great rate on the hotel through my Players Club card. Check in was a breeze. Rooms: Upside: Great View. Stayed in a Park Ave Room. We overlooked MGM, Excalibur, Tropicana and the airport no extra charge. Room was very comfortable. The bed was nice and the room was clean. It was a handicap room, so there wasn't a bath tub but the shower was nice and newly renovated. Close to the elevator. Downsides: I had asked for a smoking room and got a non smoking one. My boyfriend, the smoker, said he didn't care because of the great view. In the bathroom the marble floors got a little slick when wet though and the grout lines were deep and hurt a little to stand on. The safe was locked when we checked into the room so we needed to call maintenance to open it up. That took at most 10 minutes and the man was very pleasant. You could hear the hallway noise but it was not overly loud or disturbing. Actually reminded me of hotels in \"real\" NY. Casino: NYNY had a nice fun atmosphere. The casino wasn't too big or too small. The dealers were friendly and the minimums were reasonable even on the weekends. Slots seemed to be paying off. We didn't win much but we saw quite a few hit when we were going around. Pool: The pool was on the small side and didn't get sun until around noon. During the week it was fairly empty. But all in all it was nice enough. 3 hot tubs were nice as well. Could have gone to Monte Carlo to use their pool as they are partnering up for the summer, but didn't make it over there. Food and Drink: We ate at America and Nine Fine Irishmen. America was average but the service was friendly. I would compare it to any casual dining restaurant. Nine Fine Irishment was a cute pub and the burgers were good. We also went to the dueling piano bar to watch the game and then stuck around for the entertainment. Drinks were regular Vegas prices. Pizza place was good for a late bite to eat as well. Next time we definitely want to try Gallaghers. Location: One of the best locations I've stayed at. The walkway connects with MGM where you can take the monorail to the North end of the strip. The other walkway connects to Excalibur and you can take the tram down to Mandalay Bay.

Having no coffee maker in your room in my opinion is bad. Even budget hotels have mini coffee makers in the room. Is the hotel that hard up for money that they can\u2019t give their customers a small perk like that? My other beef was no fridge in the room. As hot as it is in Vegas, getting back to your room to have a cold bottle of water or beer is nice. We bought a case of beer for the room, and had to put it on ice every day. Good thing we brought a soft cooler. We used it at the pool every day. The pool, good luck getting a chair. If your lucky, and get one, good for you. We filled the cooler with booze every day (no glass aloud), and made our own drinks at the pool. On our 4th day there, we were told we were not suppose to do that as it took business away from the pool bar (8 beers in a bucket of ice was 30 bucks\u2026.come on, I can buy 2 cases of beer for that price). I said we had been doing this for 4 days and you\u2019re just telling us now that we can\u2019t bring our own booze down to the pool. Needless to say, we finished what was in our cooler, and left. They told me it was a min of one drink per person at a time for personal booze to be brought down to the pool. Like I\u2019m going to go up to my room on the 30th floor just to refill my cup\u2026NOT! We did eat at a couple of great restaurants while in Vegas. Wolf Gang Puck\u2019s in the MGM Grande. \u2013 5 ***** stars The Buffett at Planet Hollywood on weekends has a great buffet, all you can eat seafood (including Alaskan king crab legs) get them steamed for you as they are cold. The Monte Carlo\u2019s buffet was poor. \uf04c The ESPN restaurant in NY NY is great. Try the smokehouse burger. I swear it is worth every penny for it. My husband ate 3 of them during the 4 days were stayed. Wear your running shoes a lot for just walking the strip. Your feet will thank you. If you are staying more than 2 days, get a bus pass. It will cost you 15 dollars for 3 days worth. This way you can go downtown to Fremont Street, or go to the outlet mall, or just take the bus \u00bd way down the strip and walk back to your hotel.

I have been to Las Vegas 3 times in the past 8 years and this was the first time I stayed at the NY NY. A family member had recommeded it. I booked three rooms back in February for this weekend. I had signed up on their website to receive email specials and booked at a very good rate. Our rooms ranged from $65 on Thursday to $149 for Saturday. Of course you always pay more on the weekends. We checked in around 7:30pm; had to wait about 25minutes. Not sure why they didn't have more staff on hand but it wasn't too bad. The staff were quick and friendly. We had a Park Avenue room, a step up from their standard Skyline room. The room was non-smoking with 2 queen beds which were very comfortable. Plenty of room for two people. The bathroom was also large, all marble with a shower and tub. The vanity is in the bathroom. My only complaint about the bathroom is that the tub did not have a safety bar, the tub was a bit high and slippery. I would recommend if you travel with an elder, you ask for a tub mat. I agree with other reviews, all the rooms should have a coffee pot. I did request a room away from the elevator and roller coaster. We were on the back side of the building, two small windows overlooked the parking garage. It was quite a walk to and from the elevator but pretty quiet. I never heard the roller coaster at all. It is only supposed to run from 11am to 11pm. The rooms were clean and maid service prompt. No complaints there. In other reviews, I noticed people stating how big this hotel/casino is. As far as Vegas hotels go, this one is average. I think the casino floor is smaller than many others. The atmosphere is very cute. The shops & restaurants do resemble the streets of NY. Greenberg's Deli is a must if you like good ole fashion sandwiches. I prefer the hot corn beef on rye. For $8.00 you get a huge sandwich and they have a great potato salad. Plenty of food for two to split. The French bakery is to die for. Wonderful pasteries and sandwiches & soups. And of course, there is a Starbucks on the \"street\" corner. We ate the American a few times. $3.50 for a coffe was a bit much, but the food was very good as well as the service. Breakfasts run around $10.00. From the outside it looks small, but the restaurant opens up and is very large. A must see is the US map on the ceiling. Another must is the dualing piano bar. There is a cover charge and drinks are bit pricey also but alot of fun. If you call ahead and reserve a table, the cover charge is $25.00pp, but for special occasions it is woth it. Of course, be prepared; they will only honor your song request if it is attached to a $20 or better..! Several of the bars do have happy hour specials. Be sure to check those out at the NY Ny. We actually visited the Mandalay Bay hotel and went to the Rum Jungle for a happy hour. Their jungle juice was very tasty..!! The Monte Carlo Brew House Pub has a good happy hour also. You can choose from a list of $5 beverages and appetizers. We ordered all five appetizers and fed 5 people. Very good food and portions. I had 4 sky vodka cosmos and for $20.00..!! This bar has several big screen tvs to kick back and watch the games. A good place to visit. The pool is not one of top rated in Vegas. Be prepared, it is on the back side of the hotel and at this time of year, the sun hit the pool area around 11:00am. But to get a chair, you must be down there at 9:00 when they open. The Monte Carlo is an affilate with NY NY, and your room key will work in their pool also. The Monte Carlo is across the street and does have 3 pools, not real big ones, but a bigger area. Again, get there right when the pool opens for a chair. The NY NY is a good place to stay. I would recommend it. The staff was pleasant, the rooms clean and had alot of fun ammendities.

We requested a rollaway bed for one of our party, twice before arriving. We then asked upon check in and they still did not bring it up until we called Reception yet again to remind them. The room was clean and basic, we did not spend a lot of time there so this was all we needed. Breakfast was not included but you can eat fantastic all-you-can eat buffets at most of the hotels in Vegas (we had a great champagne brunch buffet at the Flamingo and the best buffet in town, without a doubt was at the Rio....we'd never before seen so many varieties of food available!) There are plenty of restaurants, cages and fast food chains within the hotel itself. It's easy to pop downstairs for a quick bite to eat, an ice cream or even for a drink in one of the many bars. The hotel has loads to see and do. In Vegas each hotel is like a resort in itself. New York New York is really well themed and there are so many little details which really add to the feel of being in New York at the same time. The interior of the hotel is really well designed and replicates streets and monuments in New York. Each building which is part of the hotel is a replica of a famous building...the Chrysler Building, Statue of Liberty, Empire State, and so on. Having visited most of the main hotels in Vegas, I thought that theming-wise, New York New York was one of the most effective along with Paris and The Venetian. New York New York is a great base for sightseeing and has everything you could need to explore the Strip. It's within walking distance of the Mandalay Bay, Luxor and Excalibur at one end of the Strip (and even the famous Vegas Sign nearby) and then in the other direction is in walking distance of many more hotels including Paris, the Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, Caesars Palace, and more. The MGM Grand, directly opposite to New York New York, is linked by a walkway andcontains a monorail stop within the hotel. So it is very easy to get around from the hotel. I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel that is quite centrally located on the Strip.

My boyfriend and I had never been to Vegas so we weren't really sure where to stay. We booked our vacation with WestJet vacations and they did a great job of giving us lots of different hotel options for a great price. We chose the New York New York because it looked hip, fun, and was decently priced. We arrived in Vegas at 10:00pm and had about a 10 minute wait at check-in. The check-in lady was VERY nice and got us checked in promptly. She even upgraded us to a Park Avenue Deluxe room for free. (We had booked a Skyline room) We got just what we had asked for-a non-smoking room with a King size bed. We stayed in the NyNy Tower room 1110 and the view was amazing. If you are older or have kids I wouldn't suggest asking how far of a walk the room is from the elevator, because my boyfriend and I are both physically able to walk perfectly fine and found it to be a very long walk to the elevator from our room. Our room was great. VERY clean, shower worked well (good pressure) and the bed was EXTREMELY comfortable. I haven't slept that well in a while. The mandatory $3 a night fee for the telephone came in handy because we made many phone calls to get show tickets/times/reservations. When we couldn't find any extra pillows we called down to housekeeping and they brought us up some extra ones along with extra towels within 5 minutes of me making the call. GREAT service! There were only two things we didn't like about the room. 1. The shower doesn't drain very well. It wasn't until we got back to Ottawa that we realized that they actually do this on purpose to try to get you to conserve the water. (You end up soaking your feet while you're showering basically) 2. Our room was overlooking the rollercoaster so you would hear a lot of rattling from the metal and some yelling from the riders. It wasn't unbareable by any means, but it may be a nuisance for some people. The hotel itself has lots of great food options and they really try to keep with the NY theme. Casinos are all really smokey and the hotel always seemed really busy. The night before we checked out we called down to the desk to see if a late check-out would be a possibility. They allowed us to check-out at twelve noon even though check-out was supposed to be at 11am. Our flight only left at 11:30pm that night so we had a long day and wanted to check out as late as possible. Upon check out, we had some luggage we needed to put aside so we brought it to the Bell Desk and they dealt with it very quickly and stored it away safely. It was fast and friendly. Upon check-out we only waited about 3 minutes and the lady at the check-out counter simply asked for our names and then told us we could keep the key as a souvenir, and thanked us for staying there. That was it. Simple and fast. My boyfriend and I are not fussy travelers and we are satisfied if our bed is comfortable enough to fall asleep in, the room is clean and that we feel safe throughout our stay.

Check-in was long and drawn out, it seemed as if the person helping us had no clue what she was doing. We were upgraded to a Park Avenue with a \"deluxe strip view,\" and I am so grateful we were, because based on our \"upgrade,\" I NEVER would have wanted to see a Skyline Room. The Park Avenue was set up in a very strange manner. The armoire seemed way too big for the room and was oddly placed. Also, there was no closet. The bathroom was tiny. The beds were incredibly uncomfortable, and the linens were something you might expect to find in a rundown motel. I don't understand what was done when the rooms were renovated because it seemed very outdated. My biggest complaint was the fact that housekeeping did not show up until around 3pm each day. Everyone in my party is an early-riser, so our room was always vacated early, yet we would come back around 3pm to find housekeeping just coming in to fix the room. I am just glad that it wasn't warm enough to sit by the pool because the pool area looked very disappointing, especially when compared to others on the strip. There were some positives about the hotel - the 24 hour essentials shop was a great place to get everything you need.

There are also lots of eateries downstairs and at the other hotels nearby. My favourite was the Mexican place 'Gonzales Gonzales' for the food, not for the service however. Another plus point for this hotel is the relatively clean air. Some hotels, such as the Venitian or Mandalay Bay, seem to have the idea that an attack of chemical smells throughout their premises will increase guest comfort or make them spend more at the games.

There are loads of shops inside including two H\u00e4agen-Dazs, A Houdini shop, Coyote Ugly bar and nightclub upstairs, various clothes shops and of course about 1,000 slot machines, poker & roulette tables. Not forgetting the awsome roller coaster ride that goes from inside the hotel out of about the 7th floor (I think) and loop the loops all around the outside. We where here as we got married in the Tropicana Hotel across the road, what a day they where great and it was well worth the money. This hotel is in a prime loaction on the strip and a little walk will take you to all the other well known hotels, all of which will blow you away. I could quite easily say we are addicted to Las Vegas and could easliy go back every year. We also did the Grand Canyon with Maverick helicopters booked before we went out.

The location is good because it is connected to MGM which has a lot of action, gambling and otherwise but with Ceasars, Bellagio, Paris and Venitien located more north on the strip, your walks could get very tiresome. BUT this is very minor. Show (2 out of 10) Zumanity is the show that is at New York New York. Not a good show at all!!! Very amateurish and a waste of money. Spend the extra dough and go see Love at Mirage or KA. Gambling ( 7 out of 10) If you are a poker player, this is not the place for you. There is no poker room. But the MGM has a good room and the hotels are very close so not a big deal. The other aspects of the gambling floor were good. Restaurants (8 out of 10) Good food at good price. Atmosphere (10 out of 10) This is where New York New York excels. There always seems to be an upbeat, party atmosphere at any hour of the day or night. You will have people singing in the Piano bars, through the streets of \"soho\" and people yelling from the roller Coaster (which is a great ride) Overall (8 out of 10) If you avoid Zumanity, this is a great hotel that provides great value.

To book a Marquis Suite you have to call the hotel because you can't do it via their website (anyway once we were able to book it via expedia). The Marquis is a very nice room with Jacuzzi in the corner of the bedroom. You have a sitting area with couch, two chairs then a round table with other chairs. You have the safe, and then what my husband and I think is great is the Bose Wave stereo. The suite is very quiet you never hear noise from the outsite. We didn't hear the rollercoaster even if we could see it from our windows. The view from the marquis suite is not so great because if you have the strip view you will see the rollercoaster and also the windows are small at NYNY. Not floor to ceiling windows as you have at Mandalay or Planet Hollywood. The pool is very small and we never went there. The casino is cute but we used to go to Excalibur or MGM casinos. The Fornaio Backery is great to breakfast or also to eat some Panini (sandwich) during the day. We tried the Caprese Panino (Mozzarella, Tomatos and Oregano).

I know this hotel is popular with the young crowd, but there's a great mix of all ages here. We checked in early Monday morning about 10am and our room was available then. The time it took to check in was minimal. However, the time it took to sign up for a players card was ridiculous! They have 2 older gentleman working behind the counter who can't type faster than 2 words per minute. Extremely slow. Most all of the staff we encountered were friendly. The workers who work for \"Tahiti Village\" timeshare were quite annoying. They're the ones constantly bugging you with free tickets to shows or dinner. After the expierence we had from taking the so called tour, I'd like to advise everyone who's not truly interested in buying a 50K 1 week timeshare to by pass this 3 hour tour. I can see how people get pressured into buying something they cannot afford. Our room was clean and quiet. Never heard any noises from the room next door. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were awful!!! They were small, thin and hard. We had a spa room that was very nice. We used the safe in the room. Wish they had a coffee maker in the room. We ate at Gallaghers Steak House. They keep it very dark, so dark I could not read the menu. The food was good although very pricey. I ordered the surf and turf- $85.00. That's all you get, everything is ala carte. A glass of Merlot-$8.00. A shrimp cocktail in which you get 3 large shrimp- $16.00. Had we not had a gift certificate to eat there, we probably would not have just because of the cost. Each restaraunt has a menu posted outside so you can easily view the items they have along with the prices. We did eat at the America, good food, decent prices. One evening I had the steak and crab legs for $15.00 that included a salad, potato and steamed veggies!!! It was delicious and a great value. Had the breakfast buffet at Chin-Chins, very good. The casino slots were very tight. Didn't see anyone hitting anything of substance. The tables weren't busy. We participated in the black jack tourney (1st time for both in a tourney) and took 2nd and 3rd place. That was fun for only a $20 entry fee. The best and funnest bar at NY NY is the Bar at Times Square!!! What a blast. It's the sing along with the dueling piano guys. If you get there early enough, you won't have to pay the $10 cover.

Most places only seem to have a few options and most shut down late at night, but NYNY did not disappoint. In addition, it had a wide range of choices for any budget instead of all pricey options. Even the room service prices were incredibly reasonable by Vegas standards. Location on the strip was good and being able to easily walk to Luxor and MGM Grand was nice. We rented a car during this trip and found the self parking here was MUCH better than several other hotels we parked at (Planet Hollywood, Palazzo). Perhaps the best part about NYNY is the great club scene. Rok was a fun club and Studio 54 and LAX are a short walk too. If you don't want to dance all night there's also a piano bar that was packed every night and looked like a good time.

My girlfriend and I stayed in a Jacuzzi room and I would recommend this upgrade for sure. The room was huge (like everything in Vegas !) and the hotel and Casino is set out in a village theme, with loads of eating / drinking opportunities for all ages/nationalities. The pool was amazing and chilled with music playing, though the drinks were slightly pricey there, they were big and worth it ! We are giving a review here about Vegas in general, a few pointers to pick the right location and things not to miss. Get on the right hand side of the plane from the UK when checking in, the window view coming through the desert into Vegas with the Canyon on you're right is amazing for those of you, like us, scared of taking a helicopter at a later stage of the holiday ! The *New York New York * is opposite the MGM Grand and a perfect place to start off your journey down the famous strip ! We went into every Hotel/Casino - Hooters is off the strip but close enough to walk to, it's one for the lads - say no more ! A short cab ride to the Hard Rock - worth a visit. The Luxor, Excalibur and Mandalay Bay were behind us and to be honest a little too far out for our liking and not as good as the *New York New York.* Heading up the strip the Harley Davidson Cafe is a place you've gotta go to, the food is out of this world and if you like motorbikes and the rock n roll years it's the place for you. The Water Show outside Bellagio's is an experience to die for, incredible isn't the word. Caesars Palace is huge, and has a nightclub (Pure) and a fantastic bar (Pussycat Room) with world class barmen doing tricks galore. Along with the Venetian (Probably in our opinion the best hotel in the strip) and Mirage, these hotels are exceptional, bang in the the middle and in a great location to save on cab fares ! We watched three shows, the Phantom of the Opera in the Venetian has to be the pick, truly sensational, get in the first ten rows for an amazing experience. Shoot \"Downtown \" about a 20 dollar cab ride, but catch the Stratosphere on the way, at the very end of the strip it's a great Hotel/Casino. If you are a Poker Player in Vegas for the first time, the tables are welcoming and you feel comfortable playing against the best. The Imperial Palace, centre of the strip, is also a good poker choice for the novice. The Stratosphere has a revolving restaurant (Top of the World) go there at night time the view is mind blowing - Vegas Lights from one end of the strip to the other. For the nut-jobs it has a ride that shoots you off the very top of the hotel at it's peak, 900 feet above everything in Vegas ! Downtown has cheaper game play than the strip, the Golden Nugget and Four Queens are the best Casino's. The must go show to go to is \"Defending the Caveman\" in the Nugget. Either if you are in a relationship going nowhere, or like us one forever, you will find it funny and true to every couple's everyday life, it is also famed for sorting out sexual troubles, it will save you from those councelling sessions for sure ! The light show \" Downtown\" was one of the highlights of our stay, Music and lights, won't spoil it for you - just go ! For first time slot players, play \"Wheel of Fortune\" be warned you will get hooked ! We saw the \"O\" by Cirque du Soleil in Bellagio's, not really for us, but can understand the enjoyment in some people's faces and work put into the whole show - so professional. The Cabs have a free Vegas guide, make sure you pick one up. Keep to the main streets, tip the waitresses a dollar when playing in the casino's and your drinks will be plenty and will keep on coming ! As for shopping, \"Las Vegas Premium Outlets\" is the place to go, damn hot ( touching 100 !) but the prices are cheap for designer gear ! Bit further along from the Stratosphere - again a cab ride from the strip. As *New York New York *goes, for atmosphere, customer service, rooms, food and the Vegas experience it's a fantastic choice. A truly wonderful hotel and casino. The American breakfast bar/diner is fab. \"Mon Ami Gabi \"close to the Paris hotel is a fantastic Parisian - style restaurant. Next time we go ( one five day trip to Vegas isn't enough !) we are looking at a more Central Location, like the Mirage or the beautiful Venetian, but in the *New York New York * we will one day return !", "Date": "January 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cAwful experience...\u201d", "Author": "diazfranco", "ReviewID": "UR23868519", "Content": "the location is awesome.

Prior to deciding to get the tickets I had to find a place to stay for my girl and myself. After weeks and weeks of research, I decided NY NY was the best deal in town. Since the fight was at the MGM Grand, the location was close enough to walk (a bridge length) and at the same time save some money compared to the surrounding hotels on the strip and the MGM itself. My girl and I stayed for 2 days in the Skyline room accommodation and were very pleased to say the least. Our room had nice views including the roller coaster facing MGM. The bed, pillows and sheets were pretty comfortable. Good size room with ample space in the bathroom is all we could ask for. However, the casino itself in my opinion is not my favorite. I'm not a big gambler so I don't really care, but what stood out in my mind was the relatively small size of the layout of the casino and especially all the smoking going on which irritated me greatly. I'm fortunate and grateful that NY NY had affordable rooms available during this exciting weekend event.

We booked a Park Avenue room, and upon check in, we easily upgraded a non-smoking Spa Suite room. The upgrade cost was $55 for the weeknight (Thurs, 1/1) and $90 for the weekend night (Fri, 1/2). Our room was in the New Yorker tower. We were surprised there was not a staff member asking to see your room key like Excalibur has before accessing the elevators. Our room was tastefully decorated with a clean spa tub. However, a significant amount of the grout in the shower was black with mildew and in a few spots appeared to be damaged due improper repair or so badly damaged from mildew and mold it appeared to be rotten. It made me wish I brought flip flops to wear in the shower. There were knobs missing from the chest of drawers and the picture quality from the satellite TV was poor.

Our dinner at Nine Fine Irishmen was great. We've never been disappointed with Nine Fine Irishmen's food or service. On both mornings around 8:00 am, we were awakened by groups on people shouting in the hallways. Upon checking out, we reported the mildew and received a $20 dollar credit for each night.

As a point of reference we have also stayed at the Mirage and the Aladdin (now Planet Holleywood). New York New York still remains our favorite. As a sidenote, we had a free hotel room offered to us at Hooters Casino. Two days prior to the trip we decided not to chance a new hotel that was not directly on the strip and paid to stay at NYNY. What a great choice! We checked out the room we would have had at Hooters (ok but not what we would want on a trip to Vegas). Check in was easy. We had an offer through the Players Club which gave us great rates and a Park Avenue Deluxe room. I asked for a room with a good strip view and we got it. We were at the corner of the hotel with a view of the strip, the airport, and the mountains in the distance. Loved it. Our room was just as I remembered, comfortable, fairly contemporary, and clean. That's all we need in Vegas. We played mostly at NYNY because we really like the vibe there. Everything seems to be laid back. Our drinks were comped everytime we sat down at a table or machine. And service was fast. (We are tippers-so this might account for the fast and attentive service-we usually tip a dollar a drink) I mention this because we had a bad experience at the Mirage-we found the Mirage to be impressive but not our style. I can't describe it other than we sit at 10 dollar tables and play 25 cent machines. We are not high rollers and were treated as such. On the other hand we always feel comfortable and taken care of at NYNY. We ate at both ESPN Zone, Americana, and Gonzales y Gonzales. All of our meals were good. My husband is a big sports bettor so ESPN Zone works out GREAT for watching the games. The food is good, not great, but its a sports bar what can you expect. Americana is a great choice for breakfast. Once again food was good and service was excellent. Gonzales y Gonzales was really good and the margaritas were GREAT. Our favorite new touch to the hotel is the circular bar in the middle of the casino. The bartenders were great and there was always a seat available for video poker. I think this casino/hotel is great if you want a laid back, fun, young environment. If you want the wow factor, this is not the casino for you.

We usually stay at other MGM properties, but figured we would give the New York, New York a shot as the casino and hotel do have a funky young feel to it. However, there are very clear warnings that go along with this hotel that did sour the experience; First; Check-in/out. The front desk in this hotel is woefully under-staffed and very inefficient. There were long lines when we checked in and out. The hotel check-in is also visible from the casino and it did not seem that our experience was any different than most peoples (even at odd times of the day!). The most glaring example was a very large line at 7am one morning. Staff: I was quite shocked by the rudeness of the staff in the hotel and the casino. Maybe they take the New York theme a bit too far? there is no reason to be overtly rude to people. Some examples were being completely ignored for drink service (one time we actually asked for drinks and were dismissed by the waitress with I'll get around to you' - she never did come back after several hours.. Other examples were people getting chewed out at the front desk and playersclub for legit errors (from what I observed waiting in the obscenely long lines). Food: There are several food options in the Hotel, All of them incredibly over-priced (even with the 20% off coupons that they dish out!). None of them very appetizing. Avoid the ESPN Zone, completely smoke and mirrors place - it was one of the worst restaurants I have ever had the displeasure of eating in. Frozen burgers, really? Thats just lazy, cheap and stupid (esp for $15!). Rooms: Decent and well decorated rooms, but not terribly clean.. mold rampant in the bathroom. Looked as if it was a very cheap build, grout falling out, mouldy silicon interface of the tub. Sink counter-tops not installed properly. We had to request a new room after the first night as they put us directly beside the elevator shaft - don't bother accepting this room if you can help it, you won't sleep. They didn't really question us too hard when we asked for a new room, a few others in line were asking for the same reason. I guess the desk staff is used to it. Value: Well, unless they give you the room extremely cheap or for free I would suggest staying elsewhere. We don't vacation to feel uncomfortable.

Checking in at that hour, there wasn't anyone at the registration desk so we checked in right away. I asked for a roll a way bed as we had three people in the room and the queen size beds weren't going to big enough for three people.

We did not have to wait for our room to be ready and after we grabbed a quick bite to eat at the American Restaurant, we checked out our room and by then the rollaway had already arrived. After placing the call for our luggage it took no more than 5 minutes for it to arrive at our room. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The ambience of the hotel was overwhelming. The American Restaurant wasn't so great so we ate there just once. We at twice at the Chin, Chin Cafe, like their chinese food and their prices were reasonable. We also ate there for breakfast. The night of my daughter's birthday we splurged at Gallagher's. Although the food was excellent, it was very pricey. The village eateries, which had an array of eaterys (Starbucks, Ben & Jerry's, fish place, dessert eatery, Nathan's hotdogs) was picturesque with tables set up all throughout which made it appear that you were eating at outdoor cafes. You couldn't hear the noise from the casino, so it was a good place to escape the noise, smoke and music if you wanted to. The roller coaster was OK, not the best ride I ever had, very bumpy. The shoulder harness should be replaced with over the head/chest harness like other roller coasters and the headrest was not cushioned. My shoulder's and neck hurt for three days after I rode the ride. I wouldn't ride it again. Alot of archade games for the kids on the second for those kids who under 21 - something to keep them busy.

The only thing I can recommend is if you stay here, walk across to the MGM and look at the lions, they are amazing.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellwood, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNew York New York - Nice, But No \"Vibe\"\u201d", "Author": "B.Hart", "ReviewID": "UR22314893", "Content": "My wife and I recently returned from a four-night stay at New York New York Hotel to celebrate my birthday. We stayed from November 17th to November 21st and although this was our tenth trip to Vegas, this was our first stay at NYNY. From worst to best, the other hotels we've stayed at have been - Circus Circus, Bally's, Planet Hollywood, Treasure Island, Mirage, and Venetian. Among those hotels, I would have to place NYNY between Bally's and Planet Hollywood. The look of NYNY was quite impressive, but I found the over-all vibe somewhat lacking. More on that later. The hotel is designed with a mixture of 1920's art deco and modern New York style, but the combination works. The valet area where the taxi dropped us off looked like the grand entrance to a 1920's hotel. The front desk is located only a short walk from the valet entrance and the front desk personnel, as well as the valet, were very friendly. We booked the 5th Avenue Deluxe package that gave us a free upgrade from a standard Skyline room to a Park Avenue Deluxe room and believe me, the room looked just as nice as it did on the website. The hotel rooms are divided among four towers - the Century tower, the Empire tower, the Chrysler tower, and the New Yorker tower which is where we stayed. Each tower has it's own bank of elevators with about ten elevators in each bank serving certain floors. The result is a very short wait for elevators going up, or coming down. The halls to the rooms look as if you are in an apartment building. The smaller the last two digits of your room number are, the further you are from the elevator. We were in room 1408 so we were pretty far. The room itself, although kind of small, was very nice and cozy. It felt more like an apartment than a hotel room. The room had a king-size bed, two cushioned chairs, an ottoman, a marble table, two bedside tables with lamps, an iHome radio with iPod dock (The radio won't work with the iPhone), a writing desk and chair with a large mirror and lamp, an additional lamp in the corner, and a large armoire with closet space on each side which holds the iron and ironing board and three large drawers. The armoire also holds a 32\" T.V., but it's not a flat screen like many other hotels are upgrading to. The bathroom is all marble with a shower/tub combo with sliding glass frosted doors. The bathroom wasn't that big, and the water pressure left something to be desired, but it was nice all the same. Some rooms have foyers like ours did and some don't. We had a free safe on the wall in our foyer. You punch in a four-digit code and you can use it as much as you want. The safe won't fit anything big, but it works for small valuables. The room we were in had a wall of windows on the south side facing Flamingo Ave, and on the east side facing Las Vegas Blvd. The armoire was in front of the east windows though, but that was okay we still had nice views and lots of sunlight in the morning and lots of neon light at night. We also had a direct view of the roller coaster a couple hundred yards away, but the noise level was barely a whisper. As nice as the room was, we did encounter a few problems. The comforter on our bed had some questionable stains and hair on the underside. We called housekeeping and not only did they change the comforter, but they changed all the sheets as well. The housekeeper told us that they change the sheets after each guest, but not the comforter, but they will if the new guest requests it. We also had a burned-out light in our armoire, and our iron didn't work. Both problems, along with the comforter situation, were handled quickly and very professionally. The comfort of the bed was okay, not bad - not great. It felt like a regular bed, nothing like the bed at TI which is the best bed I ever slept in. Our package, along with the free upgrade, also included two free drinks redeemable at Nine Fine Irishmen pub, or Pour 24, the 24-hour bar on the mezzanine level, a 2 for 1 ticket for the roller coaster, discounted spa treatment, and a 2 for 1 breakfast on the patio of the Italian restaurant Il Fornaio. The coupon is for your entree only. Not for sides or beverages. We ordered French toast and it was delicious. They do great coffee, eggs, and bacon as well. They are definitely worth a try. Although we didn't swim, we visited the pool which is open until early December. The pool is very small and under the shadow and noise of the roller coaster. Not relaxing at all without much sun. When I said earlier that NYNY lacks a \"vibe\", I meant that there's not much to keep you there. It's nice walking through the recreation of the neighborhoods, but they've taken out most of Central Park to replace it with a casino bar which, as of this writing, is still under construction. Their shopping is virtually non-existent consisting of a few souvenir shops, a watch shop and one \"upscale\" clothing store that looks just like another souvenir shop, and you can find equal or better food choices at other hotels. There is no buffet although the Asian themed Chin Chin has a daily breakfast buffet. The bars like Nine Fine Irishmen and the dueling piano bar have live music, but you have to buy two drinks in the afternoon, and at night they become just another pretentious spot with doormen and a cover. The Coney Island arcade is cool, but if you're not a kid or if video games and cheap prizes for tickets aren't your thing then you won't care. The casino is not well organized, and the sports book is tiny. They also have time-share and rental property sellers at practically each entrance - inside the hotel. We've all seen them by other hotels, but to have them inside the hotel jumping you coming and going is very annoying. One thing I can say though, is that during the time we were there the weather was amazing (sunny and warm every day - cooler at night) and the crowds were incredibly thin with hardly any kids around. The lines for the clubs were so short that your chances of getting in were very good. In fact, they were practically begging for people to come in. Check-out was very quick, in fact, you can check out through your t.v. and drop your key off at the key deposit by the elevators, but only if you haven't incurred any in room charges. Check-out is normally 11:00 a.m., but if you need an extra hour you can call the front desk and request a 12 noon check-out for no extra charge. Like I said earlier, NYNY is a very nice hotel and you should try it, for the right price, but aside from the fact that my wife and I don't like to visit the same hotel too many times anyway, I can't really see returning to NYNY when there are other more exciting hotel choices. By the way, if you are looking for some entertainment and food choices, you can't go wrong with these - For burgers In N Out Burger is the only way to go. They have the best burgers I ever tasted and I visit them every time I visit Vegas. They are far less expensive than the over-rated Fatburger but many,many times better. Also , you may not believe this but although Circus Circus is hardly one of the best hotels in Vegas, they have the absolute best steakhouse. The steakhouse in Circus Circus has been voted the best many times and when you eat there you will see why. They have the best atmosphere, the best service, and the best food. Many steakhouses are a la carte meaning you have to purchase your entree, salad, potato, and vegetable separately, but here you get all that, including bread, with the purchase of your steak. I can't begin to describe how delicious every morsel of food was, but if you love steak try the Steakhouse at Circus Circus. Also if you are a fan of magic you would do well to check out the Steve Wyrick show at Planet Hollywood. I've seen Lance Burton four times and I've loved it each time. Lance has an endearing, engaging, fun personality and fast paced show perfectly suited to his classic magic and illusions. I've also seen David Copperfield, and for all his amazing tricks, I found his show slow, dull, and his personality felt as if he was phoning it in. Steve Wyrick is a mixture of the two. He combined Lance's personality with David Copperfield's amazing illusions. Steve's tricks, though, I felt were better than both of them. His theater is so intimate that every seat was a good seat and even though his show was hardly filled to capacity, he acted as if he were playing to a full house. Simply put, he was amazing. Check him out. I hope you enjoyed my review, I tried to be as thorough as possible, but as with any review just use it as a guideline but you can never really know until you experience it yourself.

Room size was great, with good sized beds and bathroom. However, by this stage, for the money we were spending in 4-5 star hotels, I was getting a little tired of showers over baths, and this is something I would research a little better for next trip. These configurations, especially when old, are terrible - they have very limited adjustments(pressure/temp) and the spray type can sometimes be uncomfortable...not good when your paying top dollar. This was the 3rd leg of our trip, from LA, SAN FRAN. We were booked in to get married at Stratosphere on the last day, and this turned out to be a great experience for an informal type ceremony. The hotel is located at the southern end of strip, which makes for some lengthy walking if you want to explore the 'newer' looking casino's. Not to say NYNY looks overly old itself. However, be prepared for the imposing, rude and extremely annoying sidewalk antics of people attempting to hand out 'escort /prostitute services literature. I found this really awkward, walking up and down the strip with my fiance/wife, and my friends. On the 1st night, when walking back to our hotel, one of these guys said something in Spanish, of course, to my partners sister. I couldn't help myself and swore at him. He heard me, and we almost got into a fight, when the lights changed, he kicked me and ran off. I would have been hesitant to retaliate, with so many of them there. This left a foul taste in my mouth about Vegas generally, and that confirmed to me I would never come back. However, next day upon a cancelled trip to the canyon, because of a mix up, I used the Hotel gym - for an additional 18USD!!!, (GREAT GYM THOUGH) and had a mini bucks night out - blackjack at Caesars Palace with pussycat doll dancers! I don't gamble - first time player, and I won 130 BUCKS - I was very happy!!! The girls went to Cirque show and absolutely loved it! That evening we all ate togethr inside Venetian. This was fantastic - beautiful interior - my favourite, and a variety of 'normal' priced restaurants. I found it very hard, walking through other casino's, to find a well priced eatery. The Venetian however, was at the opposite end of the strip to NYNY, and thus I would aim to stay here, if I went back. America,good priced eatery in NYNY, as was Rainforest in MGM across the road. There was even an Australian I think 'Outback' restaurant which was open late down the strip which was good. Ate lunch at Stratosphere Top of the world before wedding and it was really nice, and great value...you'd pay similar anywhere on the strip and here you are on a revolving restaurant high in the sky - brilliant! After the ceremony etc I booked us in at PANEVINO near the airport, with a great view of the strip. For a lovely meal, treat yourself to this place, an excellent, after wedding dinner!! The Mirage was pretty cool on the inside, and would like to see their wildlife habitats if we returned. If only the local authorities stepped in and got rid of those annoying literature/ticket dispensers!!! Oh, my partner and friend went on the roller coaster on the last night and said it was a buzz! Gym at cost of 18 dollars is a bit cheeky, would be good to know that up front, and also internet minimum of 5 dollars too.

I wasn't very happy, but they would not upgrade us at all. The second night, we used our points to upgrade to the Ziggarat Suite. This suite was bigger than some apartments I have been in! The windows were tinted green, which was different - but kinda cool. The bed was amazing! The jacuzzi was a 4 person tub and came with bath beads - so great! We got slippers and bathrobes - and chocolate cherries at turndown service time. The restaurants in the casino were okay - a little pricey - but thats not uncommon in Vegas. We ate at the pizza place and the ESPN Zone - both were pretty good. But, if you want a great buffet - go next door to the Exalibur - it was great and a decent price. We also got a free breakfast at the MGM which was awesome as well! I would definitely go back to Vegas - but I think I would stay at the MGM over the NY NY. I really would like to try out the Venetian, Mirage or the Wynn. Those are mid-strip and close to all the action.

Our room in the New York Tower was average -- not great, but clean and warm. Just a little bit worn and not new. I was surprised there wasn't a mini-bar in it.

One complaint is that we were given a 2 for 1 coupon at Il Fornaio restaurant for patio breakfast before 10:30am. It turns out there are TWO Il Fornaio's in the hotel. We stood in line at the wrong one for a time, and when we got the the RIGHT one at 10:33, the man said it was too late for breakfast and wouldn't serve us.

The Park Avenue room was okay it also had a nice view but it was a little small and the TV wasn\u2019t great. Checking in was very easy and smooth we stayed in the Century tower and it was a great location. We ordered room service a few times and we all thought it was very good even with the high prices. We didn\u2019t really eat that much but the ESPN Zone was pretty cool the baseball games on Friday night. They were very fast and the food was okit was a little pricey. We also tried the America restaurant this was a great restaurant the food wasn\u2019t that expensive and they give you huge portions and they have a huge variety to chose from. The casino was very nice it was a little on the small side with the construction going on but it wasn\u2019t too crowded and the staff was very friendly. Rok night club was really cool and we didn\u2019t go to the Times Square bar but every time we walked by seemed like everyone was having a blast. We went to check out the roller coaster and it was 16.00 bucks to ride it kind of pricey if you ask me and just beware if you are in some of the rooms you can hear the roller coaster and the people yelling on the roller coaster late at night. I would say the only downfall for this hotel was the pool area it was way to small and you had to get out there really close to 10am when they opened or you wouldn\u2019t get a seat and the sun doesn\u2019t come over the pool until about noon. Check out was great and our flight didn\u2019t leave until 1130pm so they held our bags for us and got them within seconds when we had to leave to get to the airport.

Check in on 9/24 was a breeze and we received the exact king non smoking room we requested. We stayed on the 27th floor of the Century tower.

One thing we really noticed about the NYNY that is different from all other LV hotels was how quiet the room is. The hallways are not a straight linelike in most hotels. There are twists and turns that follow the unique shape of the building and this tends to makes sounds in the hallway not travel so far. Also, I noticed that the doors to the rooms don't slam like in other hotels which was nice. We visited the pool a couple of times and it was ok, but nothing spectacular. We don't like sitting in the sun, so were actually happy that the pool is shaded for a lot of the time. Call us crazy. I could see where the pool would get very crowded at other times of the year though. There is not a lot of room for chairs and it does look like it would be cramped. We like the location of the NYNY on the Strip because it is easy to walk over the bridges to MGM, Excalibur or Tropicana. There is still work being done in the casino.

We were also missing basic amenities (shampoo, soap, etc.) when we checked in, but a quick call to housekeeping solved the problem, and it never happened again during our stay. We also got fresh towels every day, even though we didn't request it. Although I appreciated this touch, I was slightly bothered by the fact that my attempt to be environmental was ignored by the staff; perhaps the daily tip made him/her want to go the extra mile? The casino was small in comparison to some of the other hotels and there was still a lot of construction noise as they were finishing up Rok nightclub at the start of our visit, but that quickly cleared up halfway through our trip. The restaurants were interesting enough although the pizza place was very disorganized (it took 40 minutes for us to get a pizza), but the Chinese breakfast buffet was good value for the cost. There was a great margarita bar upstairs with plenty of different flavours to choose from but the shopping was very limited, as was expected from a relatively small-scale hotel like NYNY. It's connected to the MGM via walkway, so it's location is quite convenient, as you can catch the Monorail from the MGM to take you to most points of interest along the strip. Since we booked our trip with airfare plus hotel, it's hard to say how much the hotel itself cost, but it felt like a pretty good deal, in comparison to some other hotels we were looking at. Especially given it's location, it's definitely a good deal, as you can pay less to stay there but still be nearby to the other big name hotels. We would definitely stay there again!", "Date": "September 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redhill, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat time.

NYNY is pretty spectacular, especially from the outside. Its a replica of NY City, with skyscrapers, a mini Brooklyn Bridge and their very own Statue of Liberty. Inside is a large casino and a food court replicating the streets of NY City. There's plenty to eat if you like fast food (i.e. pizzas, bagels, burgers etc). The food was very good, especially the pastrami bagels from the deli. There are some restaurants in the hotel. We tried the Italian (nothing special) and Gallagher's steak house. Be warned, the steaks here are HUGE!!!! There were six of us. None of us were able to eat a whole rib-eye ($35 each). Do the sensible thing, share one. We visted other hotels on the strip - Venitian, Paris, Mirage, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay - and discovered that their malls, casinos and food courts were bigger and, probably, better. But there was something very comforting and relaxing about NYNY. The room we had (Park Avenue) was bigger than we expected and very clean. It had everything we needed. NYNY is at the south end of the strip. Its quite a walk to the hotels and sights further up the strip, especially in the 100 degree heat we experienced. If you need to travel north, we recommend using the Deuce, the 24-hour bus service that runs the length of the strip. Its only $5 for a 24-hour unlimited pass. Sights to take in when you're in Vegas - the Grand Canyon (a must), the Bellagio fountains, the baby lions and dolphin at the Mirage, the light shown at Fremont Street (Downtown).

Check in was superb, no-one in the queue and upgraded to a room with a strip view for $10 per night which was well worth it. It was a corner room looking out over MGM/Excaliber and the roller coaster (Which wasn't noisy). The room was a good size (but with two queen size beds instead of a king) and was in good condition. The casino itself was be upgraded while we were there so some areas were out of bounds but was still a pretty good size. The restaurants in NYNY were excellent and everything that was needed was there. Nine fine Irishman was OK though a bit pricey for drinks. Bar at Times square was excellent and you don\u2019t need to go in to sample the atmosphere. The roller coaster was excellent and could ride all day for a little over the cost of one ride ticket. Pool area was OK if a little cramped. They get as many loungers in as they can as long as you\u2019re there relatively early (Opens at 10AM) then you\u2019ll get a lounger but is very busy in the afternoon. Most of the pool was in the shade when it opened, when we were there, but that didn\u2019t last long. The hotel has an excellent spot on the strip. The walkways linking NYNY with MGM and Excaliber were really handy and spent most of our time in these casinos. Hooters and Tropicana were just across the road aswell with lower gambling limits. Bellagio was a 10 minute walk up the strip and down to Mandalay bay was 10 minutes (Or 2 hours if you walk through Excaliber as we found it pretty confusing inside) . There\u2019s a monorail from Excaliber to Mandalay Bay aswell. We sampled a Grand Canyon flight and coming back over the strip at night was excellent. Stratosphere was well worth it for the thrill rides which are more daunting than they look ($35ish for unlimited rides for a day). Fremont Street was excellent and would seriously consider staying there next time as seemed really relaxed and a lot friendlier than the casinos. We also drove out to Hoover damn which was well worth the visit and really interesting and had a boat ride on lake mead afterwards. All in all it was a superb choice of hotel and Vegas couldn\u2019t have lived up to expectations and more. Will be back for more and would consider staying at NYNY again if looking for a hotel on the strip though Excaliber really does seem value for money aswell.

The Monorail is better if it goes where you are going but to find it is like an episode of Indiana Jones, the MGM opposite has one somewhere but it is the largest hotel in the world and it is a long way to the station at the back of the hotel.When it gets busy at weekends it is almost impossible to get to and from it without losing the will to live. We drove o the shopping centres ( Premium outlets and Fashion show mall ) with no probs and they are great,lots to see and do and we also drove to the Hoover Dam and took the tour,you must get there by 9am to miss the crowds and it is about a 40 min drive,it was Awsome man and well worth the $11 entrance.We also took in Mamma Mia at the Mandalay Bay ( free tram from Excalibur gets you there in no time ) and it was the best night of my life to date . Also went to the Star Trek Experience at the Hilton , kids loved it , wife was terrified of the Borg who was walking around . Pool at the NyNy is great but ice cold,get there early and get beds around the edges as the sun comes on the pool at 10.45 in the far left corner and is just about bearable until 12.30, my watch had the temp. in the sun at 133 deg at 11.30am and by this time the pool area is full of crazy locals hollering and having a good time, beer in the pool? no probs , anything goes here. My wife smokes and found nirvana in Vegas , you can smoke just about anywhere, no need to go outside for a fag, just sit at a machine and smoke yourself silly, no stress for me and shes happy as punch. Want to smoke in your room ? no probs sir. The food at the hotel was great and varied, Gallaghers was really expensive, the Italian also , the Mexican was awful slop . Our fav was the ESPN bar , great food, great Tv and great vibes. All in all the hotel was just the best , we tripped out to every hotel on the strip in our week ( to keep the kids active and we were in bed at 9 each night knackered but happy, every hotel appears to be just around the corner but isn't, must be the desert air) up to the Sahara and every time we were grateful to get back to the gold ole NyNy , the expensive hotels are nice but exactly that,the Venetian and Caesers and Bellagio are take your breath away good, the cheaper ones are a little tatty and seem to cater for the serious gamblers, the NyNy, Luxor and MGM seem to attract the Shows crowd and site-seeres and are a lot nicer vibes wise for it, my fav was the Mandalay Bay, it had an edge to it due to the House of Blues and Mamma Mia crowds and would be my choice if I win the lotto. All in all we cannot wait to go back and will defo stay at the NyNy without hesitation, it is just so easy to do what you want to , from the free easy access self parking to the great pool ( get your beer from the shop for $3 not the pool bar at $7 ) , the lovely decor, great bars, great vibe and if you want to I am sure the gambling is great also, maybe next time when our kids are older . The only dissapointment was coming home , the airport is rubbish . Us non Americans have terminal2 to ourselves and it is tiny and has no shops to speak off , get all your snacks and bits and bobs beforehand , cigs are ok @ $55 for 400 and Jack D is $27 a litre,Smirnoff is $16 a litre. Flight home was awful . Looking to go back next year for 2 weeks to do it all again , if you have ever been to a good Blackpool or London or Manchester hotel dont worry about staying here , it is 50 times better than anything they have to offer , it is that good.

We chose NY NY because of the balance of price and reviews on Trip Advisor. It was a good choice. We stayed for three nights in the last week of June 2008, in a Park Avenue upgrade at $89.95 a night. Here's a quick summary :- Plus points :- Room - very nice, we were about 17 floors up (sorry, forgot room number now!). Good size, nice decor, good condition. Comfortable beds. Bathroom - No complaints, good condition. Safety - Felt very safe in that part of hotel. Whole hotel felt safe. Corridors were very quiet. Plus it has an in-room safe for valuables. Pool - Not too busy, despite it being 103 outside ! Bit of a walk/elevator to pool but no real problem. Lobby - Quick check-in no delay, staff polite but more business-like than friendly. No real probs with that. General - Casino area had some building work going on but it did not cause a major problem. Hotel still looked in good condition despite this. Much classier than Excalibur. Eating - Only used the hotel for late night quick snacks. Fine for this, pizza etc and not too expensive. Minus points Room - reserved non-smoking, didn't get one. BUT, couldn't smell smoke in room. No problem there. General view of Vegas as a first time Brit ! :- It's HOT, crowded, it'll wear you out. You'll walk for miles, I got blisters on my blisters ! But, you've got to do it. The Duece is practical but way too crowded, only use it for short runs if you can avoid it. The Monorail is luxury compared to it, but is not practical as you have to battle through casinos to get to it from the Strip. If you are not a real gambler, three nights is more than enough. We did a day bus trip to the Grand Canyon and still saw enough of Vegas to keep us happy. Final summing up on hotel, NY NY is a lot better than you would expect from some reviews and other websites.

All of us had the same opinion of the place, and all agreed that we would stay again. The other couples had standard twin rooms, while we opted for the deluxe room at an average rate of 159.00 a night, (The best rate I could find for any of the newer on strip hotels). We were not charged for an extra cot (we were there with the two kids). I would opt for the larger room if you are travelling as a family. Even with the cot, we had room to spare. Our room (and the other couples) was actually a non smoking room. (something rare in Vegas). I would rate the room in good shape, everything worked well. I would rate it above average for the middle of the road hotels in Vegas I have stayed at. I have to admit I was a bit worried about previous reviews of construction and roller coaster noise. I (nor the others) heard nothing of the roller coaster, nor did any of us hear jack hammers from the construction in the casino, which was really a non event. The casino had some tarping up, and maybe a few less games, but it did not ruin our fun one little bit. Found the staff at the hotel 1st rate in being friendly, helpful & going out of their way to help our stay be a good one. On checkout, the bell desk was a bit behind and we actgually received a phone call from the bell desk manager who appoligized for our slight wait. Our kids loved the hotel for its variety of food.

Also, the casino is undergoing some renovations so we never even played a slot machine there! As for the famous rollercoaster - it passed right below our window, but it didn't bother us at all! Mind you, we woke up very early and came back very late - so we were rarely in our room when the roller coaster was running... The restaurants did not seem as refined as the restaurants we went to at Mandalay Bay, MGM, the Bellaggio and at Caesars... Actually, the ambiance did not even come close....They were just not inviting whatsoever for us...We did have a few breakfast at America and Il Fornaio and they were good.

I had to use the hotel wi-fi one day because of an early morning business emergency when ESPN Zone was not open. The wi-fi service charged my credit card 4 times prompting a call from my credit card fraud prevention department. I routinely stay in Las Vegas at least 6 times a year and usually stay at an MGM/ Mirage hotel and this one is by far the worst of that bunch. The Good- The housekeeping staff is fantastic. They do not bother you if you have a do not disturb sign on the door until 2pm when they give you a courtesy call to let you know you may have your room cleaned any time 24 hours a day! The room, although dated and with a view of the roof was at least clean. The Bad- I booked through Expedia and afterward found hotel specials for the package I booked at $75, offered for only $64. They also had a special offer at $75 that included an upgraded strip view, free cocktails and restaurant discounts for the same $75 fee I paid. The hotel refused to offer me these same incentives. I even mentioned that this was my first stay (and my last) to the hotel staff and the room they elected to impress me with was vintage 1978 at best. I was even surprised the shag carpet had been replaced with the stained, sticky retread that was in there. The 20\" TV failed to work most of the time, producing snow for most of my visit. There is no coffee pot in the room and though they provide an ice bucket, there is no ice machine to be found anywhere. Not even a mini bar is in the room which is surprising since they are obviously charging for everything but the smoky air you inhale. The Ugly- The hotel clientele consists mainly of drunk smoking guys walking around in wife beater tee shirts drinking low quality american beer. This is amazing considering you can cross the street to MGM Grand and see a much higher quality clientele in what is an amazingly updated older hotel. The noise in the rooms is atrocious. Daily, it sounded as if people were moving heavy furniture around the adjoining rooms. For several days I thought the roller coaster passed through my room but it was just lack of any sound proofing. The hotel is more casino than hotel and everywhere you go you can here the slot machines going and going and going. The worst was that the hotel staff really didn't seem to care at all about the inconveniences of their hotel. They were just nice enough to keep them from losing their job. Overview- If you are looking at staying somewhere cheap (I don't mean inexpensive, I mean CHEAP) and don't mind sleeping in a casino... this is for you. If you want to feel special or pampered at all then look at the SIgnature where they have it down to an art for only about double the NY, NY prices! I cannot say enough positive things about the NY, NY restaurants. Sirrico's pizza has lines out the door until 3am because it is fantastic! The ESPN Zone is a great respite from the noise for sports lovers! Il Fornaio and Gallagher's are also top quality eating establishments. You just don't have to stay at the NY, NY to enjoy these gems. I would love for NY, NY to offer me a casino invited guest pass to stay at their hotel. Perhaps I could exchange it for some cash to someone less informed so I can stay at a place of quality.

The rooms are very small, outdated, and not the cleanest. The towels were very grey and smelled strongly of bleach. Strip views aren't the greatest, and the rollercoaster can be annoying. The walk to the rooms can take forever and to get to the front desk you must venture through the casino area - it isn't separate like in most hotels. The pool is very small and is not located in a convenient area. It also receives a great deal of shade from the building. We went to the Spa on our first day and were very disappointed. We had to walk through the workout area in our robes to get to where our massages were to take place. Then it was very hard to relax as all we could hear were people in the weight room dropping the weights. We were impressed by room service.

We arrived at Mccarran Airport at 7am and checked into the hotel at 9:30 am where we were given our room number and told to call around 2 to see if it was ready. After driving around and visiting off-strip casinos we went back and it was ready. The check-in lady was very nice and assured us we would have a nice room facing the strip and decided not to upgrade from the Park Ave to the Broadway as the room wasn't as nice. The room was great, in the New Yorker tower room 1758 we had views from Planet Hollywood to Mandalay Bay and the rollercoaster below us. The rollercoaster did not bother us at all as other reviewers have said, if anything it is neat to watch if you are even in your room long enough to check it out as we weren't in there much. The first night we were there, the hotel and casino lost its AC and the room and casino was hot so we gambled late at the Monte Carlo. However, upon checkout we were comped the first nights stay for the inconvenience. Excellent service. *Negatives - worsed smelling casino not from smoke but we felt they were really going for the New York Smell of dirty sewage. Once we were down there for abit, the smell wore off but once you get off the elevator it is horrid. Also, Broadway burger had bad customer service and not so good food. The comps for playing Blackjack at $10-15/hand for 8 hours a day for 3 days at their property was bad. They told me you needed to play at $25/hand to get rated so luckily I played the slots too there with no luck but got all food comped. *Positives - great service, excellent housekeeping, rooms were spotless and modern with great views at night time. Close to monorail station, southstrip casinos. *Recommendations - Get a rental car if you plan to go places but don't get the extra insurance and it is dirt cheap. Gamble downtown, it is more fun drinks are faster/better and your money lasts alot longer. Also they have $3 and $5 blackjack all over. Eat at Binions Ranch Steakhouse (business casual) to take in an amazing view from the 26th floor. Great Steak and price. Also I always go to Ellis Island to get the awesome steak dinner and Homemade microbrew for $5.95. And lastly, get players cards everywhere you go, between 3 of us at Wynn, we signed up spun a wheel and got 2 free $37 buffets and 2 $10 free-play. Amazing food at the Wynn Buffet. Overall I enjoyed the NYNY and could not beat the price I got from playing there last year but when I go back in October I want to be closer to the centre strip where the action & fun happens such as O'sheas, Flamingo and Bill's Gamblin Hall or the Nugget Downtown where we spent the majority of the time.

Also ate breakfast one morning at Il Fornaio, which had good food and service, but a little pricey--think lunch or dinner there would be nicer, better option. There's a soft pretzel place, New York pretzel, on the mezzanine level--GREAT pretzels. Printed off and used a buy one, get one free coupon from vegas4locals.com (going to Vegas again next month and have already printed off a few of these coupons!). Nearly every day we saw someone handing out a coupon booklet sort of near our elevator bay (the New Yorker). Look for that as there were a few useful ones in it. Didn't wait too long to check in or out. There were however big issues in the hotel on the day of check out--there was no hot water for hours. We called down and said we'd be checking out late since we hadn't been able to shower and they didn't seem to mind. Check out was at 11:00 and by 1:00 there was still no hot water so we checked out anyway so we could experience a bit more Vegas before boarding the flight (flight wasn't until 5:00 or 6:00). Other than that morning waiting for the hot water to return, we spent very very little time in the room. The room was fine, but the bathroom was in need of some repairs (sink faucet was really loose, for example). The king size bed was super comfortable. Our room had a view of the Monte Carlo, which happened to be the same weekend it caught fire--had a perfect view of the unfortunate damage! Would've seen the actual fire had we been in our room at the time. The pool was closed for the winter (those of us in the Midwest often don't realize that it's not really hot in Vegas over the winter months!)", "Date": "June 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGood Value, Good Location\u201d", "Author": "EHendrix", "ReviewID": "UR16794113", "Content": "I just finished a week stay at the New York and had a great time. For those new to Las Vegas, the hotel is located right towards the beginning of the strip and is across the street from the Monorail that will run you up and down the strip (for a hefty fee). I got there early on Monday morning and although they didn't have any rooms available yet (it was 9am) they gave me an early check in. They gave me keys and everything, all I had to do when I came back later that afternoon is pick up any house phone and give them my name and they gave me a room number. I had a Skyline room, room 1564. The room is pleasantly big, with double beds, an entertainment center, small computer desk / table. Average shower and bathroom facilities. Plenty of room for all of my belongings and a wall safe was very helpful, although the safe is extremely small and will only hold small items, like an iPod, wallet, jewelry..etc. No laptop will fit so beware of bringing one. The only negative in the room was the television; it was about 10 years old and was a 19 inch. It looked rather odd in the large entertainment center and the remote didn't work very well....but this is Vegas after all and I didn't watch much TV except at night when trying to fall asleep. The Hotel is quite nice for the money ($80 per night on my stay). It's in good shape overall and has some nice things to do. The roller coaster is always fun, the arcade is nice for the kids. Definitely eat at Sirroco's Pizza. It's fantastic and I would have eaten there more than once if I could have. Do NOT eat the breakfast \"buffet\" under any circumstances. It has about 15 or 20 items total (counting the bread, fruit...etc). Other than eggs and bacon, everything else is \"Oriental\" breakfast and is not appetizing at all. For $13 I was very very unhappy. After getting screwed there once I went to the Paris hotel for breakfast (BEST buffet in town, hands down). I also went to the spa, which I'll review elsewhere but it was a good time also.

The hotel is average. Caught a taxi from the airport, Check-In was nice and quick. Asked for a view of the strip and got a room looking at the MGM and Trpoicana junction on the 30th Floor, well away from the rollercoaster and excellent night views. There are 6 lifts to this particular floor! I was disappointed that there was no fridge or tea making facilities in the room otherwise it was fine. No DVD player but clean and confortable (especially the bed). I liked that you could leave the aircon on when you went out (doesn't rely on the swipe card to be inserted anywhere). For breakfast I would recommend Chin Chin. Great buffet choice and great value $26 for 2 adults. Casino area isn't much to look at after you've visited the other hotels which seem to be better presented, illuminated and more lively. Do the rollercoaster but be warned it is violent! My wife and I didn't feel the same for a couple of days afterwards. Next time i would choose to stay at places like, Belaggios, Ceasars Palace, The Venetian, The Wynn or Manadaly Bay. (MGM is huge but really crowded). The strip is massive. Everywhere seems close because you can see it, but OBJECTS APPEAR CLOSER THAN THEY ARE and you will get tired after a couple of days of some serious walking. Make use of the free Monorail between Excalibur and Manadalay Bay, get a 24hr ticket for the DEUCE bus (the only double decker buses on the strip) which just go up and down the strip at all hours for $5 each. Catch lots of cabs and take comfortable footwear. Most of the hotels have free shows so don't miss any. The Volcano at Mirage was being repaired and Treasure Island was cancelled 2 days running due to high winds. TOP ATTRACTION is the Belaggio Fountain outside the hotel. Also go on a Gondola in the Venetian ($15each). We saw a Magic show at The greek Isles Hotel, had VIP seats and were impressed by the magic acts. Too good to have any doubts about Magic. Excursions. We went in a Helicopter over the Hoover Dam, Grand Canyon and landed at a Cowboy Ranch where we went horse riding. On another day we went Rafting down 12 miles of the Colorado River from Hoover Dam through Black Canyon to Willowby Beach. The next day we went Extreme Sky Diving (our first Tandem jump) and this was like nothing we've ever done before. It was just beautiful and there is nothing to fear at all. Food. Eat what you like and where you like. We just kept it simple until we lost our appettites (might be the heat 32C). Night is still t-shirt weather. Nightlife. Has to be the best in the world. We had pre-paid Vegas Passports which gave us VIP access to all the nightclubs (about 25) and included the entrance fees. Do dress up though as i saw many people get turned away because of footwear. The best club (and most expensive) was VooDoo Rising at The Rio Hotel. It is on the 51st (and top) open air floor overlooking the whole of Las Vegas. The views were amazing, the music was excellent (choice of 3 rooms/music) and its clearly where the rich kids go to party. This club is a MUST!!! LAX in Luxor Hotel was also very good, as were RAIN at Palms (for the views) and PURE at Ceasars Palce for views/rooms and choice of music. We managed about 10 clubs in 3 nights.

There is some building work beneath Coyote Ugly which was being revealed the day we left. There is also a closed off area in the middle. All casino's are updating so don't let it put you off and we couldn't hear them working. Check in There was no check in queue when we arrived at 3:30pm. Other days we did see a long queues so I wonder if they got a shuttle and arrived all at once. I saw queues at other hotels too due to the number of guests. I have read the reviews on here before booking and the guy that found the soap made me laugh, why not call houskeeping to get them to re-clean the room as that's why they have a phone extenstion. Also someone couldn't find their room, try looking on the key card. I was given a map and pointed in the right direction as I left reception. In the tower there were 6 fast elevators so hardly waited at all. Luggage was brought up within minutes of getting into the room. Location NYNY is in a great position a bridge links it to the MGM and another one to the Excalibur. From the Excalibur you can walk through to the Luxor and Mandalay bay or use the free tram. There are some shops opposite to get water and food from. Rooms Our room was in the Newyorker tower 9th floor. We could see the roller coaster but could not hear it. It's opening/closing times seem to vary but our friends on the 4th floor couldn't hear it. Our room was a famly set up so had an adjoining door so we could hear next door easily, my only negative. The room has a wall safe, hairdryer and iron. Try the promotional code TAHITI for an upgrade from the basic room. Casino I don't gamble but our friends do and said that this hotel has good drinks service. We tried it one night and found it to be quick and a good selection. Restaurants We ate in the Italian one night and found it to be very good. It has plenty of snack places so plenty of choices. Use the voucher being handed out from near Chin Chin restaurant to get free hotdog. Don't use the American for breakfast as it is very expensive, use the buffet places in other casino's. Rainforest cafe at MGM was good. Bars Prices seem to vary on drinks from bar to bar. The nine fine Irishmen was $7.50 for a Guiness and not even a pint. It has live entertainment in the afternoons. Coyote Ugly was always packed as was the bar at Times Square so never went in there. Chin Chin bar was quieter and a good meeting point for us before heading out. The bar by reception near the main doors has the best coffee (better than starbucks) and was $2.50. Pool Now hear is the bad part of the hotel. The pool is freezing and small. The sunloungers are packed in. The pool area is in shade until 11am and you can hear the roller coaster every few minutes but music is playing drowning some of the screams out. Turn left out of the doors and get the loungers in the corner by the fire escape doors these are quieter and get the sun first.

Strange to see how people's opinions differ so widely on the rooms. I guess it's just like the casino slots, you either get a good one or it just takes all your money. I was one of the lucky ones as far as the room goes. I was sure because I received a \"special\" offer, I would get one of the worst rooms. But I got a Park Avenue room on the 29th floor. The view was opposite of the strip but that doesn't bother me. It was still very pretty at night with all the city lights. And it's not like anyone sits and stares out of their window for their whole stay! It was nonsmoking (which I requested) but had 2 queen beds instead of king. No big deal. Nonsmoking was more important. It was a handicapped room so it was very spacious. It was very clean and the bathroom sparkled. No complaints about the room at all. Check in was a breeze. I was a little early for check in but they had a room ready. Only one person ahead of me in line. Check in clerk seemed a little taken aback that I requested a room away from the roller coaster, but was very polite about it and although I could see the roller coaster a few floors below my room, it was far enough away I could not hear it. All staff I came in contact with was exceptionally polite and helpful. It seems like only the people that complain about something, are the ones that get the rude service. As other reviewers have said, the slots are extremely tight there. I usually walk around and see how other gamblers are doing and other than a couple of exicited people winning a few hundred dollars, no big winners. Construction going on in the casino so it was very noisy at times. But there was a good variety of machines. I like using the pools at hotels where I stay but this was an exception. The hotel pool seems to be geared toward the young, trendy crowd. It was overcrowded and noisy. The only lounge chair I could find was right next to the rest rooms and there were loudspeakers right overhead blaring rock music. (Those days are way behind me!) People were packed in like sardines. Not relaxing at all. The only restaurant I tried was II Fornaio. Small bistro like atmosphere and they served a limited light menu. I had a tomato, basil, mozzarella sandwich on Italian bread. It was wonderful. A nice break from the usual hamburger and sub sandwich. And at $7 not a budget breaker for lunch. Check out was very easy and fast also. I had plenty of time so went down to the desk to get my receipt right away. No long lines and again very polite staff. Took my luggage to the bellman until my flight and had no problems whatever. A little slow getting the bags out, so don't run at the last minute and expect to get out fast. I enjoyed my stay and if another special offer comes along, I would consider it.

I was told there were no non-smoking rooms available until the next day. That was fine with us for one night.

The check in guy ignored my requests for an upgrade because of the inconvenience - he just kept saying ' this is a better room'.

The girl said our second room would not be ready for about 30 minutes. We asked if we would have to stand in line again and she said 'yes.' We complained about having this. There was no apology, no 'sorry, but that's our policy.' She was completely indifferent. We waited about an hour, went back and stood in line for around 30 minutes this time. The room was still not ready and we were told we would have to wait in line yet a third time. My husband complained again and said that we didn't want to waste the afternoon waiting to check in. They said they would reserve us a room close to the one room that we had, and that we could come back and check into the reserved room later that evening. Now 10 p.m. and waited in line again. The young guy practically called my husband a liar, saying that there was no way someone went against policy and reserved us a room. He was extremely rude. After asking to speak to a manager, who was also very unconcerned about our complaints, she finally (after much argument) did agree to give us $30 off the rate of one of the rooms for one night. (Upon checkout, we were told this was not recorded and we were not given the $30 off.) We finally got the second room and it was in a different tower and nowhere near the first room. ARRRRGHHH! This room had no view of the strip which we'd paid the extra money for. The first room had a slight view of the strip, about all you could see was the MGM across the street. I wish I had the names of the four people at the front desk that we dealt with. If ever treated like this again, I will be writing down names and dates for an official complaint!! As for the room itself, it was supposedly recently redecorated but it was very old. It was also dirty. I've attached a couple of pictures showing the dirty carpet and the nightstand which no one had thoroughly dusted in quite a long time. The pillowcases so rough I couldn't sleep on them. The bedspread had a hole in it and looked dirty. The rollercoaster was very noisy and kept us awake. The water in the bathroom sink also had an awful sulphur-like smell. I recommend paying less and staying at Circus Circus. The rooms are bigger, brighter, nicer and cleaner for less money.

They sell bottles at the gift shop and at one of the koisks. - Now I don't know about the other rooms but our room did NOT have a mini fridge!!! Which was very important because we wanted to refrigerate our own alcohol and drinks. So we went over to wallgreens and bought a five dollar cooler... which helped but wasn't the greatest. - We visited during the week and there weren't as many young people as we had hoped. I recommend going over the weekend when the younger crowd is there... if that's what you are looking for. - For sun bathers - By the pool, the sun is blocked by the hotel up until about noon.

After some haggling, we agreed to pay $45 night extra. This was a spa suite. Room wasn't ready and we had to check out in order to switch rooms. So we were without a room from 10:00 a.m. until 3:30 when the spa suite was ready! After spending one night in this room - dirty spa tub, something gross-looking around the drain in the shower - I told my husband we were leaving. Called TI and got comped for 3 nights.

Only other problem I had was the girl behind the desk at the players card counter, she was a nasty girl... my husband had to go deal with her as I was getting very upset with her. Overall we LOVED NYNY and would stay there every time we go!!! I don't understand the negative reviews, I guess some people are just really picky but I couldn't find much to pick on at the hotel. (other than the two workers that needed more customer service manners, but that is solved by moving to another table/casino). TIP: The timeshare people - you just have to have fun with them! Every time we would pass by my husband would hollar at them just like they try to hollar at you to get your attention - he would laugh and then they would end up laughing.

The room we were in that first night was OK. Thankfully, the smoke smell wasn't that bad and we could tolerate the room. When we received the call the next morning to change rooms and upgrade, we were very disappointed to learn that the only \"upgrade\" they gave us was a strip room, but still the older (but newly decorated) room. We were hoping for the next room up. Overall, the hotel is nice, but is showing it's age compared to some of the newer and nicer hotels.

The hotel itself is not as large as some of the other resort hotels..i think this helps a lot although it did get fairly crowded in the evening..this was also made worse by the kids being on spring break and the fact that it was Easter as well.

We ate alot in 'America' NY-NY's themed restraunt, the staff in there are a credit to the hotel..very helpful and lovely people..they can't be faulted.

Spoke to the front desk and they moved us the next day to an identical room on the 24th floor with a great view, this room was also alot quieter and you couldn't hear the hotel roller coaster. We stayed in a Park Avenue Delux room in the Century Tower. The room has ecerything you would expect apart from a mini bar, but who needs a bar when the town is open 24/7. The room was very clean and the maids did a good job on a daily basis. The location of the hotel is perfect, next to the MGM Grand, Excalibur, Monti carlo and only a short (free) tram ride from the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. The Belargio, Paris and other mid strip hotels are only a 5 minute walk or 2 minutes on the MGM mono rail. Facilities in the hotel are excellent, good food, drink , shops and plenty of slots, tables etc. They do have a breakfast buffet but the choice is limited compared to the other strip hotels, far better to walf across the street to the MGM or the Belagio which had huge selections by comparison. Car Rental service is also available within the hotel (provided by Dollar), we booked a car for two days to travel to Hoover Dam & Grand Canyon and it was cheaper booking at the hotel rather than on X pedia.

I have never stayed at this hotel and wasn't sure that I would like it since I wasn't real impressed with it when walking through it in the past. But I was pleasantly surprised. My husband had a work truck, which needed to be driven into a special area of the garage for larger vehicles. He stopped and asked the valet attendant for directions to the garage. Immediately, a gentleman came over to the truck and opened the door and waited for me to get out so he could collect our luggage. I was a bit put off as I wasn't planning on getting out right there and wasn't prepared to have him start grabbing suitcases. One of the bags wasn't even closed, but he grabbed it anyway and put it on the cart. I felt a little bullied, and was worried that the contents of the bag would end up spilling out. Not a good way to start the stay at their hotel. Check in was a bit longer than usual because they wouldn't let us check into our room since the guy who booked both of the rooms hadn't arrived yet. Not a big deal, but a bit inconvenient. The woman checking us in was very friendly. We stayed in the Century Tower, on the 27th floor. The room was quite nice--large, with a king-sized bed. The windows overlooked the Monte Carlo and the construction site of the City Center, which was interesting to see from above since my husband's company had worked on the project. The windows were tinted a pink color, which took a little while to get used to. I'm not sure why they were tinted--maybe to help keep the heat down in the middle of summer? Anyway, it was a nice view. The room was very clean. And so was the bathroom. The bathroom itself was large, with a lighted, magnifying mirror. The shower pressure was good. My only complaint might have been the sliding door to the bathroom. I'd rather have one on hinges, but they were better than the awful doors in the bathrooms at The Orleans. Carpets were in good shape and I noticed no stains on either them or the bedspread. You could see the roller coaster rails outside the window, but I really didn't hear any noise, so that didn't bother me. In fact, we really didn't hear a lot of noise at all. But we were also not in the room much during the weekend. There was an ironing board and iron in the armoir, along with plenty of hangars and extra pillows. The tv was also in this same armoir. All electrical things were in working order and we had no real problems with the room safe. I didn't notice a refrigerator in the room. We didn't gamble while there, so I can't comment on the casino. However, one of the other couples we were with did quite well on the slots one night. There are plenty of places to get food. One evening, we dined at the Il Fornaio inside the casino and had a wonderful meal. Everyone commented on the good food that they served. We had no problem getting a table there; however, there was a line waiting by the time we left the restaurant about 8 or 9 p.m. The casino needs to do a better job of catering to the early morning crowds. We all got up early to head to the races and decided to meet down at the Starbucks at 6:30 a.m. When we got there, Starbucks wasn't open--not a good thing for all of us Seattle people who really need our coffee in the morning. We ended up going around the corner where you could actually get a Krispy Kreme donut and a beer if you wanted. My husband opted for their coffee, which he wasn't too impressed with. Quite a few others also came through to get their caffeine fix at Starbucks, only to find they didn't open till 7 a.m.--unheard of in \"coffee country.\" They could have made a lot of money if they had opened earlier. I know other Starbucks in other casinos have been open in the earlier morning hours, so am not sure why they waited so long to start serving. Check out was easy and fast, but then we left very early to head back to Sedona. All in all, it was a pleasant stay. But then I didn't have to pay the hotel bill--I believe they charged about $225 per night, which included taxes. Way too high, in my personal opinion, but then the NASCAR races probably had something to do with the high hotel prices. I wouldn't have paid that if I had been taking care of the room myself. I'd rather spend my money elsewhere--we loved our room at the Rio and it was a lot cheaper and even larger in size. Another good thing I noticed while we were there is that I saw fewer children running around than in some of the other hotels. (May have been a fluke, though.) I sincerely think that parents with younger children should be spending their time entertaining their children off the strip--or in Disneyland. Getting a babysitter might be a novel idea..... Adults should have a place to go and play without having to worry about tripping over baby strollers in the casinos.....All in all, a nice stay, but a bit pricey for me.", "Date": "March 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa", "Title": "\u201cAt the end of the strip\u201d", "Author": "stormiowa", "ReviewID": "UR14183134", "Content": "We stayed at the NY, NY in March of 08 for 4 days.

The hotel has a lovely, reasonably priced Italian restaurant called Il Fornaio, and you can view their menu online.

If you want to take your chances, however, you can get tickets for half price on the day of the performance, depending upon availability of course.

We rented a car for one day, and had no problem renting it, or parking it overnight so we could return it the next day. We did eat at the steakhouse one night, and while the meal was good, it was fairly expensive and very crowded, even on a Thursday night.

This was our first time to stay here. Got to LV on the 25th of January, the day the Monte Carlo burned. New York received some of the overflow from this hotel initiallay, but we did not check in until Sunday the 27th as we had reservations elsewhere the first two days. Worried about possibly crowed hotel conditions, we arrived from our first hotel on Sunday. Check in was very fast and the reservations clerk was very nice. Our room was what we booked-- a Park Avenue Strip View King Nonsmoking. These rooms have been recently rennovated and looked nice. Marble bath (albeit smallish). Nice new upholstered furniture, gray metalic wallpaper with an art deco style in keeping with the Century building theme. I don't usually like wallpaper in a hotel but it worked in this room. It added warmth to the room--that and the upholstered high headrest that was actually attached to the wall. I find the armoire a bit out of place with the other furnishings but overall I enjoyed our room on the 29th floor overlooking the tropicana, the airport, and part of Excallibur and the MGM. The bed was quite comfortable and I am a mattress junkie who has owned several very nice mattresses (currently own a high end 100% latex mattress which I absolutely love). The pillows were fairly good as well. I slept well and noise was generally not an issue in our room with the exception of hearing the dinging of the elevator occasionally as we were only a few rooms from the elevator. Still it really was not an issue. There did seem to be some water conservation issues in the hotel but they did not affect the upper floors. I have no idea if they were fire related from the Monte Carlo fire two days earlier. The only meal we ate here was at Il Fornaio for breakfast as we had a buy one get one coupon. The food was good, but not really outstanding in any way. It was typical hotel fare though they promote it as northern Italian. I imagine it probably is \"more Italian\" for lunch and dinner. Table game limits were 10 and up. Slots not big paying as I recall but small pots to be had. Actually a fairly easy casino to get around in. The Times Square Bar was not that busy on Sunday night so we did not want to pay the cover and additional fee for a table so instead of them getting our drink money, we just walked around. Had there been no cover, we would have gone in for a while and had a drink or two. The time we were there it was a \"slow\" time of year. Next weekend will be Superbowl though and it will be packed. Even so, the hotel casino was somewhat busy as it is smaller than most other big strip hotel casinos. I chose it for ambiance and just to experience this hotel from the inside, and I am glad I stayed here but have been to others and will likely stay elsewhere next time. No real complaints. I had fun--just been there done that and next stay will probably be Bellagio or the great big rooms in the PH which I have stayed in a number of times. Also I like to play poker and they have no poker room here unfortunately. There is one across the street at MGM that they directed me to but late at night I want to stick to my property.

There's a cobblestone street where there are a few bars and restaurants, or stands to grab a quick bite to eat. They also have tables and chairs outside these places where you can sit and eat or just relax. The pizza place, where you just buy and go, is ok. It's a good place to grab something quick. The steakhouse is awesome! It's a sit-down restaurant where the food is a bit more expensive. They serve a lot of food too, so go in with an empty stomach. We also spent some time at 3 of the bars in the hotel. The Irish pub is a nice place to get away from the casino for a while. They have an Irish band in the evenings. The Bar at Times Square had a piano player that would play requested songs that everyone can sing along to. They charge $10 to get into this bar, but it's open air so you can just stay outside of it on the casino side and sing along with everyone else. THe Big Apple bar had a good rock band when we were there. It's free to walk in here. i checked out the prices in the spa and they were ridiculous.

I came into LAS on fight night (Hatton and Mayweather) early that Saturday morning. I took a taxi from the airport to the hotel which from now on I will do when visiting LAS. Checking into the hotel wasn't exactly quick. It took about 15-20 minutes, but once I was assisted it only took about 5 minutes and it was about noon time. I stayed in the Century rooms on the 21st floor and just outside my window was the drop off for the rollercoaster. I could faintly hear the screams. The room itself was beautiful. I requested a king size bed and a non-smoking room and my request was granted :-) This was the first time in a while that I was able to get a room that I wanted in all my recent travels. The room was very comfortable and \"roomy.\" The bathroom was large. The only fault would be that there was approximately a half inch space at the bottom of the room door, but the floor was quiet so that wasn't a problem. The hotel and casino was festive and it seems that all the patrons were having a pleasant time. I played a few video poker games and the waitress kept the drinks coming including a bottle of water. The bar where the dueling pianos was very active with the \"Brits\" in town and I spent alot of time and money there. I ate at the American resturant and the food was average and pricey. I reviewed the video arcade which was large enough for children to have a good time as long as their stay at the hotel was short. If I decide to bring my son with me while he is still young (6 yrs-12), this wil be the hotel that I choose. The number one reason why I enjoyed my stay was the employees of the hotel. I must admit, there was service with a smile. I had booked the hotel before the fight was scheduled and when I found out that I was going to be in LAS on fight night I first wanted to know how much for a ticket which was way out of my league :-( However, I learned that MGM properties were showing the fight on close circuit television and would be selling tickets.

Every day when we returned to the room, although the bed was made, it looked as if someone had been lying on it just prior to leaving the room. Our second day there, we returned to find we had no new shampoo, and we were out of it. We didn't find out until later, that the maid had left new shampoo on the sink behind the tissues instead of on the shelf in the shower stall (where we found it the first day). On more than one occasion, we came back to find dirty, empty plastic cups from the night before were still sitting on the nightstand. And finally, our third day there, we came back to the room to find a dirty feather duster lying on top of my husband's good clothes. The maid had apparently left it behind. We couldn't wait to get to Nine Fine Irishmen, because we always have a blast there. I ordered the Irish Breakfast, which was great, and my husband got the Lamb Stew. There was hardly any meat in his stew and for $14.00/bowl, I don't think it would have killed them to put a big pile of lamb in there. We decided to never eat there again. I also couldn't wait to play the slots and looked forward to playing the big, electronic ones, with all the bells and whistles. Well, those were few and far between, and ALWAYS crowded. But they have hundered of the old school \"777\" ones, that I find really boring. Since MGM Grand is part of NYNY's Player's Club, we spent most of our time (and money) there.

My wife and I were in town for the Las Vegas Bowl and chose NYNY because we haven't stayed there before but always liked the Casino and the ESPN Zone. Pluses: We liked the variey of restaurants at the hotel. They pretty much covered all the bases and no matter what you were in the mood for you could find it there. We had a great lunch at the ESPN Zone and I had a field day with a booth facing 2 wall-size tv's along with our own 17 inch screen at the table that we could watch and listen to any game we wanted. We had some good pizza at one of the smaller restaurants and liked that atmosphere as well. We had a rate of $94/night directly through the hotel on one of their specials that also gave us a couple 2 for 1 deals and a starbucks credit and $10 in free-play. I'm not one for the slots but that $10 turned into $135 when I cashed out so their free play more than paid for one of our nights. I sign up for a lot of email specials from a bunch of places in Vegas but never before had it worked out this well. Minuses: The walls were incredibly thin. We were woken up at 7:30 AM on Saturday to a conversation in the next room that we could tell wasn't even in raised voices. And then on Sunday morning we could hear the housekeeping staff in the other room word for word also. And Vegas isn't exactly the type of place where you want to be woken up that early, especially if you've just gone to sleep... The location is on the south side of the strip and there is a lot of construction between the Monte Carlo and Bellagio so it feels kind of isolated from the center of the strip. But each hotel is kind of a world all its own so it wasn't that big of a deal although we drove down to Caesars to check out the shops and the fountains at Bellagio. One of the main reasons I've stayed away from NYNY was because I never liked the pool area. It seems kind of cramped in on the side of the hotel right off Tropicana. We chose to stay here in December when it was 40-50 degrees so it took that out of the equation but if you're coming here in warmer weather the pool isn't as nice as at MGM Grand or Mirage.

The hallways you had to walk through to get to your room were ridiculous. I couldn't believe how poorly designed this hotel was. The room itself, Park Avenue, was a step below a room in the Luxor: dated, needing remodeling, and the bed was hard and the bathroom was ridiculously small. In addition to the problems mentioned above, I was never able to redeem my 10 in free slot play (it would never work and there were no instructions given to me on how to retrieve on the slot card -- and I have been an MGM slot card holder for over a year!!!). I then tried to go to lunch at Nine Fine Irishmen, where I have eaten before. I was told that as a single diner I could not use the 2 for 1 coupon given to me by the hotel as part of my booking package. This was after I was told by the host outside that she didn't know and that I should ask the bartender if they would honor the coupon. The bartender I asked said they would. I was then seated and my server informed me that they wouldn't accept the coupon. At that point I left the restaurant for good. This is unbelievably cheap and was completely alienating to someone who actually liked the restaurant and wanted to dine there. I won't ever spend any money at NYNY ever again. They couldn't even handle a simple coupon promotion properly. I have since complained in writing to NYNY.

When it came down to it I couldnt be happier in our decision to stay at NY NY. As soon as we got off the plane it was easy to get our luggage and find the shuttle (directly outside the doors of the airport) that took us to our hotel. They are not always the friendliest drivers so make sure you have your shuttle ticket out and ready to be checked by them. When arriving at NY NY we were greeted immediately by a bellman who took our bags for us and stored them until we were checked in. One slight problem was the computers were down at the time we tried to check in. They gave us a pretty broad range of time in which it may be up, so we decided to try out a restaurant for our lunch while we waited. We went to Nine Fine Irishmen right in the hotel and got to eat outside since it was gorgeous. After getting off of a 5 hour flight it was nice to just sit out and people watch. The food was great and the service was excellent. By the time lunch was finished we waited in the casino by check in and one good thing we noticed is that there are always cocktail waitresses offering drinks in the casino, you do not have to hunt them down. We were able to check in much earlier then expected. They did try to tell us the only had a smoking room available and would move us the next night, but I told them when booking we had noted we did not want smoking. Within 5 minutes they came back and had a non-smoking room available. So it helped to speak up, and they were extremely nice about it. Room was much bigger and cleaner than expected. The casino was a bit smokey but it didnt travel up into the rooms. Water pressure I didnt think was as bad as some have made it out to be in reviews. Although we were overlooking the highest part of the rollercoaster, right before the drop, it really was not loud at all. From previous reviews I was a bit worried, but glad to find you didnt even really notice it! It was actually a lot of fun to watch randomly when in the room, but your so busy with other stuff we were only there to sleep and get ready! While there went to Coyote Ugly which had awesome drink specials and free shots every 5 minutes it felt like. The staff was really nice and there was a lot of interaction. The Dueling Piano bar was very entertaining and we actually went 2 nights because its such a fun time. The bartenders are friendly and fun as well there. The Big Apple Bar which is right in the center of the casino is more of a Rock and Roll bar which was ok, but more of a place you went to sit and listen while drinking. We had discussed trying more of the well known clubs outside of NY NY but had so much fun where we were we didnt have time! The main village area had many food options that could please pretty much anyone and in the mornings it was nice because it you could have a good coffee and it wasnt as loud or busy. The detail of everything in NY NY is incredible. You feel like you are there, even down to how the walkways look like the cobblestone streets. Overall NY NY was amazing and was perfect for our first time in Vegas. I felt like I got the best of both worlds, in that I could have the true Vegas party experience but not feel so overwhelemd that I didn't enjoy it. It offered so much and so many different things.

But the best decision I made for this trip to Vegas, was asking the gal checking us in whether there were \"any rooms with spas available?\" For a $45 a night, we added an in-room jacuzzi tub with views to distant mountains out one window and The Strip out the other window--it made the trip.

From the beginning the service was great! We had three rooms and they got us checked in early and all the rooms right by eachother, two of which connected, a major plus!! The staff was always helpful which made the stay even better. Our rooms were great, very clean, and the beds were comfortable. I am normally very picky about hotel cleanliness, and this hotel certainly passed inspection. The only con about the hotel itself was the elevators got me a lttle confused the first day, and our rooms were at the end of the hall so it required a winding path to make to our room. The pool served its purpose for our trip. Our first day there we got to the pool around noon and had a good amount of sun in the chairs closest to the casino doors. We also sampled the food and beverages here, all of which where great! We asked before we left if there were any cabanas available for the next day and they said they weren't be sure if any would be available, because some are reserved for VIPs, but if we came down in the morning they would let us know. So on Saturday morning we went down and they were able to get us into a Cabana for the day at $150 including all the extras listed on their website. The cabana was nice because it had a TV for the guys in our group to watch football, and it was close to the pool so we didn't have any chairs in front of us! The only problem was by the time we got down our area was covered in shade for the rest of the day, which I didn't mind because it was still warm even in the shade. While it may not be as fancy as some of the other cabanas on the strip the staff was friendly and it was a great central location for a big group to meet up! The only real con with the pool was it was hard to get down to the pool by elevator because you had to swipe your card and for some reason it took everyone a long time to get the reader to actually read the card. The pool size wasn't huge, but you can tell that on the website, so if you are all about the size of the pool you should probably go to one of the hotels that has more pools. Otherwise the size isn't that big of a deal, and also means this area isn't as crowded as the mega pool complexes and we were actually able to order food in a timely manner.

We were allocated two twin rooms in the New Yorker tower, but on different floors. The rooms were spotlessly clean and in excellent condition. Bed was lovely and comfortable! Bathroom had shower screen over the bath which is far preferable to a curtain. My room on floor 11 looked over the rollercoaster as you might expect, but it was far away enough not to hear the screams too loudly. The food we had at the hotel was excellent - pizza and sandwiches from outlets in The Village, and breakfast and dinner at the Italian Restaurant - Il Fornaio - the service was excellent, and even though there was a queue on the Friday evening, we got a table within about 15 minutes and they even served us drinks fom the window while we were in the queue! The Nine Fine Irishmen pub was a handy place and you could sit outside if you wanted. Main course salads very small here though. The couple of downsides in my opinion - and this is true of all Vegas - the casino floors are so vast and confusing it's easy to get lost, so beware of your surroundings and landmarks or you won't have a clue where you are or how to get out. Also the lighting is very dim on the main casino floor as the ceiling is dark, as though it's night in New York.

We did not do the slip him a $20 with the credit card, we just asked and told him it was our anniversary, still no luck. He brought a manager out who gave us the Marquis suite for an extra $30 a night. We gladly accepted. On the way to the room we were stopped by the timeshare sharks, we said no. In Mexico you can get up to $600 for your 90 minutes, here the max was $100, it wasn't worth our time. We got a drink from a bar in the Casino and went to our suite. Wow, the Marquis suite was wonderful. 700 sq feet including a hot tub. The room was very nice with a sitting area, armoir, bose stereo system, hot tub, marble tile, decent, but not spectacular bathroom. The thing that impressed us the most was the size of the room. It was very wide and spacious. The roller coaster was outside, not close and not too noisy. Upon arrival to our room, our luggage followed almost immediately with a remarkable young woman as our bellperson. She had been with NYNY since it opened and she was awesome. She knew everything about the hotel, amenities, sights to see, etc. She was in no rush to leave us, offering to answer any questions we had. We got unpacked and went out to dinner. We attempted to dine at Gallagers steakhouse but it was a long wait so we indulged at the bar, drink count, 1 double, 2 singles, went over to Gonzales Y Gonzales (recommended by our bell person). I had the chicken fajitas, hubby had the enchiladas, our food was very good. Coming from Arizona, we get good mexican food regularly and Gonzalez Y Gonzalez didn't disappoint. Their chips & salsa were great, great drinks, fun bartender and server. Hot tub was awesome. The water really pours out into this thing so it didn\u2019t take long at all to fill it. The bell gal told us that the hot tub bath salts didn\u2019t do much so we could add some shampoo \u2013 advice\u2026 don\u2019t add more than about a teaspoon full. We had a lot of bubbles. Friday, slept til noon, had lunch at the Pizza place in NYNY, it was very good. Gambled a little, lost a little. Shopped at the Zumanity shop, not too impressive but too expensive. Also shopped at the other shops in NYNY for souveniers for the kids. Saturday morning \u2013 slept til noon again! Hubby went downstairs and got Krispee Kreme donuts and then we hit the casino and lunch at Nine Fine Irishmen. We had an excellent server, Amber. She took our free drink coupons, 4 of them and our buy one get one lunch free coupon. We enjoyed the musician who was entertaining. It was a very fun atmosphere. Of course it wouldn\u2019t be Vegas if a dozen Elvis wig wearing guys didn\u2019t come in drinking. We gambled a little and then wandered over to MGM grand. MGM was full of Parrotheads ready for the Jimmy Buffet concert. We only saw a couple that were really elaborate. We stopped over at Excalibur and then back to Mandalay Bay for drinks. I love how the casinos are connected with the walkways over the strip and by the tram. Taking the tram back to Mandalay Bay we still didn\u2019t remember walking over there on Friday night LOL. Saturday evening was our night for Zumanity. We arrived half hour before showtime, got drinks and were seated. We had the couch seats and luckily they were not right up front they were back just a little bit. The couch seats up front were right in the center of attention for all of the performers and being one who doesn\u2019t want to be the center of attention I was happy we were not! Hubby on the other hand would have loved to be part of the show. We really enjoyed Zumanity, it was a great performance and I would definitely recommend the couch seating. No better seats in the house. We had a wonderful trip in Vegas.

This hotel takes up a whole City block and is at the beginning, Southern part of the Strip and attached to the MGM Grand (another great hotel) and the Excalibur. The interior casino was cute and reminiscent of New York, don't forget to try the Deli in the food court, the sandwiches are to die for!! This hotel has no Buffet, but we went over to the MGM's which was great. The BEST buffet we ate at was at the RIO Hotel, second best was the Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood! We loved our trip and heeded all the warnings about walking, yes our feet were killing us. But we later learned to hop on the Monorail, or take the public transit for $2.00. We watched the KA show by Cirque Du Soliel (At MGM) and it blew our minds!! Best show on the strip!! As long as you ask for the things you want in a room, this hotel was AMAZING value for your dollar!!

Check in was quick and easy despite having to walk your way through the gaming machines with your cases etc to the reception desk and thereafter to the elevators. However, you quickly understand that this is how Vegas works! Our room had been described as an upgradeto a deluxe Park Avenue room. However, whereas it was fine, we didn't have the feelling of being upgraded. Our view was poor - away from the strip and facing west towards the Orleans hotel and a large car park. The room amenities were average. The bathroom no more than adequate, television restricted to tourism channels and American shows, no tea/coffee making facilites, only just sufficient wardrobe space but with a very useful room safe. However, we did not spend a great deal of time in the room - as there is simply so much to see and do in Vegas - and overall was it adequate for our purposes. we most ceratinly did not hear any noise in an evening. The pool area is at best average in comparison with the others we seen from views from the Monorail and visting other hotels. The buildings around the hotel means that it is in the shade in the morning and in the early evening, and perhaps this was reflected with it's 6pm closure. A ice making machine in the hotel corridor near our room (No. 1277) made up for the lack of a room fridge and ensured that ice cubes for the gin and tonics was always at hand. Despite no tea/coffee making facilities, a short morning visit to the Greenwich for our coffees ensured that my wife still enjoyed a morning coffee in bed. The entertanment in the casino was varied - with live bands and the duet pianists. Their sounds coupled with the cumulative noise of the slot machines and cheers from the tables, at times created a noise level that was a little high and uncomfortable if it is not your normal way. This was fairly typical of most hotels but Ny Ny was perhaps the noisest we expereinced and we found that the best way of coping with it was by joining in through playing the machines or listening to the entertainment. I must make a point of saying that I found the quality of the Guiness in the Nine Irishmen pub to be below standard. It lacked the quality of a true pint of the 'black stuff' and by way of observation on how it was poured and settled far too quickly, one is tempted to say that 'extra water' had been added to it. The Ny Ny roller coaster was fun - made you scream and shout - but was pricey at $14- albeit they tried to make up for their high prices by offering further rides at a reduced rate of $7. You should take time to quickly get your bearings around the hotel as there are several ways of entering/leaving the hotel and you can get a little disorientated until you become totally familiar with its layout. The NY NY is at the southern end of the strip but this is a problem. Transport is readily available if you do not wish to walk. We tried the Monorail - all day ticket at $9 - and also the Deuce bus - all day ticket at $5. The former was cleaner, quicker but you do need to walk through the MGM to get to it and this in itself takes time whereas the former did get very busy at times making it very slow. Found Neil Sedaka to be alive and well and thoroughly enjoyed his show at the Orleans very much indeed, with the half tickets obtained at the booth proving to be excellent value. Only eat snacks in the NY NY as we eat out at other hotel restuarantsas we constantly explored the Strip - such as the Tropicana, Baly's and the Rio. Food was plentiful and extremely good value. Check out was simple - and by completing a card from your room you simple deposited your key card in the apprpriate box near to the elevator. Highlights of Las Vegas included the Bellagio fountains ( they simple were amazing), the other free shows such as the Freemont street light show (Downtown), the erupting volcano(Mirage), the Pirate fight (TI), the Masquerade show (Rio), the moving statues (Forum Shops at Caesars palace) and the Rain Storm at the Mile Long Shops all provide a quality and Disney like theme to the Strip. The view from the Stratosphere Tower at sunset was also worthwhile. Our trip to the Grand Canyon - South Rim - was excellent and a refrshing break from Vegas itself. It gave another dimension to the holiday, enables us to see at close hand both the Canyon and Hoover Dam but also get a feel for the Nevada and Arizona countryside. Well worth the trip albeit it was a long day. Overall the New York New York did not appear to cater well for children, and was more suited to those adults who wanted to enjoy themselves in a party like way. It was not the best hotel we seen in terms of furnishings - unlike the Bellagio, Caesars Palace and the Paris - but it does what 'it says on the tin' and if you do your research beforehand then you will know what to expect and not be disappointed.", "Date": "October 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "SC", "Title": "\u201chorrible stay at NYNY hotel & casino\u201d", "Author": "Purplemonkey07", "ReviewID": "UR10028231", "Content": "My husband & I went to Las Vegas in March of this year & got married & had an awesome time. Stayed at Stratosphere & was treated great & had no issues. We wanted to come back in 6 months to try & do everything else that we did not fit in the first time so we set it up for September but I chose NY NY this time since it was right in the heart of everything & I so wanted to stay here & ride the coaster & thought we would have a wonderful time at this hotel for our special day. On one of my nights there my husband & I were in the casino playing & having fun & I went to the restroom. I went into one of the stalls & thought I had locked my door. The door was opened by a housekeeper & she began saying loudly that I should of locked the door & that it was my fault. I wait to go out hoping she had left & when I came out she was still there with two friends. I walk by her to get to the sinks & she is in my face saying it was my fault, I should of had the door locked & I say to her at this point that I am going to have to get her name to tell her manager about this since I was very humiliated at this point. She then points at me & says hey everyone this is the girl I was talking about that did not lock her door & it was her fault that I opened the door. I overhear one of the other housekeepers saying to her you could of knocked & I also had several guests come up to me to say she is taking this way too far. Especially since I had not been upset with her or said anything to her to cause all of this. I got so upset & had never been treated like this before in my life. I was shaking like a leaf & tears are coming down my face as my husband & I head to the front desk to talk to someone about this. First I tell a clerk, then a front desk manager nicole, then they call a man up & I tell him then a supervisor jessica. They are all standing around me as I stand there crying & shaking. Here I am looking like I am the one that had done something wrong. They treated me as if I had done something wrong & acted as if they did not believe me. Then they say they are going to talk this housekeeper about this & asked me to complete a voluntary statement which took me three hours to sit & write it all out. I was so shaken up that my husband had to take me back to our room to calm down so we lost one of our nights that should of been filled with love, fun & romance & instead it was crying, shaking & being hurt & humiliated. Our special time was ruined, we lost one of our nights & I was humiliated by their staff. Then the management team acted as if they did not believe me. I was not treated with any respect or compassion which is all I wanted at that point, for someone to treat me like they cared & understood. Then they say to me they will give me an update on this review with this staff member & they do have my contact information to do so. We get back & no contact. I get a survey & I complete it & say yes please do contact me to discuss this & no one contacted me. I go online to the nyny website & I go onto the guest services contact information & ask someone to contact me & no contact. Then I sent an email to a director-cassie that I had been given an email address to & still no contact. This hotel is all about the service for their guests. Then a director-mark does contact me this past friday & he was nice to me but too little too late at this point. He asked me if he could take this up with someone in guest services on my behalf & have someone contact me this week. So today at work I get a call from kristine a director in guest relations, it was the most cold disrespectful call I have ever received. I would rather not have an apology if it is not sincere. So I get another slap in the face from the customer service from this hotel. I do want to come back to Vegas but have told everyone about my story that will listen to me so that noon else has to go through what i did & be hurt & humiliated as I did.", "Date": "October 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Livonia, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat Time\u201d", "Author": "bellalivonia", "ReviewID": "UR10020559", "Content": "Stayed at NY NY September 25th for 3 nights.

This was no problem to them and they redirected us to another tower without even having to go back down to the desk. They reset the key locks automatically. The room they gave us was large with a lovely marble bathroom. We had a view of the strip and also the pool. I was a little disappointed in the size of the pool as we had previously stayed in the Luxor which had a few lovely pools to choose from. In the end up we didn't have time to use the pool so it didn't matter. The layout of the hotel is really nice. There are lots of restaurants or fast food outlets to choose from.

Our room had two queen size beds TV table and chair and was an adequate size for 3 adults. There is also a free safe (not very big) which was a bonus. The only thing I was not very happy with was there was no security guard on the lifts checking to see if you had a room key. Other hotels have security doing this which makes you feel safer.

I checked the bed out first thing and noticed a spot on the comforter. I called housekeeping and within a short period of time they had the spread changed. The only thing I wished they paid more attention to in their cleaning efforts are the fabric covered headboards, which hold dust. I hit against one of them and was enveloped in a small of dust somewhat like Lynus on Charlie Brown. Overall the hotel experience was great. They have lots of eateries in the hotel ( a plus in my book). The problem I incurred was with the city itself.

Checking in: We checked in during the buzz of a Friday evening, which was a bit stressful because we had to lug our luggage through the buzzing casino packed full of people. We arrived several hours late to stressful airline delays so it is recommended to check in between 10-4. Room: We stayed in a Park Ave. Queen, NS bed room with a few of the pool. At first we were put into a smoking 2 double bed room and straightened that out immediately. The smoking room smelled horrendous. Our room was much, much better. The room was very quiet. You could hear the roar of the roller coaster but it was pretty quiet and it stops running around 11 so that was no problem. The casino is nice and small compared to other hotel and casinos but it's a popular one because of Grenwich Village. However, I never had a problem finding games I wanted to play. Drinks are free and I never had a problem finding a server/them finding me. They do expect tips, of course. The food: very expensive and just okay. We ate in America, the only restaurant that stays open 24/7 and the food is what you would expect. I'd compare it to Denny's so it's fulfilling and decent but overpriced for the quality. Other than America, we ate in the Village a few times and it's what you'd expect from greasy fast food. It's slightly more affordable too. We mainly ate at other hotels. However, we didn't eat much because it was a scorching 115 degrees outside. The Pool: the pool is small for Vegas and you MUST get there by 10:30 a.m. to get a lounge chair period. It's a fun scene with mainly couples and small groups of adult friends. The few kids were mainly a little older and only fairly obnoxious. The drinks are expensive at $9/drink. So we learned to make our own in the hotel room and bring them down. We put the drinks in a canvas covered water bottle we bought at CVS down the street. It saved us lots of money! However, the first day we did drink from the pool bar and the drinks are very good and a large 16oz so if you have a decent budget go for it. The sun starts to peak over the large hotel structure at about 11 so you do get lots of very good sun there and wear sunscreen! It's a hot, hot, unforgiving sun! Overall, we really enjoyed our stay.

Also, we were told to charge any meals we had at NYNY to our room, and also you can charge from Starbucks & Nathans located near the walkway to MGM. We ended up getting a $55 breakfast and our Friday night room charge ($129) comped. The breakfast buffet at Chin Chin's was very limited - but I must say what they had was very good. It's not your typical Las Vegas buffet - limited like I mentioned. We had a very good and very large lunch at ESPN Zone. For a late night snack try the pretzels at Nathan's - yum! Check out was easy - using the TV. Our flight home was in the afternoon so I asked room service for late check out and they said \"no problem\" and no charge. Just a warning - watch out for the time share people on the walkway level near Nathan's - they make it sound like they're giving you a free meal, but you have to attend a 2 hour meeting/tour that they will shuttle you to.

The wait at the airport for a cab was about 25 minutes...and when we arrived at the hotel we figured we would have a big wait as well. To our surprise there were maybe two other people in front of us. We were going to ask front desk to hold our luggage for us while we went to check out the sights , because we were told by our travel agent we couldnt check in until 3. Luckily the lady working at front desk told us that two rooms side by side were ready for us right then. We were upgraded to park avenue rooms with king size beds rather than the regular rooms with 2 double beds. The rooms were very nice, clean and nicely decorated. The amenities in the bathroom were nice too. Lemon soap, orange ginger shampoo and conditioner and pomegranate body lotion. They all smelled so good. We enjoyed pizza downstairs, as well as nathans hot dogs and those big pretzels. There are plenty of places to eat at the hotel. The hotel is right across from MGM where you can easily hop on the monorail if you dont want to walk in the heat. We found that we were offered free drinks earlier in the day ( when we didnt really want to drink) and the waitresses didnt come around to us as much at night. This might be because we were just at the 25 cent slots and maybe they cater more to the bigger spenders. We did get drinks though and tipped a dollar a drink. I loved the Family feud slot machines. They were fun and I won back my gambling money and broke even for the trip! Other people have complained about the size of the pool...but I thought it was great.

We also requested pillows the first night (they were very flat and we all like 2 pillows each) and the housekeeping argued with us, claiming that 6 pillows were enough and we didn't need 2 more. I tried to explain that we all use 2 pillows each, and housekeeping became very beligerant and said they'd try to find more pillows but couldn't promise anything. We did finally get our pillows (an hour later). Overall, the hotel was very average and while some service was very good (the valet service and bellhop service was very accomodating and helpful), the rest was mediocre at best.", "Date": "August 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "midlands", "Title": "\u201cfantastic\u201d", "Author": "singletraveller07", "ReviewID": "UR8360928", "Content": "I stayed at the New York, New York with a female friend in December.

Our flight was early; we arrived at the hotel around 12 noon. The rooms they had \"ready\" were on the 11th floor with two beds. No thanks. The next available rooms were on seperate floors BUT they had one bed. Again, no thanks. So, (after a lot of research on TA) we requested to be above the 20th floor and both couples needed one bed, not two. Finally, there were two rooms in the Park Avenue Tower on the same floor (26th) with one bed in each, BUT they would not be ready until 1-3 pm. Okay! We'll take them. Checked our luggage with the bell desk and went to get lunch because the option of 'using' a room to change for some pool time was a no go. (Last year when we stayed at the Mirage ... they let us use a room to change clothes until our room was ready). We called to see if our rooms were ready around 2pm - nope. Our friends' room was finally available at about 3 pm, but not ours. So we all went to their room and had all the luggage brought up. An extra tip to the bellman with an explanation of the inconvenience of not having my room yet - prompted him to make a call. That was nice of him. Finally, by 4pm our room was ready. Both rooms were strip views, even though all you could see was the corner of the MGM and the roller coaster. Oh, we could see Hooters, Tropicana, and the Motel 6 though! I did not like the fact that our room had NO wash cloths. The whole time we were there the hotel was 'out'. ??? Who runs out of wash clothes? Have you ever tried to take a shower and use a hand towel in place of a wash cloth? Can you say HEAVY? I felt like i was camping. Not to mention, when I tried to hang my sopping hand towel on the shower bar it was so heavy it slipped right off into the tub. grrrrrrr. ewwwww. gross. That meant I had to get a NEW hand towel the next time I washed. Not fun. I had the housekeeping extension memorized. haha. The other issues I had with my room were that the bathroom is small and the tiolet is in the way. The door almost hits the front of the tiolet seat. Plus, the sink drained SLOW. gross again. We never used the pool but while eating breakfast at the America restaurant I noticed all the lounge chairs filled and people waiting for the sun to shine. The towers block the sun until noon. Who wants to hang out for 4 hours and wait for sunshine? Not me. If you like to lounge or swim, don't stay at this hotel. If you gamble at the NYNY, get a players card. Charge food to your room from the restaurants there because you most likely will earn comps and they will pay for your bill. We played some slots and won a little. Even though we booked our package through Costco instead of directly with the NYNY (which means there was no room charge on our account to comp) we should have charged food to our room when we ate at our hotel because we could have used our comps in that way. Instead, I was given a $20 voucher to use at Starbucks in the food court area and $80 for some sandwiches at the sandwich shop. Let's just say food and drinks were on us. We also bought lunch for a couple from TN who were in line behind us, because we had a voucher with the 'use it or lose it' motto. I'm sure if we had more time, we could have asked to use the comps in one of the many gift shops ... oh well. Over all, I will not stay at the NYNY again.

Check-in was a confused nightmare that took nearly 5 hours to resolve. Was in town for a convention and decided to stay a few more days here since it is one of the few Vegas hotels I had not stayed at yet. Most hotels here get you in a room so you can get to the casino floor as quickly as possible but that did not happen here. It seemed like the staff had already pleased their quota of one customer per day and weren't going to do that again until tomorrow. This problem alone would make me think twice about staying here again. The \"Broadway\" room was entirely average and despite the fact I am a guy I must admit the colors in the room were bad with strange shades of purple visible everywhere. Frankly I don't know if this is traditional NY colors or just bad taste. For what I subtract for the staff and room, I will in part give back to the casino and restaurants. It was always busy and at least a little exciting on the casino floor, if you like people watching. I hit the blackjack tables and lost my shirt, 2 pair of pants, belt, shoes, and lucky rabbits foot, but it wasn't that lucky for me or the rabbit huh? Not exactly my favorite place to gamble for obvious reasons. There are several good restaurants on the Casino level so finding something to eat was never a problem. The best I found was the small hot dog stand next to the piano bar. Their Chicago style dog was great -- strangely better than most Chicago dogs I have had in Chicago itself. The second best restaurant was Chin Chin Cafe which could reduce their portion size by half and still have stuffed customers waddling out after a meal. I have to say one of my former favorite restaurants seems to have declined in quality over the past couple of years which is Gonzalez Y Gonzalez. This used to be the best Tex-Mex in the area but now seems to be a bit too greasy, and overpriced. Went to Nine Fine Irishmen and it was reasonably good except the bar staff seemed distracted and somewhat lacking in reasonable people skills plus had no clue how to pour a Irish style Black and Tan. Considering the this is supposed to be an authentic Irish pub brought piece by piece from Ireland, I expected a little more. They only poured your typical run of the mill American style Black and Tan with 50% or more Guinness.

Pros- The hotel's theming is fun and location is good - a short walk from several other hotels, including MGM Grand, Monte Carlo, Excalibar, and Luxor. It has a variety of restaurants / bars. We really enjoyed the Bar at Times Square (dueling pianos - far better than the guys at Treasure Island). Lunch at the ESPN Zone was decent. Check-in was painless. Our Park Ave room was plenty big, and nicely decorated. We had a view of the pool and roller coaster. While others have complained of the noise from the coaster, we never heard it. Our friends stayed in a Broadway (upgraded) room, which, I didn't think was worth the extra money unless you have several people sleeping in one room and might need a roll-away bed. Service was generally good throughout the hotel. We were given coupons (some as part of our metro pkg, and others by time-share sales people that linger near the elavators) that included free drinks, coaster passes, and two-for-one meals. Cons- This hotel is by far the smokiest we visited on the strip. At times it was suffocating. Our supposedly non-smoking room reeked of smoke as well. The hotel is also very dark, and may not be appealing to everyone. Food and drink prices were outrageous. The America restaurant breakfast was about $10 for an Denny's -style $2.99 breakfast. I don't mind paying $10 for a martini if I'm at a nice bar, but I resent spending it on a watered-down screwdriver by the pool. The pool was the biggest disappointement. For a hotel this size, the pool is too small. We had to there by 11:00 in order to get chair, even though the sun didn't hit the area until an hour later. In addition, the pool is right next to a busy road, and though there is a a high wall, the road noise / smell was distracting. Ultimately, though we had a great time at NYNY, we found that we spent most of our time at other hotels, We ate lunch at Wolfgang Pucks (MGM- fabulous!), dinner / shopping at Caesars (great!), and two Cirque shows (Love and Mystere) at the Mirage and Treasure Island. Still, for about $100 a night NYNY is a bargain.

Since my folks live there, we seldom stay at any of the hotels, but not this time! Because my husband was entertaining on business, we got the chance to try out one of the big-named hotels on the strip. Much to my excitement, I had fun scoping many of them out via Trip Advisor before settling on NYNY. From the moment we arrived, mid-afternoon on Friday, the check-in process went very smoothly. I had requested a view of the strip and that's exactly what we received ... it was a corner room, plus it was also recently renovated! The decor had a very metropolitan feel with dark brown and light blue hues used throughout. Very New Yorker-like! We were on the 26th floor and the view was spectacular! So much so, we kept the drapes wide open the entire stay and just enjoyed the glow of the lights all around us. Our room was above the roller coaster, but we were never bothered by the noise of it or the airport nearby. The hotel was running a special from June thru August, whereby we received 2 for 1 coupons to use during our stay for several different things ... the coaster ride (which we didn't use, but I gave our passes to two young boys who were just thrilled!), breakfast at Il Fornaio (which we ate at both mornings -- very yummy!), among other freebies. We did order room service late one night and was told it would be about 20-30 mins., but the food arrived within 15 -- very impressive and still hot, I might add! Prices were overall pretty reasonable given how expensive most everything is anywhere you go there. The bed was most comfy, the bathroom, lovely. The room was on the small side, but very clean and stylish, and again, it felt like something right out of NYC. All in all, we had a fantastic time at NYNY and we would definitely stay there again!

We were continually amazed at the quality of service both at New York New York and throughout Vegas. One guy at the deli pizza place in NYNY was rude (a kind word for him.) He was memorable mainly for being unique. Our room was perfectly fine, though average-sized and lacking separate lights for each bed. There was also no exhaust fan in the bathroom. Water pressure? Ours was great though others on this board have complained. The fan on our A/C rattled horribly upon arrival. We called maintenance, and it was fixed within a couple of hours. Excellent! NYNY is clever and cool, the kind of hotel you'll find only in Vegas. Our major complaint: each night during prime time, the entire casino was overwhelmed by an extremely loud live rock band. The group was talented, but I question why a casino with this much size and attention to atmosphere should be dominated by just one kind of sound.

The lower numbered rooms (2616) are a little bit bigger than the higher numbers (2662). Be sure to ask for the 20th floor and up so the roller coaster isn't too loud. However, it usually closes down before you get to your room for the night (early a.m.) anyway! Other than the Poker Tour (saw all of the major players at the Rio--fun) there were no conventions in town so it wasn't too crowded. All of the staff from registration to casino to housekeeping were friendly and accomodating. Best food is at the ESPN sports center. 15 people--15 different orders--all of it was great, fresh & hot! The American Cafe is so-so. Walk to the Excalibur to catch the tram to Mandalay Bay & Luxor. Walk to MGM to purchase monorail tickets $8.00 cash--no credit cards--per person. Worth it in the 107 degree heat. Have exact $5.00 + 3 $1.00 bills--no change given.

We found Chin Chin really delicious for chinese food, and the many bars not bad for drink prices (around $6 for beer). There is a fantastic dueling piano bar and Irish Pub, that are fun, and the Italian restaurant was great for a late dinner. We ate at America for breakfast every morning, and it was fine- cheap and good. Zumanity was incredible and highly recommended, although is fairly risque so not for the kiddies! We also went to Ka, at MGM, while we were there and this was also goo- probably on a grander scale than Zumanity. Recommendations: Wander through MGM (biggest hotel in the world) with its amazing restaurants, live lion habitat, and great bars. We also drank at Paris, and found it be quite romantic and a nice change from NYNY. The Bellagio is amazing and the fountains are incredible, especially at night. ABSOLUTELY use the Duece Bus out the front of most hotels- $5US for 24 hours use, and its fantastic for getting out of the heat and saving your feet! Fashion Show Mall was brilliant and we did some fairly serious damage to the credit card there... Anyway, Vegas is huge, lound, brilliant and so much fun!

We were booked for the New Yorker Deluxe suite at NYNY. This is one up from the standard room. When we arrived, the front desk clerk confirmed with us that we were booked for the NY Deluxe Suite which includes a flat screen TV and is slightly better than their standard room. All the room descriptions were laid out in front of us to read. She began typing away at her terminal and said they are overbooked and had to check with her manager to see if they have a room for us. What?? This is a hotel with over 2000 rooms and was she trying to tell us there wasn't one available? I explained that this is our first time in Vegas and our first anniversary hoping that she would take this into consideration and possibly find us a room or even upgrade us to an even better room. When she came back, we were told that the only rooms available were a smoking room and a handicapped room. It was as if she was trying to convince us to settle for some other room. She even said if we are not happy to call back and they'll switch our room. When we arrived at the room, we realized she actually bumped us DOWN!!! We ended up with the standard room (no flat screen TV and a connecting door to another room). Definitely NOT WHAT WE PAID FOR since our reservation stated the New Yorker Deluxe Suite. My husband called the front desk and complained without any success. When my husband asked what could they offer to compensate us, they had nothing to offer - not even a free breakfast! So I took over the phone and basically told the front desk clerk that they have officially ruined my anniversary...I was almost in tears. He said he couldn't do anything but that I could speak to his manager about it. So I did! I explained everything to his manager, and he said that housekeeping just finished cleaning a non-smoking New Yorker Deluxe Suite. How convenient...right? The funny thing is that on our flight back, we overheard another passenger recounting a similar story!

This was our second visit to Vegas together and my fourth (previous stays at Tropicana, Flamingo, Luxor). We were booked for a Park Avenue room. Upon arrival at 10am, our room was not ready but our request for a non-smoking king room was met. A room was ready for us at 11am and even though we were told a strip-view would cost us $15 more per night, we were given it for free! The bell desk stored our bags for the hour we had to wait for a room. We arrived in our 20th floor room which had a good view of the Excalibur, Tropicana, MGM and the airport. The room was standard in size and had nice furnishings. The bathroom was a bit dark, but had nice toiletries in it. The room had a post in the corner of it, which blocked one of the 4 windows. I got the impression that each room was fairly unique in size/layout, which is sort of neat. The lights from outside are bright, but the curtains cover them very well. The AC works really well. The casino is small by comparison to other major strip casinos. We enjoyed it just the same. We played some tables games as well as slots but did not walk away big winners. What little we won, we ended up losing anyway. I played enough to get a t-shirt, but nothing more from the player\u2019s club. We ate at Gonzales Y Gonzales, Il Fornaio, America, Nine Fine Irishmen and a few of the fast food places. All were good, but the value was best at the first three. We would recommend all four. Alcoholic beverages were very expensive (beer was over $5 and mixed drinks were almost $10). The Big Apple Bar featured a live band each night. We saw Wild Child, which was a pretty good cover band of 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s music. The band can be heard throughout the casino, but the view is best inside the bar. Service was good, but as stated earlier, drinks were pricey (two Miller Lites were $11.50 plus tip). As other reviews stated, the pool was our one disappointment. It is small and sunlight doesn\u2019t reach it until noon. I laid out there one day for about an hour, which was nice, but I had to time it well to make it that way. The roller coaster\u2019s first big drop is very close to the pool, so loud screams are heard every few minutes. There are a lot of folks trying to hand you \u201cfree\u201d tickets as you enter the casino from the MGM and Excalibur walkways. We gave them a firm \u201cno thanks\u201d and were left alone.

We stayed in the Park Avenue tower and the room was adequate. I don't think the hotel is on the same level with the Wynn, Mirage or Venitian in terms of the room size and decor, but its much better than a lot of other hotels on the strip (think Excalibor, Bally's).

There were plenty of restaurants to choose from and there always seemed to be something going on. Negatives: When we arrived there were room service carts of dirty dishes outside rooms. This was 3:00pm. The next morning those same carts were still there except someone had covered them with linen. Room service could have done a much better job of taking care of this. Also, beware of Gallaghers Steakhouse. The hotel advertises it as its best restaurant. The food isn't bad, but the service is terrible. First this is an upscale restaurant. We had 5:15 reservations.

The room safe was absurdly small, not even large enough to hold a normal laptop computer. There appears to be four towers, each with their own elevators, although the layout is somewhat confusing. Probably more expensive rooms had more exclusive elevators or something - we had to walk a *really* long distance from the elevator to our room (which was, admittedly, at the very end of the absurdly long corridor). My wife said we were eight blocks from the elevator, and that is not much of an exaggeration. The tradeoff is that it was completely silent - no noise in the hallway, or from above. Good news for non-smokers - Nevada now has very strict no smoking rules in place, which made the majority of the public areas breathable. Unfortunately, they still allow smoking in the casino itself, but compared to previous trips, this was an acceptable compromise. It was easy to get to most eating areas without clogging our lungs in the process. The only thing to be careful of now is the time-share sales folk, who station themselves at a strategic choke point where it is hard to avoid them. That is pretty much the case in any casino we visited. NYNY has a good selection of cheap eateries, and several nice ones as well. The casino seemed as good as any other.

The rooms are nice, I am a pretty picky person, and I was not unhappy with the room- It was clean (thats very important to me), and it was very nice too. I am an interior designer, and I believe we stayed in the Park Avenue room which is just what a typical contemporary room looks like in Manhattan- very clean lined, simplistic,nothing spectacular, but still very nice .The inside of the hotel where the casino is, is really unbelievable they way that they replicate the city, they even installed pot holes that smoke comes out of! Everything really amazed me when I walked through the hotel, how much thought was put into everything in their casino. The ONE thing I don't recommend is their roller coaster- it was one of the worst experiences of my life- no joke! It was terrible and scary and painful and please do not go on it!

When I tried to check in I was informed that a non-smoking Broadway Deluxe was not available and that I was going to be put in a smoking room. This is a large problem being that the package I paid for included a Broadway Deluxe non-smoking room. I down graded to a Skyline room for one night with the guarantee of being moved the next day by the manager on duty. I had to push to get something in way of compensation for this downgrade and inconvenience. The most the manager was willing to offer me was two drink coupons per person. While it was a nice token the fact that I had to push to get it diminished the good will value. I was moved the next day but I had to move my luggage myself down one tower through the casino and into my new room. In addition to the difficulty I had with my room I also had an unpleasant experience in the casino. I found the blackjack dealers to be rather rude and unfriendly. The slot attendants were few and far between and not once was I asked if I would like a drink while playing the slots or blackjack. I had a much better experience at your sister hotel across the street. The casinos personal at the MGM Grand were much nicer and really seemed to value by business at their casino. The bright spots of your hotel were the staff in the restaurants and housekeeping. Your housekeepers kept my room very clean and were always done when came back from breakfast. The restaurant staff was particularly good. The Friday night of my stay (September 26th) my party of seven had a great meal and time at Gonzalez Y Gonzalez. Lisa was our server and she was amazing. She not only handeled my large group of people with ease but she was lot of fun too. The Sunday (September 28th) of my stay my party of five enjoyed lunch at the ESPN Zone during the Redskins game.

It is a bit of a walk from the main Hotels on the strip such as the Bellagio, Casears Palace and so on but there are plenty of transport options. I would recommend the Deuce because although the monorail skips the traffic you have to walk miles to get to the monorail station at the Hotel's as the stations are usually at the back of the Hotels.

The cab ride from the airport was $12 including tip. We arrived at the hotel about 9 am and there was only one person checking in ahead of us. At check in we were offered an upgrade of $15 per night for a room with a view of the stirp. We took it. We stayed in the Empire Tower in room 3412 in a Park Avenue Deluxe room. We had a view of Excalibur, Tropicana, the airport and mountains beyond and MGM. For us, it was worth the extra $15 per night. The view was really amazing at night. The room was recently remodeled. King size bed, 2 nice living room type chairs, an ottoman, a desk and upholstered desk chair, nightstands on both sides of the bed, and a huge armoire with the TV inside. There was also a padded suitcase rack next to the armoire. All furniture was in very good shape and contemporary. The bathroom was all marble tile and had glass doors. There was a pull-out make-up mirror and hairdryer mounted on the wall. Great water pressure and plenty of hot water. Fresh towels every day. Now, about the roller coaster. We vented the windows for fresh air and could hear the roller coaster, but it's only open from 11 am to 11pm (Sunday-Thursday), so we were hardly in our room while it was operating. If we closed the windows, we could barely hear it. It didn't bother us at all. The hotel decor is fantastic. It really looks like NY inside and out. When you enter the hotel, it smells like apples. The door handles are the shape of the Statute of Liberty torch. In the casual dining area, it looks like SoHo village, and other NY areas, complete with laundry hanging overhead, fire escape ladders, and steam coming out the manhole covers. We had margaritas at the Mexican place and sat at the bar. Great service, friendly bartenders, and great margaritas. We had coffee every day from Starbucks which tasted just like it did at home. We also ate at the Fish and Chips place, the 24 hour place called America, and had a small breakfast wtih fruit and pastries at the Il Fornino Cafe. All of them had good food and great service. No complaints. We spent one night at The Bar at Times Square to see the dueling pianos. The piano music starts at 8 pm. It cost $15 per person to sit at a table, but standing in the bar area was free. We paid to sit at a table and were glad we did. We stayed for 4 hours so it was worth it. The waitress told us the cost of drinks increased after 8 pm. Two rum and cokes before 8pm were $12.50, after 8pm, the same 2 drinks were $14.50. Since we knew about it, it was okay with us.

Originally planned the trip to stay for four nights at the Orleans based upon reviews on Trip Advisor (# 6 Best Place). While this is not entirely untrue the Orleans is great if you want a big room, easy to find your way in casino, and serious gamblers with very few frills at a really good price that is the place to stay (see Review on Orleans). We on the other hand felt the crowd and hotel did not match our expectations. We were there for getaway/romance/gambling/good meals and long walks on the strip. We decided to move to New York New York and had no trouble doing so with the assistance of great people in reservations at both the Orleans and NYNY. Since we booked directly with the hotel and it was not the High Season we were pleasantly surprised at the amount and type of rooms available to us for an average of $79 to $149 per night. We decided to go with the NYNY in a Spa Deluxe room in the Empire Tower on the 34th floor overlooking the mountains to the west. Great sunsets and a wonderful view. This room was above the Roller Coaster and was $129.00 per night (USD). It came with an extra large hot tub in the room, a king bed and the effect of 4 single windows that gave it a \"Penthouse/Condo\" feel. The mirrors that form the backsplash to the spa tub only enhanced the feeling of extra space in an already large room. There was a private two- person shower and toilet and a sink/closet combination behind the wall. The room/decor/carpet and appointments were clean, fashionable and eclectic. All in all the room was more than we could have hoped for at the last minute. The room was not readily available at 10:00 am but this is to be expected. We stored our bags with the bell desk and went about our day returning at 5:00 p.m. The room was ready and the bags brought to us within 5-10 minutes of calling. Room was cleaned upon our return each day no matter what time we left and what time we returned. All we had to do was put out the Privacy Please sign and we never so much as heard a peep from our hallway. It was very quiet and private. The service throughout the hotel and property, including the restaurants, shopping and staff were all very pleasant and professional. We were left wanting for nothing. The location is ideal and gives you access to 5 hotels with almost no outside walking needed by the use of footbridges and the connectivity of the Excalibur/Luxor/ Mandalay Bay. This was ideal as the weather was full sun for four days but 35 degrees (the coldest snap they have had in years in Vegas...the TV was referring to it as the Freeze of 2007). The dueling pianos was the best and a can't miss good time for those into singing and partying. The IL Formato restaurant was very nice Italian dining but the portions were small but moderately priced. Order your food with that in mind. Two Starbucks at both entrances and a few shops for items of need and gifts. If you are looking for shopping in a big way you need to look at the Venetian, Belaggio, Wynn and Caesars' Palace. We heard from friends who recently visited that the Delicatessen is really good but we ran out of time before we tried it. The pastrami sandwich is supposed to be \"out of this world\". If the Casino was smoky you would not have noticed. Very high ceilings and pumped in fragrance seemed to give each casino hotel a fresh, themed smell particular to each venue. All in all we were very impressed with the entire NYNY experience and feel that if you are a couple looking to get away for romance/time alone with nice meals and long walks with shopping and sightseeing Las Vegas is a very inexpensive option, even if you do not gamble. If you do gamble Vegas is your MECCA and if you are looking for activity, shows, party bars, non-stop action and great people watching then Vegas has something for everyone. We spent 5 days 4 nights in very nice hotels, roundtrip airfare, dinners and 1 show with some minor amounts of \"try your luck\" gambling and we spent $900-$1,000 total. A bargain for a quick getaway to reconnect with your spouse and to get away from the office. NOTE: For Families Vegas is a double-edged sword. On the one hand it is very exciting and lots to see during the day. Shopping and shows, food and walking seem to be the rule of the day but at night the families looked out of place on the strip with small children. We even noted a few brave people who mentioned the \"insanity\" of having your young children on the strip at midnight. Families with small children do not want to go in for the night at sunset but the kids are not allowed in the casinos and there are not many other options available and no viable options to utilize for the service of a \"trusted\" sitter type service. Better choice is to travel without the kids if \"grandma\" is available or to slant your day in favor of getting up earlier in the morning and turning in early for bed to take advantage of the daylight hours.", "Date": "January 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hebron, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cWorst Experience Ever\u201d", "Author": "UCONN_Fan", "ReviewID": "UR6621765", "Content": "When I read these horrible reviews, I usually brush them off as being written by someone who would find something wrong no matter what. I\u2019m not that person. I\u2019ve been traveling for over 30 years and have never been treated as badly as I was last weekend at New York New York. Because my wife and I were celebrating our anniversary we decided to stay on the strip in a luxury hotel. We reserved a three night stay in a king non-smoking room. At check-in we were told that there were only rooms with two queen beds left and they were all on smoking floors. The gentleman checking in assured us that it would only be for one night and there was nothing he could do. He told me that they give out the non-smoking rooms based on the time you check in and once there gone you are forced to take what\u2019s left. He informed me that even though you specifically reserve a non-smoking room, there are no guarantees \u2013 read the fine print. After discussing moving us to another MGM property and other options (all impossible to do) for about 20 minutes, my wife asked to see a manager. When she informed him that she had health issues and would not stay in a smoking room, they miraculously found a non-smoking room on the 4th floor. It was not the type of room we paid for, but we were assured that if we stopped down in the morning we would be moved to an upgraded room for the remainder of our stay. The hallways on the fourth floor were worn and dingy and the room was reminiscent of a 1960\u2019s motel. The carpeting was worn, the safe didn\u2019t work and there was no remote control for the TV. The beds were very soft and uncomfortable and the view was of the side of the next building over. It was a horrible experience to say the least. When we went down the next morning and found the check-in clerk to move rooms, he informed us that he did have rooms to move us to, but he could not upgrade us to the next level of room (Broadway or a suite) because again they were all sold out. We indicated that we basically stayed in the broom closet for the previous night (he agreed with our description) and were promised an upgrade the next day. He politely said there was nothing he could do because everything was sold out. We asked him why he promised us something the night before that he now could not deliver. He did not have an answer so we asked to speak with a manager. What a mistake! He told us the manager\u2019s name was Angela Turner, but I never was able verify. She came over and immediately started asking me questions like I was on trial. I explained the situation and she told me there was nothing she could do and she didn\u2019t understand why we were upset. I told her that we expected a certain level of amenities in a 4 star hotel and we were placed in an inferior room. Her response was: \u201cWhat give you the impression this is a 4 star hotel? It doesn\u2019t say that on our web site does it?\u201d She kept asking me what was wrong with the room knowing full well that they put us there as a last resort. She refused to do anything but explain to me why I was wrong. After about ten minutes of listening to her talk down to me we decided to just check out and move to another hotel. We went down the street to the Venetian and were treated like royalty. Other than the room the rest of the place was just ok. It doesn\u2019t compare to places like the Venetian, Bellagio, MGM, Paris, Caesar\u2019s etc. It is dark and smoky and hard to navigate through.

I woke up with a headache from smelling the smoky pillow all night so we requested a room change the next day. They had us move ourselves to a tiny room where only one person could walk around the room at a time. There was no table in the room and only one chair so we couldn't order room service. My husband had a conference so I brought my laptop so I could do some work from the room while he was away. However, the internet connection was so slow (and I tried 100 times within 3 days from both rooms) I was never able to download or upload anything to my work. I thought since I can't work I'll go have a manicure/pedicure. The pedicure chair was basically a folding chair up on a platform. Very uncomfortable and awkward and not a pleasant relaxing experience. The towel bar in the bathroom fell off when my husband hung his towel up the first day and there were remnants of a previous hotel guest in the bathroom. The floor hallways were so long that there were 2 ice/vending machine locations per floor. However, both water/pop vending machines on our floor were \"Out of Order\", very unfortunate when it's 5am and you want a drink of water and you don't want to go hunting on another floor for some water in your pajamas.

What better way than to go to Sin City! I have been to Vegas many times and have lodged at a different hotel each time; The Mirage, Ballys, Luxor, Stratosphere, and most recently the New York New York. After reading several reviews, I must admit, I was somewhat skeptical about booking at the New York. If people are going to pay $180+ a night for a room, the least I would expect is above average ratings across the board. As far as other reviews, we had a good experience. First off, as more than few have noted, the check in desk is average at best. After many visits, every hotel, EXCEPT the New York New York has OFFERED room upgrades along with complimentary ticket booklets with freebies. Don't get me wrong, the check in desk was not rude, however, they were far from overtly courteous and accomadating as every other hotel Ive stayed at. No free tickets for the rollercoaster, nor the buffet, nor $10 match play blackjack coupons, ZIPPO! Not that we expected anything for free, but c'mon, at least a kind gesture of some sort would have been appreciated. The player reward card desk was just as dull. As for the smell everyone noted, there is a scent. It wasnt overpowering, but defintely noticeable. If you are sensitive to odors, beware. It kinda smelled like a mix of grandmas potpourri and a hint of apple cider. Only in the hallways though, not in the room. We booked the Spa Deluxe (Jacuzzi tub in room) and were on the 30th floor. Im not sure which tower it is in, BUT I can defintely see that if you are sensitive to noise, the roller coaster might pose a problem if you are on any floor below the 30th. We had a nice view of the rollercoaster, and you could hear a slight rumble as it operated, and in the morning I could hear it as it clicked up to its first dropping point. Didnt bother my fiancee and I, but if you are a light sleeper, be wary of lower level floors. The room was very very spacious and everything was clean and orderly. We always lift up the blankets and inspect the sheets for any hairs or stains, no complaints. The jacuzzi tub was clean as well. Not recommended for more than 2! Im an athletic 5'10 220lb, she a comfy 5'3 125lb, and we took up the whole tub. So if you and your spouse/girlfriend are bigger, you are going to be squished like sardines. The jets are relaxing, nothing impressive, but still relaxing. All it took was some incense and a bottle of Grey Goose and it was smooth sailing. Bring your own bubble bath, AND DONT POUR TOO MUCH! Wait a while, when the jets turn on, it agitates the bubbles and amplifies them by 5. I got a little crazy as I wanted instant bubbles and we had a small overflow of bubbles, had to drain and restart the tub. No big mess, just fair warning. This type of room is perfect for a couple, like ourselves, looking for a little R & R for a weekend. Didnt expect over the top 5 star quality, but was very pleased with the layout/comfy factor. We checked in at 3pm, and I promptly put the do not disturb sign on our door. 20 mins into unpacking, housekeeping came by, KNOCKED on the door! I answered. She was very nice and said she was just making sure. Hmm, wonder if I didnt answer the door and I were in the shower, fiancee changing into an outfit, the possibilites are endless? The bed was average, pillows horrible (every hotel pillow is, unless you are in the penthouse suites, I recommend bringin 1 of your own). The shower was in a separate area, good water pressure. The sink/grooming area was also seperate, the drain made a funny noise (a gulping sound) when draining, but only for 30 seconds or so, then it dissappeared. Again, no biggie for us, may be for others who want absolute perfection. Closet space was small, but we were only there for 2 days so it was fine. Everyone overpacks anyway, especially the ladies. With her overpacking we still had some room to spare in the grooming/closet area. As far as the actual casino in the hotel, this is definetly not a place for laid back people as we are. It is a very crowded, loud, and a somewhat obnoxious scene. Very large layout, can be confusing at times.The ambience is impressive, one of the coolest hotels Ive been in. Not luxurious, not WOW (like the Ceasers), but very cool. Minimum $10 blackjack/roulette (thats everywhere now!) Im a late night guy, and really only eat twice a day. Two buffets in one day would kill me, so we prefer ot eat a heavy breakfast buffet (You have to go to Cafe Lago in the Ceasers Hotel, its the bomb! $16 per person for fresh, clean, excellent food). Snack on a little something mid day, and have a quick fix at night. The America restaraunt in the New York is a perfect spot for anyone looking for some good, freshly prepared food, after a day of drinking and gambling late night. Stays open all night (Many buffets close at 10pm), food was good for the price (You wont feel like crap like you just ate 10 Taco Bell tacos). We went there both late nights, around 11pm-midnight, and was blown away at the quality for such a late night eatery, in Vegas. I got the philly steak sandwich ($10) with fries, SLAMMIN! For the price and quality you cant beat it. Dinner for two, with a beer and tip, $40. Trust me, its a steal. We are reg. people who just like to have a good time, and New York New York Spa Deluxe Room gave us just that. We prefer gambling at the Imperial Palace, more of our type of crowd. Low key, orginal folks just hanging out without the intimadating luxuries/fancies of other hotels that might scare people off otherwise. Their happy hour there is the bomb! 2 for 1 drinks 4p-7p, and they werent small/ watered down! TWO Hennesey and cokes for $5, cant get any better than that (Do yourself a favor, buy your first two mixed drinks to get a good buzz going, then let the girls bring you rounds of Coronas/Heiniekens for a $1. Dont even bother with the cheap, watered down, mini mix drinks they bring you. You cant mess up a good import beer) Would we go back again? Perhaps, but first we want to check out the MGM grand, we heard it gives the New York a run for its money. Booked on vegas.com, hands down the best internet deals for vegas. Better than expedia/travelocity/priceline. Two roundtrip tixs from San Diego, 3 days/2nights at NYNY with jacuzzi in room, $580.

We were not pushed to upgrade and we stayed in the Park Avenue Deluxe. The room was average size, but well decorated. Everyone on staff was very courteous and prompt. We ate breakfast at Il Fornaio...wonderful. WE did lunch at Nine Fine Irishman and it was so-so, big servings however. My husband tried to get into ESPN Zone just to check it out, but there was a $10 spending limit just to sit down so he hit the gift shop instead. We never had a wait to get a cab and were relatively lucky in the casino. A couple words of note...the monorail station is across the street in the MGM Grand...a great way to save your feet or get to shows quickly. Get used to cigarette smoke...people can pretty much smoke anywhere they please...including the restuarants. Also, be prepared to be hasseled into Tahiti Village time shares. I was a little offended these people were allowed to set up shop right in the middle of the hotel. We must have been approaced 5 times in the first hour.

The 'smell' in the hotel is not carpet freshener, it is their signature scent and it is 'APPLES' (get it? the 'Big Apple'?). All the casinos have their own signature fragrance and it is there from the moment you walk thru the door - I found it lovely actually. Secondly, I'm not sure where that woman was gambling who didn't get the free drinks, but as long as I was at any machine, I didn't pay for a thing, except to tip the waitress, which is customary if you want her to come back again. The hotel itself was busy while we were there, but all the staff was outstanding and totally went out of their way for us with any request. I must also say that the local people and bus/cab drivers were also extremely nice and helpful people. My mother was taking the bus back to Freemont at 1:00 a.m. and the bus driver actually made his stop at her hotel door and waited for her to get inside before leaving the curb - how nice is that?? I do have to agree with a previous review of Zumanity though - it wasn't great. I was expecting the 'wow factor' from a Cirque show and I mostly got 'shock value' - and I'm no prude! It had a few really good laughs, but mostly it wasn't worth $100 per ticket. However.... please please take my advice and go see Celine Dion's \"A New Day\" at Caesar's Palace - WOW WOW WOW! Now that was a show worth every penny of it's ticket price. All in all, our trip to Vegas was good and we really liked NYNY and would definitely stay there again. I thought the details like the steam coming up through the fake manhole covers in the Soho shopping/eating area were fantastic. Nine Fine Irishmen was great and the food was top-notch. We didn't go into the Times Square bar cuz it was always packed at night, but we watched and listened to the dueling pianos from outside and it seemed like a lot of fun was going on in there. Ditto went for Coyote Ugly, just didn't have the time to check it out fully. I liked the fact that NYNY was one of the smaller hotels, it made it seem kind of 'homey' when coming back from a long day on the strip. We had a Park Avenue room and I found it very clean and comfortable. We had a King Feather Bed and I wanted to take it home with me I slept so good in it. Room temperature control was always perfect. We did have a view of the strip and rollercoaster, but we rarely heard it - it ran from 10:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m., but c'mon people, whose really sleeping during those times???

Walking into a Vegas Casino for the first time (especially one as big as this) was an overwhelming experience. Reception and Check-In were great: we had booked direct on a special promotion offering us a \"stylish\" Park Avenue Deluxe uprgrade. Imagine the disappointment when we opened the door to find a dark and gloomy average-sized room. OK, it has some nice art deco touches but this felt like a pretty unremarkable hotel room, let alone an upgrade. However, 26 floors up, we had a pretty good view (tip: you need to be above the 20th floor in this place if you don't want to watch people rushing past your window on a roller-coaster for 12 hours a day!). The biggest surprise was that there was no coffee-making facility in the room - clearly they expect you to go down to the casino to eat and drink - but it felt like a pretty mean omission for a 'deluxe room'. The restaurants and bars were pretty good and we took in the Zumanity Show. Perhaps it was us Brits who are more broad-minded than others, but most of the show seemed like little more than an excuse to wave sex toys around, to use four-letter words and to have the occasional bit of stripping. It all seemed like it was trying far to hard to be sensational. Ask yourself: just how sexy is it to see a few breasts and buttocks and a lot of other people trying to be sexy in flesh-coloured body stockings! Not very sexy if you ask me!! The highlights of the show were the trapeze/circus act based stuff (with the exception of the very boring \"bondage\" routine).

We booked this room especially because of the spa tub in the room. The bed was very comfortable, and this suite had plenty of seating space as you will see in the photos. We were in the Empire Tower on the 15th floor. Ask for strip view if possible and as high as available to get a good view. The food was just ok though with only one late nite option for the wee hour hungers. Staff was very friendly, with our maid service top notch. I've stayed at several different hotels in Vegas, but this was the first one where our maid wiped down and arranged everything each day. So of course I tipped her well, AND she could actually understand the English language!! I would say the only negative thing about my stay would have to be the delay in getting my room. I could not check in until after 5 pm and there are only 34 Marquis rooms in the whole hotel, so I certainly shouldn't have had to wait that long. I DID make a suggestion that a step should be placed in front of the spa tub, since it was difficult for a short person like myself to get in and out with ease. But it still was awesome as you will see by the photos, it has a uinque faucet also. I would highly recommend the NYNY Marquis suite,but cannot say anything about their regular rooms.

It felt like it was a \"Disney-fied\" Vegas for families with children. I would recommend paying a visit to this hotel-casino to enjoy the theme and decor, but I wouldn't recommend staying here. It's pretty easy to navigate your way around (restaurants on the left and back if you're facing the escalators to \"Coney Island\" and shopping to the back and right)--slots/games in middle. The elevators don't all go to the same places or floors so listen carefully to where the clerk tells you \"your\" elevator is (Empire or Century Tower, A or B elevators, etc.). The Spa is in the Empire Tower (but avoid far right elevator or you won't end up there), so be prepared to walk back through the lobby after your treatment if your room isn't in the Empire Tower). I don't know if it's because we have a bevy of wonderful restaurants here in the DFW area that we frequent, but the eateries at NYNY were pretty lackluster. We dined at ChinChin, Nine Fine Irishmen, Coney Island-Nathan's Hotdogs, America Cafe, Il Fornaio, the deli downstairs, and Gonzalez y Gonzalez. For the money we paid, the food was extremely mediocre. Wolfgang Puck's across the street at the MGM was very, very good (especially the chocolate souffle), and Tsunami inside the Venetian was also a very good choice. TAO inside the Venetian was our first choice that day, but we didn't realize that they were only open for dinner (it was lunchtime when we arrived), so we'll have to try it next visit. Also, stay away from the Aladdin Spice Market Buffet--also mediocre. A traveling tip: the NYNY hotel does NOT have an airport check-in as advertised on the map signs at the airport. They didn't renew their contact last year. We found this out after standing in line at the MGM check-in (which is where they were supposed to be). Check in at NYNY was pretty quick, but the clerk's greeting was perfunctory, at best. Our room was on the 27th floor and had a nice view of the Tropicana and Excalibur (we toured these--a little dated and the latter was easy to get lost in). Our room (a Park Avenue room) was nicely furnished, but extremely small. The glowing \"night-light\"buttons on the bottom of each lamp was helpful navigating your way around the room at night (saving a bump into furniture on your way back from the bathroom). The tub/commode area was of a good size--not cramped at all like the rest of the room. Our room was very clean--we ran into the maid once as we were leaving--she kept our room in great condition. We had one day where the outside hallway a/c vent was buzzing very loudly (we had a corner room), but they fixed it that afternoon. The location of NYNY was ok, but the things we most enjoyed doing were at the other end of the strip so we either walked or took a cab. We were in town for late Sun- early Thursday morn, so we weren't able to check out some of the shows (most play on Sun, Mon, and Thursday it seems) like Zumanity or Folies. The Spa/Salon at NYNY was comparable in terms of service (but more expensive) to what I've experienced here in the Dallas area. However, on Monday night we had the most fun at The Mirage (the Beatles LOVE was fantastic!! We sat on the sixth or seventh row, but people above us also had a good view) and we also enjoyed ourselves on Wednesday at The Venetian (the palazzo area with gondola rides and gelateria--try both). The gondola ride was a lot of fun and our gondolier was very personable and had a wonderful voice. There were a great variety of shops if you enjoy shopping (for real or \"window\" shopping). The Bellagio (not too far down the road) was enjoyable to walk through--the lobby ceiling sculpture and the conservatory. The decor made me think of something you might see in a James Bond film. We didn't actually feel like we were in Las Vegas until we hit this end of the strip--there was so much more to see and do. It wasn't until we headed to this end of the strip that we actually contemplated coming back to Las Vegas again--perhaps to to stay at The Mirage, Paris, Treasure Island, or at The Venetian for a splurge. For Newbies--Cab Fare is about $10 bucks from airport and up/down the strip. Save a bit of money by eating a sandwich at Subway (or something of the like) instead of wasting money on mediocre buffet or cafe food in the casinos. Bring good walking shoes. After we got home we calculated the distance between the hotels we walked, so we probably walked 6-10 miles during our stay. Helicopters-this was unexpected....it sounded a little like a war zone with the many that flew over giving tours--I doubt that it was unique to our end of the strip or room location, but if you take a nap during the day (or are a late sleeper) you'll hear them frequently, so you might bring some earplugs. The roller coaster was on our side of the building as well, but we rarely heard it (or the screams of the people on it).", "Date": "October 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201c\"start spreadin' the news\"\u201d", "Author": "Vegas_Dolly", "ReviewID": "UR5913683", "Content": "My husband and I are frequent visitors to Las Vegas. we live in the Desert Southwest, so flying or driving to Vegas is easy for us..and we try and visit 2 or more times a year.

Hotel itself: The whole place is buzzing all the time, the casino was really good in comparison to others we used and had a host of entertainment around it. The Big Apple bar had a live band each night and the Duelling Piano's was good fun. Plenty of places to eat also, we ate in America and Chin Chin (be warned don't order to much in this restaurant as the portions are HUGE!!). We also ate @ Smith & Wollensky's and Top of the World whilst in Vegas and would recommend them also, we had breakfast in Denny's each morning as it was only a short walk from the hotel (great value for money) We were very suprised by our room, we stayed in the New Yorker Tower and although a long walk from the elevator the room was exceptional. Nice & Comfy bed, good clean bathroom and good facilities (Iron & Board, TV etc). We spent some time in the majority of the hotels on the strip and can say that the only other place we would consider going to is the Venetian as this is a beautiful hotel.

We love eating at the NYNY especially Fultons Fish Shop where you can get Jumbo Shrimp, fries and a Pepsi 'Meal Deal' for two people for $18. Then choose a fabulous pastry from the shop as you finish your drink. There are lots of super shops selling every imaginable thing to eat, drink, wear or show off in. You can cross the handy walkway to the MGM (not impressed) or the Excalibur (big and great for kids) and catch the tramway (monorail) to the Luxor and the Mandalay Bay. All in all if you want a quiet holiday give this place a miss but if you love nightlife - there's Coyote Ugly nightclub for swingers too and plenty of 'young' entertainment here or you can even catch a ride on the Manhattan Express roller coaster (do it on an empty stomach).

I booked the hotel directly via the website. I used the \"Manhattan Nights\" upgrade package to a PARK AVENUE and requested a non-smoking room with a king bed. On arrival at 6:30pm I was told that there were no non-smoking rooms avaliable - and that there were also no king beds. I was outraged and the clerk offered me an upgrade to a Spa Suite for $35 per night. I decided to take the upgrade. We opened our Spa Suite door, and were taken back with the size of the room... 500sq ft. However, it appears someone forgot the furniture for this room. There was a bed, small TV unit, 2 desk chairs and a spabath. NO sofa, no table - very odd. It also has a view of the parking lot and the back of the rollercoaster. As i was unimpressed with the room (esp for $35 extra a night) i returned to the front desk and asked to \"see\" a Park Avenue smoking room I walked into room 1930 and was almost physically ill from the stench of smoke and ciggarettes. I smoke, and cannot describe the foul smell from the room. I decided to stay in the Spa suite for one night. I asked the hotel reception if they were able to confirm a non-smoking room for the second night - which they were.... so on day 2 we moved to 2472, which is a lovely Park Avenue room with views of the strip. MUCH BETTER! Overall I was most disappointed that a hotel of this size was unable to provide a non-smoking room, and that they were not able to offer a suitable alternative. Other than the room problems, the hotel is great fun to be in. I'd suggest it for a 21-32yr old bracket on you're 1st vegas trip.

Fantastic. I showed my military ID on check in and they upgraded all our rooms for free.

Think I would like to have seen our original rooms first. (I've stayed in a nicer standard room at the TI). That aside we loved our week, the pool is a little disappointing (in the shade until midday) but NYNY staff were very helpful and friendly. I would highly recommend the eggs Benedict in Il Fornaio restaurant and anything in Nine Fine Irishmen. The Big Apple bar is also great with a band performing at intervals through the night. Don\u2019t bother with Coyote Ugly, even though we had VIP tickets the doormen said we could skip the queue if we tipped them and then you get inside to find you drink from plastic cups and an annoying teenager is stood on the bar trying to make you \"partay\" to thrash metal! As an aside I've \"partayed\" with my American military colleagues on many occasions and they always talk a good \"partay\" but rarely impress us Brits. Plus you just celebrate so \"differently\", shall we just leave it there? We didn\u2019t gamble much but when we did NYNY's casino was a pleasant experience, there is just so much happening there. The Times Square bar is also cool, with duelling pianos but believe it or not the best beer is to be had in ESPN Zone and not Nine Fine Irishmen (NFI). Massive jugs of Stella for 7 bucks. Also didn\u2019t appreciate being asked to pay a cover into NFI on the weekend! Come on guys I\u2019m staying in the hotel, surely that counts for something? I don\u2019t know what else to say really, Vegas is my favourite place on earth, except for Tao in The Venetian. If queuing for an hour (again even though we had VIP passes) to get into a pitch black cave full of thrash metal and then being told we could only come in if we sit at a table for a 2 drink minimum which entitled us to buy only $375 bottles of vodka then deal me out!

No matter how old you are go to Ghost in The Palms hotel one night, the view from the 51st floor balcony is AWESOME and you simply must do the Grand Canyon Helicopter trip.

Also the Hoover Dam is only 40 minutes drive away so its well worth hiring a car and driving yourself there instead of taking an all day excursion. NYNY was spot on for a bunch of stags, maybe not so for couples or older groups with children but then again where in Vegas is?

I've read varying reports about the rooms and, while I often ate meals and gambled at NYNY, I had no idea what to expect once I actually stayed there. Well, it was just fabulous - my room was in a corner of the Century or Empire Tower (between the two, I think) and was huge, with windows on two sides and one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in. (Surprisingly to me, one of the other comfortable beds was at the Excalibur.) The bathroom was big and bright and I had an extremely generous supply of towels each day - in fact, I was a little puzzled at the way they'd leave the old towels but then add three or four new ones. I wonder how many would eventually have collected in the room, but I'm not complaining. The soap and shampoo were very nice there too. It was also one of the QUIETEST rooms I've ever stayed in, at least in Las Vegas - again sort of surprisingly, the Excalibur also had a quiet room, but my three experiences in the Luxor weren't that great, noise-wise. I had no trouble finding the elevators since they were right near the registration desk. I thought the furnishings were all fairly new and so was the hallway carpeting - basicaly, I felt very happily surprised at the quality of the experience. The room temperature was absolutely perfect for me - it was abnout 110 outside but I never felt too hot, or too cold, in the room. People who like a \"cooler\" room might have been disappointed but I found it just fine. I wasn't lucky at all at the slot machines, and I have to wonder if maybe that Player's Card isn't such a great deal after all when they basically recouped the cost of my \"free\" room - all with my cooperation, of course, but still... I thought briefly about not using the card, but then I'd also be less likely to get another of those comped room offers, and I'd certainly stay there again. I've always felt comfortable at NYNY even though I usually stayed somewhere next door, so it was nice to finally experience more of the place for myself. I visited Hoover Dam this trip and was glad I did - it's like an alien planet out there, to someone from the Midwest. I also love the Mirage and hope to stay there someday, and of course I found Excalibur and even Luxor perfectly fine too (and I prefer the southern location on the Strip.) But now I'm pretty likely going to stay again at NYNY - I can't think of a single thing I wasn't happy with, and when I did want to try other restaurants or other casinos, they're a short walk away. One final note - I visited the Star Trek Expereience again on this visit, and finally realized that I can get half price tickets with absolutely no trouble at the ticket booth near the Coca Cola museum right across the street.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't really worth the money either. We were much happier and more comfortable at the Sahara. There were a LOT of families wandering around NYNY, which was annoying and a little inappropriate. I hope when I have children, I'm not compelled to bring them to a city where you can gamble, drink all night and buy prostitutes. Not good parenting. Anyway, I booked the room through expedia, and we received a double queen instead of king room. We chose not to complain about that (we can easily fit in a queen), but the view (or lack thereof) from the window was a joke. Really. We actually laughed. The window was frosted, except for the top foot or so, which was blocked by a wall anyway. The bathrooms were not what was depicted on the NYNY website. They were much smaller. However, once again, we didn't complain because we didn't intend to be in the room much. We didn't spend much time at NYNY gambling because of all the children, and also because the craps tables were consistently set at $15 minimums. We actually went down to TI and the Mirage and spent most of our time gambling there. The maid service was slightly below average. We ate at Chin Chin, which was good, and the service was wonderful. Same with Nine Fine Irishmen. The bars were lame and not really interesting for people between the ages of 24-35. And we're not even really nightclub people. Summary: NYNY is a family/older people casino, and they charge too much for an average time.

I loved my corner room, it was huge and clean,with spectacular views out of many windows. I was in the Century Tower on the 23rd floor. I really liked the line of bath products they use, wonderful scents like grapefruit and pomegranate etc. The staff was quite friendly and pleasant everwhere, from the hotel to the casino to the folks at Scirocco's pizza working their butts off and remaining professional and attentive when dealing with the drunks at 2 am on a Fri night. The hotel overall seems to me to have a NY in the 70's, Studio 54 type of theme, the house band is great, lots of 70's and 80's rock, however you will hear the same songs each night, lots of BON JOVI, but it does seem to be what the crowd wants. The dueling pianos are very good also, again, lots of 70's and 80's music. One thing out of place and quite unenjoyable to me was the music at the pool, I just don't understand why they broke away from the 70's and 80's theme and played HIP HOP at the pool, especially in the morning, 9 am, when 90% of the patrons were 40's, 50's, 60's easy listening kinda folks. It is NOT the HARD ROCK! It definitely felt like the music was chosen by and for the very young pool staff and not the bleary-eyed patrons. The food in the America Cafe was very good. I wish I had gone to Starbucks, I did not like the room service coffee or the coffee at Il Fornaio's, it was bitter. I will return! Great location on the Strip too, oh and I had a view of the rollercoaster, one of the big hills, very fun, a little disconcerting though to often look out and see empty cars making their practice runs, that was a little creepy, you have been warned!

It was for a birthday so I reserved a King Bed Jacuzzi Room, in the EMPIRE TOWER. I will do the positves first: 1) The location is ideal if you don't want to a ton of walking, as it is central to MGM, EXCALIBUR, LUXOR, MANDALAY BAY, a short tram will get ya too all big hotels. Even if you have to walk, its not too bad, as long the temp isn't above 100. I chose this hotel, for its location and the deal I got on the room, as well as the Casino. The Casino is def. for the younger crowd. However, I still saw some older folks, the reason I say its for the younger crowd is due to the tight feel of the casino. Everything is scrunched together. But if you don't mind walking in a crowded Casino, then it will work for you. The SLOTS are a BIT looser then other big casinos on the strip. My FAVORITE GAMES are the MIN $1 tables, the $1 DICE GAME by the main elevators near the STRIP entrance, and the SPIN FOR RICHES wheel located on the left side of the main PIT. THESE were AWESOME if you are like me, and want to play with chips but don't want to lose everything ni 5 mins. Its pretty much like playing $1 slots, but you get the thrill of playing at a table with chips. I noticed they have the wheel game all over the strip big casinos, the Belligio has the game for a $2 min, however, I won the most on the NY NY game, and lost the most on the Belligio game. Anyway, back to more positives, we didn't do any of the resturants here except the little eateries. That is another plus to this hotel, there are a lot of cheap places to eat if you don't want to spend an arm and a leg. They have Nathen Hot Dogs, and a NY style pizza place, which were both good cheap eats. TRY the MARGARITAS @ Gonzales Y Gonzales, they are GREAT!!! Also, the AMERICAN Cafe is really good for the money, about $8-15 bucks for dinner. Average Cafe/Grill prices, but good food, oh and its 24 HOURS. NOW for the negative: If you are a clean freak, or just don't want to see nasty things in your shower or Jacuzzi, then ya might want to skip STAYING @ the NY NY and just enjoy the CASINO. We found two GOBS OF HAIR on the shower wall, and also a bit in the Jacuzzi Tub. GROSSS! It was obvious, Housekeeping had Not cleaned the shower or Jacuzzi, also the floor of the shower had mildew/mold, and there was no shower matt supplied, which again was GROSS. Honestly, I am not that picky of a person, Im NO CLEAN FREAK. But I do have a thing about HAIR iin the SHOWER, and that was JUST NASTY!!!! The jacuzzi was big though, too bad it was DIRTY :( ALSO, the elevators that took us up to our room, we were on the 32nd floor, TOTALLY SWAYED BACK AND FORTH. So much so that I had to grab hold of the railing. I'm scared of heights, so that freaked me out, we used all three elevators and THEY ALL DID IT. It totally felt like they were hanging on a loose wire. NOT GOOD. :( OVERALL: Skip staying at the NY NY, and just visit and enjoy the cheap eats, and GOOD MARGARITAS! Jacuzzi King Room in EMPIRE TOWER : $158, booked on NY NY website. PS -- TRY THE MANDALAY BAY BUFFET, IF YOU LIKE CRAB LEGS AND SHRIMP!!! DELICIOUS AND GREAT VALUE FOR $25 BUCKS!!!!

The Mirage is an excellent hotel with the dolphins, tigers, panthers, etc. Amazing! We watched two shows. A Neil Diamond tribute and a Beatles tribute.

Also, don't forget to ride the Manhatten Express for the thrill of your life. The peak of the roller coaster gives you a view all the way down the strip before you plunge down at 60MPH. Great ride! The pool wasn't too appealing, however, as it there was only one, compared to most other hotels that boast 3 pools or more. Also, the pool closed at 6pm, which I found to be ridiculously early. The room was comfortable but I think NY NY needs to revamp their rooms a little bit. They're a little too dark and gloomy for my taste. But don't get me wrong, the beds are very comfortable, we slept like babies. No noise from other rooms or the hallway was heard at any time. You can look forward to a restful night's sleep here. Overall though, you definately get your moneys worth here. I'd stay there again, but if I can spare some extra money next time, I think I'll try somewhere a little higher in the budget, like the Bellagio.", "Date": "May 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cJust OK\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5191289", "Content": "This hotel will be very good or quite disappointing depending on what you are looking for.

Again we called... the concierge called the very amiable people in the other room, who obligingly doused their lights and TV -- my spouse had a very early meeting the next day. Next morning, New York New York arranged to move us yet again, and later that day and for the remainder of our stay we were in a lovely, large east-and-south views room, and at least 3-4 staff members called to make sure our final move was satisfactory and apologize. An extremely obliging bellman even moved our luggage and garments on hangers so that I needn't re pack. Hotel location and all the staff were quite good... the hotel has easy access to both the monorail system and the southern Strip tram system. The casino is a good deal less smoky than some, perhaps due to the very high ceilings, and we found the restaurant Nine Fine Irishmen an excellent place to take a guest the first night -- we were seated in a little 'snug' just off the upstairs bar very reminiscent of pubs in the UK, but we understand the whole thing was built and moved whole from Ireland.

The 700 sq/ft L-Shaped room is complete with clover-shaped spa tub large enough to fit two comfortably and up to four in close quarters. The only downside was that the jets were at the bottom of the tub so there was no direct massage on my back. The highlight of the room was the Bose sound system -- Far and away the best stereo system I have ever seen in a hotel room. It came with a cd/dvd player, two overhead speakers which could be positioned to face any part of the room, and a subwoofer to provide that extra bass kick. We were playing the stereo pretty loud inside the room but it was barely audible to those walking down the hall. Another nice feature was the small fridge. So much better than those lousy honor bars where if you touch an item it's instantly billed to your room. We stopped off at a convenience store on the way in from the airport and stocked up on water, soda, and some adult libations. The bathroom was small but adequate. The water pressure was poor and the toilet seat would not stay up. The living area was more than adequate with a sofa-bed, coffee table and large TV. Adjacent to that was a large four-person dining table. There were also a couple of nice chairs which rocked back and forth. All in all it was a great room and it was priced around the same as a standard room at the Venetian or Caesars Palace.

When I got to the room she had given us for the night I noticed that it was a skyline room and I had paid extra for the park avenue deluxe, which is about 150 - 200 square feet bigger. I called the front desk to complain and was told basically that they didn't have the room I had pre-paid and that was because of the late check-in. I explained that I had pre-paid the night so the time of check-in shouldn't matter. Not only that but the clerk who had originally checked us in never explained that we wouldn't be getting the room we paid extra for. Housekeeping was horrible. Our room was never cleaned before 3:00 p.m. and one day housekeeping actually called to see if we would like our room cleaned. The roller coaster drove me crazy.

It seemed like someone in the group expeienced at least one of the problems that I have seen as themes in the various reviews. Check-In 3 rooms got upgraded just by asking. 1 room got just what we had reserved. 1 room got given smoking and told they could move the next day (they keep the room since it was not noticable) 1 room / couple insisted on non-smoking and got told they would have to \"downgrade\" or pay $75 more per night since they next upgrade room was not open. Well after some very load complaining they suddenly found a room for them in the same slight upgrade / non-smoking the other 3 had gotten. It was really small but non-smoking. What kind of stupid front desk person actually tells somebody they are going to be downgraded. If she had just put them in the downgraded room they would probably have never known. Noise I am really hard of hearing so I thought ... no problem ... well all the nights at 4-6 am I could lay in my bed and actually hear clearly the people next door talking. Because of this site I had brought ear plugs that both my husband and I then put on. Rooms Considering we all had the same reservations and no one paid for an upgrade we had a huge variety of room sizes and locations. So I would say if you don't like your room just ask for a different one. Some people had a small one near the elevator. Some bigger at the end of the hall (but no view). One couple even had a corner window with a strip view. Food Nine Fine Irishmen was a hit with our whole group. It was a little strange that the poor girl could not split our bill but could charge whatever amount we wanted to 12 different things. Tons of work for her. Next time we will do that differently. I think someone in our group ended up here each night at some point. We also loved the quick service pizza on the main level and the Nathan's famous hot dogs up by the kiddie games. Try the Philly! Look for coupon's on the internet for buy one item get one free. 2 different groups ate at the America restaurant. Nothing really special although the club sandwich was really good. Service was OK. We loved the \"Food Court\" concept of the whole place and it made grabbing a bit really easy. Kids After returning to Vegas after not having been for about 15 years I can say Don't bring your kids to Vegas. You cannot walk down the street without seeing something you might just rather not have your kids think of as \"normal\" The Nude factor is huge ... That being said if you do have to bring kids New York New York would be a good place to stay. They have lots of places to eat and shop without going into the casino. There is a game area with arcade games and they could get to MGM and see the lions without being outside much. But the pool although closed when we were there looks to be a boring and small. Games / Slots etc. We had some fun at the slots but mainly gambled at cheaper places down the strip. Casino Royale was a favorite (fun craps and blackjack Split). Getting around The new Duece bus was the best deal $5 for riding all day. Just don't try to get anywhere in a hurry since they are driving on the strip which is not fast at all. Would we stay there again? With so many places to stay in Vegas our group will probably try another place down near Mirage or Treasure Island since there are more places to go in a more concentrated area but we did enjoy the New York / New York.", "Date": "February 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perrysburg, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cNew York state of mind\u201d", "Author": "keoweegirl", "ReviewID": "UR4470778", "Content": "Just returned from a 5 day trip to vegas.

This is by far my favorite location on the strip (a view shared by my wife, brothers, and several friends.) There's a handful of conflicting reviews here, and I want to touch on what you get (and DON'T get) at this hotel. Rooms: The rooms to tend towards the smaller size. Whenever I've checked in, I'm always nice to the counter person, and always at least get a view of the strip (which is all I really care about in a Vegas room). The TV is small, but of course why would anyone sit in their room to watch TV when they're in Vegas? I've never heard a lot of noise from the roller coaster; I've heard a lot more from either the AC or the copters flying overhead. Casino: I don't play slots, so I can't comment on those. I have seen people post that they slots don't pay out; do remember they call it gambling for a reason. ;-) It's easy to at least find $10 tables, and the occassional $5 table (although those are rare.) The casino is fairly small compared to a lot of the others, which I like because it's easy for me to sneak away to the bathroom or to grab a bite to eat. They don't have a poker room, which is my only complaint. (There are rumors they will open one, but we'll see what happens.) Pool: Terrible. I don't go to Vegas for the pool, so this doesn't bother me at all. If you want a pool, stay at the Flamingo or someplace else. Coyote Ugly: Unless 100 guys trying to ogle 6 girls is your idea of a good time, skip this place. it's packed, the drinks are overpriced, and the atmosphere isn't what I would call fun. Nine Fine Irishmen: Love this bar. Good food, good Guiness, good service. Not to be missed. ESPN Zone: Makes up for their very small sportsbook. Make your bet outside, then go inside and watch the game. Great fun. Times Square Bar: I love dueling pianos, so I love this place. We spent the majority of our 2005NYE at this bar. (To the random girl my brother and I seranaded on NYE, I apologize.) ;-) Quick Bites: All over the place. The best thing to do is to go upstairs to Nathan's. It's a pain to get to, so it's often pretty empty there (even when the rest of the place is packed), and you get to have Nathan's (the best hot dog in the world.) The pizza joint is OK (works if you're drunk). Basically, NYNY, just like any other location in Vegas, caters to a specific crowd.

We stayed in a normal room in the Century Tower, rm 2631 and it was just avg. It wasn't bad but but it wasn't luxury either. Like many people say though, you don't go to Vegas to hang out in your room. As for people saying that their are kids running all over the place, I think I saw 2 kids underage the entire trip in this hotel. The layout of the casino is awesome. By far my fav. of all the casino's we visited this trip. I played a lot of Black Jack and for the most part, the dealers were very friendly and funny. One dealer by the name of Robert made our time playing there excellent. I did lose all my money by the end of the trip, but I guess that's to be expected. We played BJ at TI, MGM, Luxor, and of course NYNY. The dealers at these hotels were pathetic, especially at TI. I will never drop another dollar in that hotel. MGM and TI are supposed to accept the player card that we get at NYNY but those two hotels wouldn't even take down your info if you didn't bet $25 or more a hand. And they were't friendly about letting you know it either. They were snotty and kinda laughing when I ONLY place a $15 bet for my first hand. At the NYNY, they accept player cards if you are even $5 a hand. What they do there is just keep track of your avg bet over how long you play there. Best advice, use your player card everytime you drop a dollar into the slot or play a hand of something at the tables, then charge all your food to your room. At the end, go to the players desk and ask what comps you got. We got all our food covered plus $20 cash back. Nice little perk at the end of a trip. Another thing, people always complain on here about the rollercoaster being to loud, or hearing the hellicopters flying over head...cry me a river! We had the start of the rollercoaster right out our window and could barely hear it and I watched hellicopters fly overhead all the time, but didn't hear them either.

We arrived at 9 am and they got us a room immediately. The rooms were very clean and the maid service was wonderful. Bathroom was large and the beds were very comfortable. We ate dinner at Il Fornaio and it was great. Also went to quite a few buffets and very nice restaurants in the Venitian. The best part was you had the 'fast food' type of eateries so you can grab and run to do as you please. We saw Danny Gans(Mirage) and he was well worth the money. He stopped once to take a sip of water and that was it. We also saw the Legends show at the Imperial Palace and that was a riot especially when Elvis came up to me and started serenading me. My dad really got a kick out of that one! The last night was a blast we were up till 530 am gambling, drinking, andpacking then had to get on a tour bus to go see hover dam (great experience, must see) needless to say my first experience in vegas was wonderful and i'm glad to share it with my father(Thank you pa I love you!) Second vegas experience was in August of 2004 my boyfriend got comped a 4 night stay at NYNY w/limo, spa, the works. We arrived and they picked us up in a limo(see photo.) We went to the vip area where there was a younger man helping us and giving us great info. I'm not a huge bar person so i have to comments on that. The casino waitstaff was wonderful. They brought me any kind of drink I wanted(even when sitting at the penny slots) and they were quick too. Our room was clean, tidy and spacious. I don't see why there are so many complaints about them if you don't buy a suite then don't expect a room the size of a suite! As for the roller coaster (you can see in the photos outside my bedroom window) they were not loud at all. I heard people scream from them probably twice and that's because the vent was open in the room, there was no tv/shower going and I was being perfectly quite. They must have read my mind because there was extra pillows in the closet! We left in the morning(7am) and came back around 11am and the beds were made, trash taken out, empty/dirty glasses taken/replaced, fresh towels, more toiletpaper& tissue, etc. Absolutley great! Trip 3 August 2005 for a friends birthday. Had to stay at NYNY again because they are so good to us. Checked in and upgraded our room for a nominal fee. Didn't like the first one and they were quick to get us into a new room and deeply apologized. If I could post movie images I would but this view was breathtaking. You could see all the way down the strip and the bellagio fountains were wonderful at night especially. We went down to the Wynn casino and it was like a replica of Bellagio and Caesars Palace. Again things were clean & tidy the only issue we had this time was there was a 'party' going on in the room next to us. It lasted 5 min, security came up escorted people out and actually came and sat upstairs for about 1/2 hour to make sure they weren't getting rowdy again. Trust me I appreciated it. First time I went downtown and loved the show, taxi was expensive but worth it because it took you 15-20 min to get down there instead of the 2 hours it took our friends because they took the bus. The light show was good. I really did not want to leave the hotel this time we pretty much ate and gambled here nightly. We got 'take out' and ate in our room (while watching the Bellagio fountains).

Times Sq has dueling pianos, Big Apple has live bands and NFI is just always packed. As the title says 'great for 30somethings who enjoy a lively night'.

We were told that the rooms tend to be small and this one most certainly was not!!! The view was incredible too. We were on a corner so we got the strip view as well as one toward Excalibur. Well, on our second night, after we had been out walking all day on the strip, I decided to call down to the front desk to ensure that there was nothing we needed to do for the next day. They told us again it was not a problem, and that we would need our keys recoded, but we could do that anytime the next day. Great! Off to sleep I went, until the phone rang just moments later. Turns out the room they had us in was blocked off for the next two days for \"deep cleaning\" whatever that is, but for the inconvenience they were going to upgrade us to the Park Avenue rooms (we were only booked in Skyline Deluxe). So, after being out all day and it was now 10:30pm, we had to pack up and move. Then they took us to a room that was so small, we could barely fit our luggage in there, and this was supposed to be an upgrade? I felt sorry for the poor bellperson, he almost had to carry our stuff to multiple rooms, but instead we asked if all the rooms were like this in the category, and he said they were. So down to the front desk we went. We finally spoke with a manager, and he upgraded us to the top type of room they had. It was the type of room they reserve for the winners in the casino, however, he did mention that there was no view. In fact, the view was so bad that they kept the blinds closed all day and night. But, there was one benefit... we got one heck of a hottub, which we used immediately as we got settled into the room at 11:30pm, when we had a tour picking us up at 7 am the next morning. So in short, if they had not messed up and we had stayed in our original room, I would probably rate this hotel a 4 because it was a great room with a great view. But, due to the issues, and seeing the the normal size rooms, I can't go any higher than a 3. On other notes, we checked out the pool, but since it was December, we didn't actually go in it, but it looked nice. They had some cabanas there that you can rent that have fans and refrigerators in them to keep cool on the hot summer days. Nice little feature. I must also say that the breakfast at Il Fornaio was incredible, you gotta try the french toast. The pizza at the pizza place was ok, not as good as true NY style pizza.

I travel 200,000 miles a year and have stayed every where in evey country. You get what you pay for based on where you are and what you want. NYNY is a solid B Hotel a 3+ stars a good clean fun place. It is also priced at $65 to $150 which is at the low end of the strip. You get a larger than normal strip room the more you pay. For $150 you get a monster, hot tub in the middle of the 600 square foot room. For $79 you get a nice 3-400 sq ft. room. This is a good room for vegas, huge for london sizes and small for Scottsdale, you judge by where you are. The advantages are the hotel delivers what it advertises, check in is reasonable comnpared to the MGM or Ceasars and horrible compared to the Mayfair in London. It is a smaller hotel and that has the advantage of easy to get around, no one gets lost and the restaurants are not jammed. The food options are great from a deli with $9 sandwiches to a good steak place with $35 steaks. Il Fornaio is a good upscale italian chain for all three meals. What you do not get is any thing like a spa. The pool is closed in the winter and small in the summer. The workout room looks like what you would expect in Paris, a few machines in a basement with no view or look and feel. I could not do a massage there as the rooms are on top of the workout and each other. So go some where else if you want to do anything other than a tread mill. Specifics to know. Rooms face the strip and the suburbs if this is a big issue ask. The rollercoaster goes around 3 sides of the hotel and runs from 11-11 except on weekends till midnight. Good soundproofing but if this is an issue ask to move. The people are very helpful and move people around like chips on a table. So go expecting a reasonably priced smaller hotel with a few issues and you will love it. It could be worse you could stay at the new Wynn hotel for $400 and be dissapointed.

Prior to booking, I had read online that the roller coaster is noisy. When I booked my reservation, I made a request for a room AWAY from the noise of the rollercoaster. At check-in, I again requested a room AWAY from the roller coaster. I was assured that my \"Park Avenue\" room on the 14th floor in the New York Tower was very quiet. The room was small and unimpressive. About 15 minutes after settling into my room, I heard a loud \"whoosh\" and people screaming. I looked out my window to see the roller coaster going right by my window. I called the front desk, and was told I could do a room change in the morning. We could not sleep until the ride closed at about 12:30 am. After changing to the Century Tower on the 18th, we went to our room on the 24th floor. The \"Broadway Deluxe\" was bigger and better than the last one, and, it was a free upgrade from the desk for the previous problems. During the night, at about 3:00 am, we were awoke to the sound of several large \"thuds\" that shook the bed. We thought someone was physically fighting in the next room. In the morning, I found out that it's a room filled with machines and elevators used by employees. On the 19th, housekeeping finally arrived at about 5:00 pm to make up the room. We asked them to come back at about 6:00 pm when we would be out of the room for the night. When we got back at 10:30 pm, the room was still not made up. I called \"Cindy\" in housekeeping and was told they would be 'right up'. We left for a snack and returned at 12:00 am. The room had not been touched. I again called \"Cindy\" in housekeeping to find out what the problem was. I was again told they would 'be right up.' I told them I was NOT going to wait any longer. I called the front desk, and complained to the night manager. On the 20th, the room was finally made up, but, the maid took the comforter leaving just sheets and a blanket. At about 4:00 am, we felt really cold because the comforter was gone. A very nice way to get some good sleep before leaving early to go to the airport at 7:30 am.... NOT !!! I used the Spa - very average... a couple of treadmills, bikes, weight machines, and free weights --- nothing to brag about. NYNY looks quite nice on the inside and is a fine place to visit, but NOT to stay. There is no buffet; the America Restaurant was good, the pizza place was bad. The slot machines did not pay out at all ... Upon checkout, we told the clerk how our stay with them REALLY was. We were told the manager would be told about it, contact us, and try to \"make things right.\" I sent this to the management of the hotel over a week ago -- and received no response.

As for hearing the rollercoaster, we could very rarely hear it. The coaster starts at 11am and stops at 11pm. We were out before 11 every morning and very rarely returned before 11pm. The only time we heard it was when we came back late afternoon to get changed for the evening, even then it was a very feint noise. Elevators:> I can\u2019t understand all the fuss about walking a few minutes from the elevators to the room, the distance to our room was 2 minutes at the very most. All the hotels in Vegas are massive and I would imagine this to be a problem in every hotel. Facilities/Restaurants :> We ate at 2 of the main restaurants; America and Il Fornia. America was very nice and reasonably priced. Il Fornai was a nice restaurant, pleasant atmosphere, nice food but my girlfriend and I thought it was a bit overpriced for what you got. As for the rest of the facilities NY-NY has to offer they are excellent. Plenty of choice for food on the go, Starbucks an excellent choice for breakfast in the morning, other include hot dogs, Krispy Kreme, Burgers, Pizza. The hotel caters for various types of food. Pool :> As previous posts suggest the pool is very small compared to others we saw whilst walking through the hotels. If you want a couple of hours to chill out by the pool then it is fine. The majority, if not all of the pool gets the sun, its just the sun lounge area which only get 25-50%. The pool staff are friendly and frequently come around and ask you for drinks. As stated in other posts, the pool is not NY-NY strong point, but for the amount of time you spend in the pool it is adequate. Location :> The location of NY-NY is ok, but not the best. It has easy access to various Monorails, a FREE one in Monte-Carlo which runs to the Bellagio, another FREE one at Excalibur which goes to Mandalay Bay Via Luxor. Plus there is a pay per ride monorail at the MGM which runs all the way down the strip. Overall this hotel is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone. I would stay in the this hotel again, but on our next visit will look to stay in a more central location, Paris, Bally\u2019s, Bellagio.", "Date": "October 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mahwah, NJ", "Title": "\u201cNY NY ROCKED - Great Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Mahwah", "ReviewID": "UR3998337", "Content": "Just returned home from an extended weekend in Rockin Las Vegas! NY NY hotel was awesome. I NEVER heard the roller coaster from my room - never! We stayed in a Broadway room in the Chrysler Tower. I was all set to upgrade upon arrival and decided to see room first before making decision. We stayed right where we were - room was perfect. 28th floor, two Queen beds, very large extended sitting area near window overlooking pool, and bathroom was gorgeous (all marble, deep/DEEP bathtub). The pool was beautiful, hot tubs were great. I've stayed at the Mirage on a previous visit and this hotel beat out the Mirage (by FAR!). Right outside the elevator was a perfect little coffee shop, quick trip downstairs and breakfast was taken care of (coffee, bagel, muffin, etc). At the Mirage, it took 35 mintutes to get a cup of coffee (only one coffee shop, clear across casino - near D.Gans theater, line was 50 people deep). NY NY hotel was awesome (period). Anyway, stop worring about the rooms and get out on the town! Vegas is where it's happening (for sure!). One giant party from sunup to sunup. Some of the best entertainment is FREE! Bellagio fountains, Sirens of TI, Ceasar's pool, not to mention some of the most amazing casino's you'll ever see. We ran into Robin Williams at MGM - nice guy - held the door for me :) One of the best BAR's in Vegas we just happend to stumble upon - it was just outside Harrah's. The Carousel Bar in the middle of the afternoon was one of the highlights of our trip. The Bartenders are a HOOT, not to mention talented (major bottle juggling, and funny, funny entertainment). Hint, don't pick up your cell phone, or the bartenders will leap over the bar and blow sports whistles into your phone :) There's always a BAND playing during the middle of the day and the dancing FREE. Great Party! Bring your comfortable walking shoes, and enjoy the sights while walking the strip - out in the open - with your beer, or famous test tube cocktail. You can't NOT have fun!

Nice view. The pool was ok. Kind of small. The Casino was fun and we won at the sports book!! The first day we got in about 4pm. We had Rita rendner tickets for 630PM ( the show was good. I think my girlfriend enjoyed more than me. Allot of female jokes. Before our show we went to the Chin Chin Cafe. We ordered WON TON soup, KUNG PAO CHICKEN and MONGOLIAN BEEF. The service was good but the food was average. No better than our corner Chinese restaurant, but the bill was about $60 with 2 drinks. I would pass one this place. The next day, We lunch at the Il Fornaio for lunch. We had to wait at our table for about 10 minutes before a waiter came. I could tell that our server had no interest in our table. We finally got our water about half the way thru our meal.It . We really like fresh pasta when we can find it. We ordered the fresh pasta dish with a pesto sauce they had a featured item for that day (I forget the name). Well it was supposed to be stuffed with duck It was like a paste. I took one bite and told my girlfriend that it tasted like dog food.(I know I tried it when I was 6 years old)LOL. We made it about half the way thru and decided we will wait for dinner time. We had a hard time finding our waiter to give us our bill. When we were leaving we spoke to the manager. He invited us back for a free lunch the next day. I thought this was a good gesture. We went on our way and both had the burpies for about 3 hours. That night we ate at the MGM steak house. We had Kobe skirt steak. It was great. Really nice place. When we got back from dinner, we wanted desert. We could have had ice cream, but opted to stop at the Gallagher's Steakhouse( in the NY NY hotel). We figured we would order desert and take back to our room . The only thing that looked god was this toffee brownie with ice cream on the side.($8,50) We got it back to the room and we had about a postage stamp size brownie with allot of butter sauces on it.

We checked our bags and decided to have lunch at Il Fornaio, a really good Italian restaurant for any meal and reasonably priced for Vegas. By the time we were done with lunch around 1:30pm, our room was ready. We had a room with a view of the MGM Grand, and just above the rollercoaster in the New Yorker tower. The room was very clean, nicely decorated, and the beds were comfortable. A few minutes after we got to the room someone came to check if everything was okay and if there was anything we needed. In general we didn't spend much time in the room, so the noise from the rollercoaster was not really an issue. On the downside, the tram was not working, so we had to walk to the Monte Carlo to get on the tram to the Bellagio. However, there is a pedestrian walkway from NYNY to the MGM where there is a monorail station. Also, the location was not really central on the strip, so we had to walk or take a cab to get to other places. The casino was small, and we had much better luck at MGM and Treasure Island.

No problem with check-in, we had 3 rooms and got them all together (1102, 1103 and 1109) and non-smoking. Didn't ask for any other offers/upgrades. Only 1101 is farther from the elevator though, so if walking bothers you it's not so good. Can't really understand why people complain about walking to the elevators...the hotel has 1000's of room, it's going to take a while to get to some of them. Initial room condition was very good. All three rooms were queen/queen, clean and reasonably spacious for 2 large bags and room to spread out, unpack hanging clothes for 2 people and still be in the room. The bathroom was smaller than it needed to be but clean and decently stocked. Daily maid service comes at the entirely bizarre hour of 8:30am. Make sure you put your DND sign out when you go to sleep. Service was good each day and the DND sign was obeyed. Ate at ESPN Zone once, reasonable food, good selection of TVs to watch. Our particular waiter had no interest in clearing our table for 7 of dishes until after dinner (he told us as much!) and we were left with quite a stack of plates and glasses. I didn't have the chance to try any of the other restaurants in the hotel, choosing instead to eat at Picasso and Aureole for dinner and trying several buffets for other meals. I've never been to Vegas before and wasn't sure what to expect of the casinos. After walking to as many hotels as possible, NYNY was below average in terms of slots and table games. We had one extremely bad experience at a blackjack table. There was an empty beer bottle left on the table (no idea why it wasn't removed). 6 of us sat down with approx. $1000 at a $10 table. We asked the dealer if he could clear the table, he said he wasn't allowed to remove it but asked the pit boss to help take care of it. The pit boss came over, smirked, said it was fine where it was and walked away. The dealer was stunned and the 6 of us picked up our money and walked away. That was our only bad table experience. Other than that everything was positive with table games. Drink service, even at the 5 cent slots was extremely good. I was served 6 drinks in 90 minutes playing $20 in a 5 cent slot. No reason to pay for a drink, ever....just tip the waitresses for bringing you all those free drinks. Other than that 1 pit boss, I only witnessed staff working hard to make guests feel comfortable. The atmosphere in the bars/restaurants at night is very lively and fun, with tons of people milling about. Especially so outside the dualin pianos show. Very fun to listen to. The pool is not lavish but it's a pool and you can take a nice break in the afternoon sun to cool off. There's 3 hot tubs, I think, behind the pool. Between the fake NY skyline and the parking garage, however, you don't get much sun. If you are used to the sunshine, then not so great, if you're used to 60 degree temperatures in September like I am, 95 in the shade is nothing to complain about!! Went on a tour of the spa but had to cancel my appointment. Smallish spa but clean and well stocked. Overall a good experience for a first trip to Las Vegas. I can recommend this hotel as a clean, fun hotel in a good location on the strip. Walkway to Excalibur lets you on the tram to Luxor and Mandalay and walkway to MGM gives you access to the monorail and the rest of the strip. A short walk to Monte Carlo gives you a tram to Bellagio. It's all very convenient. I could easily go back to this hotel and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others.

One big complaint would be that on weekends ALL of the tables in the Bar at Time Square are reserved (for who I'm not sure). In theory this is OK but we were in there on a Friday night and half of them stayed vacant all night, what a waste!!!!!! The room service is always good and there is always something to and somewhere to eat with the restaurants and fast food outlets being varied.

According to locals Vegas wasn't as busy over Labor Day as it normally is but you would never have guessed it from the NY NY. It was teaming and that is something I am used to now. It seems to be the busiest hotel in vegas (probably because it is smaller than some of the other big ones) so if you don't like slow moving crowds, don't stay here on a holiday weekend.

Arriving at the hotel was easy. You're dropped off within feet from the check in desk - which is nice. I proceeded to check in and they still had us with a smoking room. I showed them my voucher which stated non-smoking - strip view, so the girl made the change and we were on our way. We were lucky that our tower was close by the desk, some of the tower elevators are clear across the casino - quite a hike! We got to the room and I think it was the same one that I originally was given (smoking and away from the strip) - back down we went and back into line. The front desk person (same one) was a bit bewildered when we got there. \"Sir, that is a non-smoking room and on the strip\" Well, it wasn't. I demanded an upgrade and after 30 mins of the girl checking with someone, eventually she came back and said \"Sir, we can put you in our Park Avenue room for an additional $10/night\" - What the heck, I was tired and wanted to unload my luggage. The room in comparison to the original room we were to get was worth the extra $10. Newly renovated, very nice, with a view of MGM, Tropicanna, and Excalibur, plus the airport.

The rooms were spacious and clean, we were in Century Tower so our view was tinted pink but we still had a view of the rollercoaster and the Excalibur end of the Strip.

Read books and websites like this one and decide what you want to see. We weren't really into the whole drinking/gambling thing and so wanted to see what else the city had to offer. And we had a fantastic time. Here are a few things we did that I would recommend: - Sushi at the Coral Lounge at Mandalay Bay - Tournament of Kings at Excalibur. No cutlery and plenty of hunky knights made for a great dinner show! - Lions at MGM Grand - Secret Garden at the Mirage (White Tigers & dolphins) - Take a Gondola (inside for families, outside for romantics) at the Venetian and dont miss St Marks Square - Shop at Forum Shops at Caesars Palace. Dont miss the free shows at the fountains at either end! Also check out Fashion Show Mall. - Fountain show at Bellagio - We didnt see Cirque de Soleil, but if you havent seen them before, check them out. Theres several different ones in Vegas at the moment. We saw Splash! for a bit of authentic Vegas and it was hilarious. - Helicopter flight over the Strip at night - Day trip out to the Grand Canyon (we went with Pink Jeep Tours - highly recommended) - Sirens of TI (hint: if you are staying at an MGM propert, you get VIP seating for this show!) - Volcano eruption at The Mirage Favourite place to eat: Prime at the Bellagio. Worth it for the truffle mashed potato alone. Have cocktails on the terrace first overlooking the fountains at Fontana. Extra Hint: We moved to the Montelago Village area for 3 days at the end of our trip to recover. 20 minutes by taxi and you're in a whole new world. We stayed at the Hyatt Regency and it was just beautiful. Amazing restaurants and two huge pool areas, lovely rooms and helpful staff.

We should have known that we weren't going to have a lot of luck there, hey, it's Vegas! But, we did think that getting a jacuzzi suite would guarantee a good stay; we were wrong. I have posted pictures of our view, it was the side of a wall. So, first piece of advice, ask for a view, if you don't, they won't give you one. One thing I had read about was that you could rent a refrigerator, it is $30 a day to do so. We stayed for 6 nights and wanted cold water (bought at CVS down the street) to take with us for the day and at night after walking around. Upon check-in, the woman waived that fee, we believe because we had such a terrible room. Other things that went wrong with the room: our comforter was filled with rips (with all the money they make they can't get a new comforter?), our soap and shampoo were not restocked when they needed to be (I think it's stupid to change them everyday, but when there is no soap left, please restock without me asking, we obviously used it), it then took them a while to bring it up as we were both waiting to take a shower after being out all day and rushing to get to a dinner reservation, and on the second to last day we randomly got bubble bath for our jacuzzi, why hadn't we gotten it all along? Now, I know we could have gotten money off our very overpriced room, but my boyfriend and I are not really complainers. We were going to when we checked out, but the woman checking us out didn't even ask us how our stay was! She didn't give us a chance to complain. We should have at least had the opportunity! If you are looking for a place to be close to great bars and don't care about a strip view or fancy room, this is your place. If you are looking for a little more than your average hotel, stay somewhere else. On our next trip to Vegas, we will be staying somewhere else. Other comments on Vegas: Fiore Steakhouse at the Rio- Very nice, good steak, wonderful wait staff, not THAT overpriced ($90 for 2 entrees, 2 sides), and they give you a stool for your purse, which I thought was a nice touch. Catch Penn & Teller after dinner, after 30 years together they've perfected that show. It was great and the tickets are really reasonable. Alize at the top of the Palms- BEAUTIFUL VIEW, I didn't love the chicken that I got, but my boyfriend LOVED his steak. Wait staff of 4 with wonderful suggestions for wine, the chocolate cake is AMAZING, order it. Just be prepared to spend at least $150 for two, we don't get soup, salad, appetizers, or coffee, so that was just the entrees, half a bottle of wine (they don't sell by the glass), and chocolate cake. Neros at Caesars- really good food but if you want to sit inside instead of in the walkway to the casino, you need to be in the smoking area. Which didn't make sense to me being that we were in the hallway practically of the casino where people smoke. Tell me how that makes sense? Anyway, really good food, nice wait staff, they don't give you a basket of bread though. They must have a bread shortage or something because they give you each a piece of bread and don't restock when you're clearly done. It was odd. This cost us about $120 with tip for 2 entrees, 1 side, and 2 cocktails. Go see Celine Dion after dinner, it was amazing, and amazingly overpriced! Onda at Mirage- my boyfriend had some sort of seafood plate, he absolutely loved it. I had chicken parmagiana, it was fantastic (to let you know, my boyfriend's parents are from Italy and her food is hard to beat!). Not overpriced by Vegas standards, I believe it was $100-120 for our two salads, two entrees, a glass of wine, and a cocktail. We saw Ray Romano after, he was hysterical! And just a note from a NYer, don't eat the pizza at the NY NY hotel! It is not NY style pizza, it was the worst pizza I ever had in my life! Don't let them trick you into thinking that's what pizza is supposed to taste like, come to NY and visit a Mom & Pop shop in Little Italy, only then can you say you've had NY pizza! Also- go visit the Grand Canyon! Just make sure you don't mind being the only one not in a private tour and/or speaking English! Other than that, the view is amazing :) Take a ride on a Gondola, you might want to go indoors. We did the outdoor one, it was about 5 minutes long for $25 for the two of us. I think the one inside is longer, it's at least more expensive if it's not.

We had to call in the doctor that the hotel uses which cost us 400.00 dollars, than he had to be transported to the ER, this was the frist night. the ER was at least 5 miles from the hotel,which ment that both nights I had to pay for me to get back to the hotel plus pay for my friend , because they would admit him each time for fluids , then they would release him afterI was back at the hotel. security was great they did a very good job on securring our room. we spent more money getting back from the hospital than on anything. I say this because my friend ended back in the ER on the third night, which we had to call the security again for them to lock out the room so that nobodycould go into it. they also arranged to call the ambulace and the ems. they were just great!

We stayed from Aug 11 through the 14th. Every day was a pleasure. Check-in was immediate. I did see small lines at the desk at times, but that was on Friday and Saturday nights when the whole place was very busy with weekenders. Still they seemed to move quickly. We stayed in the Empire Tower, #3414 - our elvator was right around the corner from the check-in desk - very easy to access. The evelvators were never a problem (as far as waiting for them) as the elevators bypassed all floors until #30. Our room was absolutely fine and we had a great view. Some folks have complained of the size and lighting....I could admit that the size was a bit small, but hardly tiny or cramped in any way. Lighting was fine as well. Loved the ginger/orange bath products, unfortunately, the spa was out of the lotion so I wasn't able to purchase any, but I WILL be checking back! Maid service...awesome -I made our bed daily thinking they'd not have to change the sheets each day...but they did anyway on the very comfortable bed! I agree whole-heartedly with the very recent review that the casino is terrific in that you get the 'lay of the land' quickly! That, to me, is great. We visited several other hotels during our stay just to say we saw them and some were just so gigantic! I always would comment upon exiting them that I liked our hotel better. The service people at New York New York were so entirly great! EVERYONE one was polite, courteous, always wishing us 'Good Luck!\". And lucky we were! I think we were luckier than most folks have aright to be in Vegas! Our winnings practically paid for the whole vacation! And all winnings were at NYNY save for one slot jackpot at MGM - but they're a sister hotel so that's good! Make sure to sign up for a players card! We were comped dinner at ESPN and America plus we got the free t-shirts! While I'm on the restaurants, let me say that all food we had at NYNY was great. We had an appetizer, lunch and a dinner at ESPN - all different days - all great. I reccomend the bbq'd chicken breast dinner (on garlic mashed potatoes with onion straws on top!)- one of the best dinners I have ever had!! Had Mexican Lasagna at Gonzales Y Gonzales, very good and breakfast at America on our last morning was very fine with an awesome waitress. Two other breakfasts were at the MGM Grand Buffet - a great price ($12.99!) for fabulous choices of many, many wonderful foods. We did do the Carnival World Buffet at Rio for one dinner as we'd had heard lots about it...this thing is too big to be terrific. Must be over 100 yards long. My huband said his first choices of food were cold by the time he found our table to eat them (he got lost twice trying to find our table!)The eateries in the 'streets of NY' were very nicely done....treat yourself to a fabulous sweet at the pastry shop! We happened upon the Bar at Times Square just as the two dueling piano guys were starting up one afternoon.....this was a hoot! They were as fun as I'd read about..very interactive, funny and talented. The evening 'show' gets packed (standing room only), so if you're able to get in on the afternoon session, do it! Awesome place to be entertained! We never 'did' the pool - it was way to hot to lay out - but stepped out to the pool deck to see that it was better than many have said. It aint Mandalay Bay or Cesars....but if you just need a dip, what does it matter? All in all we had a fantastic time! I'd like to come during the week next time as I like the casino a little less crowded. Thursday night was perfect, Friday was certainly busier, but by Saturday, it was really hoppin'....still a ton of fun, but I'd rather not dodge folks so much - that's just me.

The room was very tiny while the bathroom was decent size. I think kingbed room has smaller room than queenbeds room, but has bigger bathroom. A/C, Shower, Lights, and etcs. all wroked fine. Room's decor was ok, nothing fancy or luxurious. Bathroom had a marble tiles, but could tell it was cheap marbles. Nothing was dirty or worn out, but wouldn't say everything was extremely clean(hotel is aging).

Good: The room is average - nothing too fancy. my wife loved the bath products, and housekeeping was fast and friendly. We were on the 24th floor, and even with a full elevator it was efficient. The casino is fine, but the sportsbook is mediocre. I played most of the week at the MGM Grand, as they accept the same comp card, the sportsbook is wonderful, and they have a great selection of slots. Not so good: Even with all the lights on, the room remains dim. There was a sizable tear in the carpet near the bed, and the bath towels were almost as thin as paper towels. Our walk from the elevator to the room was unbearable, so many twists and turns before we would reach the room. Drink service at the slots was awful - at times it would be over a half hour before someone would stop by. It never used to be this way, which is upsetting. Lots of kids here, and the pool is small and crowded. So my final verdict is - unless you get a decent rate to stay here, there are much better choices.

Tried to check in at the airport--only one person ahead of us-- but was informed that they could only give out smoking rooms there (we had requested non-smoking) so we went directly to the hotel. Waited maybe 10 minutes but check-in was very quick. Requested upgrade, but no dice. Had a Park Avenue Deluxe room in the Chrysler Tower on the 31st floor with a spectacular view of a spotlight and piece of the building. Very disappointed, since I had requested a strip view. Room was comfortable and pretty typical for something with 2 queen size beds. Bathroom was spacious enough, with marble tile and a glass enclosed shower/tub, but would have preferred 2 sinks. Casino is smaller than most but high ceilings help with smokey air. Help was basically friendly with a few exceptions. $10 minimums at night, a few $5 BJ tables during the day, but they were 6 to 5. Ate breakfast at America Cafe and lunch at Gonzalez y Gonzalez--both very tasty. Also got a slice from the pizza place (forget the name) and highly recommend it. NYNY has a very hip, happenin' vibe and it shows in the nightlife. The Bar at Times Square is always hopping at night with the dueling pianos--lots of fun and singing along. The Big Apple Bar is more cushy and laid back, with couches and an R&B band. You can actually carry on a conversation in there. The rowdiest of all is Coyote Ugly, a southern style saloon where the waitresses (and female patrons) dance on the bar and pour free shots into drunk men's mouths. A truly wild time if that's what you're up for. If not, go for the dueling piano bar. Other fun things to consider in NYNY are the rollercoaster and the ESPNZone. Make sure and get your free $20 voucher at the ESPN website before you go--an INCREDIBLE value! All in all, we had a great time at NYNY. It was conveniently connected via walkway to the MGM Grand, which means quick (if you can call a 1-1/2 mile trek through the MGM casino quick) access to the monorail. Also connected via overhead walkway to Excalibur, which has a free tram to Luxor and Mandalay Bay, as well as a short jaunt to Monte Carlo on the other side, which has a free tram to Bellagio.

Never got a live person, only voice mail. I couldn't get anyone to call me back after two calls, so I left a message for the manager. Manager called me back wanting some clariying questions then never called me back as well. When I got to NYNY I called to see if I had a reservation --no one called me back. When I actually made it to the pool I found out that I did not have a reservation and wasn't even on the waiting list, but that I could check back the next day to see if any were available. At that point I said FORGET IT. RE: Room. Booked under a deal w/ the Players Club $69 (plus tax) a night (week night). Upgraded to next type of room for free (same square footage). In addition they did not charge us for the rollaway bed or refrigerator we requested. Was a little crowded but that was probably because we had three women, tons of luggage, two queen beds and a rollaway bed. So little hard to get around the room. BUT room was VERY quiet. Never heard anyone outside the room, or in the rooms next to us. Had no problem with maid service and bed was very comfy. CASINO: Ended up staying at this hotel because last time we were in Vegas ended up gambling all the time in this hotel. Soo I like the casino even tho' we didn't win anything. In fact we lost enough at NYNY that they comped one nights lodging. MUST JOIN PLAYERS CLUB. POOL: Seemed kinda small, but pool staff are great (save the cabana incident) and was able to get chairs easily when we got to the pool by 11:30. Cabanas didn't seem that great for $$-- they raised the price for Memorial Day weekend to $200! And they only had 6 for the whole pool! Couldn't get the waitress to take our food order to save our lives--even tho we asked the drink waitress TWICE to ask her to come by.

Then we went to the pool. What pool! The pool is smaller than the the two pools I have at my apartment complex. Tucked behind the hotels the pool is in the shade until about twelve noon in May. There are no seats and the pool is filthy. What a terrible way to attract those who enjoy the beautiful pools that line the Vegas strip hotels. On top of everything the gameplay at New York, New York is awful. What rude dealers and pit bosses. I was carded every table I went to and not just carded, I was given an attitude by every dealer. Just do you job and try to fake the fact that you hate doing it. It was an unpleasant experience that I just walked away from.

I am 24 yrs old and say that NY NY had the best party atmosphere, it was a young crowd mostly and was perfect if you like to party to the wee hours like myself. All the bars are pretty much centrally located plus they have two bars that are 24hrs, The Big Apple and The America. It was a great time to bar hop and then hit up Coyote Ugly's late night when the crowd was lively. There was a lot of walking but they had FREE trams one that goes from Excalibur to Mandalay Bay on one side and another one that went from the Monte Carlo to the Bellagio on the other side. They had a Monarail in the MGM that basically went down the other side of the strip but it cost money. All and All I had a wonderful time, if your young and never been definately check out NY NY and The Hard Rock, both are great party places.

But once we arrived at the New York, New York Hotel, I knew we were in safe hands. We received help with our luggage and only had to wait in line for 5 minutes to check in. The staff was really nice to us and everyone else. The rooms were very clean and luxurious. I think the whole privacy thing, where you can only go to certain areas with your key, is great. (I don't want some bum roaming the halls...) Our view was great, which overlooked the pool and if you looked up, you could see the roller coaster. (Our travel agent had to specifically ask for a good view. Do this or else you'll get crap.) The only bad thing about being near the roller coaster was that even at late hours of the night, they run the thing. So, say around 11pm you want to end the night early--you can't because some cart full of girls comes screaming by. Oh well, I guess you could take it. I did. Room service was great. There is internet on the tv, which I thought was cool, and the room was plenty big. If you never make it out of the hotel, I wouldn't blame you. There is so much to do just a few floors down from your room that you don't ever have to leave. First off, there's gambling, as usual, so that's a given. But the restaurant choices are endless. I recommend Nathan's hotdogs if you're on the go. It is upstairs by the gaming area. There is a small pizza joint on the main level and they are so quick and serve the most delicious food. There is one tavern that we always passed by, and everyone inside was always singing and having a great time. (Sober? No. Drunk? Yes.) The shopping is great too. You can visit the NYNY gift shop and they price everything reasonably. I recommend the \"I heart NYNY\" shirts--the ladies will love them! The pool was also great. They serve towels to everyone just as if they were royalty. Also, Rita Rudner is featured at the hotel, and it looked like a good show. Overall, NYNY hotel is one great place. It's not just some smokey joint on the strip. It's a very lively, entertaining, and just plain fun place to stay. Please go here because you'll have many great memories.

At one point, my room key became de-magnetized and would not work, but a gentleman at the front desk was very helpful and friendly and made a new key for me right away. Our group ate at two different places (Il Fornaio for breakfast and in a Village Eateries deli for lunch). Both restaurants provided tasty food at reasonable prices. The hotel is located on the southern end of the Strip (near MGM Grand, Excalibur and the Luxor), but everything on the Strip is so close together I never felt like we were too far from anything. We had dinner at the Paris (5-10 minute walk), and saw the Blue Man Group at the Luxor (10 minute walk). We also dined in the Venetian (15 minute walk).

The rooms were not too small as others have said and I loved the decor--very modern with some added touches like lights that are dim when you first put them on and grow brighter over approx. 5 minutes. It was nice when people in your room come and go at different times of the night/morning.

The high ceilings, sidewalks, water streams, corner stores make you feel less confined. The only negatives--the elevator room key security system is odd. Other hotels only require you to show your room key to security to board the elevators. This hotel makes you put your key in a slot which was somewhat tempermental and didn't always connect before you and the other people on the elevator were able to press their floors.

We were in town for the Jimmy Buffett show at the MGM Grand Garden. As with our prior visit, we booked the cheapest room (Skyline) and because of the timing of when we showed up, we were upgraded to a Park Avenue room. Although we were on a low floor (room 716 in New Yorker Tower) facing the roller coaster, we never heard any noise during typical sleeping hours and actually enjoyed the view of the Tropicana and Excalibur. The Park Avenue rooms are very nice as they have been recently redone. The in room safe is especially convenient for storing valuables. One another plus of NY NY is that you can check in for both it and the MGM Grand at the airport. We like NY NY for weekend trips as it is very convenient to/from the airport (no dealing with Strip traffic) and features a very lively environment. The Times Square bar features great dueling piano players, playing classic rock songs while the crowd sings along. Plus, it is very convenient to the MGM Grand, which has a plethora of restaurants and hosts the Strip's southern-most monorail stop. Speaking of the monorail, this was our first trip where it has been fully functional. It REALLY opens up the Strip for easy transit. We bought the 24 hour pass for $10/person and made our way all the way down to the Sahara and back, stopping at every stop along the way. After the concert Saturday night, we jumped back on the monorail and within 10 minutes were at Harrah's, where they now host a $9.99 late night buffett. On Sunday morning, we checked out the Dishes buffett (new) in Treasure Island. This buffett is similar to Cravings at the Mirage, but offers slightly different dishses (i.e. extensive barbeque section). Dishes also offers a made to order salad and pasta stations that I really liked. In summary, another great Vegas trip and another great stay at NY NY.

We knew a lot going in because we stayed at Luxor last year and spent a lot of time hanging out at NY NY. We booked early (in late fall) for our 5 day trip on March 30th. We booked the Irresistable Package. That included a Park Ave Deluxe room upgrade, 2 for 1 breakfast at the Italian restaurant, 2 fitness center passes, and 2 free roller coaster rides. The room decor was very nice! Real modern and New Yorkie. Nice woods, metals, marble bathroom floors and counters, flat screen TV, etc. We ended up on the 33rd floor with strip view (of Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay). As always we love the casino in Central Park, you have to convince yourself that you're INSIDE. With all the cafes and restaurants - the food possiblities seem endless. Now for the downside. Our room was right next to the elevators. Though not loud, we could still hear them. The elevators were horrible. You have ride a certain one to get to the high floors. To push the button for your floor, you HAVE to swipe your room card - which worked maybe 10% of the time. So you end up going to a few different floors until someone gets on and their card works (most people's cards didn't work either). Maybe it was just the 33rd floor, but there was a constant beeping sound outside our room somewhere - almost like a whine. We searched for the source, but couldn't find it. In fact everywhere we went on our floor to look, we could still hear it - very odd! My theory is that maybe it was a washer or dryer with a squeaky drum, but it went on 24 hrs a day. We couldn't switch rooms cause the hotel was full. For the most part the hotel stay was great. Afterall, how much are you really in the room? When you are, it's just to sleep.

I booked the \"Irresistable Package\" online and didn't get any of my \"free perk certificates\" when I checked in at the airport (check in there if you can). I had to go to the front desk the next morning and ask for all of my free coupons. We did the roller coaster, good, not great but it was free with the package. Used the spa/gym, once again, good not great and NO WAY IN H*LL I would pay $20 a day if I didn't have the passes for free ($25 for non-hotel guests, ouch!). Gym is small but backroom showers were some of the best I've ever used. Pool is good, not great, lounge chairs fill up by about 1030, get there early if you can. Casino is good, not great, kind of small but the blackjack tables were very kind to me, slots weren't. Restaurants are good, not great (see a pattern here...?) and of course, over priced like everything else in Vegas. Bar at Times Square is cool but $20 for two mixed drinks, ouch again. Get to Coyote Ugly by 8pm if you don't want to wait in line (or pay a cover). Upgraded Park Ave \"Deluxe Room\" seemed like a normal room to me, I'd hate to have a regular room. No complaints with the room, well above Motel 6 but not close to a Ritz-Carlton, just nothing special. Oh by the way, I requested a top or high floor with a view when I called to confirm the reservation and got an 11th floor room with a view of the pool/parking garage. Room # was 1101 which means it is 700' from the elevator (furthest one away). Request a room number between 30 and 70 if you don't want to walk too far to the elevator. Go online and study the layout of the bottom two floors so you don't walk around lost your first two days like everyone else. I am dead serious when I say you should study the layout of the hotel for at least an hour before you arrive, nothing is well marked. Went to see the \"Zumanity\" show in the theatre, I've never been to a show like that and am not considered a \"theatre\" kind of guy but it was actually worth the $85 per ticket. If you are going to see it, there is nudity and profanity, you have to be 18 to get in and of an open mind or you won't like it. Book your tickets as far out as possible (I think you can do it via there website or call their box office) and spend as much as you can afford, you'll be glad you did.

The exterior of this hotel was probably one of the most beautifully designed hotel. We've never been to NYNY, this hotel gave us a taste of what it might look like. The Park Avenue Deluxe room did seem a little small, but very comfortable. Our bed was nice a firm. Pillows very fluffy. Bathroom very nicely decorated, bigger than the average hotel bathroom. The shower had a nice gentle all-over stream to it, I found it relaxing. The room had self-control heater and air conditioner. The TV had about 25-30 channels with WebTV, PPV, and view your room bill. The staff through out the hotel was very nice and accomodating. PUBS AT NYNY: At Coyote Ugly, it is a very small bar - standing room only! No tables or chairs to sit to casually enjoy the atmosphere. In my experience there, I got tired of standing and found my energy drain, we just left, as other customers did. The Big Apple, very nice for casual drinking. However, the bar staff didn't seem to personal or in the mood to work, they didn't smile or chit-chat. The bar has a stage performance each night, we enjoyed that. The Timesquare! A very entertaining crowd-pleasing bar. We enjoyed the duelling pianos. The performers bring the crowd in to sing, yell, participate, all in playing your favourite tunes for a price. Very very enjoyable. Arrive early to grab a table. ROLLERCOASTER: My husband went on this rollercoaster, he found it very uncomfortable and a rough ride, he found his head hit the side pads a lot. This rollercoaster is rated in the top-10 of USA, my husband strongly disagreed, as he is a rollercoaster ride enthusiast. NATHANS HOTDOGS: a part of our free coupons...blahhh! The taste of these famous NYNY hotdogs were very very bland. If these are really NYNY and USA's favourite hotdogs, OMG! Please come to Canada and try our juicy-meaty hotdogs. RITA RUDNER SHOW: OMG! Rita was absolutely hilarious! She had my husband and I laughing from beginning to end! A must see show, while you are in LV. Our tummies were sore the next day from all the hard laughing! CASINO: We didn't gamble that much, we might have spent $20 in slots and $40 in BJ. We played mainly the .05 cent slots, lost what we put in instantly. A staff member later shared that the .05 are the biggest revenue earners of all the casino games, I can see that being true. HOTEL SURROUNDINGS: NYNY is connected, by way of pedestrian bridges to 3 other hotels. MGM, Tropicanna, and I forgot the other one. MGM is a very well decorated hotel, it offered more shopping and fast-food restuarants. You can connect to the monorail at MGM, to hit the other end of the strip. Across the street from NYNY is a Denny's restuarant, M&M store, Coke Cola store, a kid-amusement arcade park. Would we stay there again?

Check-in at the airport was fast and easy. We received a 28th floor non-smoking, 2 queen room in the Chrysler tower. Getting to the room from the main entrance was kinda a hassle because our elevators were on the opposite side of the casino from the front near the Zumanity entrance, but that also meant that we had a side exit right by our elevators that was really convenient when you wanted to walk to the other casinos. You just can't catch a shuttle or a taxi there or easily get to the pedestrian bridge to MGM. Also, it didn't seem like any of the rooms were that far away from the elevator because each tower had it's own. The elevators were also very fast. The layout of the NYNY did seem to be even more confusing than the average Las Vegas casino and was kinda cramped and not well marked. The room itself was on the smallish side but nice and clean. There was none of that smoky smell you sometimes get even in non-smoking rooms. We never once heard the roller coaster that a lot of people are complaining about. We did, however, hear our neighbors cell phone conversation loud and clear because the walls are very thin. Oddly enough, we only ever heard him when he was on his cell, so maybe he just talks excessively loudly. The airconditioner worked, but it seemed like it made the side of the room that it was on cold while the other side remained stuffy so it was hard to settle on a setting that everyone would like. The armoire was fairly small and there was no other place to put your clothes. The bathroom was marble-tiled with a shower/tub with a sliding door and was very clean though also small. Unfortunately, the shower pressure left much to be desired. The maid service seemed good, though I was annoyed when she woke me up at 9am after partying all night to see if she could clean the room. I guess I should have used a Do Not Disturb sign. Also, if you want your sheets changed you have to make sure to leave that card on the bed otherwise they'll just make the bed. The rest of the hotel was adequate. My friend really enjoyed the spa and her massage. The quick service food places were just passable, but I did enjoy the Il Fornaio breakfast.

Instead of spending most of our time in the NYNY, we ending up going to some other casinos to eat or club. The location of NYNY was really good for that.

(whole other review), but then began receiving very inticing emails from NYNY. So I figured the $25 cancellation fee would be worth it, so I decided to take advantage of the specials.. There were two internet only special (one sent in an email, and an other on the webstie), when I clicked on the link in the email- the booking engine was not calculating the refrenced special,.. ) so I decided to use the special on the website itself.. it referenced a $79 Per night charge (including free upgrade of your room) as well daily passes and other 'bonuses'. The calender dates was the 'portal' into the special, and when I clicked on my check in date, it provided room choices.. all the same price.. (can I pick any one at this point???) and the price was $5.00 more .. (taxes???) - and my confirmation made no reference to the bonuses.. I had to call to confirm I had actually gotten this special... I called and they couldn't explain the difference in price, just saying the package may not have been available. but they did ensure I got the correct room (to reflect the 'upgrade') I checked in at the airport.. here's a hint.. check in first then go get you luggage.. it's quick and easy.. so convienent. It is down on the luggage claim area.. all the way to the right. The room was nice.. really nothing to complain about. We were on the 34th floor, so the roller coaster was no issue, but the helicopters 'buzzing' the Statue of Liberty were a bit distracting. We had a great view- looked down on the statue. I had to go to the check in desk to get my passes. The B1G1F breakfast was still expensive... too fancy for a breakfast.. I didn't get to ride the roller coaster, but the passes are good til the end of next year.. so next time.. The elevator, required you to swipe your card to pick a floor. Both my husband and my's room key wasn't too effective at this. There was time.. the elevator actually started to ascend stopped at 30- someone got on, and then we all rode down to the lobby together.. pretty frustrating. The casino was tight.. didn't win at all on the slots. Had better luck elsewhere. Went across the street - to see LaFemme @ MGM Grand- be sure to tell them you are staying at NYNY if you are paying for the tickets. you get $10 off. This show was okay.. a little 'spacey' for me.. The opening scene of Rockette-like dancers nearly naked.. not just topless, marching with large bearskin (think Castle Guards) and boots.. kind of 'artsy'. but it is the Art of Nudity Excellent chorography.. The premise is this is an exact replica fo the Crazy Horse in France (then why isn't this show at the Paris?) .. Saw We Will Rock You @ the Paris- OUTSTANDING.. if you are from the generation that grew up on Queen... (graduating high school in the mid-to late 80's) You absolutely must see this show.. it was worth every cent. I live in NY and have never left a Broadway show saying \"I wanna see that again!\". I will see this again but next time I have to sit in the back row- so I can dance.. I just wanted to dance and sing.. it was so amazing.. really. Sat in the Killer Queen section.. excelletn.

I didn't know where to find the check-in desk so I asked one of the casino floor walkers and she very kindly directed me where to find it. The woman working at the front desk was ULTRA helpful, very sweet and courteous. She gave me all kinds of information and useful tips, ect. She even gave me a few extra goodies to go with the package I purchased online! Thank you, thank you! The room was totally wonderful! Very contemporary and it had a great view. The bathroom was very swanky and they gave you lotion, shampoo, conditioner and mouthwash! Handy dandy, indeed! The view was spectacular as well! Right across from the MGM grand and the strip was almost fully visable. The room was quiet and just GREAT! Don't worry too much about the noise from the rollercoaster (which is quite a ride!!!) -- unless you go to sleep at 6:00 pm then it MIGHT be a problem. There were food options a plenty and the wait staff at all of them were prompt and pleasant. The Cirque Du Soleil show was great! The music was out of this world and the acts were hot and steamy! (To make it even better, I won enough money to get the most expensive seat with ONE spin on a $.50 Wheel of Fortune slot machine! Also, the cashiers in the casino were always busy but each time I went to cash in my winnings (I won almost $400 in one day) they did it with a smile, wished me luck and told me to have a good day). The show rocked the house! I would see it again and again. If you ask for a room far from the elevator, it will be quite far from the elevator! I requested one of these rooms and next time I will not do that. It was a fairly good hike each time. My only complaint is about the FOUR DOLLAR room service delivery fee. The prices on the menu were quite high without it! But the pizza I ordered was excellent and it lasted me almost three whole days. One other small complaint -- I went two days without having my room cleaned. I did stay in my room in the morning, until about 9:30 and when I got back at almost 5, my room was still not cleaned. I don't mind a whole lot, because they have 2,024 rooms to clean but it was less service than I'd expected. In all the stay was a 9.8/10.

The rate I got on the internet (directly on the hotel website) was fabulous at $79/nt which included several bonuses (a free ride on the roller coaster, spa passes, one room upgrade and 2 for 1 meals). When we checked in the front desk person was nice and cordial but when they warn you that the room may be a little far from the elevator listen to them! It was at least a two and a half minute walk from the elevator to our room! At the end of the day that's the last thing my feet needed!!! The room was okay (Park Avenue deluxe). Nothing special-and small. Last year we stayed in the Aladin where the rooms were big enough to be called suites! Also, the room is very dark (dark decor). Houskeeping was good-the housekeeping manager was a lovely woman that was very nice about getting me extra soaps (that smelled great)...etc. (shout out to her!) Now on to the pool...the pool area isn't very large but more than that it's very noisy with loud music and NOT really relaxing. The roller coaster goes right nearby and you CONSTANTLY hear the roller coaster and people screaming on it. Other than that I didn't hear the roller coaster from our room as other ppl complained about but it was annoying at the pool area. The location of the hotel is so-so. It's a little further down the strip (across from the MGM) and it's a little bit of a walk if you're walking say to the Venetian or the Bellagio. All in all, there were positive parts to the hotel-the valets were helpful and nice. They have a great system where they scan your car in and you just scan your ticket when you need your car to be brought up. It's up in mere minutes (as opposed to other hotels where you can wait for 20+ minutes to get your car); also, if you are taking a day trip to any of the parks or Grand Canyon the valet has a printed paper with directions to most of these places (just remember to ask them for it!) Being from New York we really got a kick out of the different parts of New York portrayed. And I think that kids would really like this hotel. All in all, I can't complain with the great rate we got but I wouldn't stay here again as there are much nicer and less crowded/noisier hotels on the strip.

The room was really nice. It had modern decor with marble bath room and entry way. The king size bed was comfortable and so was the pollows (which you got extra in the closet). I see what they say about the lighting but they are committed to saving energy and so they gradually get brighter the longer you leave them on. I personally think that's neat. The vanity could have been a bit larger to store all your toiletries. There was enough closet space and drawer space for all our clothes and shoes. Although we didn't watch TV hardly the channels available were not that great. It could have had MTV, HBO, or something like that. The view was of the north end of the strip (Excalibur, Luxor, and Mandalay Bay). You could barely hear the roller coaster. When we did sleep it was like babies. Dinner choices were great. We ate at Gallager's steak house. I had the fillet mingon and my husband had the prime rib. He said it was the best he's had. I though mine was excellent. We had steaks and split a large side of lenaise potatoes and a desert and our bill came to $86. It was WELL worth it. The other choices for dinner looked good although we didn't eat there. There is an Italian place and a Mexican place. Informal choices were pizza, hot dogs, hamburgers, and the Fulton Fish Fry had excellent fish and chips (yum).

I would never, ever stay there again and would highly remcommend that you not waste your money. The desk clerk was so disinterested and bored it was like pulling teeth to get any information out of her. She asked if I would like to keep a credit card open for charges to the room and I said no as we generally pay cash for everything-however they had our credit card information as we did charge the room to the card. She falied to inform me that without the imprint of the card the PHONE WOULD NOT DIAL OUT NOR WOULD THE TV WORK. (Cheap, cheap, cheap). We were there on business as well as pleasure and after several failed attempts to connect my laptop I called the front desk to report my phone was unable to dial out. A recording answered the front desk phone and I was kept on hold for over 15 minutes. The front desk clerk was also short and curt. I also reported that our air conditioner seemed to be not working. Our travel alarm has a thermometer on it and the room never went below 84 degrees the entire three days we were there. He informed me that was the correct temperature. We were quite uncomfortable at times-especially at night. The room itself was dirty. The trash had not been emptied when we arrived and there was food and drinks left in the ice maker from the previous guests. (There is an ice maker under the counter in the bathroom. It opens inches away from the side of the toilet. You must put the ice bucket or glass right up next to the toilet in order to fill it with ice...most unappealing.) Our bed had a hole in the sheet the size of a quarter. When I attempted to place the card on the bed asking for new sheets I had to pry it off the nightstand, as it was stuck there by some goo that originated heaven knows where. We stayed in a Broadway Suite. The size of the room was fine but overall, our stay there was most unpleasant. We go to Vegas at least twice a year and we have never been unhappy with any of our accomodations. We always stay on the strip but none of our favorite places were available when I was trying to make reservations. Everyone was sold out but we had tickets for a concert.

Had thought of going to the Nugget for about 300 dollars less but boy I am glad I picked NYNY. The Nugget is 4 to 5 miles down the road from the middle of the strip & there is no way you would walk it in 90 degree heat plus saved on bus/taxis. Checked in at Airport to avoid possible queues. Finding correct room was a slight problem as you have to walk through casino to get to the lifts. My only complaint is that the lighting in the room was not adequate but this was not enough to give 4 instead of 5 star rating. The maid who cleaned the spotless room+bathroom (from the Phillipines) was a real lady. I gave tip+kiss like a real Irishman would. Because of the heat I only had 1 meal a day & lost 10 to 12 pounds in 7 days. Drank a lot of water - go to Excalibur for breakfast but be aware that trying to find your way out from Excalibur to NYNY is very difficult even though it is next door - there are no signs to it. If you are going to gamble my advice is DO NOT. I do gamble here in Ireland but soon found out the truth here in VegasThe odds are stacked MASSIVELY in favour of the house. Only saw one guy winning anything of consequence. Go to shows+hotels instead. Best Shows I saw were Mamma Mia(went x2), Tom Jones, Lord of the Dance & Rat Pack Tribute - worst value were Mystere & Bottoms Up. You have not lived until you go to Vegas.

I had read all of the reviews on trip advisor before coming and can say I was very nervous! Let me first say that we arrived on a Sunday and stayed 4 nights. It may make a difference if you stay during the week. When we arrived at the casino we were happy to see there were few people in the check in line. We waited not even 5 minutes. One thing I was worried about was our room we reserved. I had read one review that they give you first available and do not honor your reservation. This proved to be true! We had reserved a skyline king. We were with a group of people and all wanted to be on the same floor. We did not end up with a king bed but two doubles. This was ok though because we got a broadway deluxe room for the same price as the smaller skyline rooms. I did not complain because we were on the same floor as our friends. The roller coaster was right outside our window but I never heard it. It only runs to 11pm at night. If you are in Vegas and you are in your room before 11pm your missing the parties before they even begin! Sure they do not have coffee pots in the rooms but there are about four different places to get coffee in the morning. If you go to Vegas you should expect to pay for everything! The pool was smaller but very nice. We were there every day. It opens at 10 am but does not get full sun until around 12 noon. You can rent a cabana for $100.00 a day. Before you say how expensive that is let me tell you what is included! The cabana has a changing room, tv, refrigerator (stocked with juices, pop, ice water), fruit basket (enough fruit for 12 people), all the chips, pretzels you want, ice bucket, towels, lounge chairs and rafts for the pool. We had four couples, everyone had a chair. It cost us $25 per couple. The rafts alone were $7.50 by them self. I think it was worth it for the money you would have spent on food and pop. We ate at Gallagers Steak house. It is very much worth it for the money you spend there. It was they best prime rib I have ever had! The piano bar is way to small but very entertaining. If you plan on going arrive a couple hours ahead to get a seat. The slots were tight but aren't they everywhere? The casino is smaller than average but very cool with outside atmosphere feel. We had great dealers and everyone in our group did well. We did not have to wait to sit at a table at any time. Remember we were there during the week. We all got to sit and play together also. ( 4 girls ) The drink service was outstanding! Did not wait too long on drinks. I think they cater more to the tables then the slots. You do get better service when you tip. I tip I learned was that you can order doubles if you get mixed drinks. I have been to Vegas many times and this was the first time I did not want to leave our hotel and casino.

Too many people. Every time a machine would have a \"problem\" and the light would come on, it would take forever for the attendant to come. Could not even think about getting into the bars. Did make it into coyote ugly which was a total joke. Absolutely nothing like the movie. No where to even sit. $10 cover charge to see some sleezy girls dancing on the bar. It was like a big room where they herded cattle into. The coyote ugly frozen drink bar outside of the actual bar itself was wonderful. Also the walkways going over the roads to the other hotels were VERY convenient. Restaurant variety had a lot to be desired. We ended up eating at the Monticarlo buffet every day. Very yummy! Entertainment at their back bars was satisfactory, but I would highly recommend the Aladdin for bar entertainment. Pool area was too small and shaded. I did write a letter to the management about my likes/dislikes and heard absolutely nothing back. Oh and also got a smoking room instead of non-smoking which I've heard happens a lot there.

Lack of a bar around the pool though.Good location, breakfast Ok, but other places better. Did quick checkout by dropping room key and card into box, glad we did as queue to check out was enormous. Overall may stay there again but would definitely go back to Vegas- FANTASTIC!!", "Date": "February 20, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHoneymoon in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1650057", "Content": "We stayed here last April at the start of our Honeymoon. After a 27 hour journey actually to reach the hotel we arrived at 9pm to find a queue to check in. They said they would \"upgrade\" our room because it was our honeymoon (which had been pre arranged anyway by our travel agent!) The room we were given was HUGE but had a view of the parking lot and the a/c vents! As we were staying for a week we immediatly called the front desk for another room. They told us nothing was available for 4 hours. We just couldn't wait that long to sleep and went to bed. The next morning at about 5am we called them again requesting a room transfer they advised us to contact them after 4pm. I was not prepared to wait and went straight to the desk to ask for a room transfer. After a bit of humming and hawing the receptionist managed to get us a room on the 32nd floor which it has to be said was a fantastic alternative lokking right onto the strip. The rollercoaster (The Manhattan Express REALLY isn't a worry at all!) We did read reviews of trouble at the check in and our experience held this to be true. The rest of the stay was largely enjoyable. The walk with your cases at 9pm through a crowded noisey casino is a challenge! The pool is lovely but noisey because of the Roller coaster. The proximity to the other hotels around is great. We were a little dissapointed in the breakfast buffet served in the chinese restaurant, the breakfast at MGM was better.", "Date": "February 15, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cadorable hotel-great food 1-18-04 to 1-22-04\u201d", "Author": "sandrita", "ReviewID": "UR1564122", "Content": "This was our first trip to Vegas. This hotel was so attractive. Felt like we were on a Disney themed property. Ck.- in was easy. Walk to elevator was long, but if you follow the outline on floor (like a sidewalk), you will not get lost. We had spacious jacuzzi suite and was done up in art deco style...not fancy but nice and very comfortable bed. No noise at all between walls. Bathroom was all marble in black, beige and white. Roller coaster outside was not bothersome at all. We loved the atmosphere at this hotel. Casino on ground floor has 3 story ceilings and you feel like you are in Central Park, with glittering trees all around you...very little smoke and not claustrophobic at all. Noise factor was very low too. Restaurant food was very good. It was hard to decide where to eat. We saw the Zumanity Show one night and it was just fantastic. I liked the fact that you could step outside and take sky bridge over to MGM Hotel very easily. We ate buffet breakfast over there, since NYNY does not have a buffet. I think NYNY is a great hotel for younger people...has great night life and has great urban feel. Seniors will find lobby confusing when tryting to get to elevators and rooms. It can be a long walk from your elevator to your room in many cases. Other than that, I would recommend it to any one.

The rooms we had were large and very clean. We had 8 guys down for the trip and they gave us two rooms which conected and two cots. The layout of the place can be a bit confusing and if you play poker this is not the hotel to do it at (they have only 3 card) - but no matter what everyone says, this hotel is on the strip (the front entrance is on a side street but the side entrance is on the strip and alows you to take in the sites and gamble everywhere. Not a very young crowd, but I think the walls were well insulated b/c we did not get a single complaint and there was some very loud mornings coming home. The food downstairs was a overpriced (but so is everything else in Vegas) and the lady at the pizza shop wouldnt sell us a pie at 3:02am b/c they stoped selling them at 3am - pretty silly but oh well. Definately take a walk down to the Belagio and take in the water show and then the buffet. Also fun, there is a Country Western bar in a hotel off the strip somewhere that has an electronic bull you can ride - if its your thing this place can be really fun - also they have a contest for women to ride the bull in their underwear - what a town. Enjoy, be careful crossong the streets and dont plan on staying for more than 3 days - it gets old and tiring.

However, we do expect that when we present a casino with an aggregate sum in excess of $7500 of combined wagering in blackjack, craps, and slot play over the course of 3\u00bd days, the casino should be capable of accurately identifying and tracking our betting history, and should assume a proactive approach in acknowledging and rewarding its customers in exchange for a near-exclusive opportunity at winning their wagers.Although 80% of our gambling time was spent on table games, it appears as though the New York-New York had difficulty tracking our play. After three days of play, when we finally asked if it was possible to receive a comp for breakfast, we were told all comps were handled by the Players Club booth.The reception to our request at the Players Club booth was nothing less than insulting. Although we did ultimately receive an approximate $65 credit on our room bill, we were made to feel as though we were the groveling poor begging for alms we didnt deserve. The representatives conduct was arrogant and reprehensible. When we first asked if it was possible to receive a comp for our play, he asked condescendingly, Well, what did you have in mind? My wife looked at me and innocently asked, What are our options? Upon hearing her simple question, he theatrically rolled his eyes, threw his hands in the air, and proclaimed, Lady, a comp is a comp! What do you want? I wish I were exaggerating, but sadly I am not.So disenfranchised were we with the whole New York-New York experience that our last two days were spent paying taxi fare to conduct the remainder of our gambling downtown.I will close by saying that after only approximately 5 hours of blackjack play at a downtown casino my wife and I were graciously rewarded with free dinner passes, and near the end of our second day we were offered free lodging in the event we choose to stay there on our next tripand all of this provided without us needing to ask.The New York-New York is a nice Theme Hotel/Casino to visit, but do yourself a favor and stay/gamble somewhere else.", "Date": "December 6, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, MB", "Title": "\u201cA Great Stay!!\u201d", "Author": "bigeasy41", "ReviewID": "UR1505353", "Content": "We stayed at the NYNY for the first time a few weeks ago.

Six hours later when we returned we still had not got one and the nasty one was still there causing our whole room to smell awful. They switched us rooms and gave us another fridge which did not work at all. This rooms shower was broke, as were the phones unless you put it on speaker. The sheets were stained and we also found reeses wrappers in the bed that night when neither of us had eaten reeses. THe mini bar had someone elses old shrimp cocktail and leftovers in it. We did not even bother to complain about this stuff because everytime we tried to say something about anything they were rude and took at least an hour to get anything done. Our room temp alternated between insanely hot to insanely cold, back and forth, even though we kept it on fifty. Awful place.

This does not include the cost of parking (hotel garage $32) and any other incidentals. Watch out for the $4.00 bottle of water. It is on a pressure plate. One move of the bottle and you are billed. Thankfully we were tipped off about this from another reviewer and we did not have an issue. The hotel is within walking distance to about everything downtown. We were in town for the Big Ten tournament. It was about a 10 minute walk to Bankers life field house which was great. This hotel is home base for Michigan State fans it seems although other some other fans were present. Overall the hotel seemed better than the last time I stayed here. The room we had was in nice condition and for the two of us plenty big. Bathroom is very small, room for one person at a time. Overall the front desk staff was good. The gentleman that helped check us in seemed a little burned out. All other requests during our stay were granted and timely. Pool is subpar for this class of hotel . Very small, the times we visited the kids using it seemed to enjoy it none the less. The main complaint I have with this hotel is the parking. You must valet your car at this hotel and in order to get your car you must wait on valet to bring it up. During busy times plan on waiting a good 15 \u2013 30 minutes to get your car. Please plan accordingly. The nice thing is you should not need your car if your activities are all downtown due to the nice downtown location of the hotel. This is really more the norm for most if not all downtown hotels. Plenty of options exist in the area if you need other parking. In summary if I would have had to pay more for this hotel my review may have been more critical. Since the price was so fair I give this hotel a 4 star for my stay.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location in Indianapolis\u201d", "Author": "Bill W", "ReviewID": "UR126004657", "Content": "This Westin Hotel is in the center of fine restaurants, the convention center and Lucas Field.

I am a seasoned traveler. I stayed in this hotel a few weeks ago and hoped the bad experience might soften before I wrote the review. But whenever I think of that hotel, I think about my lovely relaxing get away from New York, as ruined by this experience. I went the weekend AFTER the SuperBowl, so you would think Westin property a few blocks from the stadium would have it's act together. Also the fact that this is a HUGE convention hotel. OK, convention hotels are not always the swankiest, but usually very service oriented. This one gets zero circles for service. First I had a rental car. When I pulled up at about 11 p.m., there was no valet/bellman/doorman who came out. I waited awhile and even honked my horn. It was a snowy night and I was nursing a broken ankle. After about 10 minutes, I had no choice but to lock up the care and hobble in. They said they only had one bellman on duty and he was helping someone else. One guy at the front desk also helping someone else. I was given a room with a burned out light in the bathroom. So I called downstairs. They couldn't tell me when maintainence would come up, so I asked if I could just change rooms, since I hadn't even unzipped my suitcase. So it took a while, but they come up with a key for a new room and floor. It was fine. As I started unpacking, I heard a lot of noise in the hallway. I waited about 15 minutes and it seemed to grow more. It was now midnight. I opened the door and I saw kids sitting in the hallway and drinking...show no signs of leaving. I said how much longer are you going to be out there, and they just looked at me. I called downstairs and asked if they could intervene. They said, Well a fraternity has booked the hotel, so there is not much we can do. I said, OK, do you have any floors without a fraternity party going on? They said they would move me. So I waited. and waited. I called down and they said the bellman was on his way. He never came after about 15 minutes. Back downstairs and the poor front desk guy, still alone, helping others. At this point, I am distraught. Bad ankle, tired from a long flight, and hungry. He put me in a room he said \"where the pilots and flight attendants stay.\" The poor alone bellman tries to help me move. He was very sweet, but I said, it seems only three people are working tonight, you, the front desk, and the guy on the phone. And he said, pretty much. I couldn't believe it...the hotel is huge and they were nearly booked as it was the weekend before Valentine's Day. I got to the room, it was fine, no view, but it was quiet. I unpacked and called room service, nearly 1 a.m. now (wasted all this time getting to a decent, quiet room). They only had a few items to offer...nothing hot. And really cheap wines (well, I could see I am not at the W!). I asked how long it would take and they said 45 minutes. So it would be nearing 2 a.m.. It was near 0 outside, so they sent me to the attached restaurant, which was nice enough,and they were closing up, but took pity on me and had some bar food which was hot which I carried up to my room (very glamorous!) I then went to take a shower and the \"heavenly shower heads\"...only one worked so it was not so heavenly. The bathroom was smaller than most in New York and the lighting was very dim. The towels were super thin (definitely not heavenly), and there were only one bath towel! Then went to sleep in the so-called heavenly beds, which felt just like any old hotel bed. Nothing special about the linens either. The next morning, I went to use the phone by the bed, and it did not work. Had to get up and go over to the desk. I called down to ask for a manager to share my experience and see if I could get these items fixed while I went out for the day. They said they don't have a manager until 1. I said ok, can I leave a message for him? I was doubtful that they took the message, I went to the front desk on my way out (there is no concierge at this hotel)....again waiting in line, although there were now 2 people at the front desk. I told my person a little bit of my story, and she was very rude. I left my number again with her for the manager to call me on my mobile So, the entire day, no one called me. I got back to the room thinking there was a message, and again,none. The shower was not fixed, nor was the phone. The sheets were not changed. Even though I put the little card on the bed that said \"change the sheets.\" When I left the hotel, I will say there were a few more people at the bell/valet stand than at night. But when I stop to ask them for the best directions to the location (only about 7 miles!), it was if I had asked them how to get to Memphis. They totally could not give me directions...didn't seem to know the streets at all. Very odd. They asked if I wanted to talk to a manager, and I just laughed and left, using my Google map on my cell phone...difficult to use as the roads were slick. When I returned late at night, I experienced the same problem with no bellman/valet. Had to turn the car off and come in. Same thing at the front desk...one lone guy. Well only one more night of this. When I checked out I stopped by the front desk just to be sure they had my entire bill, including valet (which incidentally they did not as I was charged for that a few days later). Again a very cold staff at the reception desk. This is not the Indy I remembered. I finally said, are you interested in my Westin experience at your hotel? The woman seemed a little shocked. She asked if I wanted to speak with a manager. I said yes, but it would have been nice to have someone to talk to DURING my stay, not as I am checking out. I left my cell phone number if they were interested in my experience. I will tell all who read this review to beware of this hotel. It really gave me a poor view of downtown Indianapolis after all the hype. As far as staying in a Westin...never. To all who may be forced to stay here, just know this is a very old property with some renovation in public areas. The rooms are clean enough, but very dated. Bathroom is so dimly lit, you need to put on your makeup in the bedroom (so bring some extensionn cords).

I am an SPG Gold Member and I've had much better experiences at hotels such as Holiday Inn Express and Hampton Inn, even Comfort Inn. We will definitely return to Indy but we've stayed at the Omni in the past and will likely return there or to one of the other many hotels in the downtown Circle Center area. When we pulled up to the valet, we were not greeted. We removed the luggage ourselves, when the valet finally arrived. He took our key, did not give us a ticket, and then disappeared, and we spend 10 minutes looking for him while bringing our luggage in ourselves. I had booked a club room suite. I was told we'd get a suite and we'd have club access, but we would not be on the club floor. Our keycards did not work and I had to go back down to the front desk to tell the person who checked us in (who was the manager) that we needed new keys. My wife forgot something in the car - 30 MINUTES for them to bring it up to retrieve something. They did remove the valet charge for both nights. The club room is a joke, especially at night. First, when we entered on Friday night, the stench of bad food and trash was so bad we almost had to leave right away. There was a pathetic display of Townhouse crackers and cheese (crackers still in the carton) and veggies, and apples with bad brown spots on the side. The smell was likely coming from the frozen dumplings they had heated up. After I mentioned the smell, the next night, it was gone, but the food was no better. Breakfast was somewhat better, with eggs, potatoes, sausage and oatmeal, as well as cereals, bagels, etc. If you stay here, you'll do as I did and laugh out loud when you realize your reservation uses the phrase \"contemporary decor\" and then you look at the rooms. The rooms, elevators, and hallways are in need of a major renovation. The decor of the room and hallways is what I'd expect out of an unrenovated Holiday Inn, not out of a Westin, with stains on the sofa, unfinished molding on the ceiling, chipped paint, dents in the elevators, etc. In addition, our room had a sofabed. They gave us one very old-school green wool blanket for it. I asked for an extra comforter and they said \"we don't usually keep extras.\" Really? You have the exact number of comforters for the exact number of beds? What happens in an emergency, such as a spill, etc? Next, a big draw to the hotels in Circle Center is that they are all connected by Skywalk to the mall and to each other, as well as restaurants, etc. This weekend, the Skywalk was closed. However, if you looked on the website beforehand, and clicked on \"special conditions exist at this hotel,\" there is no warning about this. I realize this is out of the hotel's control, but if you are going to have a \"special conditions\" section, use it. All in all, this was not a good experience and I'd recommend this hotel get its act together, because there is a lot of competition in the area and despite having SPG Gold status, I'd stay anywhere but here when returning to Indianapolis. There even seemed to be something about the heavenly bed that wasn't that heavenly - maybe it was just that the rest of the hotel was so disappointing. As an aside, we HIGHLY recommend the Indianapolis Children's Museum. You could spend all day there with your kids and they will not get bored.

Check-in was relatively fast at the counter. concierge and counter staff were knowledgeable and efficient. The room was clean and well-kept, although it was evidently more than a few years old. The beds came with 5 pillows each and were very soft and comfortable (probably the most comfortable hotel beds) I've slept in), tiny fridge (no room for my stuff other than the snacks or drinks you get charged for using), desk and chairs and flatscreen TV. Bathroom was well-annoited (with the expected shampoo, conditioner, soap, and hairdryer) but was on the small side. The rooms were fairly well soundproofed, which is important as I'm a light sleeper. The gym (with 10 treadmills) was open 24 hrs a day and the heated indoor pool and jacuzzi were open till 10pm. The pool was showing its age - one of the support beams of the ladder was broken. Checkout was a breeze, with a receipt slipped under my door on the day of checkout. There were 2 restaurants on site (plus a Starbucks which closes by 3pm everyday) - Shulla serves expensive steaks. Stay away from their salmon - my colleague and I both came down with diarrhea the next morning after having grilled and blackened salmon. Two issues I had with Westin were: the tag on the bottled water said something like the drink is on us (complimentary) but I was charged $5.32 for it at checkout. And there was a card that said if you don't want your room cleaned (to be green), you can leave a card on your door and receive a $5 voucher at Starbucks, but the next day I received a note that this offer was not available that day.

I showed up at the Westin's front desk with no reservations, seeking a three nights' stay. John, a front desk manager in the evenings, was most helpful. He was able to provide accommodations for two nights but told me that he could not promise anything beyond that. He asked me to keep checking back. I did, and he was able to accommodate me for a third night. Thank you, John. The hotel has a spacious lobby. There are six elevators, so there is not usually a long wait for one. My room (1337) was clean, and the bed was very comfortable. There were plenty of clean towels. Many reviewers have noted the small bathrooms. This is true. They are small, but I managed. It was not a problem for me. The tub drained a bit slow, so as you shower, you might be standing in a few inches of water. Internet service is reliable but not free (10.00 a day). There are snacks and bottled water provided on those motion sensitive machines, so if you touch the snacks or the water, even if you don't eat or drink, you will probably be charged for it. It is better to take the Indy Go Green Line Shuttle from the airport for $7.00 one way as opposed to a $20.00 or more cab ride. The shuttle boards at the Zone 6 ground transportation area and stops near most major hotels in the downtown area. The Westin is centrally located. Lucas Oil Stadium, the Indiana Convention Center, and the Circle Centre Mall are all accessible by the sky bridge from the hotel, so you do not have to walk on the city streets if you don't want to. Walking the streets is not bad, however. I never felt unsafe, but it is still good to use common sense to avoid poorly lighted areas, and do not jaywalk. There seems to be a beggar/panhandler on almost every corner, but none seemed aggressive in any way. If you do not wish to be bothered, simply ignore them, and keep walking. My stay was a nice one. Either I am too easy to please, or some travelers are very critical. Probably the slow tub drain and the $10.00 a day Internet charges caused the most concern for me, but I do not think that it would stop me from staying at this Westin again.

I found the self parking easy and pretty well lit but expensive at $26.00 which you pay at a paystation - not through your hotel bill and there is no cashier. Valet is $32.00. The good news is that when I stayed here at the end of September the construction in the lobby was almost totally done and it was very nice. I also got upgraded to a very nice two room suite with a nice view but it still had a very small bathroom. The Executive Lounge was somewhat of a secret even though it should have been accessible to me since I am Platinum. I asked about it at the desk and was told they had one and my key would let me access it. I got to my room, realized I didn't know where the lounge was, called and asked, was told the 15th floor and assured my key would work. Went to 15th floor and of course my keys didn't work so back down to the lobby and was told then that there was breakfast served there. I didn't make it up to breakfast but was able to grab a Diet Coke, orange and bottle of water there about 9 pm.

Due to his wife's father have to have emergency surgery they could not leave until Late Thursday the 4th. Both Westin res line and the hotel direct told me since I had already paid for the room with my hotel points the room would be there for him regardless when he checked in. Notes were place on the reservation to make sure. About 9 PM Thursday I received a call to my cell from John at the hotel asking if someone would be checking in. I called back within an hour and said yes, my son, his wife and two small boys were on there way from Chicago. He said they were oversold and had no rooms. I said they had no right to sell our room. He said they did. I guess our attorney will find out. So much for customer loyalty. I understand another 20 people were having the same thing happen. I think Jerry Jones pulled the same thing for the Superbowl to fans that traveled from all over. Now my son will have to drive from Sheraton North to an early event he has scheduled and leave his family at Sheraton North. When they go it will have to be by cab or Sheraton van. This should be covered by the Westin since it is their fault. I actually thought Westin would be above this kind of thing but John says they overbook all the time.

I figured since I got there in the morning (to sleep all day) that it would end soon....I was wrong. I heard all of housekeepings duties, heard door's opening and closing, heard people talking in the halls, heard loud bangs. The rooms do not have a nice loud A/C or heater to drown out the noise. Needless to say, I did not sleep well during the day. But I figure most people sleep at night so the noise probably not so bad then.

If you need spotless, continuous Internet, bring your own connectivity (front desk staff say the system is about to be replaced, but it hasn't happened as of this posting). The hotel is beautiful and ideally situated for downtown activities and conferences- we never had to take a taxi and during foul weather citygoers can stay inside to get to almost every attraction and restaurant. There is one staff- Jason, to be exact- who goes out of his way to provide excellent service to each customer he sees. I didnt get to know the others as well, but I only experienced friendly staff throughout the stay. It also houses its own medium-sized workout facility and indoor pool/jacuzzi. It is missing a spa, which would have been great as I had two back-to-back trips and could have used some TLC. But th at's not a complaint- most hotels here don't have in-house spas. I only have two issues of concern: the close presence of the restaurant- which is starting to smell less 'fresh,' has seeped into the lobby carpets and even the elevator landings. I could smell it all the way up to my room near the top floor. Secondly- and this is my chief concern- the ibahn Internet system at the hotel has significant issues. The hotel ended up comp'ing my internet (for which I'm eternally grateful) because neither wireless nor cabled internet was working in my room. The hotel also advertises free lobby wifi service, but, along with 5 or 6 other lobby denizens, I was unable to keep the connection going for more than a few minutes, and the staff was baffled by repeated complaints, unable to give anyone a working answer or look into the problem while we were there. Will I stay here again? Probably- they host a conference I attend on a yearly basis and the rooms are terrific, as well as the staff I met.

First of all Eric, was wonderful because a. he did not cancel my reservation, but let me pay for two nights and then put notes on my account. He was patient, and I feel went over and above his call to duty in helping me. I can honestly even say that as a Black Woman I was not treated with any prejudice or preconceived notions.

We arrived just after dinner time after spending the Friday at the track, and really wanted to relax and rest up for a fun day Saturday. As other reviewers have mentioned, even though the address is Capitol Avenue, you need to go around the block to pull into the drive. We didn't have a big problem finding the entrance. Yes, self parking in the underground garage is $25 a day with no in & out. Valet parking is $28, and you can come and go as you please. With only 3 dollars difference, do the Valet. The Westin isn't a cheap place by any stretch of the imagination. The in room vending machine is expensive (refrigerated mini bar), internet access in the room expensive and I would assume there are charges to use the phone and computers in the business center. (I didn't look too much into it as I had just stayed at a Starwood Hotel in Minn. a couple of weeks earlier so I wasn't shocked at the extra charges.) The hotel had a Steak House in it (too rich for us), a Starbucks (went there every morning!) and a gift shop. The gift shop very convenient, but obviously, pricey. Being out at the track on Friday caused my allergies to act up and I wound up paying $13 bucks for a 5 pack of 24 hour Claritin. The Candy Bars and Pop are also expensive in the gift shop. Heck, even the ATM had a steep charge. I do think, though, for this type of hotel in a downtown metropolitan area, that's just something you have to expect. My wife and I found our room to be very clean, comfortable and it had a great view of the plaza by the Simon Mall Headquarters. There was a flat screen TV, good selection of channels, a comfortable sitting chair, desk and a clean bathroom. The Starwood Hotels do an awesome job when it comes to the bed and bedding. No scratchy sheets or bedding, nice, soft and comfy. The beds themselves are fantastic. My wife though, thought the pillows were a little wimpy, and next time would bring her own. That Friday Night, we decided to stay in and get a pizza. When the pizza came, the pizza place forgot to give us napkins and plates. We called down and they brought us a couple of plates, one of which wasn't washed properly and had something on the bottom of it. The front desk also helped us with a list of restaurants and the front desk person was helpful with suggesting a couple of pizza places he thought were worthy of trying. On Saturday Night after exploring the Mall, seeing a movie (it was rainy till mid afternoon) and exploring downtown we returned to our room and the hotel had left us a bottle of wine and some chocolates with a little note from the hotel wishing us the best during our stay and expressing their hope that we'd have fun at the race Sunday. (I suspect they probably did this for everyone who was a guest of the Indy Convention Association.) I thought it was a very classy touch. And it wasn't a regular bottle of wine, the bottle had the All State 400 at the Brickyard logo on it. A very nice keep sake after enjoying the wine! We did want more than a taste of chocolate, so we opted for dessert from room service, which was not as good as we expected. Sunday was race day, so we were grateful to have a comfortable room to relax in after a long, fun day at the track. What I noticed and liked a lot about the hotel was it's location. There are many food and bar choices a short walk from the hotel. Lucas Oil Stadium, Conseco Fieldhouse, Victory Field are all walkable from the hotel. The Indy Zoo and White River State Park are probably walkable too, if you're a motivated walker. For the rest of us, a very, very short drive. My wife and I really enjoyed our comfortable room at the Westin, thought the staff was great, and a terrific weekend in a great, friendly city that has lots to offer. A couple of notes: If you're planning a trip to Indy do check out www.visitindy.com. The Indy Convention and Visitors Association can really help you plan a great getaway with their resources. Also, take a drive out to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and go to their museum. The Brickyard is an awesome site, whether you go for a race, or just to see the track and check out the museum it's well worth it.", "Date": "October 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Naperville, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cWell presented hotel - Superb location !\u201d", "Author": "applestrudel", "ReviewID": "UR43428659", "Content": "Just returned back from a great weekend at the Westin. My husband booked this hotel for an Anniversary break as it was close to the Lucas Oil stadium where he had booked concert tickets, for the Saturday night. Once I knew the hotel, I logged straight on to trip advisor and the mixed comments really had me concerned. Getting to the Hotel. We didn\u2019t really have any problems finding the hotel, it is located just off S. Capitol Ave on Washington Street. (opp the Capital State Building). Car Parking Not too sure what all the fuss is about regarding parking. Basically you have two options, self park for $25 a night. If you are using this option your car has to stay put for the duration of your stay. Should you wish to take your car out then use the valet parking at $28 a night. We chose the self-parking option and the entrance is easy enough to find, the car park is called Capital commons and just before the hotel. I know other hotels in the area are charging $32 plus a night for parking. For me living near Chicago, where parking is far more expensive I really did not have an issue with the parking rate. I felt my car was safe where it was parked and that was all that I cared about. Room. We had a gorgeous suite with sitting room, bedroom and bathroom. The d\u00e9cor was in calming shades of cream and green. Very serene and relaxing. The king size bed was heaven to sleep on. We felt as though we had full panoramic views of the Capitol state building and downtown Indi. Very clean, presentable room. The bathroom once again was well appointed, the only negative was that it was rather on the small side. But I loved the double showerhead and the illuminated vanity mirror. Towels were a little course but the bathrobes luxurious. Wi-fi Free in the reception area, although a fee to use in rooms. There is a business centre available, but once again a charge is made for that service. Location. For us the location was perfect, only a very short walk to the shops, restaurants and bars of downtown. The lucus Oil stadium only 10 minutes away and numerous museums very close by along with the central canal, which is a very enjoyable walk. The city was so accessible that we left our car in the lot and went everywhere on foot. Restaurants/Room Service We did not eat in any of the restaurants as we chose to dine in town. We took advantage of the room service for Breakfast. Eggs, Bacon, Hash Brown, Choice or bread, tea or coffee and fruit juice priced at $18.50 plus 18% service fee. We enjoyed breakfast and it was very well presented. Not the warmest breakfast I have ever eaten and maybe not the tastiest either and at a total of around $55 for two, I guess it was not the best value meal I have eaten!!! Negatives On our second day at the hotel, we were out all day and only returned to our room for one hour to get ready for the concert in the evening. This was at 4pm and we were surprised to see that our room had not been cleaned. We left for the concert and returned at 11;45 pm. Our room had still not been cleaned. I called down to reception and she was very helpful and apologetic, but it made me laugh when she asked me if I was sure that my room had not been cleaned! They offered to send a member of housekeeping up straight away, but at this time of the night I just wanted to get into bed so declined. Our bill the following day believe it or not was incorrect, not sure I have ever checked out of a hotel yet and not been overcharged, they were trying to charge me $7.80 for 2 bottles of water which had a complementary tag around their neck in our suite. Reception put the mistake right for us with no fuss. Summary I know we had a couple of problems, but I would stay at this hotel again without any hesitation. The public rooms and bedrooms were well appointed, beautiful d\u00e9cor and very clean. All the staff we encountered were very friendly and knowledgeable and the location could not have been more perfect.", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Piqua, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cNot as bad as everyone claims...\u201d", "Author": "mbucha4", "ReviewID": "UR42804972", "Content": "My husband and I took a trip to Indy to catch a concert @ Conseco Fieldhouse. After reading many reviews on different sites about this hotel, I was a little worried. We got a steal for a room, so I couldn't pass it up. From reading reviews, we found out that you cannot get to the hotel entrance using a GPS if you put in '50 S Capitol Ave.' The entrance is actually on Washington. You can valet park for $28 overnight or self-park for $25. We were told that with the valet, you have in&out privileges, but with self-park you do not. We used the valet. The doormen were VERY helpful and polite, asking if we needed help, told us where to go, etc. Check-in went smooth, and we got the room that we had reserved. Upon entering our room, we found it to be clean and comfortable. The bathrooms are a little on the small side, and the mirror over the sink is a little small, but it served the purpose. The pool area was very nice, and although we were not traveling with kids, we noticed the pool is 4ft all the way around, not very kid-friendly. The fitness center was HUGE, the largest i've seen in a hotel. Not sure about the internet, we did not have a need for it. We used the skywalk to get to the mall, that was nice. The hotel location was wonderful, less than a 10 minute walk to Conseco Fieldhouse. Check out went smooth, and we did not have to wait long at all for the valet to bring our car around. Overall, the hotel was very nice, but I probably wouldn't have paid more than $130-$160 a night for a king size standard room. Yes, parking could be considered expensive, but it's the same in any big-city downtown location. Oh, and on some travel websites, you have the option to pay a little more for a \"city/fountain view\"....the city view would be nice if you care about that sort of thing, but the fountain wasn't working when we were there. Otherwise, you get a \"nice\" view of the Mariott behind the hotel, maybe some scenery on the sides, luckily view wasn't important to us.

The price was one-fifty-nine a night, plus taxes, obviously higher than \"non-peak\" times. The hotel is attached to the convention center, which helped out a lot, particularly as my wife had trouble walking great distances. They warned us about the minibar when we checked in, and we made sure not to touch anything in it. The pricing was high at $25 a day. We weren't going anywhere, so I didn't bother with valet parking. Regardless, they charged us valet parking even though we weren't in the valet section. They did remove this from our bill. They seem to have trouble with their elevators. I saw another review about people stuck in the elevator. This happened to us (a total of 12 of us), too. Unfortunately, our 10 year old was skittish about elevators and all the way up to Indy he asked if we would get stuck. Sure enough, we did. We ended up missing a dinner engagement as we tried to calm him down. What did the hotel do to compensate us, given that we got grease on our clothes from the rescue? They had water available, and they called to see if we were okay. That's it. I'm not sure what I expected, but a laundry service would have been nice at the very least. For the money, the hotel was absolutely nothing special. The beds were okay, but the padded cover is not elasticized and kept riding up on me at night. The bathroom was an okay size, maybe a little on the small size. The big cost ripoff is their wireless internet. It's free if you log in on the first two floors (well, the first floor, anyway) and ten dollars for the privilege of checking your e-mail from your room. Why they nickel and dime you on this is beyond me. I had to traipse down to the lobby every night to check e-mail. The free internet is free for 24 hours. You can renew, but once I tried to renew on the 2nd floor (having connected for free from the second floor) and it wouldn't let me in. I had to go to the first floor, disconnect from that server then reconnect before it let me in again. Totally unnecessary, and just another way of gouging you.

My directions told me the hotel was off S. Capitol...so I ended up circling a very busy block (it was Black Expo when we went and the traffic and pedestrian traffic was understandably busy at that time) about 4 times before I figured out that the hotel entrance is actually off Washington instead. Every single one of my friends said they had the same problem. Check-in was ok, but when we got to our room we discovered that our sink was leaking water everywhere on the counter. When we called the front desk for maintenance we discovered that the battery in our phone was dead and the only way to get ahold of someone was on speakerphone. We were told someone would be right up. A maintenance man did come to our room while we were headed out for the evening, but when we returned, the faucet was still broken and leaking. When we called again, they said someone would be right up. An hour later...nothing. At this point, the faucet was so bad it wouldn't even shut off, so for about an hour we just had the water running constantly because the faucet would not shut off. When we called a third time, the maintenance man came and did fix the faucet, but he said we wouldn't have any hot water on that side and that we'd have to climb under the sink and wrap a towel around the pipe or something because a part was missing. Um, what? During this time, my friend was still waiting for her bag to be brought up from the valet....nothing. She called the desk and was told \"we'll bring it right up\"...without even asking for her valet # or what the bag looked like! Needless to say, the front desk did NOTHING and she finally gave up and went down to the parking garage herself to get her own bag. (On a side note, the parking fee was ridiculous and the hallways were dark and had filthy dirty carpet.) We did not even attempt to try to go to sleep until around 2 AM...partially because of the insane amount of noise in the hallway from the other guests. I understand it was a particularly busy time in Indianapolis with the Expo going on and that the hotel was booked to capacity. But I'm sorry, people running and screaming and talking and slamming doors ALL NIGHT LONG is ridiculous. We called to complain several times but absolutely nothing was done, even though we were assured that they had a \"full security staff\"...where were they? Could they not just periodically walk the hall to maintain peace and some semblance of decorum? We got no sleep all night. This hotel has a responsibility to all of its guests. It's clear that, even though Indianapolis is home to several large conventions and tourist events like the IBE, no advance planning was taken to ensure that the hotel was able to operate efficiently, especially for those guests not necessarily there for the event. Service was the worst I have ever experienced at any hotel....and was especially disappointed in this from a 4-star Westin. When we complained AGAIN about our long list of problems we had...we were given an obviously rehearsed but insincere apology and were told that we would have to call or email the manager. He wasn't even AVAILABLE! I'm sure he was hiding from all the guests. We could not have been the only ones with problems there. The bottom line is that we paid a lot of money for services we did NOT receive. We paid for a place to sleep....we did not sleep. We paid for a place to use the facilites...those facilities were broken. We paid for a reasonable about of service from the hotel staff....we got blown off and waved away.

Yes parking is $25 per night in the closest garage, but you pay this in just about any garage in downtown Indy or any other major city for that matter. Check in was a breeze, walked in stated my name, I was asked what kind of bed I preferred and handed my key cards, and shown to the elevator. We had room #1107, it is a corner room with a modest north facing view. The room is probably a little narrower than most, since it is a corner room and there were 3 rooms at the end of the hallway. Two corners and a middle. The room did have a stuffy smell upon entering, but once the air conditioning ran for a short while the stuffiness dissipated. No stains on the carpet or furniture. The room had a table/desk setup with internet connections and a phone. It had a HD flat screen TV, presumably LCD, I don't remember, roughly in the 40 inch class. The \"Heavenly Bed\" was wonderful, it didn't however keep me from snoring, much to the dismay of my girlfriend. She also enjoyed the bed very much. The \"Heavenly Shower\" was also great, good water pressure and plenty of hot water for each of us to take a shower in the morning. The bathroom sink also spit out instant hot water. The in room vending machine IS NOT A REFRIGERATOR!!

The bathroom is small--can't imagine more than 2 people sharing a room. The room temperature was hard to control and caused some discomfort. The bed was very comfortable--the best part of the room. Like other reviewers, I was charged for items from the minibar. I never opened the minibar--I don't even know what was in it. I asked to have the charges removed and my request was met with reluctance. If I return for business in the future, I will be sure to try a different hotel.", "Date": "January 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cHorriffic Experience!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "lp8", "ReviewID": "UR23756792", "Content": "Terrible is an understatement!!

We found a good price on Hotwire and decided to book it and it turned out to be the Westin. When we arrived, the valet was prompt and very courteous. Check-in was a breeze with no problems at all. The room itself was average. It was rather clean, however, it was an older room from the looks of it. There was some water damage (dark spots and possible mold) on the ceiling above the shower. There were no fitted sheets on the double beds, only flat sheets. With that said, the sheets were clean and the room didn't smell particularly bad. We did realize that you absolutely have to pay for everything, even internet access, which is 9.95 a day. There is also a stocked refrigerator with all kinds of stocked goodies for outrageous prices (can of coke was 4.00 + 21% service charge). The real problem began when I went to purchase 2 bottles of coke from the vending machine in the ice room. It conveniently did not take dollar bills (I had one dollar bill and 4 quarters for a 2.00 bottle of coke). So I went down to the front desk to get change for a 5.00 dollar bill so I could try the machine on the floor down. I went back up to the 12th floor (the floor which I say staying) and tried the coke machine another time just to make sure it wasn't working and it wasn't. I proceeded to the 11th, 10th, and 9th floor, and each coke machine didn't take dollar bills at all. I went back down to the lobby to see if I could get 16 quarters (for 2 20oz drinks out of the vending machine). I waited in line for 10 minutes because there was only one attendant on duty (which was very understaffed since there was a huge FFA convention in town). When it was my turn and I asked for some quarters, he let me know they did not have any quarters, he gave an excuse because they were busy. I said it was awfully convenient that none of the coke machines worked and it was basically forcing me to purchase a 4.00 can of coke out of the stocked refrigerator. I was very perturbed at the time and asked that he comp. a can of coke from our refrigerator for my troubles of having to come down twice because of problems with the hotel's equipment. He stood there and said that he couldn't do that. By this time it was after midnight and I was tired and all I wanted was a drink. I asked him why he couldn't comp my room a 40 cents can of coke. After 5 minutes of arguing he finally agreed to comp the can of coke. I know it seems silly to get so upset over a drink, but it was the mere fact that none of the coke machines worked, and I am lead to believe they don't work for a reason, and the fact that the attendant argued with a guest over a 4.00 can of coke (which they paid around 40 cents for). However, I checked my final bill in the morning and everything was correct. I have also noticed I have small bites on my body, I cannot assume they are from the beds in the hotel.

I spent most of my stay trying to get the hard-wired Internet connection to work. After two visits from technical help with no luck, I gave up and used the wireless access -- which ranged from slow to none. I had flashbacks to my dial-up days. A place like this should have flawless high-speed Internet access for free. Period. Instead, I paid ten bucks a day for slow wireless access that died out frequently. The hotel suggested I request a small in-room refrigerator rather than use the honor bar, but when I did request it they didn't deliver it. So I asked again. No luck. A third call. No refrigerator. Finally, after an irate fourth call, I got the refrigerator. So the place has some technical and service issues. Finally, as always, I had the room across from the loud family, who apparently booked two adjacent rooms and spent the entire evening -- til 1:00 am -- opening and closing each door so they could go back and forth.

I asked the server if he could do something, seeing as how the only customers there (10:30pm on a Sunday) were trying to watch the game. He said he didn't know how. Eventually, a manager came by and turned it down, but by then, we were ready to call it a night. The next morning, the sounds of a jackhammer greeted us.

We stayed thanks to Priceline and paid $80 for the night. We had a great room, #911. It's on the front side of the hotel & faced into downtown. The Capitol was to our left, the Simon office directly in front of us, the Hyatt behind that, and the Convention Center to our right. The view was pretty decent, but Indy isn't that pretty of a city so whatever. The front desk worker made it out to be something spectacular when we checked in. My biggest gripe with this hotel was the parking. To park in the Westin garage is something like $25, with no in & out privileges (not something I've experienced at other area hotels). The other issue is that the location isn't the greatest on the block. The address is on Capitol Ave, but since Simon built their new place you can't actually see the hotel until you have passed it. All of the pretty pictures that Westin has on their website are obviously from the pre-Simon days when you could see the hotel from Capitol. In order to enter the hotel driveway you have to turn right from Capitol to Washington, and then take a pretty quick left to the hotel. The garage for the hotel has entrances on Washington & Maryland, right about in the middle of the block. The issue we had was that since there was a large convention (final weekend of Black Expo '07) it was hard enough to turn in & out of the driveway, I can't imagine using that garage would had worked too well. We ended up parking over at Pan Am Plaza, which was $18 for the night. The room itself was a bit small, but not too small. The furniture was really basic. Plain armless desk chair and basic desk, coffee maker with Starbucks pods, mini fridge that's a mini-bar stocked with overpriced food & drinks, etc. The bathroom was very small but adequate. I just wish the whole room had better lighting. Even the bathroom had pretty dim lights. It was nice though that there was light-up make-up mirror in the bathroom which helped the lack of lighting. It looked like there was a decent selection of movies, and a decent snack selection in the mini-bar. The vending machines had 20oz bottles of Pepsi products for $2 which isn't bad at all for a hotel in my opinion. Especially since there's isn't really anything too close where one can buy soda & snacks. The only odd thing that I had never experienced is that I had to have my room key to get into the vending area. The placed seemed to need some TLC. The pretty (should be shiny) stainless steel looking objects around the room, were pretty smeared & splotched with water spots. The shower head was pretty crusty with hard water gunk & wanted to spray every way except down. The shower was pretty odd, it had 2 shower heads. My husband was really impressed with the \"Heavenly Bed,\" I thought it was all right, a bit too soft for my liking, but nothing like the foam that Marriott uses. The staff was great. Well except for when we checked out. When we received our bill under the door early in the morning we found a $4 charge for a bottle of water. The issue is, we hadn't drank the water, heck even if we had no one had been into the room to verify the whereabouts of the water. We called downstairs & asked for it to be taken off. When we went down to actually check out & drop off our keys, the front desk girl bordered on rude when we asked for a new bill that showed $0 in charges. She just kind of said nothing to us from that point, not like it took much to click that print button. But whatever, don't charge for your overpriced water, or raise the Aquafina price in the machine to a charge that wouldn't yield 2 bottles for the price of the 1 in the room. I don't think that this place is worth the going rate on the Westin site, or any travel site, or [--]. However, for $80 on Priceline for that busy weekend with the location of the hotel in relation to downtown it was great. I'd definitely stay again, a great option while downtown Indy. The parking isn't too bad I guess as long as you're willing to spend the few extra bucks to park at the hotel & don't plan on leaving in your car until you are checked out. Of the other 4 star options I do think that this is not the best, not the worst. I would prefer the Omni Severin (although it lacks real parking) over the Westin; however, I prefer the Westin to the Hyatt that's right on the other side of Simon.", "Date": "August 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Location": "3", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville", "Title": "\u201cSecurity and Service Issues\u201d", "Author": "travel195409", "ReviewID": "UR8373534", "Content": "When I arrived late (with a reservation) they indicated that they were overbooked (a common occurrence according to the clerk).

I immediately called the front desk and inquired why I was placed in a smoking room when I requested non-smoking. I was told that all rooms in the hotel were smoke free, but I could clearly tell my room had recently been switched over. The front desk girl told me someone would be up to deodorize the room....to my surprise this meant spraying a green liquid in what looked like a windex bottle. After seeing what the housekeepers would use, I told them not to worry about it. After a few minutes in the room I thought that if the thermostat was turned down the smell may be minimized. I turned the AC down to 65 degrees, and yet there was no change in room temperature. This was a HUGE problem since the heavenly bed has a down comforter on it and the temperature outside was in the low 80s.......it made the heavenly bed experience slightly less enjoyable.

At check in, I asked for the room that over looks the state buildings that is shown on the website and the counter person told me that \"none of the rooms \" had that view. Very Strange. He did , however, give me my Starwood points for the stay, in spite of the fact that I'd booked on Priceline. Very nice. The room was small... just okay... very clean though, and the bed was comfy. This hotel is showing it's age in decor and in the bathroom fixtures. The turkey sandwich I had from room service was worth every cent of the $30.00 I paid, it was a great sandwich! I certainly wouldn't pay full fare for this hotel but I'd Priceline it again... and try for maybe $75.00.", "Date": "November 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cookeville, TN", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "teacherwoman", "ReviewID": "UR5932401", "Content": "I just returned yesterday from a one-night stay at the Westin Indianapolis.

Bathroom - very small as others have pointed out and only one showerhead worked, but good water pressure and plenty of hot water Room Service - ordered a cheeseburger one night which was great (properly cooked, hot when delivered, etc., fries were stil crispy) but that alone cost $25.00! Location - great/convenient for conference and centrally located in heart of City. Housekeeping - The worst! This is my main complaint. No service to my room after my first night. Second day - while they remade my bed, they did not empty the garbage cans, did not remove used glasses or provide fresh glasses, did not remove used towels left on other bed or provide fresh towels, did not replace toiletries. Definitely not worth $200/night.

We pricelined it and after a few bad experiences with not knowing what we were getting until we had bought it, we were a bit worried.

We were pleasantly suprised at our excellent room location, the location of the hotel in relation to the attractions and the overall quality of the hotel. We have stayed in very nice and very pitiful hotels and this was one of our favorites. The bed is great! Look for street parking right near the hotel on the weekends. We parked all weekend (left the car and walked everywhere, which is easy to do) on the street for free (as opposed to the $23 a day in valet) and could see our car from the window of our room. I tried to come up with a negative point or two for balance, but I really can't think of one.

The bedroom had a beautiful view of the capitol. The bathroom is a little small, but very nice. The bedroom and sitting room were very spacious. And, yes, the beds are heavenly. As other reviewers noted, be careful of the mini bar. My husband opened it to see what they had to offer, but we did not take anything. We ended up being charged for 2 beers anyway ($5.90 each!). I called the front desk and they had the charges removed, but their mini bar policy is the harshest I've seen. Next time, I probably won't even open it. The hotel is in an ideal location - right across the street from the capitol and within easy walking distance to Monument Circle. I would stay at this hotel again. If it is your first time in Indy, I would highly recommend going to the Rathskeller - it is a German restaurant in a beautiful building with an amazing beer garden.

The rooms were on the small side, but comfortable for our purposes ... but we don't require a lot of space when traveling. The Heavenly Bed lived up to expectations. And my most important concern after reading these reviews - a lack of hot water - was not the case at all during our stay. We took several showers with terrific water pressure and temperature.

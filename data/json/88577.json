First of all, I arrived at the hotel at 12:00pm with my 3 year old daughter. I wanted to check in and they said check in isn't until 430. So what am I supposed to do until then? We decided to go to Disney world and they were trying to sell me tickets that were clearly a scam, do NOT buy their Disney tickets! They called a cab for me that charged me $50. When I arrived back to the hotel there was this really rude lady who gave me the key to the hotel, she didn't acknowledged me and decided that having a personal conversation was more inportant. Wifi doesn't work, there is no food or coffee. The room is horrible! It smells and it's very dirty. I can't believe this place is legal! It looks like how I imagine a meth lab would look. Not a friendly envoironment. I don't care if they would charge $10 per night, not worth it. Oh and I called the front desk to call me cab and she said I dont know any cab numbers.... What do you mean? You called one for me a few days ago! I'm not a picky person. All I want in a hotel is safety, cleanliness, and a friendly staff and they didn't meet one of my expectations. Oh...

I am alone here tonite. When we called AA and told us we indeed had a reservation at the hotel- the front desk agent Lizzie said. We call all companies yesterday \u00a0and told them we were sold out.

You basically get what you pay for, with a hotel like this your not to expect 5 star service and acom. Room was clean and the cleaners came in everyday to clean it and put fresh towels down, bathroom was kept clean, room also had mini fridge and tv which was handy. Pool and surroundings were nice to look at. The staff were kind and helpful. The only dissapointing thing is that there isnt anywhere to eat on site apart from a very small breakfast room. This hotel is ideal if you just want somewhere to sleep and your out during most of the day and dont expect anything special.", "Date": "May 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Lauderdale", "Title": "\u201cDisgusting\u201d", "Author": "patsibee", "ReviewID": "UR14342963", "Content": "Absolutely Disgusting room - had to find somewhere else to go, spiders, broken air conditioner, dirty and very smelly.", "Date": "March 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilson, NC", "Title": "\u201cLesson Learned\u201d", "Author": "bshaw96", "ReviewID": "UR13577231", "Content": "We stayed here Feb.8-15. Not a pleasant experience at all. Read several bad reviews prior to trip, but decided for the price, to give it a try. We definitely learned our lesson. If you're paying 35.00 a night on average, you'll get a room worth 35.00 a night. First off, we're not extremely picky. And we went with an open mind. But this experience was horrible. We rented the king, non smoking room. If it was non smoking, you wouldn't know it. It smelled horrible, not sure if it was smoke or mildew? Or a combo of both. There was a cigarette burn in the comforter and pillowcase. Next, there was mildew all over the shower curtain and walls. The water regulator in the shower apparently did not work as throughout the shower the water changed from cold to very hot, actually burned us a few times. Learned to take a cool shower just not to get burned when it surged to a higher temp. They gave you 3 towels for 2 adults, and would not give extras until you turned in your dirty ones. Never changed the sheets. If you wish to sleep in and plan on not leaving until after 10am, make the bed yourself. They won't come back. AC controlled the temp terribly. Went from hot to cold on its own. Beds were horribly uncomfortable (And we spend our weekends in the summer in a pop up camper- these beds were no more comfortable!) The continental breakfast was actually in an empty room. It was loud. Not sure if we were next to a fire department or not, but heard fire engines and police cars all hours of the night. It never gets quiet, and you hear people talking outside your door constantly. I can say nothing positive about our stay. We stayed at a Master's Inn on I Drive and had a much better experience. This was another reason we felt safe trying this. NEVER AGAIN! As I said, for the price, we weren't expecting the Hilton, but we were expecting to feel safe and comfortable.", "Date": "February 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat Deal for the price\u201d", "Author": "PR_Bob", "ReviewID": "UR13122577", "Content": "Pleasently surprised.

While discussing the smoking issue with the front desk clerk that night, he sarcastically mentioned how they \"would have to remind guests not to smoke in the rooms\" and looked at me and smiled. The toilet did not flush properly in another room and there was food left in the refrigerator from a guest that stayed before us. BRING SHOWER SHOES! The bathtubs must be too old to clean thoroughly. (right) BRING HOUSE SLIPPERS or wear socks in the room. Those floors are NaStY! The next morning we saw how important the smoking issue was; housekeeping smokes from room to room while \"cleaning\". Do not expect any of the following in these rooms: shampoo, conditioner, coffee pot, clock/radio. Room DOES comes with bath towels and soap. \"Continental Breakfast\" (located in one of the hotel rooms downstairs): Four cardboard boxes, laced with crumbs on the bottom containing individually wrapped muffins and a coffee machine that poured coffee with film mixed with coffee grounds.

A word to the wise - we read the reviews on Tripadvisor and still booked - please don't make the same mistake we did. To be fair though, there are two hotels in Kissimmee called the Masters Inn - the other one is nearer Old Town, and seems to get slightly better reviews. The one we are talking about in this instance is near the big \"Orange\". This hotel may be cheap, but it will (in our opinion) spoil your memories of Florida. Let's put it this way, we were booked to stay there 9 nights, and left after just one. The thought of having to return to THAT room for 9 nights was just too much to cope with. The hotel staff seemed more like ex-prison officers than customer-focussed individuals. In fact, we found them quite intimidating. The room was, as has often been used to describe the Masters Inn in these reviews, grotty. To give you a flavour, there was a hole in one of the blankets you could put your hand through. The sideboard looked as though it had previously been dropped off the balcony, and had seen much better days. The room was cold, the steam from the shower kept setting off the fire alarm, there was a layer of crumbs and grime beneath the TV stand... I could go on. There was also a dog barking in a nearby room, and we both felt itchy and suffered from asthma whilst in the room. Could this have been bad housekeeping we wondered? For the first time in Orlando, I actually felt scared in the room, and the flimsy door opened out to the whole wide world - and the two flights of dingy stairs up to the rooms (no elevators) were not nice. The free breakfast was served in a room that made a shed look posh. The vacuum packed pink cakes were something else ;-) And another thing; we took this hotel because it was advertised in the UK as a 'non driving option'. It really isn't - you've got a long walk to Old Town, and anything else worth seeing in Kissimmee, and the free transportation only goes to Disney, so you'll be looking at a taxi to Universal. Talking of taxi's the hotel guy booked us one with a \"highly recommended friend\" of his, and it cost us $27 for a 2 minute journey. We really do try to find the best in things, but couldn't find any redeeming features in the Masters Inn Kissimmee. We've now stopped in 4 different hotels in Orlando, and this was by far the worst.

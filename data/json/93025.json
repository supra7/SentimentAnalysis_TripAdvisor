It's just beautiful now. Sparkling clean, luxurious linens, and towels. Marble floors are so clean and window has shutters, so they will avoid musty carpet and fabric smells. Great idea. We also didn't have a fridge, was told it would be sent up but never came. Large empty area by window should have had a table and chair , had to put things on the floor. Phone was also not plugged in and charged and couldn't call desk by the code on the phone, tried 0 and reached it that way. Room did have a strange smell, reminded me of roach spray! but may have been new furniture smell?? New buffet breakfast is just great. Fresh fruit cup. Scrambled eggs, perfect crispy bacon!, sausage,grits. Lots of other pastries, cereals, fruit yogurt as well as plain. Read here on line that could order eggs cooked to order, which I would have loved but was never told that, and there was no sign saying that. Can eat either in breakfast room in AC, or out in lush courtyard. Huge asset to the hotel. Hotel bar is also just beautiful and has a lounge area, an outside patio area and also the courtyard area to have a drink in. We did not have a wedding reception while we were there, but would not appreciate loud music till 11. Maybe management can stop that at 10, 10:30. After all it is the French Quarter, they can go party out there all night! But we are always prepared and use earplugs. We will definitely go back.

We slept longer there than we have for months at home. The front desk was over-the-top helpful trying to navigate us to the hotel during a crazy Saturday night arrival: crowds from the SEC basketball playoffs and from the St. Joseph's Day parade prevented us from getting the car to the hotel. The adjacent Bar Vin was very nice, and Angela at the bar paid us a very nice turn. The rooms are beautifully appointed, and I loved the black marble floor throughout. It's much better than stepping out onto carpet because you always know when the marble is clean. With hotel carpets I sometimes have my doubts. The complimentary breakfast from 7:00-11:00 every morning was a real money-saver.

It was wonderful! I can honestly say that I can't think of one bad thing. We got there at 4PM on a Friday night and no line to check in. Quick and painless the way I like it. Get up to our room....WOW! The only other hotel I have stayed in in NOLA was The Omni on St. Louis Avenue and this hotel defiently gave it a run for its money considering the price was half of the Omni! The room was perfect, the beds were comfy, linens soft, the courtyard was unbelievable...it was my husbands first time there and I really wanted him to experience NOLA. I wanted him to experience the history, architecture and culture and I really believe that starts with a hotel like the Mazarin. I was pleasantly surprised when I got to my room and there was indeed a small refridgerator. I was under the impression from a previous reviewer that there was no coolers allowed as well as no refridgerators in the room, so I am assuming the hotel saw the review and fixed that problem very quickly. Another good sign of good management! The breakfast was unbeatable, the only thing they were missing was a waffle maker. Eggs, bacon, sausage, fresh fruit, juice, coffee etc., also the water in the rooms......FREE!! This was huge considering how badly I wanted water after being out on Bourbon Street all night! Thats another good point was that it was the closest I have ever gotten to stay to Bourbon Street, it was literally right around the corner from the hotel, amazing location! The bathroom does not have a bathtub and I love to take baths, but it was totally OK considering all of the other good aspects of this hotel.

This would not have been a problem if we had not brought a laptop, iPad, cell phones and pieces of expensive jewelry. Well we phoned downstairs again and were informed none of the rooms had safes, not what we were told earlier. The problem was Expedia stated they had a fridge and the Mazarin hotel site stated they had a safe. Due to medications needing refrigeration and our jewelry we requested a change to another hotel which offered those items.

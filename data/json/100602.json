I got screwed with an extremely LONG layover and was not about to spend my day at the airport. I booked a room at a hotel that had a shuttle service and Embassy's have always been reliable. Shuttle driver was prompt and a great guy. Check-in was smooth, fast, the two gals working were great. The hotel itself is an older embassy( i used to work at Embassy Suites La Vista Nebraska) so I find it easy to see the difference. Old none the less the hotel was clean, great decor, rooms were updated and perfect. I had just enough time to go to the managers reception before I left and the two working were such a treat. I checked out later that day, the front desk seemed a little confused that I checked in and checked out the same day but I explained it to them. Probably thought I was crazy but oh well. Wish I could have stayed longer, will plan on it next time that's for sure.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, better staff\u201d", "Author": "LiscomeBay", "ReviewID": "UR125811947", "Content": "This hotel is about 4 miles from SEA and they do have shuttle service every half hour to the hotel. The shuttle leaves a bit to be desired as I was shuttled back and forth on a normal passenger van opposed to a mini-bus, which created issues with the amount of people it carried. Any way, upon arrival to the hotel it appears to not be a newer hotel and when you're inside it is confirmed by the somewhat dreary, or darker appearance. Upon check-in the front desk staff was excellent and the process was speedy. In fact, while my room was not ready upon my arrival, they sought me out in the restaurant personally to hand me my key when the room was ready to be occupied. The room itself was a corner suite and I found it to be acceptable but nothing extraordinary and certainly very dark. The TVs were newer flat screens but they did not offer HD service and the cable options were limited. The room service I ordered was good food, they just didn't get the order right as I received incorrect beverage and condiments. However, in the restaurant itself, all went well and the food was actually surprisingly good. The staff in the restaurant and bar area, specifically Erika and Susan were excellent. Very friendly, well attentive to the needs of the patrons and were extremely courteous. It actually was refreshing to see them interact with the guests and even laugh with them. Greg was an excellent bellman who assisted upon arrival and the waiter Gabriel was also superb, relative to his friendliness and overall service. The stay was ok, but it was made better by the staff. The hotel just seems older and outdated to me but I believe it to be one of the better options if you need to stay near Sea-Tac. My rate was $170 per night and both nights I was there, they were full. Again, this hotel is made by its staff.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cNice room\u201d", "Author": "Twoodr", "ReviewID": "UR125055910", "Content": "my wife and I stayed here 2 nights over President's weekend.

After staying home in the cold, we decided to get a hotel room and warm up and charge our toys. I called them on the phone and asked for a executive suite. The girl insisted that all of their rooms were suites. When I got there, we were given a standard suite. That's OK, but I did want the step up. The hotel room was nice, and the service was good. When we went to get dinner, I stopped at the front desk and asked for a couple of extra pillows. They were delivered to our room while we were gone. While using the pool, I almost slipped on the pool deck. I wasn't the only one, I saw several other people almost take a fall. They need to do a different surface in the pool area. When it gets wet, it's downright dangerous. I'm surprised they haven't had a lawsuit yet. My daughter ended up forgetting her watch in the pool area. The following morning during checkout, I asked at the front desk, and thankfully, someone had turned it in. The clerks were very nice when I asked if the watch was turned in. The free breakfast in the morning was good/bad. Since the hotel was crowded, they setup a second serving area for the hot food (pancakes, french toast, sausage/bacon/eggs). Although it was a nice thought, all the food in the second area ended up being cold. If I would have looked harder before getting breakfast, I would have stood in line longer for the hot food. The rest of the food availability was nice. The internet is an extra charge at this hotel, but since I am a Hilton Gold member, that was free. Parking was also an extra charge, and being a Hilton member doesn't help you on that one. I have no idea why they charge for parking. It is nothing special, and they own the lot. I can't think of any obvious reason other than taking an extra $10 from you.

We checked in around 10:30pm without any issues. It was quick and easy. They did tell us that parking would be $10/day and internet was $9.95 or $14.95 depending on which speed you wanted. We were assigned a room on the third floor, king bed, non smoking. Our room was great. There is a living room with couch, desk, and TV that is separated from the bedroom and bathroom. There is a little sink area outside of the bathroom with mini fridge and microwave. The bedroom was a little small. The bed took up most of the space, but it was fine. The bathroom was average in size and came with crabtree & evelyn shampoo/conditioner/soap/body wash. Do keep in mind that there is a train nearby in the area and you will hear it periodically throughout your stay. You will also hear noise in the atrium if you are in the living room area. We couldn't hear the atrium from the bedroom. This seems to be the hotel of choice for high school and college teams. There were a bunch of teenagers gathering in the lobby and atrium area at night talking and having fun. Breakfast during the weekdays is from 6-9am. I don't know why breakfast ends so early on the weekdays. On the weekends, breakfast is served from 7-10am. We had breakfast on one day and it was really good. There was a line for the hot food, where they take your omelet order. You also get to choose from pancakes, hashbrowns, scrambled eggs, sausage, and bacon. There is also the usual stuff like muffins, yogurt, and fresh fruit. It's a really decent breakfast with good selection. There seemed to be enough seating for everyone. If you miss breakfast, there is a bunch of fast food restaurants down the road. I think I saw a Jack in the Box and Taco Bell and a 7-11 store. The hotel is also close to Southcenter Shopping mall, a Target, and Costco. The hotel is right off the 405. We found the hotel's location to be very convenient. Parking spaces are a little cramped and some cars parked crooked or took up 2 spaces. It was a little annoying having to pay extra for parking when there is a lot of parking available.

When I traveled to Seattle for business, I decided to try out this property because my experience across at a hotel across the street had not been so good two weeks prior. It happened to be the Sunday night of Labor Day Weekend when I checked in so the hotel was extra crowded. The front desk staff were well trained and went above and beyond the call of duty for two guests in front of me and also for me. Because I did my homework and read the Trip Advisor review by another guest, I brought earplugs so that when the train rumbled in the \"backyard\", I couldn't hear it. The building vibrated every time a train went by but it was like having a free magic fingers bed. Speaking of the bed, it was incredibly comfortable; the room had all the accoutrements that you'd expect at an Embassy Suites property. The only two areas in which the hotel could improve are listed below: 1. More luggage carts. I had to print off several pages of legal documents so I took my printer with me on this trip. It was convenient to have the luggage cart on Sunday night. On Monday morning at 9:30, there were none to be found. I was told there were only five. I had to make three trips to my car. While I didn't mind the exercise, it made me late for my next appointment even though I allowed plenty of time. 2. Have extra staff work breakfast on a holiday morning. I went down for breakfast at 8:00 a.m. and there was still two hours of breakfast service remaining--until 10 a.m. There were no plates, no utensils, no trays, no coffee--regular or decaf, no juice (but the Coke dispenser was working). They had run out of food in the regular tray line. There were so many people looking for all of the above that one could hardly move. I don't think I've ever been to any hotel where there were more people in the breakfast area. I was really disappointed and it took me an hour to get my food. The line was 30 minutes long to get a made-to-order breakfast. One guest asked the kitchen employee if there was any more coffee and she yelled at her and said that she was too busy this morning. Apparently, she was stressed out and needed some help in the kitchen. My guess is that when the vacancy rate is higher, this would be a calmer environment on a normal morning. I would stay here again despite those two concerns because I had one of the best sleeps ever and that's the reason, after all, that one stays in a motel: to get a good night's rest.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGood place/value\u201d", "Author": "klk101", "ReviewID": "UR118119883", "Content": "Stayed at the Embassy suites for 4 days, it was slightly dated, but overall good.

We have a small child, so we like to have a suite, and have stayed in Embassy Suites around Seattle, but this was the first time in the SeaTac Embassy Suites. The good: Our room was very spacious, and seemed reasonably clean. There was a small kitchenette in the room with a microwave and a tiny sink that we could use to wash & sterilize bottles. The bad: Extra charges everywhere. Yes, at all Embassy Suites the wifi is extra (which is lame in this day and age, but not unexpected for a hotel in the Hilton chain). But here, the parking is $8/day, despite having to park yourself in a huge lot that's never full. They wanted $15/day extra for each extra person, including the baby. When I asked why, since this isn't the case at any other Embassy Suites I've ever visited, I was informed that it's to cover their \"complimentary\" breakfast. Uh, at most Embassy Suites the complimentary breakfast is covered in the cost of the room, not extra -- and I can find breakfast for a lot less than $15/person in Seattle (and especially in Southcenter). And the baby eats my milk and sleeps in my Pack & Play on my sheet -- so why should I have to pay $15/day extra for her? Other bad things: No hot water in the kitchenette sink. In the end I had to move hot water to that sink using glasses and the bathroom sink (no one wants to wash bottles in a bathroom, or cold water). The TV doesn't get all the local channels -- if you want to watch, say, the Mariners game on that night, you can't, because the hotel doesn't get FSN. Also, be warned: SeaTac (more accurately for this hotel, Southcenter) is a sketchy area. There have been shootings at the mall, etc. You get a VERY mixed crowd at this hotel -- airport travellers who didn't realize this hotel was nowhere near the airport mixed with heavily tattooed construction workers.

The hotel does have a business center with internet/printer which I did use but it's not the same as having the service in your room.

We are a family of four and our teenage daughter brought a friend. The two girls shared a room adjacent to the one we had with our son. We paid an advance, non-refundable charge of $89 per room, which came to a total of $100.31 including taxes for each room. Oddly, however, because we paid in advance, the front desk wasn't able to provide us with an itemized bill on check-out. The only item on the bill for check-out was the parking charge we incurred (more on that below). Since we booked over the phone, this meant that we actually have no record (other than the single line item on my monthly credit card statement) showing what we were charged (i.e., room rate and taxes). The hotel is located on the east side of Interstate-5 (i.e., on the opposite side of the highway from the airport), away from the main \"strip\" of SeaTac's airport hotels. I've stayed on that strip a few times and I don't recall hearing any air traffic noise, so there may be no advantage in that respect from staying further away from the airport. However, there was definitely no noise at the Embassy Suites. They had a shuttle van and, because we didn't fly in, we didn't use it. I did get the impression that if timing and proximity to the airport were critical, we might prefer to stay closer to the airport on the strip. I can only guess that a round-trip circuit from the hotel to the airport terminal and back could take 25-30 minutes in the van. So if you go to catch the shuttle and it has just left, you could be waiting a while (or trying to get a taxi if you're in a hurry). The rooms are typical Embassy Suites suites. The living area is reasonably large, with a pull-out couch and TV. There is a microwave and bar-size refrigerator. There is a TV in the separate bedroom. My pet peeves (which are not big complaints) include: \" They provide HD-capable flat screen LCD TVs, but they don't provide HD programming. As a result, the picture is squished and skewed (i.e., to fill up a 9X16 screen with a 3X4 image). Despite the high-end TVs, this distortion means that the picture is actually worse on the LCD TVs than it would be on a regular CRT TV. \" They charge $10 per day for internet access. I didn't bring a laptop, so it didn't affect me. However, this is just a cash grab because it costs them nearly nothing to run the system. I see this as not much different than charging you for the room and then charging you a separate fee to be able to watch TV. I also don't like being charged to park my car ($8) when the property is not in a densely built-up location. If I'm in a city, I sort of expect to take a hit on parking. When we're as far out in a semi-rural area as this property is, it just comes off feeling like another cash grab. The hotel has a small indoor pool with a small hot tub. We went to use the pool around 8:00 pm on Saturday night, but it was extremely overcrowded with a large group that included many small children and few supervising adults. I have no problem with kids, but there were 18 (yes, I counted) in the hot tub, which had a posted capacity of five people. The pool wasn't much better. We went back later when it was less crowded, but it was still very busy with a number of out-of-control kids (e.g., one took the emergency rescue life ring off the wall, wore it like a hula hoop and jumped into the hot tub a couple times. Another kept asking us, somewhat politely, to move out of the way so he could swim laps in the hot tub). The real culprits were the parents who weren't adequately supervising their kids. However, there appeared to be little or no monitoring done by hotel staff either. Ultimately, if the parents won't do their job, the hotel staff should intervene ... and they shouldn't have to be asked. Embassy Suites is a preferred chain for us because their properties usually (always?) include breakfast in their room rate. Unfortunately, their food service staff did not seem adequately prepared for their guests on Sunday morning. When I arrived, they had run out of drinking glasses, coffee cups, knives and syrup cups. This wasn't a giant deal, but I did need to share a knife with my daughter (who managed to snap up one of the last ones before I arrived). Ultimately, I would stay at the Embassy Suites - SeaTac again, but the experience wasn't so positive that I wouldn't look around for a better property or better deal. There was plenty of room for improvement. If I had to rank them, I would have to put this hotel at the bottom of the three Embassy Suites I've stayed at so far this year. I provide a \"thumbs up\" positive recommendation. However, the few problems we encountered were almost enough to change our rating to a \"thumbs down\" negative recommendation.", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel for families.\u201d", "Author": "erinpdx38", "ReviewID": "UR39407079", "Content": "We stayed here for one night with our 2 kids (ages 7 and 9).

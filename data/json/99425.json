The hotel is on the list of Historic Hotels and very unique in its elegant French Renassiance style. The rooms are typically New York sized, i.e., tight quarters, but larger than some I've stayed in, clean and comfortably furnished. Our room on the 6th floor was on an inside wing and so was extremely quiet. Housekeeping failed to prepare our room on Monday, which required a call at 5:00pm and follow up to get our beds made, although our request was handled promptly. I like the convenience of a one block walk to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. Manhattan Mall, Macys and the Empire State Building are all right there. Since I travel on my stomach, access to decent food is high on my list and this location seems a little bereft in terms of quality restaurants. However, for the first time I had the courage to try Korean barbeque - it was fabuluous. The hotel is located in the heart of the Korean district; we walked up and back 32nd until deciding to try Miss Korea mid block. The number of Asians dining here was encouraging and we followed our server's suggestions to try the short ribs and pork. The dish is prepared at table with many scrumptious side condiments. We also ate both dinner and breakfast in the hotel's Martinique Cafe with excellent results. I was disappointed to discover an Italian restaurant on 31st where I had had fine meals several years in a row was no longer in business. But Speedy's, catty-corner from the hotel, was a happy find.

I too was very frustrated at the fact that while there were only 5 or 6 groups of people in line waiting for check in, it took over an HOUR for them to get to us - they didn't seem to be in any hurry to speed things up, and the check in desk definitely wasn't fully staffed. I understand there was a dog show that weekend, but you would think this would be all the more reason to be prepared. That said, the room itself wasn't bad, though the bathroom hadn't been fully cleaned. The next morning, I ended up getting downstairs just before breakfast buffet ended, and they wouldn't let me in.

I did not want to skimp and aim for the lowest price because the trip advisor reviews of them could be so negative. I thought the best strategy was a mid-point price and mostly postiive reviews, and a large international chain with a reputation to protect. I selected the Radisson Martinique on Broadway, because it seemed to fit all that criteria, looked like a beautiful hotel, and was pretty much halfway to everything we wanted to do on that trip. My husband is a smoker, so I requested a smoking room: it was great, modern decor, and a view of Broadway. On the 4th floor we were not disturbed by street noise and found the bed very comfortable and the appointments all very satisfactory. We were not expecting a huge room - it's a turn of the 20th century hotel, after all, but the size was adequate for the two of us. The hotel staff were courteous, friendly and helpful. The bellman stored our bags for us that morning so we could explore the city before we checked in, and did the same for us after we checked out as our bus wasn't leaving until that evening. At all times, all staff, concierge, doormen, etc were helpful and made us feel welcome. It concerned me initially that this large hotel was not in any NY travel guides (Fodor's, etc) and mentioned this to the desk, but they did point out they were listed with the Historic Hotels of America and I could see the airlines booked rooms for their air crews - and I would think the airlines would know to treat their crews right! We did not eat at the hotel that trip but I did use the internet and the gym - very nice to have both facilities so handy. The location was unbelievably handy - there were three major subway lines nearby, one right under the hotel, and several bus routes as well. We returned a few weeks ago on October 31st for a five day stay - we were back to see the Halloween parade, 30 Rock and the Upper West side, so once again, the location was perfect. Our 2 dbl smoking room was modern, with nice comfortable beds and pretty much the same as the room on our first stay - but no view! Oh well, I forgot to ask, and will make sure I do next time. Everything we want in a hotel room was there - nice appointments, soft towels, good water pressure, and so on. and this time we had coupons for the breakfast buffet in the hotel cafe. We found the quality very good, with a nice selection of meats, cheeses, baked goods and fresh fruit, and the scrambled eggs were always fresh and fluffy. The service at breakfast was attentive but not intrusive. We were able to check in early, which was nice and once again, the bellman watched our bags for us after we had checked out in the morning so we could wander around for a few more hours before we left in the evening. At all times, everyone was pleasant with us, and made us both feel welcome and like valued guests.

That worked out very well for us as a gathering place. No food/drink is served up there -- it's just a place to sit. There is a large screen TV, but that's all. Our rooms were clean, quite comfortable and very quiet. It was nice that the beds are adjustable for firmness. I saw several rooms on the floor and each has a different configuration, but they are all nice. No views, but I am always more interested in a quiet sleep than a view, so for me that was great. The location was terrific. I didn't know NYC now has a Korea Town, and the hotel is right there. We had dinner twice at Korean restaurants and both meals were great. The subway is just steps from the hotel's front door, there is a Chase bank also just steps from the front door, and a drug store around the corner. Of course, you are also near Macy's. There are lots of stores selling costume jewelry in this area and everywhere (and I mean everywhere) we saw stores selling $5 pashminas. Every few blocks we passed a street vendor selling $5 pashminas. Needless to say, we bought some. There is a post office around the corner on 31st Street. On my last day I picked up a self-adhesive priority box and shipped some things home so I didn't have to open the expansion on my suitcase (I like carry-on). A few blocks away is the Bagel Maven. I don't know the address, but it's worth looking up. Good NY bagel. As an ex-NYer, having a good bagel was imperative. Buffet breakfast at the hotel is very good with sausages, bacon, eggs, toast, muffins, cold-cuts, fresh fruit, etc. We had coupons, so I don't know if the menu is the same for people paying for breakfast.

On the shelf there was 2 glasses, an ice bucket and a bottle of water waiting for us. The bed was made with nice white clean sheets, and on one side was the desk and chair, on the other a bed side table with an alarm clock with also had an iPod dock on it. The bathroom was small, but had a shower over bath, and the coffee machine was also in here next to the sink! It was a 'pod' coffee machine, but unfortunately there was no tea for us British folk. There was a huge air conditioning unit next to one of the windows blasting out cold air quite noisily, I was really thankful for it though as it was just so humid outside. There were two large windows in the room, we didn't have a view, instead we had a view of the rooms directly opposite. There are a lot of rooms on each floor of the hotel, and there is also vending and ice machines. In the hotel lobby there is a gift shop which also sells sweets and drinks but it was quite expensive. The hotel is situated in a busy neighbourhood, and directly outside the hotel entrance is one of the entrances to the 34 St subway station, incredibly handy as we used the subway to go everywhere. Directly across the road from the hotel was a Speedy's Deli where we had breakfast every day and I highly recommend it, hot food is priced according to the weight of your plate and they do a wide range of food, we also popped into here for snacks and cookies! It's only a short walk from the hotel to the Empire State Building, Times Square and Bryant Park, but as we had subway passes we did just wander down into the subway station. Macy's is only round the corner within easy walking distance. The hotel has a bar and restaurant area, we did go into the bar one night for a couple of drinks and it was nice enough and reasonably priced. The hotel has free Wi-Fi, and faster Wi-Fi at a price. I used the free Wi-Fi on my iPhone and it was fast enough for me, though this was usually at 6am when I was wide awake due to the time difference! There is also a computer room with printers, sometimes the room was busy but the couple of times I popped in (to check in online for our flights home!) I got a computer straight away. After we checked out on our final morning we left our suitcases with the bellman (they are labelled and taken away to a secure room) so we could roam for the city for a final few hours. I highly recommend this hotel in New York, the room was clean, comfortable and spacious and the staff were friendly and helpful especially the bellmen. The location was great, the subway station being right outside of the hotel door was extremely handy and there were plenty of places to eat nearby.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cbad service with a smile\u201d", "Author": "cosmored100", "ReviewID": "UR106162108", "Content": "Am in the Martinique now, having arrived off a long flight from London and even longer set of queues in JFK.

It seems there un-written rule is if they don't have it in lost property, then you never brought it with you in the first place! It makes insurance claims a nightmare!

Why would I bother making such a fuss when there are much better things I would have loved to have occupied myself with in the Big Apple! Unfortunately this hotel made the Big Apple a Big Let down!! as i was treated appallingly! While having a conversation with the front desk supervisor she continually told me to 'hold on one moment' every time the phone rang or a colleague asked a question about bed setting up! she even walked off at one point clearly not interested! I needed the patient of a saint!! After being passed to 4 people in total who left me standing at reception for 20 minutes I was never offered a apology or even asked if I would like to take a seat while I waited a further 10 minutes for the Hotel Manager which i was then told was in a meetin! I was told to come back later so I rang down to front desk that afternoon to speak to her...and once again very unhelpful offered nothing, even though all I was asking for is a letter/statement for my insurers! she couldn't even give me any reason why she couldn't. After another 10 minutes or so of arguing she said she would call me back before I checked out that day, you can provably guess what I'm about to say!.. I never heard a thing! turns out she had gone home for the day! The lost property situation is bad but made 10 times worse by the awful customer service I recieved.

My only complaint with this hotel was that the beds were not very comfortable. They were just ok. Didn't sleep well at all the first night. Pillows were not good. Be sure to ask for better/more pillows before your first night of sleep! We had 2 double beds for 2 adults and 2 teens, and it was a little hard for the 2 adults to sleep on the double bed. Macy's is a 2 minute walk from the hotel. JCPenny's also! Subway is just outside the hotel. Bellman recommended a place for us to eat, and basically it was a smoky bar. We had to leave. Another night, the bellman recommended a Korean restaurant that was right across the street from the hotel, and we had a horrible service experience at the restaurant. We spent 100.00 for a family of 4. When we left the restaurant, we immediately went to McDonalds where my husband ate another meal. So, after two attempts, .....I would say to be cautious of the hotel's restaurant recommendations. A lot of people movement right outside the hotel, so several times the hotel staff would check our room keys (to make sure we were indeed a hotel guest). I would certainly recommend this hotel. Make sure you get adequate beds though! Bring very, very comfortable shoes, because you will be doing a lot of walking! The free internet access was slow, but for a fee you could upgrade to faster speed.

We chose to stay at the Radisson as we had gift vouchers from a previous (horrific) experience in a Radisson resort. Our first choice was the Radisson Lexington (better location and nicer than the Martinique) but once we said we were using vouchers, we were told the hotel was fully booked and that we would have to stay at the Martinique. On booking, all that was available was a 'queen' room. My husband called 4 times prior to our departure to ensure that there were notes all over the system that we wanted a 'king' room. Whilst checking in the Radisson rep advised us that we could sign up for a \"Radisson points card' at no extra charge which would mean that we would get free early check-in. Meant that our room was ready at 1.00-1.30pm rather than 4pm. We also got our 'king' room. Room was a decent size for NY but was tired and a little dingy looking. Closet space didn't have a door, bathroom was small, carpets were worn and the hotel backs on closely to residential blocks so we kept the curtains drawn whilst we were in the room. Bed was clean and quite comfortable though and although the bathroom was small, it was clean and the shower was powerful. We were on the 11th floor so street noise in the room was not an issue, plus we weren't front facing. To be honest though I always sleep in earplugs in a hotel so couldn't comment on general noise levels in the evening / early hours. Whilst in NY, not many people spend hours in their rooms, other than sleeping, showering and changing so the fact that this hotel was a bit grimy, didn't really spoil our trip. However, I would not recommend this hotel to people who are visiting NYC for the first time or who are looking for a hotel where they can relax in the bar after a day of pavement pounding / after dinner drinks. Bar is small and is the same space where breakfast is served. A bit depressing looking and it felt like we were having a drink in an office cafeteria. The maid service are pretty rude too. On the final morning of our stay, we were waiting for room service (waited 25 minute for somebody to bring us a menu and then another 45 minutes for food that was cold and very average), so we took the 'do not disturb sign from the door'. The maid knocked and was really very rude and aggressive telling us that we should have the sign on the door and trying to reach in to get it from the other side of the door. She had to be told forcefully to back off. It took several minutes to explain that we'd taken the sign from the door in order that our breakfast could be delivered and that we were checking out at 10.30 and she could clean the room then. It's also worth noting that this hotel is on the edge of Korea town. Noisy, busy all hours of the day and pretty stinky (seems rubbish day is a Monday morning so walking home on a Sunday night is pretty nauseating). Really close to the Flatiron and a good location for walking and exploring but in honesty, with all of the choices of hotels in NY you can do a lot better than this. More expensive choice - W Union Square or a similar priced hotel as this try Hotel Kitano at 66 Park Ave at E. 38th street.

The same problem on day 4 with the toilet however this time it didnt over flow it just filled up made the toilet un-usable. The mouldy danish which my good lady had on day 4 in the restaurant, oddly we had been give free breakfasts due to the toilet issues. The waitress who must have double vision, I assume this as every time she served up juice it half ended up on the table. The lack of communication at front desk when asking if our issues had been dealt with. Our passes which stopped working on day 4 so all our passes needed re-activating. The inablity to give us enough towels/flannels and pillows for 4 people. The shower head which wasnt actually attached to the wall. Having to ask for more toilet paper on a few occasions. To be fair most of the issues were dealt with quickly but the problems kept coming. Would we stay again?

It took a while, but finally the names for the rooms were corrected - so we thought. We were then advised that we had been 'UPGRADED\", well, 2 rooms had only a single full/queen bed.

The price can be decent for the area if you catch it right and dig around a little. The hotel is undergoing some renovation, but none seemed to be in prominent areas. I've had a regular single and was once given one of their jr. exec singles. Obviously the latter was much nicer, larger, better bathroom. The regular single is typical for NYC - very small room. I found the rooms to be clean, serviceable, and the bathrooms to be reasonably up-to-date. The location is solid, if you don't mind being around the corner from the Empire State. It makes that and lower midtown (MSG) highly accessible. Subway stop is literally steps from the front door. Very compact workout room in the basement has several treadmills and steppers, plus a separate room with free weights. Disappointingly, no bikes. It is NOT the exercise room pictured on their website. I have 2 main problems with the Radisson Martinique - 1) check-in is a deathly long process. No idea why, but it's been consistent that way for me and for co-workers. 2) their website advertises \"High-speed, wireless Internet access (complimentary).\" This is either a flat out lie or intentionally misleading (like maybe it's free in the lobby that way). For a fee, you can get broadband. For free, you can get access at 56k (remember that noisy modem you had 10 years ago? Yeah, it's about that fast). I kid you not. Finally, it's probably worth sharing that my basic single room had the most interesting view I've ever had at a hotel.

I paid about $ 250 for 3 people in the same room. I made payment advance, and received vouchers to be presented at the front desk at the time of check-in. I will try to put as much information as possible for everyone. Also took some pictures to illustrate better. Room: The room is not large, it's normal size. They do not have a policy of 3 twin beds. I was upset because I made the reservation (agency travel) for three single beds, which did not exist. The room is ideal for maximum 2 persons. Three or more, will be very tight. Important Notice: Don't have minibar inside the room. On each floor has a machine selling beverages and water, the cost for $ 3 each. Bed: Very comfortable. Excellent. Bed Linen & Quilts very soft. Wonderful. Bathroom: It is also not big, but it is a reasonable size. Egyptian Towels for optimal absorption. Shower it's very good too. It has a hairdryer, cap, free soaps and shampoos. Inside the bathroom, has a coffee machine with 3 sachets of coffee, replenished daily. TV Room: I had difficulties to make it work. has over 15 channels in HDTV, and is 32 inches. Phone Room: 1-800 For phones, they only charge 0.50 cents per call, not per minute. Have public phones in the hotel lobby. Maid: In my room, I didn't locked nothing and nothing missing. In my case, was highly reliable. Always I arrived the room was very well-done, and was not touched in private items. BellBoys: They are very professional and efficient. If you get to the hotel too early for check-in, leave your luggages with them and get off to tour the city until the time of check-in. Your luggages will be safe in an private room, without access for guests. Do not forget give tips for them. For a taxi, you can talk with them too, that they will provide the same time. Safe: Don't have inside the room, just at the front desk. But it is individual. Reception: Many here, write bad reviews of the front desk. But, what you pay, you receive 100%. If you want a plus, something unusual, hardly chances of you get. They do not get a smile on your face for free. I want to mention that everything, what I needed and paid, I received, and nothing more that this. Just that you paid and nothing more. Business Center: It has 7 computers with free Internet in the hotel lobby. Have printer for free too. Are 15 minutes for each guest. But are busy all the time. Just sit, wait, and done. Location: Sensational. Has absolutely everything around the hotel. Stores, Deli's, Fast Food (All Brands), Shopping, and much more. It has an entrance/exit of 34 Herald Square station, 10 meters from the door of the Hotel. Simply amazing that. Times Square: 20 minutes walking. It is only one metro station to came (34th to 42th) It's easy and practical to go to any Times time of day or night. I think was so far, but I was wrong. It is near the hotel. Trust me. I came back walking from Rockefeller Center (51th) to the hotel without tiring. That's why I say the perfect location of Hotel. Security: In Manhattan, security is very high. Do not you feel insecure any second. Cops on every street. You can walk to Metro and walking in safe in Manhattan any time. I do not guarantee outside Manhattan, like the Bronx, Harlem, Queens. In Manhattan, you're protected 24 hours a day. Taxi: There's in front the Hotel. Are $ 50 to go to JFK. Check-In: Really is 16:00. I got the 15:30, but I think that was luck. Check-Out is 11:00. Breakfest: My reservation, had not included the breakfast. The cost is $ 15 per person. In region of the Hotel, there are many options for taking a breakfest, good, and priced well over down if you compare with the Hotel. It has all the Fast Foods at the corner of 5th. Avenue. Delhi's had a lot too. And have the Speed's Deli, on corner from the hotel, which serves Breackfest, Lunch and Dinner. Food very good and cheap. Information: In this Hotel,have a lot of airline crews. I saw KLM, Swiss, and others. I saw too, a large groups of Brazilians. It's very commom big brazilian groups. I'm talking of groups of 20 or 30 people. These groups arrive and depart daily. If you have the misfortune to find them during check-in can cause problems, and consider some delay to ckeck-in or another question. I recommend this hotel to everyone.

In that regard, we weren't disappointed. A subway entrance is right as you walk out the building or, if you want shopping, Macy's is just a few blocks away. You really can't beat the location, but that's if you're willing to suffer through the freezing rooms and the staff's attitudes. As soon as we walked into our 8th floor room (with an excellent view of a brick wall), we went to turn up the thermostat. Alas, it was stuck on 60 degrees, regardless of our attempts to turn it up. We called down to the main desk and after forty-five minutes a repairman arrived. He poked and prodded around, messing with the main unit for a couple minutes (we later realized all he did was press the \"on/off\" button of the main unit), and then declared it would get warm in no time. Twenty minutes later: still freezing! We replicated his actions to no avail. Needless to say, we tried to stay out of the room as much as possible, despite the outside temperature holding steady at 20 degrees. The room was clean, though the lights gave off an odd, bright white light, which is fine if you're working in a high-tech laboratory, but not if you want to read a book in bed. The TV - a flat screen Sharp - had a number problems, including freezing up, making squeeling sounds, and not responding to the remote. The internet was similar. The hotel website boasts high-speed wireless internet, free!, in every room. In reality, every room is equipped with the lowest broadband wireless access, but with the option to purchase high speed for $12.95 per day. Geez! Was the room worth the price? Heck no! Upon checkout, there were two staff members behind the desk, and one was helping another couple. The other staff member was bustling around, but clearly doing nothing. The man before me kept trying to grab her attention to ask her if a box of his had arrived. She said, \"you expectin' a box?\" before ignoring him and moving on to other tasks. His repeated efforts to get her attention were fruitless. Five minutes later, she asks me if I want to check out, completely ignoring the guy who had been desperately trying to talk to her for ten minutes. I motioned to him and said, \"he was here before me,\" and finally she listened to his question and helped. The service was poor, the staff rude and inefficient.

Unfortunately when we opened the door to the room on the 5th floor, the lights were all on because the window faced onto a brick wall some three feet away so there was zero natural light. We immediately returned to Reception and refused the room. At this point, we were informed we'd have to wait until after 4 for another room. We did a pre-check in, room number allocated, details taken and told to return to collect the key card later. We left our luggage with the concierge and went out to explore. Returning at 5, there was no queue and we were issued with our new room card. No problems with this room - it was on the 11th floor and faced the front street. We booked a room with 2 double beds and this is what we got. The room was a good size, spotlessly clean with flat screen TV. Beds were very comfortable and the maid service was excellent. Towels changed every day and toiletries replenished daily. We found the staff on Reception, Concierge, Maids and door staff to be very pleasant and helpful. The free Internet service in the business area was greatly appreciated and we made good use of this facility to research and book attractions etc. Although there are only 3 computers, guests are requested to use for a maximum of 15 minutes and we found that people adhered to this. I have to say the room is one of the quietest I've ever stayed in. There was no noise from the room on either side of us, although they were occupied, nor from the corridors or street below. Amazing when we considered we're in the middle of a huge city. We slept very soundly as a result, which is something I never take for granted in a busy hotel. Free newspaper every morning was a nice touch but the complimentary water was only for first morning! We flew into Newark Liberty Airport and caught the train into Penn Station, which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel and cost half the price of a taxi. We didn't eat at the hotel, but regretted this later as the restaurant seemed very busy and the menu was good value. Definitely worth checking out. As long as you're prepared for a potential wait for your room to be allocated, and willing to be assertive if there is an undue delay (my colleague asked to speak to the manager and the problem was immediately resolved) I can't say anything negative about this hotel at all. We booked our deal on Expedia together with the flight and for \u00c2\u00a31700 for 2 return flights from Manchester plus 5 nights room only here, we feel it was a good value break. As previously mentioned, a lot of airline staff do stay here and we were initially concerned this may mean some noise and disruption at unsociable hours but we never heard a thing.

The hotel manager, Joseph Somenbeck is a poor example for a manager. Rooms Division Manager, Fatena Williams, lacks customer service or professionalism. Our entire stay at the Radisson was horrible, from beginning to end. On Thursday, August 6, 2009, I arrived at the Radisson Martinique formerly called Holiday Inn Broadway. After waiting three hours for check-in, my mother, daughter and I arrived in our room. The room air conditioner was not working. I immediately called the front desk and was informed that Housekeeping would arrive shortly. I placed two additional phone calls and waited a total of one hour before Mike, the engineer arrived. He then informed us that we needed to change rooms because the compressor was malfunctioning. After packing up and changing rooms, the air in the 2nd room went out at 1 am. The night engineer, Ruben, came and repaired the AC unit. The following day when my family and I returned from shopping, we entered the room to find that the TV was not working. Naturally, I called the front desk. I waited 45 minutes for Mike, the engineer, to arrive and tinker with the television only to inform me that he didn't know why it wasn't working. Eventually, Mike discovered that Housekeeping disconnected the cable, and he was able to repair the television. Once again, we were inconvenienced during our stay. When the room was asked to be serviced, the bathroom was either not provided with enough towels or didn't have any towels. The final and most serious incident transpired on August 8, 2009. At 5:30 pm, I requested a new set of keycards from the front desk clerk. I left the hotel at approximately 6:30 to leave for the theater. I returned from the theater at approximately 12:30 am to find that the Radisson front desk employee had given a colleague I knew from Chicago a key to my hotel room. When I entered the room, I discovered her intoxicated and laying over the bed. I immediately went to the front desk and requested to speak to a manager. Thomas Richards, the night manager, spoke with me. During our conversation he requested a Lock and Interrogation report from security. The report was generated and clearly indicated that a Radisson employee issued [--], a mere stranger, a key to my room, 619 in their hotel. As a result of their negligence, items from my luggage are now missing. Radisson breached their contract when they knowingly allowed a unauthorized person access to my room. We could have been seriously hurt or even killed. Fortunately, the evening did not end tragically, but I was unable to sleep because I no longer felt safe in our hotel room. The individual he allowed in our room was intoxicated and urinated all over herself. Simply put, our wonderful evening had abruptly turned disastrous. I informed Mr. Richards that I was requested a full refund totaling $501.05 immediately. He told me that Fatena Williams, Room Division Manager, was the only person who could authorize the refund. I have contacted her a total of six times between August 8 to date, and no one from the Radisson has attempted to call and apologize or rectify the situation.

There was no one big incident that marred the stay, but rather, the culmination of substandard staff-guest contact points made me really doubt the professionalism of the staff and the sufficiency of training they have undergone. Arriving near noon time, I attempted to check in early but since it was still hours before check-in time. I absolutely understood why that I was not offered a room. However, I enquired if there was a minibar in the room where I could store my medicine. The lady on duty said there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any because the hotel is currently replacing them, without offering any alternatives or suggestions. I asked if there was a way I could store my medicine in the property\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant/room service department.

When I finally checked in around 5pm, I was glad when I realized I was being assisted by the Duty Manager (Mr Juan). I thought, perhaps, he could be a good reference for the service standard of the hotel. Although I was heartened that he offered to place a fridge in my room free-of-charge when I enquired about storing my medicine, I wondered why there was a double-standard on this front. More disappointing was perhaps the fact that he did not look at me when talking to me, seemingly more concerned with the paperwork than welcoming a guest. My preference for a room with a window which I stated upon reserrvation was not reconfirmed with me. Neither was I asked for my preference for a smoking or non-smoking room. I was sent on my way to my room with a rather half-hearted thank-you and yet again, no eye contact. When there was eye contact, the staff seemed to prefer avoiding it rather than to engage in it. Mr. Raul from the bell-desk, who saw me holding up a ticket for my luggage, almost immediately shifted his glance to something else, ignoring my presence and walking past me. Hence, I walked up to another bellman for help. At the Financial Center, I could not believe my eyes when the staff on duty did not even lift his head up to address me, when I enquired about the availability of wireless internet in the room. No word, merely a nod to my yes-no question. The next day before I departed, I was trying to catch a quick nap before checking out. However, I was interrupted on 3 occasions within the short span of an hour. On the first 2, there was a knock on my door (Rm 804). Just as I was stepping out of bed to get the door, the door opened and a Housekeeper walked in. She was apologetic. But at the second time, another Housekeeper did the exact same thing. That kept me really puzzled, not to mention unable to get to sleep by the interruptions. I wondered what kind of policy the hotel was with regards to opening room doors when rooms are occupied. Is there an SOP that states that Housekeepers should wait for at least, say, 10 seconds before opening a door just in case? The last straw was when a suited man, whom I assumed to be the Housekeeping supervisor, knocked on my door. When I opened the door, he did not even greet or address me or express any apology for disturbing, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Are you the new guest or the guest who is checking out?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I almost felt \u00e2\u20ac\u0153expired\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as a guest since I was not a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd guest. It seemed like all 3 of your staff couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait for me to leave so that they could get on with cleaning the room. Another point of concern, and often frustration, is how some of the staff treats guests differently. While one of the bell captains addressed the gentleman in front of me as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sir\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, I was addressed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Here you go, my friend.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When I entered the Financial Center just after checking out, I was cast a doubtful eye by the staff. He asked me, again with no salutation or address, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Are you a guest here?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The aggressive comment that was laden with judgment was absolutely uncalled for. I understood that he was doing his job of keeping non-guests from using the Internet facilities, but I believed there could have been a more polite way of verification. If there was a gem to be found amongst the mostly unfriendly staff, it came at the very end - Mr Cesar from the bellstand. He was the only one who engaged me in conversation, offered useful directions, spoke sincerely and with interest to provide excellent service. I was pleasantly surprised by his hospitality, especially after such an unpleasant stay at the property. He was outstanding even though our interaction lasted less than a minute, and I think many of the staff members can take a leaf from him. I sense a general lack of interest and motivation amongst Radisson's staff members, made more obvious during peak periods of the day. This was perhaps evident in 2 of my observations: 1) At the Financial Center, two staff engage in open, loud criticism of another colleague, which I honestly thought should have been kept under wraps or discussed when out of earshot of internet-using guests. 2) At the concierge, Mr. Tony shared with me the increasing burden he feels as he is doing the job of both concierge and gift shop, though not paid more.", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cNice location, super small rooms.\u201d", "Author": "saaji", "ReviewID": "UR31246514", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here May 27-30 2009.

They were apologetic, but I was not thrilled with the response time. I was also told we had free internet, but when I went to log on it told me it would be $12.95 per day, I called and they said it was a glitch, and just to accept the charge, and they wouldnt charge me. I then called the night before we left to be sure, and they wouldnt even look at my bill to tell me if it was on there or not. And since we checked out at 2 am for an early flight, I still dont know if we were charged for internet or not. I will have to wait and see I guess. They did let me print my shuttle confirmation and boarding passes for free. Which was a plus. This hotel had (for us) a very good location, easy to get to,a nd close to most things.

We had to constantly ask for 2 of everything (eg, towels, washcloths, etc.) They never emptied or cleaned out the ice bucket. They did not replace the coffee cups and glassware every day.

To make matters worse, we had an early flight out the next morning, were tired, wanted to shower, etc. When I called, housekeeping did not answer so I went downstairs and talked to the manager. He offered to send up clean towels, but not make up the room. He asked me if I had left the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door (I had not.)

We were given vouchers for a full American breakfast for which the restaurant charge was $20.00 It was a nice benefit. (The breakfast buffet was excellent. Later we had tea and cake at the restaurant late one night and there was an excellent jazz group playing until 11 PM) You walk out your door and New York is before you. Want to see a play? You can walk to the TKTS booth. (PS The Seagull is a perfect production!) The subway line is conveniently located 15 steps from the lobby! The staff upon leaving kept our bags safe so that we could tour the city one last time and arranged a ride to Newark Airport.

I returned 15 mins earlier and Angela recognised me advising my room was ready. My room was a lot bigger than I expected, especially as they had offered us a 2 double bed room, when there was only 2 of us staying! We even got a view of Broadway and Speedy's outside! The room was on a high floor so we had no problems with smoking rooms or any safety problems encountered by others. We got 2 bottles of complimentary water on the first day and everything was replaced daily, apart from the first day but a housekeeper came to check and it was replaced within one minute. The reception, concierge and bellhops were all very friendly and helpful. The hotel is located very centrally, next to a metro stop and also 2 blocks from some fast food chains and shops and also round the corner from Macy's and Empire State Building. There is also a shop called Walgreens which is 2 blocks away, round the corner from Empire State Building, where we purchased many American goodies for a decent price. We didn't eat in the hotel's restaurant so can't comment, but Speedy's is conveniently across the road. If not, there are lots of other places to eat, Starbucks being on every street in NYC! The only negative was the hotel is opposite some building works, so if you have a room facing that side of the hotel, then beware of some construction work which could wake you up at 7am! But if you're an early riser or can sleep through anything, then you won't have a problem! Overall, I found this hotel to be fantastic, in a great location and I would highly recommend!

There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good and bad with this hotel; here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowdown: Location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s midtown, one subway stop south of Time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square, which is where we had a lot of activities planned. We also had Central Park and the World Trade Center museum on our list, so this centralized location came in handy for us making it a little easier to plug in some down-time for us and the kids mid-day. Another plus, the subway station for the N, R, & W lines is literally out the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front door and to the right. The hotel is on the corner of 32nd and Broadway. 32nd street east from Broadway is Korea Town, which is primarily that one street going out some 3-4 blocks from what we saw. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to explore the neighborhood much more than going down 32nd street a ways. The bad with this location is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s midtown address means higher room rates than you can find further out. We had the boys, so the good central location seemed worth the extra dough. After riding the subway extensively for three days however, we realized that it can take you all thru the city with such speed that we think that, absent needs of any kids, one could do better in a hotel further out, say down towards Battery Park, where some new and cheaper hotels are located. Service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The Check In Saga \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We had a real problem with this hotel upon our attempt to check in on Friday afternoon. As with most hotels, check in is 4pm. We arrived there early and were told they might be able to get us into the room early. Good thing we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t count on that because they stalled us till past 5pm, claiming someone else was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153still in the room,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and then, that staff were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153checking the room.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I overheard similar excuses given to other guests and realized they were playing games with us all because they were probably short staffed in housekeeping and way behind getting rooms ready. After giving them over an hour past check-in I announced to the front desk (loudly) that I needed to bring the manager in at this point because me and my family were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very disappointed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at what was going on. When the desk clerk tried to put me off further with more promises that the room was being checked I said (also loudly) that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this ISN'T MOTEL 6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to see such a problem in a hotel like the Radisson. When the manager noticed some of the other guests they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d managed to delay had heard this and were now heading back his way, he suddenly found that they had a room available that would meet our needs. We found ourselves up on the 17th floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Executive Suites floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which had it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own little clubroom with free drinks, snacks and internet for those with rooms on that floor. For those who haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been to NYC before, let me add here that (1) once a hotel has decided to inconvenience you, only effective complaining will get results; (2) hotels in older buildings in the city have smaller, older rooms. The Executive floor room we got was what they considered one of their best rooms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anywhere near as big or as nice as even some lower level rooms in say, a Marriott in the DC area or in Virginia. And (3), if you DO find yourself up on that executive floor, whether by design or luck (as with us), the breakfast served in the executive club room is only a continental spread \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the breakfast you probably got free tickets for from your booking is the downstairs buffet which is the full spread with eggs sausage and bacon. Service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Hotel Staff - This was a mixed bag for us. Most of the staff, especially the bell hops and front door people were terrific. We ordered carry-out from the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant on more than one occasion and I found the staff I had to deal with there not always willing or happy to help me. On one occasion the guy I was dealing with tried to overcharge me and it took me a bit of back and forth with him to get it straightened out, which I needed like a hole in the head at 10 pm (they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re open 24 hours, which is a rare and good thing). The staff they had working up in that executive club room were for the most part very friendly and helpful with one notable exception \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one lady who apparently was having one hell of a bad week. Cost \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We booked with this hotel thru a package on Expedia.com \u00e2\u20ac\u201c getting us the optimal set up for our long weekend. I think the room came up to around $360 or so a night, which we found similar to comparable chain hotels in that area. We chose to stay at a chain rather than an independent. Room service and restaurant costs were on a par with that part of the city.

My husband laid down to nap and shortly after, a second employee entered my room and said exactly the same thing as the first and hurriedly shut the door and left. I laid down to nap with my husband around 5:30 pm and was awoken by a phone call at 9 pm by my daughter saying some women had just called our house in upstate NY saying she had found my purse. I could not believe it. I have no doubt my purse was in my room with me before I fell asleep as I sat and put my receipts in my wallet and purse while my husband slept. I also put my cell phone on the floor by my bed so I would hear when our NYC friend called to meet up with us. That was also taken. Someone entered our room while we slept and removed these items! It was quite nerve-wracking to know that not only did someone enter my room (AGAIN!), they were right by my head while I was sleeping...what would/could have happened if one of us awoke? o_0 Hotel security was of no help. The Front Desk manager(s) were of no help. They would not call the police for me and made me find and walk to the nearest precinct. The Manhattan MIdtown South Precinct wanted to know why I did not call 911 to report the robbery and I told them the Radission said I could not and had to walk down to the Precinct. The Police told me they were well aware of the Raddision Martinique management being obnoxious in this way and not wanting the police in their lobby to reflect poorly on the other guest. I found this to be outrageous. When I confronted the head of security about this, he stated that it was not an emergency so I could not use 911 regardless of what the police told me. For real. The conference meeting planner made the hotel give me a new room with a lot of arguing as they did not want to. One the last day there, I received a call from security that my purse had been found outside the door to my NEW room. Security refused to discuss the investigation with my or why two of their employees would try to enter my room without knocking or anything. They would not give me a printout of the information for my company...nothing. My personal feeling is that it was definitely an \"inside\" job and the hotel will do anything to just shut you up till you go away. They don't want to hear anything that reflects badly on them.

Two complaint though; 1) the hotel has a wireless network rather than a cabled solution for guest room Internet access.

The Service Cleaning was very good, room service was quick, the front desk new what they were doing and were very accommodating.

So I packed my laptop up and headed to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business Center.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Business Center was packed with people. I went to the counter to ask for assistance and the guy told me that he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affiliated with the Business Center (even though he was the only employee in the tiny room) and that they Business Center was comprised only of the three computers along the wall. However, I observed these three computers were currently being used by three 12 year old boys playing games on the internet. Maybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just me, but I think the Business Center should be reserved for Business Guests\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Anyway, I told the guy behind the counter that the Wifi in my room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work and he told me to tell the front desk. The problem is that there were about 20 people in line to check in at the front desk. So I went back upstairs to call the front desk and tried to tell them what was going on. When she answered the phone I could hear in her voice that she was quite annoyed I kept calling. I was pretty frustrated by this point too and asked to talk to the hotel manager and guess what, they hotel operator HUNG UP ON ME!! Either that or the broken hotel phone disconnected me. I am not sure which. I ended up across the street at some shady internet caf\u00c3\u00a9 so that I could do my work. I will never, ever stay at another Radisson.

After a $45 taxi cab ride which is the set price between JFK and Manhattan we arrived at the Radisson. After reading the reviews we were very sceptical but we found the entrance and reception quite bright and welcoming. No smell of smoke or must. All the staff were excellent and very welcoming. Check in was okay but I can imagine when a few people arrive it is slow. We then went to the 'infamously slow' lifts expecting a snails pace speed. We found them fine. I am not sure what other people are judging them by the term \"slow\" possibly by their own impatience. We were on the 5th floor so the ride was quick. There were three lifts, two working with the middle one having a notice to guests apologising whilst they were being upgraded. I imagine when more people stay at the hotel the lifts have to stop more frequently ten or twenty more seconds extra wait - wow!. I think some people have not seen the speed of the lifts in Las Vegas, now that is slow ! Or perhaps they are judging the speed by the one in the Empire State Building ! The room was clean and adequate. I would say on European standards of an average size. It was a queen size bed and very firm and comfy, which we were glad of as we hate softy spongy beds where you sink and roll together. Firmer the better. Bathroom was small but not tiny and shower was good. Plenty of hot water. View was not great and let little light into the room (see pics) but you dont go to NY to stay in your room. It was surprisingly quiet despite being in such a busy location. We heard the odd police siren but no traffic noise and the only noise we did hear occasionally was the \"ping\" of the lift arriving on our floor. I do agree that the whole hotel could do with decorating and a facelift but it is not as bad as the reviews previous make out. I would imagine there is the odd problem but our stay was fine. We did not try the restaurant downstairs but it was always busy. Oh and the mini-bar. It makes a right racket. So we simply unplugged it during the night and plugged it back in at morning. Ahh, much better. As for the location, it was excellent what more could you want. Macy's across the road two blocks up (bout 5 minutes walk), Times Square about 15 minutes walk or amble as we would do. Central Park was only 25-30 minutes away. Empire state building literally round the back of the block the hotel is situated in. As for food we did not find breakfast that easy to find. There was Speedy's across the road for fast food type breakfast, Cafe Metro and Paks Wholesome food a little up from Macy's. All had good cheap breakfast on offer, tables to sit at but no waitress service. We did go to Andrews Coffee shop, corner of 34th St and 7th Ave back of Macy's to offer a good sit down waitress service. It was pricier than the others but we preferred it. Also worthy of a mention is Ruby Tuesdays on 7th Avenue near Times Square, cafe downstairs and restaurant upstairs. Very good food and service, good price. If you want to splash out then visit Bobby Vans Steakhouse on 50th Street. Our flight was due to leave on the Sunday at 8.40pm so we checked out at 10.30am. We had prepaid our hotel bill on CheapHotels.co.uk to get a good rate so when we checked out there was nothing to pay. We did not even have to pay for the US Paper deliverd each morning. We left our suitcases with the bellboy. They gave us a ticket and put them in a secure room, they also ordered us a car to go to the airport for 3.45pm. On return to hotel after our last wander around our bags were brought to us. (Whilst we were there another couple had done the same thing but one of there bags was missing, not sure whether it turned up as we had left by then.) We gave them a tip and took the car to the airport (cost $55, okay $10 more than a taxi but it was a comfortable ride). I do recommend going with the Radisson if you can get a good deal like we did.

I organise corporate events and incentive travel for a living so have lots of experience in top hotels but unfortunately do not have a personal budget to match this! We did decide to pay extra for the Executive Rooms which were still excellent value for money and well worth the slightly higher room rate. This meant the rooms were large with huge beds and also (the best bit) gave us access to the Martinique Club for basic breakfast - excellent for stocking up for the day's exploration plus take out coffee to sustain us as we set out. This was brilliantly complimented by snacks and free drinks between 5pm and 7pm. Chance to relax in the spacious lounge, re-charge for the evening's adventures and plan for the next day. Don't expect gourmet canapes (think cheese, biscuits and peanuts) but the atmosphere was very chilled and a good contrast to the crazy city. This brings me to the location which was AMAZING. Walking distance to many major sites and access to Penn station meant that the whole city was just a few subway stops away. Shopping, eating, Times Square, Broadway shows, Madison Square Gardens and the Empire State Building all an easy walk away. Agree that the elevators were very slow but the beautiful (but hidden) Renaissance staircase is always an option if you can't wait. We did have an issue with a blocked lavatory which was quickly fixed (first time over) then, when the problem reappeared, we were moved very quickly into a new room.

How I wish they'd picked somewhere else! Right from my arrival, there were problems. My UK bank card doesn't work in a lot of places in the States, so they book / pay with their company card in advance, sending an auth fax to confirm the hotel can take payment from their card. At check in, I'm told I need to pay. Looking confused, I'm told the room was merely reserved, not paid for. After handing over my card to pay for the first night (and not even knowing if payment would be accepted or not), I headed to my room. (Eventually my company told me they had indeed sent the hotel a fax in advance - did they simply not check the fax machine, or throw it away? Who knows. The person from my company informed me that whoever they dealt with on the phone to fix the problem wasn't particularly pleasant, either). The room was tiny, the view was a brick wall with some windows in it, I couldn't control the heating (it was always boiling hot), and the two worst problems: one, the safe wouldn't work, and two, the smell of SMOKE! The room, the floor itself (and all the other floors I checked out) all reeked of a stale smoke odour. Absolutely horrible, especially as I'm a non-smoker. It seemed like every time the (very noisy) air-conditoning radiator / fan thing switched on, the smell of smoke started to blow into your room. I did hit the off switch on this, but it would always come back on. The safe? I had lots of electronic gear with me, and NEED a safe as I'm in and out of the hotel a lot...don't want to carry it with me. Lots of back and forth action commences, with a guy coming up and failing to fix it, then I was moved into another room, then told to wait for the same guy (who failed to show up). Rang the front desk numerous times - eventually he arrives and tells me the safe in the ORIGINAL room is now working. Had to move back downstairs - something like FOUR HOURS were wasted during all of this nonsense. I was there for something like three nights - by the final night, I was having problems breathing properly, I felt out of breath and my throat was killing - presumably because of the endless stench of stale smoke filling the room. I'd been up since 6AM because of work, had to be on a train early the next morning and it was now after 10PM and I was pretty annoyed. Went downstairs, demanded a new room only to be told it was pretty much booked out, \"would you like me to spray your room with air freshener\"? Surely, that has to be a joke. I persisted, and was told they could take up a dehumidifier. Ok, sure. But...\"you can't be in the room when its on, and it'll need to be on for around at least half an hour\". Yep, I was supposed to walk around New York after 10PM at night while they messed around with dehumidifers. I persisted some more - eventually got moved to a new room where I was promised there wouldn't be a smell. Sadly, I wasn't in there long before the smell was back again, and to top it off, the toilet seemed to be stuck flushing and there was only cold water in the shower. My chest still feels a bit wheezy even now. When I mentioned all of this to the hotel I stayed in during my time in DC, the girl at the desk rolled her eyes like she knew all about the problems people have at this hotel.

The beds are reasonably comfy, and the shower is fantastic. Our biggest gripe with this hotel was getting a late check out. Our flight back to the UK didnt leave until 7pm and we wanted to check out late so we could sleep in before the seemingly endless journey home.

After popping out for some last minute shopping as we were now awake anyway, we returned to the hotel at 1pm to find we had been locked out of the room we had paid the $95 for. Very frustrating.

It is difficult to walk out of your hotel in the morning trying to avoid the hoard of tourists who clamber every inch of the pavement. Hustle and bustle is at its premium. Because it is so near the touristy areas, there is little in the way of bars and restaurants nearby. In fact the immediate area outside of the hotel is a bit dingy, so it is a case of having to get on a subway or taxi to either Greenwich Village (which was lovely) or uptown.

It is quieter, slightly more geared up for the more discerning tourist and there are loads of lively bars and restaurants.

On the whole we would thouroughly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a good travellers hotel in New York.

We turned up just before 4pm & booked in straight away & went to our room on the sixth floor. I had asked for a quiet room because of other reviews, the room was fine & a reasonable size but had no view. This was our first visit to New York so we weren't too bothered as long as the room was clean. First impressions were not that good, the lobby was small & very busy with a lot of flight crew. The bar & restaurant was all very open & could do to be sectioned off to give a more intimate feel. We had a meal that night in the hotel & were happy with the service & quality. The following morning we had breakfast at the 1st floor restaurant. $15 for the buffet was more than we needed but the service & food we had was ok. We did see one of the waiters completely ignore a guest & refuse to even discuss there request. There did seem to be a bit of tension so I can't comment on what lead up to this but no one forced these people to become waiters or work in the service industry & to ignore the very people who contribute to there wages by staying in the hotel is completely unacceptable. We decided that we would eat out after this. On consecutive days we had to chase housekeeping as our room hadn't been cleaned by late afternoon, this was after informing them earlier in the day. On one occasion we talked to housekeeping twice & then contacting the reception desk. The mini bar, which we found to be fine & offered $15 credit if you spent $15, was never restocked the whole of our stay. Check your bill on departure as the $15 credit wasn't included in our bill but was deducted when pointed out, I put it down to an oversight. We found the concierge to be very helpful & used them to book tickets to the Empire State & Statue of Liberty (take the advice, get there early to beat the queues). The best thing about the hotel is its location, come out of the hotel & turn right onto Broadway & Macys, turn left & walk to 5th Avenue. The Empire State is only a block & a half up 5th & next door is the Heartland Pub & Restaurant. This place was great for food & service, we ate here quite a lot. Times Square is a 10min walk up Broadway as is Bryant Park. We walked up Broadway to Central Park & down 5th, quite a walk but a great way to see the city, we did this several days stopping for lunch & visiting stores. The restaurant in Macys is worth a visit any time but especially for breakfast as is Andrews Coffee Shop & the Brooklyn Diner. We had lunch at the Stage Deli, it was ok but could do with a make over & is maybe living on its reputation. If you go to Macys make sure to pick up an International Savings Card for 11% discount. This review may not sound very good about the hotel but to be honest it's not as bad as some of the other reviews & most of the staff were very friendly & helpful. The location is excellent & we felt very safe especially at night when security check everyone coming into the hotel. When we go back to NYC we will probably try another hotel but would be happy to stay here again. If you go for New Year as a couple or group of friends then try to stay right in Times Square, after 6pm you can't get near.

For Minnesotans like us they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the hometown hotel chain and we desperately want them to succeed. Unfortunately, too often they end up being a step (Or two. Or three) behind their peers at Hilton or Crowne Plaza. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the Radisson Martinique was such a nice surprise. All of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elements we experienced were well maintained and perfectly acceptable. The lobby: Least impressive of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attributes was the lobby. The small lobby is entered off 32nd street and while it was not crowded while we were there, I can see it becoming a zoo if a large group was checking in or out. The business center: We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring the laptop (We wanted to take a weekend off work) so we never tried the in-room internet. But we did check our e-mail using the free computers in the small business center off the lobby. Bonus to the hotel for not charging. The fitness center: Tiny. And under equipped. Still, there was a stylish and recently remodeled one available in the basement. And given the space limitations in Manhattan, a gym that would be underwhelming anywhere else was acceptable. Restaurant: While we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat there, the restaurant appeared stylish and even had a separate entrance on Broadway. Across the street is the Manhattan Mall which has a decent food court on the basement level. Location: Outstanding. Seriously top notch. Exiting the lobby you have to watch your step or you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll fall into a subway entrance. (34th street on the yellow lines.) The hotel is only a few blocks from Penn Station. Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is a block away, the Manhattan Mall is across the street and Times Square is a 10 minute walk north. The room: Fine and a generous size for Manhattan. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not certain exactly what type of room we ended up in, but we were very satisfied with what we got. We had reserved a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbasic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room using a free stay coupon. I suspect we were upgraded (The clerk had to ask a manager before putting us in it). We ended up on the 16th floor in a room with a small kitchenette area and recently remodeled d\u00c3\u00a9cor. We saw no signs of wear in the room at all. For that matter, the we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any wear in the hotel. Our complaints were a matter of personal style more than any deficiency with the hotel. We prefer the stylish urban earth tones that Hyatt and W emphasize. The Radisson, however, was done in the upscale suburban Atlanta d\u00c3\u00a9cor that Marriott seems to prefer. Our king size bed was a Sleep Number with clean white bedding. While we want to love the Sleep Number bed (another Minnesota company), we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. The first time I slept in one I was alone and it was fine. But as a couple\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6alas, it seemed designed to push us apart. There seems to be a ridge running down the center and along the edges as well. So no matter how you adjust the mattress firmness you still fell like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sleeping in a pair of shallow boxes. The room had a pullout couch and a TV with no armoire. Had we pulled the couch out we would have needed to climb over it to get from one end of the room to the other. Finally there was a small alcove area with no door that served as the closet. The most disappointing part of the room was that the view was of an airshaft. Still, we had two windows to view it from. I asked the maid if all of the rooms were renovated and she told me \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, not all are.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, the front desk told me that all rooms had indeed been renovated. I would tend to believe the maid. So I suggest asking for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153recently\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd renovated room. I suspect the nicest rooms have the Sleep Number beds in them. Pity. The bathroom: Fine. And average. The sink was marble and we had a tub, but it was still a little cramped. It came stocked with the full compliment of Asira toiletries (Which seems to be the Radisson house brand as well as a knock off of Aveda toiletries. Which is, in turn, another Minnesota company. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bet you had no idea how many Minnesota companies there are!) The staff: No complaints. We were not allowed to check in immediately upon arrival at noon, but they had a room for us by 2pm. And while I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call the front desk staff \u00e2\u20ac\u0153warm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t openly hostile and did their jobs efficiently. One thing worth noting is the hotel entrance policy. At night they really do check to make certain you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a guest as you walk in. Even at midnight we were asked to show our key. Some might find this comforting although I personally was irritated by it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not like a prostitute could get into the hotel and conduct business. Not with Sleep Number beds in the room preventing it. Overall: A perfectly sane choice in New York. We found it to be clean, renovated and containing all of the required amenities.

First the good... The room was not large, but not tiny either, as many in NYC are. The room was quiet, no problems with either street noise nor with staff & guest noise. It was decently furnished, and well-located just off Herald Square. That said, a slew of service issues will keep me from returning. The biggest problem for me was that the in-room wireless internet was nearly unusable (#1). Despite an \"excellent\" signal and an 11 mbps connection, most web sites were very slow to respond and many timed out. I called the front desk, and they gave me the toll free number for help, but I couldn't write it down, because there was no pen in the room (#2). Three calls to the help line over two days failed to resolve the problem, which they admitted was on their end. I thought I might try dial-up instead, but nowere in the room was the usual card showing local phone costs (#3). Inquiring at the front desk, I was told the rates, and per-minute charges on local calls start after just 10 minutes (#4). That could have made for an unpleasant surprise at checkout. There were other service problems besides the telecom. When I checked into the room, half the lamps were unplugged (#5). The lightswitch by the door did not control any lights, but did shut off power to the alarm clock (#6). And the housekeeping always shut off all the lights, so on return, you had to walk thru a dark room to find a lamp to turn on. On my 2nd day, I got back after work to find a light on, only because my room had not been serviced at all (#7). They promised to send housekeeping right up, but it was almost an hour before they came. I expect issues like these at lesser independent hotels around Manhattan, but for a national chain, that is priced comparably to the Marriott's and Sheratons on the island, it's disappointing. I will look elsewhere for my next NYC trip.", "Date": "October 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucks", "Title": "\u201cAn Ok Hotel, but ...\u201d", "Author": "PeterGW", "ReviewID": "UR5971041", "Content": "The Martinique on Broadway is a well located midtown hotel, one block away from the Empire State and Macys.

When we returned the receptionist still had a struggle to find us a room. Overall the reception desk was not a welcoming experience. The room we had was a triple. It was small, containing two narrow double beds. Decor was a little tired and the bathroom had seen better days. The good news was that it was at the rear of the hotel away from the traffic noise. Avoid the mini-bar - $3.25 for a can of soda! There is a Duane Reade drugstore virtually next door charging the proper prices. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was adequate, but expensive.

Once we returned we quickly got to our room which did have the odour of smoke but we were too tired to call down to get it changed. Caveat emptor. Of note the hotel is in the area known as Little Korea to the locals; a few streets surrounding have Korean groceries/cosmetics stores etc which were interesting. These did not impact on our stay in any way. We saw an asian action movie being shot at 4am on the street in front of the hotel!

It's a very busy section on NYC, much like the craziness of Time Square with a more urban, youthful demographic. It's a unique and interesting neighborhood, centrally located to the subway, Madison Square Garden, and Macy's. I got to the hotel at 5 PM an hour after the official check in time. I did check in on line the night before but one needs to stop by the desk to get the room key and show id. The small lobby was packed with airline crews and foreign tour groups. After maneuving my way through the crowd I felt fortunate their was no line to check in. I walked up to the desk which was staffed by two clerks. I said I checked in online and requested a quiet two double bedded room with a sleep number bed the hotel advertises in \"some\" of the rooms. The clerk said she only had a sleep number bed in a king bedded room. That was fine by me and actually my requests were granted. My room had a pull out sofa bed along with a comfortable, well appointed king size bed. I wanted an extra bed in case a local friend wanted to stay over. The check in clerk was a very nice woman who did mention my Priceline status upon check-in. After talking my credit card info, she pointed me to one of the two elevator banks. I was assigned Room 924 which faced inwards to a courtyard. I was nicely surprised when I opened the door. The room was large by NYC standards and had minibar, a large desk, two phones, tv, and microwave. The sofa was nice and would serve as another bed if needed. The king sleep number bed was great. The bed linens were of decent quality and the color scheme was a pleasant white with blue and yellow trim. The bed was remarkably comfortable once I figured out how to use the controls. The bathroom was fairly standard stocked with Radisson bath products. The shower/tub was clean and the towels were soft. Also, this hotel has free wi-fi in the rooms. I really like not having to pay to use the internet. There was plenty of light in the room and the curtains shut out any sunshine for good sleeping. Hotel security checked to see if I had my room key each time I entered the hotel. I appreciated that level of service especially in such a busy area. Furthermore, there is a all purpose restaurant on site, a very small fitness room with limited equipment, and a business center that I did not use. I did not order room service either. There is a good pizza place and deli up the street. Fast food places surround the hotel as well. Oh yeah the gift shop cashier acts as the conceirge. That is kind of funny to see in action but can lead to long wait when buying a newspaper or bottled water. Moreover, the air conditioner in this room could have been stronger even after a maintenance man took a look at it. In addition, the tv reception could have been clearer. I wish the elevators ran faster and where a bit larger too. Yet, in spite of the busy neighborhood and some small little things, this hotel was a winner for me. I got it for $150 a night but noticed another bidder got this property for $135 on the same nights as my stay. His post was closer to the date of our arrival. The Radisson Martique on Broadway is a well run, nicely kept three star quality hotel. It is not as nice as the Hilton Times Square which is a four star property but certainly superior to the small pathetic rooms at the three star Paramount. If the Radisson Martique remains on PL, I would continue to avoid 3* MTW and bid 3* MTS along with a few other zones. I would be very happy to stay at the Radisson Martinque on Broadway.

The room itself looked more like a Holiday Inn in Cinncinnatti or Altoona, Pa. than a Radisson in mid-town Manhattan. Soft pillows, only two, and a hard bed. Overall, very sparse. This is disappointing considering I stayed at a different Raddisson only a week earlier. The other one was at, I believe 50th or 51st and 3rd Ave. Much better, cleaner, etc. So, this hotel should be a second tier choice or choice of last resort if you plan on spending ANY time at all in the hotel/your room.

Our trip to NYC was her highschool graduation gift. We too were surprised to learn that the hotel had changed names from the Holiday Inn to the Raddison that very day. I was very nervous when we arrived, afraid our reservations would be lost in \"change-over\" land, but they weren't. Everything was set up as we planned. We didn't arrive until after 8:00 p.m., so I am guessing we missed all of the commotion and delays those arriving earlier in the day encounted (I guess it is a good thing the airline lost our luggage :). Our room was on the eleventh floor. Frustrated from dealing with the airline over lost luggage. We were just happy to have a room! The location was great, and the doorman was very helpful in pointing us in the right direction of a close, good, and not too expensive restuarant for dinner. We found Walgreen's around the corner, loaded up on basics - in hopes our luggage would arrive the next day. Walked back to the hotel and turned in for the night. All night long we heard the toilet cut on and run for about 30 seconds every five minutes or so ..... very annoying. We learned quickly to close the door so not hear that. The next morning, we were pleased to find out that our luggage had been delivered by the airline during the night, so after a quick trip downstairs to get our luggage we were ready to shower and prepare for our adventures in NYC. Well .... no washcloths, we made do for the morning, and called down to the front desk to have them bring some up when they cleaned our room. When we returned to the room later in the day to shower, and freshen up for a show we were going to see - still no wash cloths. So, I again called housekeeping, they said they would bring some up... waited for 45 minutes, and again had to make do - or miss our show. Before leaving the room, I made a call to the front desk to complain about the wash cloths - he mentioned that they were running short on these, but would try to get some up to us. Oh, and did I forget to mention, the tub would not drain, by the time you finished showering you were standing ankle deep in water. Called 3 times about this, and they toilet that nearly overflowed 3 times before someone came to work on it. By the last day we had wash clotths, a tub that would drain, and a toilet that would flush ... oh the luxuries! I did like the fact that they always asked for a room key when we would come through the door, assuring that only hotel guests gained entry. This did make me feel safer. The subway entrance/exit right outside the door was extremely convenient, once we figured out how to come out there (2 days after arrival - apparently we were walking the wrong way when we exited the train). We didn't use cabs at all while we were there, we used the subway and had no problems getting around. Because of the great location we were able to walk to time square, etc. We would ride the subway, and if it was late and we didn't want to ride the subway back to the hotel late at night (after 11:00 p.m.), we were very comfortable walking to the hotel. The hotel was clean, the staff was very courteous, I felt safe, but the small inconveniences of the washcloths, tub and toilet issues made our stay frustrating, and less than great. We didn't spend a lot of time in our room - on the go constantly, but we did expect to have the basics, and have them in working order when we were in the room.", "Date": "July 19, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Radisson Martinique on Broadway", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d99425-Reviews-Radisson_Martinique_on_Broadway-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$257 - $496*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">49 West 32nd Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10001</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "99425", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/1d/0a/97/radisson-martinique-on.jpg"}}

This was a last minute trade of my time share through Interval International. The resort is in a nice location, and, for us anyway, was a good location, located close to Interstate 4 for the things that we did - which didn't include Disney World - although it is very close should that be on someone's agenda. It's a nice trip to Tampa/Clearwater Beach (westbound), and the Kennedy Space Center/Cocoa Beach (eastbound), as well as being close to Celebration, FL. (The Disney planned community - think the Jim Carrey movie \"Truman\"). Parkway is not a destination resort. That being said, we found that the staff was pretty helpful and mostly very friendly. The condo itself was nice and comfortable, and the unit that we stayed in backed up to the forested area between the Parkway Resort and the Vacation Villages. It was quiet, and the screened in patio allowed us to eat all of our meals outside, watch the birds, squirrels, geckos, snails, and listen to other birds and frogs. The pool was more than adequate, and during our time there, not very crowded. However, the food at the Kenya Kafe -which is at the pool - left a little to be desired (not a great variety and nothing truly healthy), but under the circumstances, it wasn't too bad. The little walkways through the forested areas were very pleasant, and there was a little educational material, and one leads to a strip mall with a few restaurants. The down side: these are really minimal. The fitness room left a lot to be desired. The weight machine is a piece of junk. Clearly the room was created as an after thought, and all of the equipment was stuffed into a very small space. The condo itself could use better lighting. While they were using flourescent lights - this is good - they could still use higher wattage. The low wattage and some of the dark colors left the condo a little dark. The frig (at least in our unit) should have the door reversed (and it can be done - it is built for that change) so that you can get into it without having to step into the laundry room in order to open the door and remove things. The Wi-Fi internet access is expensive. Really this should be free. I am really! The resort could use a good recycling program. Maybe recycling is not that big in Florida, but we had a great deal of recyclable materials from the grocery store, and I don't think that any of it will be recycled. (I hope that I'm wrong - and I admit I didn't ask). This could be simply accomplished management! Would I stay there again? Possibly, depending on what I wanted to do in central Florida. I'd call this a 3 star.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maple Grove", "Title": "\u201cAwesome 10 Night Stay\u201d", "Author": "karen45", "ReviewID": "UR127205038", "Content": "We checked in on Thursday, March 22nd and stayed for 10 nights in Nairobi 308. I had called a couple of months ahead of time with 3 requests: a renovated room, a room on the top floor (we were burned a couple of times with kids running in rooms above us at other timeshares), and the type of room where the toilet area was in its own room. We received all three plus we were put in a room where the pool was just out our back door! Maybe because we checked in on a Thursday afternoon we had no one ask us about a timeshare presentation? We did receive a phone message and a notice about it but we ignored both of them with no problems at all. We were very pleased with our unit -- the photos posted by others are exactly what you will have. Thanks to other reviews I brought a small shower caddy as I knew there would not be anywhere to place things in the shower. Everything was in working order and the screened porch was a great place to dry swimwear and pool towels. The only thing I found strange is that there was not a door seperating the master bedroom and the master bathroom so whoever got up first woke up the late sleeper! The location cannot be beat! Very close to Disney, not too far to Universal and TONS of restaurants very near by. There is a Target store a couple of miles away and we took advantage of it several times. We usually do not spend a lot of time at a pool (too busy on rides) but after one trip to the pool at Parkway we were hooked! The water was very refreshing and there were plenty of places to sit by the pool. We did not try the Kenya Kafe but the food looked good. The washer/dryer in the unit was great--for once I did not bring 3 suitcases of dirty laundry home! We would throw towels in and run the washer in the morning before we left for the parks and then threw them in the dryer at night. I love not having to worry about people entering our unit and making our own beds is not a big deal...I mean does it take more than 3 minutes? We did use the oven to reheat some leftover pizza and we used the toaster but other than that there was no cooking done in our unit :) !! We had plenty of space to spread out and the 3 tv's were great (I'm not a big basketball fan and 24/7 ESPN is not my style). The two tv's in the bedrooms are a tad bit older but no big deal. I did not go on vacation to watch tv!! I also appreciated the tile floors throughout the unit (except for the bedrooms) as I feel it is much cleaner. The beds were really comfortable and we slept like logs. Others complained about the noisy airconditioner outside the 2nd bedroom but my daughter likes white noise and this lulled her to sleep every night. My wishes for this condo? A nightstand in the master bedroom please. I made do by bringing a stool from the kitchen counter into the bedroom. A list of \"to do's\" for checking out -- I had to ask what they wanted us to do. A printer in the room that housed computers would be great too. The front desk people were super nice and let us print our boarding passes there. The area is very nice and not as sketchy as some areas of Kissimmee. Can't wait for more vacation time in Florida and we will definately be back!!", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Rapids, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cstayed there in Dec of 2010 and LOVED it\u201d", "Author": "heather h", "ReviewID": "UR126811148", "Content": "this place was awesome..we checked in at night and were so tired from driving all the way from Michigan to Florida and the motel we stayed at the following night was just plain nasty..this place exceeded our expectations..it was a beautiful 2 bedroom with 2 bathrooms with a jetted tub in the master bedroom with a separate shower and a private balcony entrance from our bedroom..the other bedroom had two beds and a pull out couch..only complaint was the pull out couch was not comfortable at all. it was close to the main strip of stores and restaurants and the kitchen is fully stocked so making breakfast there saved us a lot of money. the grounds were beautiful and the scenic trail bridge was playing cool music as you walked..had a pool and a hot tub and a bar..the bar wasn't open though in DEC..we didn't get a chance to swim because it was still a bit cold outside and we were to busy at universal..this is a timeshare and they do ask you to take there tour but we just opted out of it and never felt pressured..the jetted tub was awesome after a long day at the parks.i was pregnant and my feet were killing me and this was the perfect end to the night..the price was great too..this place is a total GEM ..go there and you will NOT be disappointed", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hedgesville, West Virginia", "Title": "\u201cbeen going for 12 years\u201d", "Author": "mary v", "ReviewID": "UR126534081", "Content": "We are actually owners here and look forward to coming every year.

Unlike other reviews we have never experienced any problems with bugs or pests, we have always found the bedding to be comfortable, rooms cleanly, kitchens supplied with adequate utensils, and specific requests adhered to whether it be for more towels or toilet paper, it is always accomodated without incident. Those who complain that this condo complex is not up to par are those who are looking for a 5 star accomodation without paying the 5 star price. Well surprise Parkway is a 3/4 star accomodation and they make no secret of this and they provide exactly this and beyond in my opinion. As far as I am concerned parkway exceeds many 3 stars I have stayed at and the price is always right. Finally parkway international is ideally located to the interstate highway which will direct you to all parks, it is conveniently located near many shopping venues, restaurants, etc. It is a quiet area perfect for families who want to come home after the hustle and bustle of a disney park and just relax.

There also were no grab bars around the tubs/showers, and I had to request a rubber tub mat because their floors are slippery. Those are minor, though. The positives are everything else! The resort is next to the Arabian Nights dinner show, and well set-back from Rte. 192/Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway, and easy to get to and from DW, I-4, I-Drive, etc. It\u2019s a short drive to area attractions; and the resort itself is beautiful, serene and quiet with pretty and consistent themeing throughout, and ALL the units are 2-bedrooms and 2-bathrooms. The suite itself: If you can, imagine the general layout as two large rectangles side-by-side \u2013 the bedrooms/bathrooms/lanai to the left, the living room/ kitchen/ laundry on the right. You enter into a small foyer/corridor; to your left is the smaller bedroom and bathroom; to your right is a small coat closet. You walk into the short corridor a few feet; the kitchen and laundry nook on your right, l/r in front of you, and master bedroom/bath to your left. The smaller bedroom contains two single (twin) beds with a storage nightstand between them, with a lamp; also a t.v./storage armoire and a closet. The 2nd bathroom is split. First you come to the mirrored vanity/sink with storage cabinets/drawers beneath; to the left of that (behind the smaller bedroom) is the smaller room with the commode and shower/tub, with a small nook with a few built-in shelves. The master bedroom contains a K bed with 2 storage-nightstands, and a t.v. and storage armoire. The master bathroom contains a whirlpool tub, commode, separate stall shower w/ a door, and a large mirrored vanity/sink with storage cabinets and drawers below. The beds were heavenly. We do not like soft mattresses, and these were just a little softer than what we have at home, very comfortable for both of us. I\u2019m not thrilled with the soft pillows, but I\u2019ve come to expect them at hotels so I just deal with them. Tip: I\u2019ve learned that we like dark rooms, and that most hotel drapes do not close completely, so I\u2019ve learned to pack a few binder-clips to solve this problem. A bonus is that the clips can also be used as snack-bag clips ;). To the right is the fully-equipped kitchen: full-size fridge with ice-maker, smooth cooktop/electric oven, m/w, d/w, toaster, blender, double-sink with sprayer, and fire extinguisher (you never know \u2026). Basic cooking needs: set of pots/pans and cooking utensils, glass measurer and measuring spoons, corkscrew, ice bucket, can opener, cutting board, and a set of knives in a block. Also there were 3 oven-proof and m/w-able glass baking pans, two rectangular and one round with a lid, dishes and lots of glassware for dining, as well as dining utensils, a 2-qt. pitcher and four placemats. The phone is also in the kitchen. There is a breakfast counter with two stools, plus a large dining table with four chairs. (There are also several artificial floral arrangements in the suite, and a statue of a tiger on top of the l/r entertainment armoire!) In the back of the kitchen (which would also be behind the entry door) is the laundry nook which contains a stacked washer and dryer. As with other timeshares, you get a starter-pack when you check-in (several rolls of bathroom tissue, facial tissues, hand soap, bath, hand towels and washcloths; a kitchen towel and dishcloth, 2 potholders, a sponge, dish detergent for hand-washing dishes, 2 packs of d/w detergent, a roll of paper towels, 2 packets of laundry detergent, and 6 pool towels. If you need more of anything, you just call the front desk and they send it right over. I requested a rubber tub-mat around 9:30 the first night and it arrived within 20 minutes. (I\u2019m assuming this is a positive indication of the level of service; we had no other service needs other than internet issues, which are handled by an outside company.) They also give you an option for fresh towels. You can launder them in your suite as needed, and/or you can opt for a towel exchange mid-week. If you choose the towel exchange, you can further opt to have your towels exchanged at their convenience (meaning they may need to enter your suite while you are out) or at your own! If you forget to fill out this form (which is in your suite at check-in), you are on your own for towel issues lol. We opted to wash our own, in their washer/dryer, using their detergent and hot water too, not too difficult a chore. In the l/r are a queen-sized sofa (that can be opened up for another bed), an easy chair and ottoman, two end tables and a coffee table, and an entertainment armoire that contains a flat-screen TV. and a DVD player (movies can be rented from the office but at $6-something, I\u2019d skip them); there is loads of storage in this piece, and on each side of this piece of furniture are end-table type ledges as well. At the far end of the L/R is the exit door to the rear; there is a small patio-type space right outside the doors, and there are board walkways throughout the rear of the resort; leading to the office, the pool, other buildings, and there is a nature trail as well! To your left is a door leading to a screened lanai (on the 2nd floor, this would be a balcony) with a patio set (table and four chairs). Dh loved this space. He used it to set up our Halloween decorations \u2013 a ginormous inflatable Mickey-Pumpkin, two strings of lighted (small) Mickey-pumpkins, a Disney garland, and small lighted Mickey-ghost and Mickey-pumpkin statuettes. People passing by loved it, especially kids lol. Other notes re. the rooms: if you request a unit in buildings A, B, or D, you\u2019ll be less than a half-block walk to the pool. Also, the theme is \u201crustic resort\u201d and like Disney\u2019s Fort Wilderness Lodge and Animal Kingdom Lodge buildings, with their (appropriate) darker colored motifs and surrounding lush foliage, makes for more dimly-lit rooms. The suite, and in fact the entire resort as well, were clean throughout, and very well kept/maintained. We did visit the pool one afternoon, but it wasn\u2019t quite warm enough to stay in long; we then moved over to the hot tub which was better! Tip: by 3:00 p.m., the pool becomes mostly shaded, so you may feel chilly when exiting the water (depending on when you visit, of course). We came here on an Interval International Getaway (timeshare exchange company), but even if we\u2019d exchanged, I think this is an excellent resort and a great value; I would not hesitate to stay here again. BTW, if you\u2019re going to stay at timeshare resorts, you have to realize that they do not offer daily maid service (some provide it for an extra fee); also you will be solicited to attend a presentation to invite your ownership in the resort you are staying at. However they usually offer you some kind of remuneration for your time \u2013 a gift card, show or park tickets, a meal, discounts, or even cold hard cash. If you do not want to participate in this, you simply just tell the solicitor such when approached. Timeshare solicitors also have kiosks throughout the Orlando and Kissimmee areas, at restaurants, malls, etc. I didn't post any pictures of my own because the pictures on the resort's website are better and more importantly, are an accurate depiction of the resort itself.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cLoved staying at Parkway International!\u201d", "Author": "lisale", "ReviewID": "UR120048998", "Content": "We stayed 11 nights at the Parkway International in early October.

Checking out Sept 2nd. The resort which is really just a few buildings and one pool, oh, yeah, and a tennis court was pretty empty and despite my requests to be near the pool ( I am handicapped and cannot walk more than 100 feet without assistance,) I was put in building G. The pool is behind building A. The front desk said\" its just a walk around the buildings, not to bad of a walk\". I said I cannot walk that far. 500 yards or whatever, anthing more than 100 feet , its all too hard for me. I understand it is hard for people to realize that a chubby healthy looking woman who seems to have no disabilities - has a disability. I have COPD, and several herniated discs which make it extremely painful to walk more than a few steps at a time. Of course I understand requesting a room near a pool is only a request, but most hotels try to be accomodating. I was told a note was put in the computer to try to get me a room closer. From what I understand , the male at front desk didnt put a note in or try to get me a closer room. I made a few calls to the front desk, each time getting someone else, assuring me they would try to move me. Getting in my car and driving to the pool was a joke! You are soaking wet and make your seats in your car wet and then they smell up the car like mildew!! Finally on Tuesday I was moved to a room closer! IT was great, ground floor room right near the pool! I could walk out the back dooor to the pool and see my child from the patio. So , now I start seeing giant COCKROACHES! No, not the florida Palmetto bugs, these were cockroaches! Could I ask to be moved again? No. So now my dream room has roaches. Not a dream anymore. I was so concerned with my luggage and clothes and of bringing them home with me. I had to sort through all my luggage and wash and dry everything, it took me hours. I did inform the front desk about the roach problem and they did use the eco friendly company. I also did tell them about the front door. seems the bottom of the door was too high and we actually saw a roach come in under the front door. So, we were in the room far from the pool for 4 days, and couldnt utilize the pool, now in a room that had cockroaches, which really turned me off, and ruined my time. I am still hoping one of the roaches didnt hide in one of our suitcases and come home with us. We drove so they could have made the trip back here alive. THe room was nice. Actually the building G room was very nice with a huge bathroom. Building A room was a little smaller,the bath room was also smaller, with a shower that could only fit a child. Everything was nice enough. Nice kitchen, nice sized beds.but........ We stayed here a few years ago, and lke the other reviewer expected the buildings to be run down-and they weren't.

Even before we arrived, being paranoid, I emailed the resort to check on our booking and received a friendly and prompt response. We arrived very late after flight delays, but had no problems checking in, the security officer who showed us to our apartment was friendly and courteous and the check in process was quick and easy and at no point were we hassled to buy a timeshare, although if I could have afforded one I would definitely have considered it. The apartment itself was lovely - more spacious and pleasant than our home in England! All the rooms are nicely furnished, the beds are very comfortable and there is certainly every appliance and utensil that I would care to use and plenty that I didn't get around to using! I was especially delighted with the washer/dryer as I don't have a dryer at home and I found it extremely convenient and effective at getting my family's clothes dry quickly. We were in a ground floor condo so we didn't have to climb any stairs and we barely heard any noise from upstairs or next door. If I was being picky my only negative would be that we didn't have a particularly exciting view - over the tennis court and the back of the shops - maybe next time I would see if I could request a condo overlooking the pool, but really that is an extremely small thing. We did see one cockroach in our room - it was no big deal, I trapped it in a glass and put it out the door and were't bothered by any again. The complex itself is small but perfectly formed! Our kids (aged 12, 7 and 5) enjoyed the play area and loved the pool which was heated and lovely to swim in at the end of a long day at the parks. The jacuzzi was amazingly hot and relaxing. Although the pool is quite small, it was never crowded and there was always spare chairs and plenty of room in the water. The nature trail was short, but pretty although I was disappointed we saw no snakes! We did see fish and turtles and lots and lots of lizards and squirrels. Some of the boardwalk was being replaced during our stay but it caused us no problems. We found the staff friendly and pleasant whenever we encountered them. The security guards were often seen doing their rounds (even during torrential rain!) and always said hello. The staff in reception were pleasant, efficient and helpful when we went to collect our suitcases (which had missed our flight), when they sorted out a problem with our room key and on checking out. As for location, the Parkway is in a great place for visiting the Disney Parks, just 10 to 15 minutes depending on which park you're trying to get to and about 20 to 25 mins up to Seaworld and Universal. You are right next to the I4 and a short drive to International Drive. Being located on the 192 there is no shortage of places to shop and eat. You can walk to a few shops and restaurants next door to the complex although I wouldn't advise using the supermarket there as their prices are phenomenal - head up to Walmart on Vineland Road or Turkey Lake Road instead and stock up (they're open 24 hours - we went at 2am!) It is also quite close to Old Town which is worth a trip on a Friday or Saturday night to see the cars. I would recommend an evening visit to Pirate Cove mini golf - there is one just off the 192 or one at Lake Buena Vista (not Pirate Island which is next door to the Golden Corral) - it is very atmospheric and a lot of fun. There are lots of cheap restaurants nearby - I wouldn't recommend Ponderosa, but I have no complaints with Sizzler and the range at the Golden Corral is well worth the price you pay. However, if you want to eat in, there are all the cooking facilities you need in the condo. If I had eaten in more often, I might not have had so much dieting to do now I'm home! All in all, we had an excellent time and I would stay here again tomorrow. Next time we visit Orlando, this would definitely be one of my first choices.

The kitchenette area was well thought out and appeared to have everything needed for a self catering holiday should you chose to do so. We did however, have problems with both toilets, which had obviously been blocked by previous guests which meant a very early morning on our first day when the bathroom flooded when we flushed the toilet. However, a frantic call to Reception and 10 minutes later the caretaker arrived to sort it out, closely followed by the cleaner. After that we had no problems at all. We were not in Kissimmee long enough to use the facilities at the Hotel but we checked out the pool which looked good. The Hotel is extremely well situated for Sea World and the Magic Kingdom the two parks we visited. Roughly taking around 10-15 minutes to reach them.

We have owned timeshares for almost 15 years. We exchanged our Westin 2BR timeshare via Interval and selected Parkway based on the \"premier\" designation given by II. We also read the reviews which were, for the most part positive. What an inequitable trade this turned out to be. The unit was a 2 BR, 2BA - it was definitely sized well enough based on sf to accommodate our family of four. And the kitchen was well-stocked with tools, and the AC worked well but as someone else pointed out, it was right next to the second BR and very loud. We had to turn it off at night. The man who checked us in was pleasant enough. The maintenance guy who came to unlock our safe and bring us working knives was timely and helpful. But that is where the positives end. Our unit - B306 - was lacking in the cleanliness department. While dustbunnies and cobwebs are generally excusable, the following are not: used bandaids on the floor, cockroaches in the bathroom and bugs in the utensil drawers. We told the front desk about the bandaids and the cockroach on our 2nd full day. She then proceeded to tell us that she can have the room sprayed but cannot guarantee the odor. My daughter and I have breathing issues and a room full of bug spray is not what I have in mind during my vacation. She promised to get the room cleaned. They changed the towels - but cleaned it was not. More cockroaches showed up again on Friday - this time we brought them the \"dead specimen\" in a ziploc bag as well as a picture to prove that there is an issue as the first encounter did not seem to generate a serious enough response. I asked for the manager on duty the second time, who proceeded to tell me that they use a eco-friendly service (we weren't told about this the first time and the front desk should have advised their managers of the issue the first time) and she will get them out right away. Should we have left or asked for a different room? Perhaps we should have after the first time but I trusted that they would take care of the problem the first time. After the second encounter - we only had 1 full day left and repacking and moving would have taken too much precious time. The Master Bath was an afterthought. Sure it had a jacuzzi tub - which I guess is a must for all the MBRs nowadays, but they forgot the shower, so a pre-fab shower unit was installed at the corner - no room to bend if you drop anything. A more comfortable shower would have been more useful than the giant 2 person tub. There was one sink, but no countertop and nowhere to hang our toiletries - we had to use the tub wall to store our toiletries. The Master bath was very dark - either they need to change the lightbulbs or add more, but it was dark. There were more switches than there were light fixtures. The second bath was more usable than the Master. The pool area needs updating. After the cleaning issues with our unit, we were quite uncomfortable trying out the pool and the hot tub. When I told the front desk we were in the process of checking out and I wanted to get a receipt to make sure we were not charged for anything, she gave me a rather funny look when I wouldn't give her my room key and explained we were still packing. She proceeded to tell me in a rather snobbish manner that I was not checked out until I turned in my room key. Seriously??? I know there are others that raved about this place.

Since we had additional people coming with us we were looking for something a little cheaper and Parkway International Resort was perfect. The resort is in a better location than Liki Tiki. It also does not have the water park that Liki Tiki has. Honestly the thing they call a water park is a slide and water fall located in a pool. When I booked my room I requested a poolside and/or first floor room. Needless to say I didn't get either of my request. The lady at guest services advised me that I could stay in the room provided for one night and then she could get me in another room the next day. That didn't work for me so I just stayed in the room provided for me in the Kilamanjaro building 2nd floor room. The Kilamanjaro Building is located across the parking lot from the pool. It takes about 3 mins to get to the pool area so everything turned out ok. My favorite thing about the resort is the pool area. The resort is very small so the pool was never overcrowded and I could always swim without worrying that I was going to bump into someone. I spent several days at the area and my 3 year old son enjoyed it very much. There is a nice park right beside the kiddie pool. My son went back and forth with ease and I was able to see him at all times. Plus the area is gated! The bar/grill is also located beside the kiddie pool. You don't have to worry about bringing any money to the pool because they will charge it to the room. We loved the chicken nuggets in fish batter, nachos and all the spirits. The pool closed at 11 which is very late for most hotels/resorts. The bar only stayed open to around 6 though...I'm assuming this changes in the summer time. There is also a small game room in this area too. There were activities for kids and adults in the area. They played bingo and black jack for money and there were a lot of kiddie activities that my child was too young for. To top off the area they played island music and even had a performer at times. On top of the beautiful pool area the rooms did not disappoint. The living room had a pull out sofa and if you pushed the tables against the wall, there is enough space to add 2 queen size blow up mattresses (one on each side of the pull out couch). There was a nice screened patio with ceiling fan and had a view of a parking lot and trees. We saw 3 raccoons looking for food while we were out on the patio. There was also a grill that was easily accessible by the extra set of stairs for the back of the building. The master room had a king size bed and a patio door for immediate access to the patio. We had new mattresses too...of course I checked. The bathroom had a jetted pool and an additional area for toilet. This was very helpful because someone would go to the bathroom and shut the door and not hold up other people from brushing their teeth etc. I did clean the bathroom but I always do at hotels. The jetted pool had sand in the jets. It took me 15 mins to clean the tub. I believe the people before us went to the beach and the cleaning lady didn't notice the additional sand. The 2nd bedroom was smaller and had an outdated TV but who cares. The twin beds had wheels on them so it was very easy to push them together to make a full size bed. The 2nd room had the water heater in the closet so the room was warm even when the rest of the hotel was freezing. The 2nd bath was ok but I didn't used it. There were no complaints from any members in my party about the 2nd bathroom. I did not see any bugs but my sister explained that she saw an unidentified spider with fur in the room. She killed it and she didn't see any thing else. Kitchen had everything you would need but a small frying pan for eggs. We brought dish washer and laundry detergent and didn't use it. The only thing that they didn't provide was hand soap...so I will be sure to bring it next year. We used the dish detergent that they provided. Washer and dryer are small but served it purpose. We did not use the oven so no comment there. The free breakfast/time share speech is ok if you want to get the 20 dollars off your multiple day passes to the park. They also offer you $100 gift card if you do not want the discount on the ticket. Why not get the money before you leave? If you tell them no they do leave you alone though. Another thing I like about this resort is the home feeling. Once you get there you can have guest over and they have no problem parking. I asked for the 1 hour extension for checkout and it was horrible. The maid bothered me the entire extra hour knocking on the door trying to figure out if I had left yet. She said nobody told her. I guess they need a better system. Overall this resort is just a little bit above average. If you are looking for a comfortable place to stay with privacy in your own room and the option to cook and wash clothes...stay here! Also the exercise room is a joke. They don't have a stair climber...my favorite. They do have a treadmill and elliptical though. The nature trail is a very small path and not even half a mile lol I hope this helps!", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roselle Park, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cWorst Vacation Experience Ever\u201d", "Author": "jaymvita", "ReviewID": "UR110795974", "Content": "This past April 2011, I booked several days with the Parkway through an exchange company for myself, my wife and our three daughters, aged 6,3 and 1. Upon arriving at the hotel from New Jersey at about 8:00pm in the evening, I was told by Sandra, the desk attendant, that they had no record of me or my reservation in the system. After insisting that I had a confirmation via email, I was allowed to pull up the email and prove that they did indeed have me confirmed. Sandra then proceeded to tell me that the entire resort was booked solid and that they simply had no room for me or my family. Sandra called around to sister resorts to see if they could accommodate us but they had nothing either. At this point, after a half hour of looking to see what happened, the only sure thing was that my kids were without a place to stay in Florida. Luckily, we had friends staying at the resort who offered to put us up for the night until the Parkway could sort out the mess that they had left us in. Unfortunately, they were themselves a family of four which meant that they had to rearrange their vacation plans for one night to squeeze my family of five into their two bedroom unit. Not exactly the heigh of comfort for everyone involved. The next day, the Parkway did find a room for us which was frankly enough given that we had nothing else. The room was fine except for the AC unit which sounded like a jet engine every time it went off. Unfortunately it was located right next to the kids' room which meant that it startled them every time it kicked in. The manager, Vicki tried to ease my anger and disappointment by offering me some complimentary vouchers for future stays, but in keeping with it's record of failing my family, those vouchers have yet to surface. It has been a month since we stayed there.

Our apartment was comfortable, all equipment was working and was decorated well. The sofa, however, did appear to need replacing but this appeared out of place as it seemed to be the only item in need of replacement. The air con unit outside bedroom 2 was fairly loud but this did not cause us any problems. The location is great for Disney and also convenient for other attractions. It is not a large resort and therefore does not have a wide range of facilities but the facilities it did have, seemed perfectly adequate. The staff were friendly and although there is currently a lot of painting/refurbishing going on, the workers were accommodating and we were given warning to use the back door to the apartment rather than the front as the front stairwell was being painted. The view from the apartment wasn't amazing, but wasn't unpleasant. As a sister resort, guests of Parkway International are permitted to use the water park of Liki Tiki Village. You are however required to pay for a parking pass which is $5. The Liki Tiki water park is very small (a pool and a few small slides) and although it served a purpose as part of a relaxing 1st day, we would not make the effort to go again. We also made use of the hotel Wifi access and were pleasantly surprised to find that this worked in our room, but we're not sure if it would work in every room. We paid $29.99 for 7 day access, which was worth it for what we needed it for. I believe there was a daily fee option of around $7.99 / day.

The condo is fairly dark, between the decor and the energy efficient light bulbs. The beds were very comfortable. The shower was strong and refreshing. My kids enjoyed the jacuzzi bathtub.

After complaining, we were switched to a 3rd floor room with a pool view. Finally inside our room, it was very dated and not too clean. I immediately killed a crawling bug on the kitchen floor. It had a musty odor, but a great view of the pool. The main area of the room is tiled and you will need to wear socks of shoes or else you will have dirty feet. I would recommend stripping your beds and immediately washing the bedding. The bedding at night didn't smell fresh when sleeping. The second bedroom has two twin beds and inside the closet is the hot water heated. Right outside the bedroom door is the furnace, needless to say, you don't get much sleep with all the noises from these two large units going off and on.

The bar closes early around 7 p.m. So grab some cold beer from Publix if you want to drink something by the pool after a day at the parks. Also, the pool closes quite early and I saw security shooing guests back to their rooms around 10 p.m. It is true that this place is centrally located near many activities, food and disney parks, but it certainly isn't a 3 star, more like a 2 star resort.

We were also there during a week of poor weather, although we travelers may not realize it, the weather can tilt our opinion, but I will try and not have that affect my review either. We had one week on deposit with the Resort program itself that was going to expire soon so my husband and I decided to use it for our first vacation without our boys in 15 years. (It was also the 1st time we stayed here at our home resort). For this purpose the 2 bedroom suite was a perfect size, we did not use the 2nd bedroom but the 2nd bath was a nice plus, but if we would have had our 3 boys with us, it would have been tight for us. There were not many draws offered in the master bedroom either. General info: This is a mature resort, old is not the right word as the units were all re-done within the last 5-6 years. The first building done (the building we stayed in and own in, \"C\") shows the most wear. The guests who stay at Parkway are also more mature than many other places we have stayed, some in age, all in behavior, some both. With that said it is also a great place for kids with many activities. Maybe not the best place for singles and those who enjoy a \"night-life\" or \"partying\" atmosphere. It has a laid back, festive feel, but not rowdy. Staff was fine, they where neutral about us and we were neutral about them. M-F they offer coffee, orange juice, packaged muffins or bagels, granola bars and packages of oatmeal. Not a full continental breakfast by any means, but we made good use of it. All units are 2b/2b with a king size bed in the master and 2 twins in the 2nd bedroom. I understand they can prep some rooms to have 2 king beds by putting the twins together for you. There is a mini W&D, full kitchen, dining room, living room and a screened in patio. The suite has outside entry both in front and back - loved that! The rooms are decorated in an African Motif. Nothing showed much, if any, wear and tear but neither was it \"fresh\" or \"brand new\". Well appointed kitchen. Wireless I-net is free if you own here and maybe if you own at any Island One resort, but it was pretty darn slow, even with a strong signal. The breakfast/lunch spiel after you check in and are getting your parking pass is a timeshare tour for Vacation Village at Parkway, the neighboring Resort, we own there too. We bought our 2b/2b there from private owners, but we did do the timeshare tour at VV@P about a year ago and it was one of the most horrible experiences of our life, we will never do it again! This is a timeshare resort and like all the timeshare resorts we have stayed in, daily housekeeping does not come standard, so be prepared to make your own bed. Supplies we found in our room: TP Paper Towels Kleenex Trash Bags Liquid dish detergent 2 single size packs of dishwasher detergent 1 single size washing machine detergent (we use and are happy with the 2-n-1 wash & dry sheets) 1 Caf & 1 D-caf coffee Sugar/Sweetener packages & powered creamer packages Small soap bars Pros: \u2022 Location, location, location - just east of I-4, it is only minutes from Disney and a short jog up I-4 to Seaworld, Discovery Cove, Universal, etc. Publix is just a couple blocks west and about every place you can imagine to eat is within a 5 minute drive. \u2022 Quiet - you might think that a resort so close to a main drag and interstate would have a traffic noise problem, but the lush vegetation totally insulates out all traffic noise! \u2022 Attractive grounds - really one of the best, mostly natural landscapes we have seen. The nature walk is a nice bonus too! \u2022 Awesome jetted tub, but do not care for it's location. I like the configuration of having a nice jetted tub where you view the bedroom and the TV versus the bathroom and bowl. \u2022 Very pretty pool area and finally a true Hot Tub! \u2022 Comfy bed but the pillows where a little too plump for me. \u2022 Not a single bug in sight. Cons: \u2022 In an effort to conserve energy, they go way over board using the energy efficient light bulbs making the entire unit way too dark! I finally had to just start leaving lights on so as to not have to wait for them to \"warm up\". \u2022 Carpet in the living room. We prefer tile. Regardless if it looks dirty or not, I always \"feel\" like carpet is dirty unless it is brand new. \u2022 No door on the laundry area so you could not close off the sound of the w&d. \u2022 TV - The size in the living room is fine, the one in the master is small (sorry, forgot to look at the 2nd b.r.), but the worst thing is the lack of selection. Only the most basic channels. Why does TV matter when in Orlando? Well when it rains, or is cold and you can't hit the pool after a day at the parks, it might be nice to wind down with a decent movie, not possible here unless you like only the oldies. But, with that said, the current rack rates to stay here may be worth the trade off. \u2022 Pool was too cool for the season, we could have swam if it where warmer. We visited the Resort where we will be staying Dec of 2011 and tested the pool temp there, it was very warm and swimmable even with weather barley hitting 60\u00ba. \u2022 The exercise room is sad, depressing and packed with way to much stuff! I love to work out, but I walked in then right back out. The resort is above \"Average\" but \"Very Good\" is not quite right either. Wish I could give it 3 1/2 stars = \"Good\".", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LaCrosse, WI", "Title": "\u201cFantastic stay here!!

Parking was right outside the door. There were tennis courts and a pool area which the kids used and enjoyed. There is a little strip mall behind the hotel with a grocery store and restaurants. The grounds were clean and beautiful. We were located in the building furthest from the front office and it was very nice and quiet there. When we arrived they told us after we signed in (and had provided our vehicle information) that we needed to go into a side room and get our 'permanent parking pass' from a gentleman but we politely declined and walked out of the lobby (we got no parking tickets while there either!) No one called us to ask us to a \"breakfast\", etc, until the day we were leaving and then they apologized for calling when told them we were checking out. Everyone was polite.

Went with another mom and our 14 year old boys. Accomodations were perfect for us! Recently renovated, new kitchen cabinets, new GE appiances, stacked washer and dryer, tiled baths. The linens we had on the bed differ from the pictures....we had a white double sheeted down comforter (more like a down blanket) with a runner at the bottom, not a bed spread (this was much better). Some of the towels were a little thin, but we just used the other fluffier ones. The jungle theme is used quite a bit, although I wouldn't want it in my house, it was tastefully done. 2 flat panel tvs, one in the LR and one in the master BR. Another tv in the 2nd BR. We timed it: 3 minutes from our door to the Hollywood Studios entrance! Only a little longer to the other parks. The location can't be beat. The boys loved the Nike outlet that you could literally walk to. Prime Outlets are only several exits away on I4. Publix grocery is a very short drive away. The boys loved having their own bed and bathroom. Although they didn't go to the pool, the moms did and enjoyed afternoon drinks at the pool bar several afternoons. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here at all. If you are looking for a place with expansive lush grounds or golf course, you may want to look somewhere else, but this 2BR 2BA timeshare fit our needs and I felt more than comfortable staying there.

We own a time share in another state and opted to trade this year for our trip to Orlando. As it goes with timeshares...what you see is not always what you get (or what they sell to you!). Over the years I have found that you really need to carefully check out the places you trade for because so many of them are crap, run down, and filthy. I am admittedly neurotic about where we stay when we vacation and I spend countless hours (much to my husband's dismay) researching and reading mutiple reviews from many sites before I commit. Of course I like places that feel a little luxurious, but I will trade luxury any day for CLEANLINESS!!! With a toddler, I want a clean place more than anything else...the Parkway met the requirements. We had a 3rd floor unit (2 bed/bath) and the 3 grandparents shared a 1st floor unit (2 bed/bath). I called ahead to ask for one unit to be on the first floor for the grandparents (no elevators at this resort) and even said I preferred at least one 1st floor unit over the units being in close proximity to each other. The front desk was wonderful and not only gave us one 1st floor unit, but made sure they were in the same building. Nice. This is not a luxurious resort, so if you are insistent upon modern furnishings, decor, and the very best quality of everything (as many timeshare owners are), then you should not stay here. It is NOT the Ritz, but it is very comfortable and very clean. If you just want a spacious, comfortable place to come home to in the evenings from the parks, then this is your place. The kitchen and bathrooms were spotless and well kept. LOVED the very clean jacuzzi tub after walking 10 hr. days. As in another review, the master bath shower on the 3rd floor is fairly small, but again, IT IS CLEAN. They do only provide clean towels in the middle of the week, but I've learned to just take a small bottle of laundry detergent (they did actually provide some detergent) and throw them in the wash myself when we need a new supply. Again, if you need to be pampered the towel thing might annoy you, but washing a load of towels once during the week was not a problem for us. They provide a stacked washer/dryer unit that worked fine and quickly. Also, I read some complaints about paying for maid service...we were only there one week!! I don't need someone to pick up after me every minute and I actually prefer no one enter my unit during the week, so yes we emptied our own trash and ran the dishwasher ourselves. The ONLY issue with anything being unclean at all, was the tile floor in the living room on the 3rd floor. It was swept and free from debris, but it could have used a wet mop and a nice floor rug just to \"warm\" up the atmosphere a bit:) The living room in the 1st floor unit was carpeted and felt a bit cozier. We stayed over the July 4th weekend and the resort was not crowded. In fact, we found it to be fairly quiet and private the whole time we were there. We finally realized we had neighbors when we saw their pool towels on the rail, but never heard nor saw anyone :) Parking was never a problem and many spaces were available right in front of our unit. We used the pool on two occasions in the late evening hours and it was clean. Our screened in porch over looked the pool and even when it was the busiest, it never seemed overcrowded. Buildings C and D are a perfect location for using the pool. We had a back door to our units (C building) that went out to the pool, shuffleboard area, grills, picnic areas, childrens playground, and poolside bar/restaurant. Our location was perfect. The playground is a very nice ammenity for small kids. Well kept, looks new and safe. We used the small arcade for a few minutes also. Probably wouldn't occupy teens very long and the games seemed old. We had a huge flat screen in the living room with a DVD player so just bring your own game system. We did call in an order to the pool side restaurant one evening and just went down to pick it up and bring back to our room. Food was good and resonably priced. Not open very late though during the weekdays, so plan accordingly. Plenty of restaurants in the area and we never minded driving so it wasn't a problem for us. I knew about a small waterpark at the Parkway's sister resort from all my research so I asked about it (no one mentioned it at all during check-in) at the front desk and was given directions (about 8 miles away, very easy and quick drive) and a pass to get in for a $5 fee. The pass was good for one day. We loved the waterpark! It was small and so were the slides, but perfect for school age kids. Also had a toddler play area. Again, teens would probably be bored by it pretty quickly, but youngers kids seemed to love it. Location: We went to the Disney complex (parks and downtown disney)everyday and often more than once during the day. VERY close. Maybe a ten minute drive into the main gates and never encountered any traffic even after the fireworks at Epcot on the 4th. The parking pass into disney is $12/day but it's good for the whole day AND at ANY of the 4 parks during the same day so if you park hop, you just pay the $12 once a day. Aside from staying on the Disney resort, you can't pick a better location. I would recommend this resort for a family with young kids anyday and we will stay here again! Just a few cons to be very picky (and for management to read)...water pressure in master unit shower was like being beat to death. I actually dreaded getting in because it was so hard, and I felt like I was draining a small river somewhere. In the days of going \"green\" it was definitely wasteful. Not enough (nearly none) towel bars/hooks to hang wet towels. They could easily add these on doors, etc. Master bath vanity on the 3rd floor unit was so narrow, I could only leave my toothpaste on the counter. No room for anything else on the countertop, so I had to use the second bathroom vanity top for make-up, hair supplies, etc. However, the 1st floor unit had a large vanity to in the master bath, so it just depends on your unit. 3rd floor units have more square footage (about 500 more!) and very high ceilings, but the 1st floor unit was still very comfortable for my parents and mother-in-law. 3rd floor unit had a \"wet-bar\" in the living area, but not 1st floor unit. 3rd floor unit had wardrobes in master suite, no closet or night stand, but a large closet just outside door in the living area. Not a problem, just be prepared. 1st floor unit had a closet in master suite and night stands...again, just depends on unit. My only REAL complaint is the $30 fee to use their WiFi (or $8 for 24 hrs.). Really ridiculous...it's 2009...even my dentist's office offers free WiFi!!!

The accomadation had two bedrooms, two baths a living room, kitchen with everything you need, a full sized fridge, microwave, toaster, dishwasher, full sized oven and much more.

You can walk to a smaller supermarket/grocery type store. This store is was about a 1 minute walk from the hotel that does not require you to cross any streets or use any public sidewalks to get to. The pool area was great and not as small as some reviewers have said. The whirpo0l was also very nice. The pool area also has a bar that serves drinks and food. The pool area also has activities for the kids during the day for a nominal fee such as crafts. The hotel also has bingo games and black jack somenights. One night included musical entertainment by the pool area and a fish fry which cost $8 for adults and $6 for kids. The resort also has gas BBQ's that you can use although no one used them during my stay. Tennis courts and shuffleboard are also available. This place has no room service unless you request it for a fee. The master bedroom had a whirlpool tub in the bathroom. My only complaint was that to use the WiFi service you have to pay a $30 fee for one week or $8 for 24 hours. This really should be free during this day and age. This is a time share location. Initially when I checked in they asked me if I wanted a free breakfast and free tickets to which I said no and I was not asked again about the subject. The next morning I received about two phone calls and a knock on the door. I ignored this, learning from previous posts that these were the time share peolpe, and was never bothered again. If you stay call ahead and ask for a room that faces the Pool if you don't want to walk far or if you want to watch you kids. Each room has a small screened in porch. Mine faced the pool area and was very nice to have breakfast in the morning. If you have trouble with a lot of steps also ask to be on a bottom floor. I was on the third floor and this was a little difficult for my father in law who has had a hip replacement.

For example, the pool bar wasn't open every day, you had to pay for internet use at Guest Services, the water pressure could have been better in the shower and the mattress was rock hard. The amount of trees around the pool shaded the pool over quickly, but I'm sure at another time of year this is not a problem as the sun gets higher in the sky.

We desired to set up houskeeping instead of being holed up in a hotel for our time in the area. We searched the internet for lodging close to the hospital and sorted by the most reasonable price with the best reviews. The low nightly rate plus a few unpleasant reviews (mixed in with mostly positive reviews) had us a little concerned, but we booked anyway. Once we arrived, we were simply blown away by the accommodations. The rooms are very large and spotlessly clean. The grounds are mature with lots of plantings and large trees. We were really pleased with the discovery of boardwalk trails through the woods, some leading to a grocery story and restaurants, and some leading to neighboring resorts and some leading to even more trails. These walking trails became very important to us and we walked them every day. They are even lit up at night. The Parkway International Resort is only about 1/2 mile from the hospital. Another big benefit for us. The room as I mentioned was perfectly clean and well laid out. 3 TVs with a big screen in the living room. Two bedrooms, two bathrooms, full kitchen including dishwasher and washer & Dryer. There was even a bag of basic supplies on the kitchen counter waiting for us when we checked in. The room and grounds were quiet and we spent a lot of time on the screened in porch drinking our morning coffee and listening to the birds in the woods just outside. There were absolutely no bugs and we really wonder how anyone could write a negative review on this resort. On top of everything else, the staff was always very pleasant and helpful and flexible to our needs. Our stay there was wonderful and we hated to leave. Bottom line.....This place was just perfect for us and we will gladly stay there again and we will highly recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "January 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vero Beach Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat well run clean resort\u201d", "Author": "jhillflorida", "ReviewID": "UR12450950", "Content": "we have stayed at Parkway three years in a row and it is a very nice resort.

It is very close to everything. The rooms are very nice, very much like a place you could live at year round with a nicely equipped kitchen. The renovations will completely redo every unit including all new tile, carpet, appliances, etc. and the units will be fantastic when this is completed. We have never once had any major problems with the resort that they were not able to resolve. Our experience has been pleasant. When staying here you can walk to the other resorts that are part of Parkway and that means additional pools and hot tubs and other nice nature areas.

Convenience to Entertainment & Dining - Very Centrally Located 2. Fastest property check-in I've ever had - No Hassle 3. QUIET... Once inside our unit (50 ft from the pool), didn't hear a thing the entire week. 4. Clean & Well equipped: Walked through the entire week in stocking feet & socks were never dirty (a common complaint in resorts like this). 5. Beds were comfortable with plenty of extra linens/blankets. 6. Units are very large. Visited Blue/Green Fountains same week as a friend was there & they were quite small by comparison. 7. Washer/Dryer combo in the unit was efficiency sized but it worked extremely well. Dried 4 pool towels in a matter of 30 minutes. 8. Non-Smoking in all units (ash trays provided on the patios if required) Cons: 1. Pool is a little dated and is not walk-in style. Deep (6.5') and clean and never crowded, just older - its not a brand-spankin' new property. However Pool Furniture was newer. 2. Amenities (i.e. food & bar) / Activities are fairly limited. It is a smaller property after all. 3. In-Room TVs not great (smallish & reception not great) 4. Master-Shower is quite small & the Master Vanity will not accomodate two adults. I was amazed at how quiet this resort was when we stayed during 4th of July week. Expected it to be crowded & noisy & it was just the opposite. Staff was courteous and helpful and check-out was as quick as the check-in. Part of the attraction for this resort in Orlando is that Liki-Tiki (within the same property management company) is available to use for $5. A short drive down US192, and this 220k gallon water attraction is great for the kids. We also used the bar/dining facilities there and they were excellent. Generous portions and prices, at least on the food, was very reasonable. Ladies, if you want a foo-foo drink (daquiri, etc.) expect to pay a premium. One catch is that they won't let you bring in a cooler of your own. I thought that this was cheesy at Liki-Tiki, but fair enough. The life-guards also didn't prevent kids under 42\" from going down the big slide which is true at Orange Lake Country Club River Island, and so we saw many smaller kids having a blast, even though not closely monitored but there are usually lots of parents around anyway. Liki-Tiki is a very kid-friendly property and we're glad that we get to use it, I just don't want to stay there because it is at the far end of US192. Just remember that this is a Timeshare Resort NOT a hotel, even though they rent out nights for 3-day trips, etc. So don't expect hotel-like service or you'll be disappointed. This is a home-away-from-home style of vacation property. If you want room-service, etc. try Renaissance across from Sea-World. In summary, Parkway is a great location for a base of operations for a park-hopping stay in Orlando. We didn't spend a great deal of time at the resort, however it was a welcome place at the end of each day due to the comfort and size.", "Date": "July 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Balto,Md", "Title": "\u201cOn Family Vaction at Parkway Resort\u201d", "Author": "2muchpeach", "ReviewID": "UR8078942", "Content": "June 22 Me and my family stayed at the Parkway resort my family and I had lots of fun , great room , people was real nice and the kids love the pool .

We stayed in building \"B\", which is the first building on the left when entering the resort. It is rated a \"5 star\" resort, but I have never stayed at a \"5 star\" resort that I would classify \"5 star.\" I had read the reviews on this site prior to checking in and wasn't sure what to expect as the reviews range from great to terrible. Happily our stay was great. We arrived in the Orlando area earlier than the 4PM check-in time and called the resort to see if early check-in would be possible, and were told to \"come right over.\" When we checked in, the staff person remembered speaking to me on the phone and was very friendly. Our unit was on the second floor and we had to climb one flight of stairs to reach it (these are three-story buildings with no elevators.) All week we were able to park right by the stairwell to our unit. The units are approximately 1200 sq ft, two bedrooms, one with a king bed and one with two twins, full kitchen with laundry, dining, living, two full baths with showers and tubs and a screened patio area. The units are non-smoking, which was great for our son who has asthma. The unit was very clean, though the decor was a little dated (this didn't bother my family...we don't go on vacation for the furniture) but was not badly worn. Everything in the unit was in fine order and we didn't have any trouble with anything all week. The beds were very firm but not unlike the beds you will find in most hotels. The sleep sofa would not have been comfortable to sleep on for a week, but then I've never seen one that was. We prepared several meals in the unit during the week, and saved substantially over eating out. We visited the pool most evenings after a day at the parks and never found it crowded. We didn't see any bugs all week. We were called a couple of times about the \"free breakfast\" (timeshare-speak for the sales pitch tour) but when I explained politely that we were not interested, the calls stopped. The only complaint I heard from my family all week was from my 17 year old daughter who missed wireless internet. (I did not miss it.)

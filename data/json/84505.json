Parking was tight and made me nervous but the hotel staff was always willing to move our car for us! No compliants when parking is included in your stay! The staff was very helpful and friendly. We took advantage of the Universal Studios ticket discount and brochures in the lobby. The room and bed were better then we anticipated and the fridge in the room was great! I would stay here again because it was very easy for us to drive everywhere we wanted to go and keep our belongings in one place. I only have 3 small compliants which would be the property next door got a little loud over the weekend but when I shut the window it was fine. The room was scented with some type of inscents but we kept the windows open most of the time to air it out and it was fine.

However this hotel overall is better than average, but would I come here again, probably not. The reason being that would probably stay closer to the beautiful Santa Monica, as getting around is not difficult so less emphasis on the location of attractions, but more for the beauty and elegance of Santa Monica. We arrived here on our first leg of a tour of fantastic California, and the location was perfect especially when travelling with a toddler, located literally on Hollywood Blvd with Kodak Theatre, good restaurants, walk of fame etc so location wise it is excellent, but do remember we hired a car so were driving from here to all over LA - and there was plenty of driving to be done to get to other areas of LA (4 nights). Oh and no real issues with parking, like some have moaned, we usually found parking outside the hotel or just around the corner, the world is becoming lazy! The hotel itself is standard - reminds me of a typical 3 star, the rooms for comfortable, clean and the bathroom did its job. The breakfast was basically, but the food was fresh, however we usually went out for a brunch as there is so much choice. The comments about the staff are inaccurate and probably unfair, they are nice people and do the job, always helpful perhaps could smile a little more. Not much more I could add, we used this as the hub to travel to Beverly Hills, Universal Studios, Sunset Boulevard, Santa Monica, Venice Beach, Pietersburg Museum, and other places, good hotel for that reason and good value for money especially as we spent so much on worthwhile excursions.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Modiin", "Title": "\u201cvery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "Shalom R", "ReviewID": "UR127052296", "Content": "We stayed 2 nights there.

We chose the hotel primarily for its proximity to Hollywood Boulevard, combined with a relatively reasonable price. The hotel is about 2 minutes walk from the back entrance to the Hollywood and Highland Mall and included free parking and breakfast in the price we paid. Our room had a massive mural on the wall of the four characters from the Wizard of Oz, which added a certain fun to the place. From the glimpses we got of other rooms when they were being serviced, they all had the red murals depicting various films! Our room had two double beds in, a small area to eat, a wardrobe/dressing area (including a mirror with lights round it) and a bathroom. The one thing that let it down was that the carpet was pretty dirty - it appeared clean, but when we spilt some water and went to clean it up, the dirt that came up shocked us - yuck! Breakfast was simple, but sufficient for the three mornings we were there; toast, jam, muffins yoghurt, juice, tea, coffee etc. It was starting to get a bit boring by morning 3 though! The hotel was in an art deco style and had framed pictures and posters of hollywood legends in the corridors, Reception were helpful and sorted our tickets for Universal, as well as pointing us in the right direction for dinner when we arrived.

Given it was LA we did not have high expectations for anything to be that cool about the Southland. We mostly came to see world class art. And the art did not disappoint. Both Getty museums, the LACMA, MOCA, the Annenberg Space for Photography, lots of galleries, were very good. We chose this hotel because of the price and location right in Hollywood, near subway lines and express bus service. We had a room with a full kitchen which saved us some money by cooking in the room. The hotel itself was clean, comfortable and the front desk staff were nice and very helpful. A high number of foreign tourists were staying there. The hotel is just down from a tunnel that takes you to the Highland Mall and the Kodak theater, where they were preparing for the Oscars that week. I have a discarded piece of the red carpet while they laying it out, the guy threw it in the air and it landed on my feet. My only problem with the hotel - and this is a big one - the shower head was clogged. This is a basic amenity and should work and be tested before renting the room to guests. The first morning of our stay, I told the front desk, who promised it would be repaired. However this did not happen, so we had to get showers in the exercise room until day 4 when they locked the doors. They finally had someone fix the shower in our room, so the last morning or a 5 day stay, we had a decent shower.

The staff were unfalteringly friendly and helpful - they offered me tips on where to eat where I could do my laundry, what streets in Hollywood weren't safe to wander alone, warned me against drinking the tap water, made change for me on several occasions, explained the best way to get to Santa Monica... they were wonderful! The room was lovely and spacious - the photos on the hotel's website are accurate. It has a dining nook (fridge, microwave, little table and 2 chairs) and a decent-sized bathroom with classic black and white floor tiles. Even though Hollywood Boulevard is literally around the corner, I didn't have any trouble with noise. I noticed there were some recent reviews complaining about the cable TV not working - I can't say I had any problems with it; I must've flicked through all 500+ channels after getting in each night and they all worked just fine. The free continental breakfast is perfectly adequate for getting you up and going in the morning - it consists of toast (with basic spreads - margarine, jam, jelly, marmalade), croissants, muffins (chocolate, orange poppyseed, raisin, bran), instant oatmeal, yoghurt, coffee, tea and juice. The coffee and tea are available 24/7 and there is fresh milk (which was a big plus for me - not such a fan of non-dairy creamer). There is free wireless internet which worked perfectly for me in my time there - the connection was very fast and it really helped me to stay in touch with loved ones at home. They also provide a cable in the TV cabinet drawer if you prefer a wired connection. Showers were hot with good water pressure. Everything was immaculately clean (ran my finger along the windowsill - not a skerrick of dust) and the room was made up promptly around 10ish each morning. I'm sure most reviews have already mentioned this, but I'll say it again - if you're keen to see the Hollywood sights, this hotel's location could not be better. It's around the corner from the Kodak Theatre/Hollywood and Highland Center, the middle of the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Madame Tussauds, and an easy walk (not more than 10-15 minutes at a leisurely pace) to the Hollywood Museum, Red Line Tours, Grauman's Chinese and Egyptian Theatres, and the Hollywood/Highland Metro station (on the red line). In my time there I also visited Universal Studios LA by riding the Metro one stop to Universal City (do this! it'll cost you $1.50 each way instead of $9 for a shuttle or more for a cab), and Warner Bros Studios, which was a $17 cab ride from the Renaissance Hotel cab rank (2 minutes from Hollywood Celebrity Hotel. There are heaps of dining options close to the hotel which was a big help to me as well (although I think they do have rooms that include a kitchenette, mine wasn't one of these). The hotel can also organise shuttles to LAX at a reasonable flat rate (do NOT take a cab!) All this at a price tag of under $125 per night for 2 queen beds? Can't complain at all! I would definitely stay here again if and when I return to Hollywood, and will be recommending this hotel to friends and family.

It's on the (almost) picturesque Orchid Avenue which runs south from Franklin to the back of the Hollywood & Highland Center facing Hollywood Boulevard, and is less than five minutes' walk though a covered walkway leading past loading docks right into the heart of the shopping complex. The immediate neighbourhood seems quite safe with the usual sensible precautions, and although there are some 'colourful' characters on the Boulevard (as elsewhere in LA) I didn't encounter any trouble even late at night. As other reviewers have noted, Orchid Avenue is quietish with only light delivery traffic, and yet it's close by the busiest Hollywood tourist precinct. It must be said that there isn't much in the way of 'convenience' shopping in the neighbourhood and the food options are a bit hit-and-miss (try Sun Taco upstairs at Hollywood & Highland which seems popular with off-duty costumed characters from out front of the Chinese Theatre!). Beneath the Hollywood & Highland Center is the Hollywood/Highland Red Line Metro rail station which takes you into Downtown or to North Hollywood. The staff - who I found friendly, discreet and helpful - were able to tell me a bit about the history of the hotel: it started life as an elegant apartment block in the 1930s or 1940s, and it shows in the opulent lobby spaces and hotel rooms which are essentially the old apartments. I was given a free upgrade to a large, clean suite with separate lounge, dining area and kitchenette and a spacious master bedroom, with older-style but serviceable fittings (the air-conditioning was a little noisy). I had booked a room upstairs at the back and got one (the building stretches back a surprisingly long way so it was a bit of a hike to the reception area). Allowing for jet lag, I slept pretty well and there was very little ambient noise from within the hotel. The breakfast provided in the lobby is basic but I recall that it offered fresh milk, which I've found you can't always count on in the US. There is a pleasant patio area out front of the hotel with tables and chairs. The free Internet in the lobby was appreciated although the in-room Wi-Fi didn't work all that well.

The room I stayed in had a fridge, microwave and table, all I want is a fridge to keep my water cool. Maid service is daily and you choose if you want your towels changed by leaving them on the floor or hanging them up if you are going to use them again. They are equipped with a hairdryer, iron and ironing board. The tv has plenty of channels to watch, there is also an alarm clock radio and telephone. The telephone in my room wasn't working properly, I could hear the caller they couldn't hear me. I had about 6 calls from reception who couldn't seem to comprehend that the phone wasn't working properly and even had to check when I went to tell them. They asked me to return to the room to wait for someone to come up and check, I did this and was waiting 15minutes and no one came so I went to get my breakfast. Halfway through my breakfast the person came to check my phone and low and behold told me it wasn't working!!!! They changed it with a phone from another room. The breakfast is continental and complimentary and consists of bread for toasting, jam and marmalade, assorted cakes and pastries, fresh fruit, cereals, fruit juice, tea, coffee and water. They advertise breakfast is available until 10am and bang on 10am all the breakfast items are taken away. Just the tea and coffee are left which are available 24/7. Another plus point to this hotel is the free parking!!!!! A rare occurance in LA. The staff are helpful and knowledgable. The hotel is located in a quiet area, so noise when you are trying to sleep is not a problem. Although I did find the air con a bit noisy but I generally do anyway.

Even though the location is right behind the Kodak Theater and the shops at Hollywood and Highland with all the hustle and bustle, the room was incredibly quiet. The only minor complaints about the room were that there was some cosmetic fixes that needed to be made, but the building is probably an older building. Also, I think the carpet in our room had just been cleaned, so there was a strong soap smell when we first arrived. Having the fan on and the windows opened took care of the problem.

There is no elevator, so be prepared to haul you cases up a flight of stairs... The rooms were large and although dated, they were clean enough and comfortable enough for our short stay... Nothing special, but really OK. It was close to all the action, and a short walk down the street meant you were in the middle of a lot of shopping and restaurants... LA is huge, and you could easily end up a long walk from anything worth seeing... The car park was small and it was a tight squeeze to park the rental car up for the night and to get it out in the morning to do all the sight seeing... The breakfast was ok, with toast, juice, coffee, tea etc... But nothing special... There is no bar at this hotel. THINGS TO DO... Take a walk down the street where there is plenty do do, day or night... Drive up the the HOLLYWOOD SIGN... But be prepared to be unimpressed... You cant get as close as you would hope, but a short drive up all the interesting winding roads, past all the nice houses and you can get some good photo's and beautiful views of the city... Bring a Sat Nav... BRING. A. SAT. NAV. If you like Jim Morrison and The Doors, take a drive down Hollywood Boulevard and visit the Whisky a Go Go... There is also a motel (celta cienega) where there is a Jim Morrison room that he stayed in... There was no one in the room when we went, so we gave the guy a 5 dollar tip to let us look inside... It was very cool, and you can sign your name/messgae on the walls that are covered with messages from fellow fans... BEVERLY HILLS... Once again, be prepared to be unimpressed, but its still interesting... We bought a \"Star Map\" from one of the many people selling them on the street around that area... You can use your Sat Nav to go see the houses belonging all the biggest stars... The problem is, the are all super stars houses are pretty well hidden, but at least you can drive around all the mansions, and see how the other half live... VENICE BEACH... Its a 20 minute drive away, but it was excellent... Its just a really cool place... We wished we were staying around Venice Beach for a day or two... Lots to see, lots to do, street performers, shops, stalls, restaurants and plenty of characters... Really stood out for us... Don't miss it... T-Bag from the TV show Prison Break sat beside us and had his lunch... I could sit there all day having a few beers and watching the world go by. Al in all, the Hotel was a decent base, and we really only used it to sleep... We did have a few drinks in the rooms before we went out and it was quiet at night... We stayed in much nicer hotels during our trip, but it was fine, and if you want to be close to the action, then this is a perfect base.

The Hollywood Celebrity fit the bill. We had a king suite so that the kids (teens) could have their own \"room\" with the futon bed and a rollaway and still plenty of room in the living area to not feel cramped at all. FINALLY a hotel that understands the importance of mirrors outside of the bathroom. THANK YOU!!!! With 2 teen girls and mom all needing to do hair/makeup having 3 full mirrors was a godsend. Only thing lacking in this area were more electrical outlets. We solved that by a quick trip into a Rite Aid and buying a 6' $4 extension cord that is now going to be a permenant item to pack on all trips. Having the additional vanity area and the other two large mirrors made only having 1 bathroom for 4 people very easy. Our room was clean and large and the location can not be beat. Easy walking distance to Graumann's, Hollywood & Highland Shopping Center, Kodak Theatre and every other nearby attraction in that area of Hollywood without having to deal w/ driving in the traffic and finding a parking spot. The price could not be beat either. As for the breakfast.......... having the coffee downstairs was great. We stopped at Trader Joe's that is only a few blocks away and stocked up on some drinks for the fridge, milk, orange juice and ceral and we were set. I'd recommend the Hollywood Celebrity Hotel to friends and family no problem. We are used to very nice 4 and 5 star accomodations and having this nice, clean comfortable hotel in such a great location w/ a large room for a great price makes it very appealing. We all said they could easily do some major updating, become a very exclusive boutique hotel and raise the rates dramatically. They have the location, room sizes and layout to do it.

The hotel is in fact right behind the Kodak Theatre. Orchid Ave (where the hotel is located) is actually shut down on Oscar Night. Thus, the hotel is very close to all the action on Hollywood Blvd, with Graumann's, all the museums and other attractions in Hollywood right around the corner. It's also a 2-minute walk from The Magic Castle. My room was huge! Apparently I was upgraded so I got a room with two queen beds even though I'm a solo traveller. Aside from the main room, there was a small room with a fridge and a dining table, as well as a medium-size bathroom and a room with plenty of closet space for your clothes. My room was bigger than some of the suites I've stayed in at fancy hotels in Las Vegas. That being said, the room looked very dated and worn out, with bland walls and not much attention paid to interior design or decoration. It's not a place you'd feel comfortable spending a lot of time in. But if you are not planning on spending much time at the hotel anyway, and instead explore the tourist attractions of the area, the Hollywood Celebrity is a good choice for a traveller on a budget. Unlike the room, the halls and the lobby area look very nice. There's also a computer in the lobby for the guests to use. The free Wi-Fi was very slow and unstable. To be fair, the manager offered the use of a LAN connection with a network cable, if you have a laptop. I don't know if that connection was more stable or fast though. A nice feature was a complimentary breakfast. You got some basic choices of toast, croissants, yoghurt and juice. Nothing fancy or delicate by any means, but it was okay considering you didn't pay extra for it (and the room rate is very reasonable to begin with). There is no view to speak of from the room and across the hotel there is often noise from young folks partying and such. This can make it difficult to sleep if it happens while you are staying at the hotel. In terms of amenities, there's all the basic stuff, including a fridge in the room that you can use as you wish, and a TV with all the major channels, including HBO. There was even a microwave oven which is a nice touch. In short, the hotel is great for the location and the price.

The management are friendly and allowed us to check in early at midday after our long flight. The free breakfast is more than adequate and it even has free parking, which is a huge plus in this area. The wi-fi is free but it does not have a pool. There were two problems encountered this visit. Firstly, a huge group of young people who were staying at the hotel had no consideration for the other guests when they returned in the wee small hours of the morning, laughing and talking very loudly in the common areas. This is difficult for management to control, however extremely annoying. Secondly, I was bitten by bed bugs - I actually felt the bites (2) when I initially got into bed and the bite marks were huge. I know that I definitely did not have any bites on me when I arrived because I showered immediately, then went out for a walk around the sights before hitting the sack for an early night.

It is nestled away on a dead end street so there isn't a lot of traffic. The facility is a two-story, converted apartment complex. I had a room with a kitchenette which was helpful, especially for extra space and additional wall outlets. The service at the front desk was great, but the breakfast buffet (8 a.m. - 10 a.m.) opened late on both days we were there. The woman who was prepping the breakfast area began setting up at 8:10 and other guests were grabbing things as quickly as they could (bread, bagels, muffins, etc.) The room was clean, but dated. It also had a musty smell. My biggest complaints were the paper-thin walls and the tiny parking area. At about 2 a.m. each night, our neighbors decided it was time to party until around 6 a.m. You can hear everything from the loud music to the talking. I called the front desk and they said they'd take care of it. When that didn't help, I went next door and knocked. There were 6 guys in the room, and one of them was shirtless with shaving cream all over his torso. They kept it down from then on, but you could still hear things. On our first night, four female escorts were leaving the lobby as I was entering. Anyway, just know that this place is for location and not necessarily comfort, peace or quiet. The free parking was helpful, put the parking spaces are tiny. If you drive a truck, mini-van or full-sized vehicle, you'll feel cramped. In fact, one morning we were headed out to Universal Studios after consuming a late breakfast and when we got the our car, we saw that we were blocked in by 4 vehicles. I spoke to the front desk and asked them to move them which they said they'd do. It took about 15 minutes to make that happen. The property is ridiculously close to the Chinese Theater, Kodak Theater, El Capitan, etc. There is a CVS about 1/4 mile away for your food and beer purchases.

We were going to be spending an evening at the Magic Castle and wanted a location close enough that we could walk. The hotel is a converted apartment building--Quite cute with HUGE rooms--probably originally studio apartments. The location is great, the hotel is situated directly behind the Kodak theatre and approximately a half a block from the Magic Castle. My husband and I felt comfortable walking in the area both late at night after our dinner at the Castle and early in the morning (6am) on our hunt for the nearby Starbucks Coffee. The rooms had both a refrigerator and microwave. The hotel has Wi-fi but the signal was poor. Evidently a continental breakfast was offered but didn't start until 8am--far too late for us. Our only major issue with the hotel is the parking. Granted, parking in this area is at a premium, and I was VERY happy that they had a parking lot. In fact, it was a major factor in choosing the hotel, but be advised that the lot is small and that there is only one driveway in and out which means you cannot drive through and will have to back out onto a busy street to leave. The biggest concern is that they allow guests (and employees) to park in between the rows of cars which means you will most likely be blocked in when you need to leave. When we returned to the hotel after dinner at the castle we noted that two cars were blocking ours and since we planned to leave at 6:30am we mentioned the problem to the front desk. We were assured that there was another lot where they park their overflow and they had the keys to those cars and were planning to move them to the other lot in just a few minutes. We were assured that there wouldn't be a problem when we went to leave in the morning. Unfortunately, this wasn't true. When we went down to the lot at 6am to put our bags into our car there were now THREE cars (one of which belonged to the clerk at the front desk). The other two guests had been asked to leave their keys with the front desk so that their cars could be moved, but the gentleman at the front desk couldn't move them because he was the only one working. He assured us that someone would be coming in at 7am, and we delayed our departure until then, only to have that person not show up on time. My husband watched the front desk as the front desk clerk moved the three cars so that I could pull our car out. It took over 20 minutes before I was able to leave the lot putting us an hour behind when we had originally planned to leave. If you choose this hotel just know that you may be in a valet parking situation--either having to leave your keys with the front desk and/or waiting to be able to get your car. This hotel is a good value, with a great location, but if parking issues are important to you it's good to be aware of the potential for problems.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSECOND VISIT, NOT AS GREAT AS FIRST!\u201d", "Author": "Captivemarket", "ReviewID": "UR89541363", "Content": "We stayed at the Hollywood Celebrity in Nov 2009.

The hotel offers free parking, which is at a premium in the heart of the city; however the parking lot is very small, situated behind the hotel.

After a succession of fabulously comfortable beds on our trip, we were presented with three paper-thin pillows on our queen bed, and what looked like a very old, threadbare comforter. When we entered, the A/C was turned off, and the room was swelteringly hot; the windows were open and what appeared to be a party with very loud music was being held on a balcony in the apartment block opposite our room. Luckily the A/C worked a treat and the windows were well sound-proofed. On the positive side, there was a fridge, and ample storage/vanity space.

Ha ha, no a/c! In the room there was a small window a/c unit which blows about 15cc an hour..too bad our dial was broken and we could not turn it past \"medium hot\". The window looked directly into someone else's apartment but having it open was better than the a/c. The comforter was covered in hair, not my hair, and something else which I'll leave to your imagination. If this was a hard copy letter I could have written it on the towels, they were thin as paper.

The noise ALL night was unbelievable, from drunken parties where you can hear every word being yelled to screaming and people calling for lost cats at 4 in the morning.

Crappy shower and all fittings like taps and electrical sockets were loose and old. The only highlight was the location though which was an easy 2 min walk to the Blvd and all the attractions there. This was perfect. Check out was fun also at 6.00am with a shuttle bus waiting to take us to LAX for our flight. The $50 we left as deposit mysteriously disappeared and the office girl was ringing other staff at their homes to locate it. \"Are you sure you paid it\" was her initial line of questioning.

We certainly appreciated being explained about the parking situation in great detail. The free parking lot is adjacent to the hotel. Like the previous viewer indicated, \"it is a real mess\" The lot is a sardine can, but yet, somehow, someway, at least 20 cars are squeezed in. On the morning of our departure, at checkout, the front desk told us that the hotel staff would move any car(s) blocking the driveway. The room was very very large and clean but very very old. Our room on the ground level faced the back alley just a few steps away from the parking lot. The bed was comfortable and closet space was plentiful. The bathroom was clean BUT dorm like in decor. My wife and I opted to skip the shower facilities the next morning; not aesthetically pleasing to say the least. The location was superb. We were able to walk to the wedding event, approximately 0.3 miles from the hotel. The hotel is a stones throw away from the posh Renaissance Hotel where room rates are much much higher. The Hollywood Celebrity Hotel spells convenience in every sense of the word for most Hollywood endeavors/outings. The complimentary continental style breakfast was average. It wasn't the Embassy Suites style breakfast, but just your basic necessities to get you going in the morning.

The room looked out to the parking lot, which was always entertaining. The tiny parking lot is on a very busy street, and it is impossible to turn around, so you must back out into the busy street. Also, there is not enough room for all the cars, so if the lot is full, the front desk staff will park your car in this parking lot and block in all the other cars. In the morning, we would watch the \"musical cars\" as the staff had to move cars out in order to let earlier parked cars out. If you were in a hurry in the morning, this could be a problem.

Now I'm re-writing my review. Back in April I went on a roadtrip to Hollywood with my girlfriends to celebrate my birthday. I chose the Hollywood Celebrity Hotel b/c of the reviews here and it's great location to everything we wanted to do. Never did I delude myself into thinking that I expected a luxurious hotel stay here. All I was looking for was a simple clean room to take a shower and rest my head down at the end of the day; that was it. Sadly The Hollywood Celebrity hotel could not even meet these low standards. The one positive things about this hotel is it's location. It's located in a prime area convenient to all sorts of Hollywood attractions so I won't take that away from them. From the moment we checked in after our long day at Magic Mountain, we kept discovering bad things about our room that eventually led us to check out after our first night there. First when walking into the room, there was a very stale, musky odor... as if it'd been a while since the room had been occupied. Okay no big deal, my friends and I opened the windows to air out the room. The room was suppose to come with free high speed internet (via a ethernet cord you plug into your laptop) but our internet was not working. The front desk assistant couldn't figure out what was wrong and it couldn't be solved until the following morning. We'd have to use the wireless provided in the front entrance. As my friends and I were unpacking our things my friend noticed a disgusting puddle of something sticky on the vanity counter and on the built in blow dryer. Honestly I don't know what exactly it was but it was as if someone poured a thick layer of corn syrup on the vanity counter and let it sit there for a month. Just plain nasty. The maid service must have been asleep on the job the last time they cleaned this room. The final straw was when we needed to take showers and get ready to meet some local friends up for the night. We had a really long day of driving from San Francisco before the crack of dawn to going straight to Magic Mountain from there for some roller coaster fun. The sad part was that for some reason at 7pm on a Wednesday night there was NO HOT WATER LEFT. Yep, we all had to take miserable cold showers and it was not fun. After this we had no desire to bother asking for a new room. Just the few short hours we'd been there had left a bad taste in our mouth and there was no way the hotel could redeem itself. That night we ended up booking a room at the Hollywood Renaissance Hotel right down the road (which was a wonderful hotel and worth the extra money to stay at... read my review about it). The following morning when I checked out, I mentioned our bad experience to the front desk assistant, she was apologetic about our stay and asked me to leave my number so that the manager could contact me. They mentioned that the manager would be in that afternoon and that she'd get back to me as soon as possible. The manager didn't bother contacted me until a week after I checked out. That to me is simply unprofessional and sent a message to me that customer satisfaction wasn't on their list of priorities. Knowing that a guest had such a lousy stay, you'd think the manager would want to talk to me about my experience. Instead, the manager was rather rude and cold to me. She just flat out asked what I wanted after telling her my story, which confused me. Basically she just wanted to know what kind of refund I was looking for. She said she'd credit me $20 for our bad experience. Gee, thanks! The funny part is that I never saw that $20 credit go back to my bank account. I didn't bother trying to contact them to follow-up on this credit... why waste the time given the kind of attitude given to me by this hotel. I'm not sure how this hotel has so many positive reviews. I notice that there are a lot of people who've made only 1 contribution to TripAdvisor so who knows what kind of friends they're getting to write glowing reviews of them.

Breakfast was a OJ, coffee urn and bagels / croissants in the hall, but this suited us as we had an early start. Parking was free - a big plus considering the rates of parking at most hotels. Cars are packed in but the hotel will hang onto the keys of the blocking cars and move them for you - it won't be a problem. West Hollywood was a good spot, we drove in from Grand Canyon (9 hours in total) and had to journey across the city for about 1.5 hours. From here we were planning to get the subway to Universal but were given good advice to drive it - despite our reluctance this was the best, quickest and cheapest option. 10 minutes later and $10 parking, we were there. Very easy. You are 2 mins from a small shopping mall where you can get some great diner style food or Japanese, cocktails etc and see the hollywood sign (which wasn't lit up at night surprisingly). Also just 5 minutes walk to Hollywood Boulevard. This was our 3rd stop for 2 nights, in a 2-week road-trip, covering the following places & hotels: Las Vegas - Bellagio Grand Canyon - Yavapai Lodge LA - Hotel Celebrity Monterey - Spindrift Inn San Fran - Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf (don't) and Executive Hotel Vintage Court Yosemite - Sunset Inn (Groveland) All were booked largely following Trip Advisor reviews & the TimeOut Guide, to give us a mixture of 'spoiling ourselves' hotels with the primary focus being the best location for the part of town we were visiting (although we had a hire car). We are well-travelled 30ish Londoners who like the finer things in life but very happy to get stuck-into rustic! We were happy to swing between paying $150 and $300 a night.

We paid $139 per night for the room. I will break this review in to the different areas of the hotel. Location: The location of this hotel is second to none. It is on a small cul-de-sac, literally two minutes walk from Hollywood Boulevard, so within two minutes you can be at the Kodak Theatre, Walk of Fame, Mann\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese Theatre, Hollywood and Highland shopping centre, the Metro stop and the start of the sight-seeing tour route. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine a better location for the price if Hollywood is where you want to stay. Checking in: Our first impression of the hotel was good. There is 15min limit on parking in front of the hotel, so there was ample space to pull up the car and unload our luggage. The lobby is nice, very bright, clean and airy. The man who checked us in was very pleasant and check in took less than 5 minutes, we were given a pass to place in the front of the car that entitled us to free parking in the hotel car park (more about this later). The room: We were in room 207, which was right beside the stairs, the hotel was quiet though and we were never disturbed by people coming and going. The room itself was huge, with a king size bed, which was extremely comfortable. The room is a little dated and lacks a bit of style, but it was clean and functional. The curtains had blackout lining, so no morning sun peaking through. The room had an air-conditioning unit, which was noisy, but kept the room at a lovely cool temperature. There was a small eating area with a table, chairs and fridge. I believe some rooms are equipped with a microwave and other kitchen equipment, but we did not need any more than the fridge, as we were only there 3 nights. There was a great wardrobe/dressing area with a huge, well-lit mirror, table, chair, iron, ironing board and hairdryer. Having this separate area was great as the bathroom was on the small side and it meant I could do my hair and makeup without crowding the hubby! The bathroom let the room down a little, it was very spartan and the fixtures and fittings were a little grotty and scratched. We were only left with two bath towels and then two hand towels that were too small to wrap around my hair (and I have quite short hair). It wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a big deal for them to leave more towels and save people having to ring down looking for them. The main problem we had with the room was the shower. No matter what we did, we could not get the water to a comfortable temperature, the minute you got it right, it would start running cold and then boiling hot. In all the showers we had, neither of us had one were we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t scalded or frozen! Over all the room was fine, but could do with a little updating, very little expenditure could make the room beautiful. Breakfast: The room rate includes breakfast that consists of bagels, cream cheese, muffins, croissants, juice, tea and coffee. It is laid out in the lobby and you simply bring what you want to your room. It was very tasty and fresh and although simple, we found it got us up and running for the day and meant we could start sightseeing first thing. Parking: The hotel has free parking in a small parking lot just around the corner from the hotel itself. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t usually a problem getting a space during the day, but beware if you are taking your car out at night. We returned at about 11pm and the car park was full, as was the area in front of the hotel. We had to park in the Hollywood and Highland car park around the corner. The hotel did reimburse us for the price of the parking, but it was a bit of a nuisance. Still, free parking when they could very easily charge for it is a major bonus and they had no qualms about reimbursing us the price of the parking. Overall, this is a great hotel for the money. The staff are friendly and accommodating, the rooms are big and clean and the free parking and breakfast is a great perk. My only slight gripe is that the rooms and bathroom are dated and could do with a revamp, but then they would probably bump up the price to match! I would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to anyone going to LA looking for a budget friendly option in an amazing location.", "Date": "September 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cwhat a find!\u201d", "Author": "rhpmsfo", "ReviewID": "UR19661850", "Content": "I confirm all the excellent remarks already made about this hotel.

The location was perfect for what we wanted with public transport, Subway/buses, within walking distance and the whole Hollywood thing on our doorstep. Have to say I was glad initially that our room was situated on the ground floor as there is no lift to the next floor and its a lot of stairs to carry a heavy case up, just the steps up to the entrance were bad enough. Then with the thin floorboards maybe the 2nd floor would have been good as you could hear all of the above rooms plumbing and footsteps. First impressions of room were really great, two double beds, clean, nice bathroom but could have been better. Towels seemed old but were clean. A dinning area for your breakfast, a fridge and microwave were also in the room. The fridge was really noisy and with the thermostat it would come on throughout the night, I wished it could have been turned off but the small freezer compartment meant this was not possible.. Noise is an issue at this hotel, with an apartment block outside our window where the occupants liked to have noisy pool parties until 3am and the marble floors that seemed to cause every footstep to be 10x louder than it should be. The sound of cases coming down the steps at 4am was not good, carpeting the center of the hallways would I'm sure go a long way to solving this problem. Breakfast was hit and miss, not really our thing. Muffins, bagels and croissants only and not always a great selection of these. We ended up getting a proper breakfast elsewhere, so the hotels free 'breakfast' was not of benefit to us. While we were there the hotel suffered from a power outage, luckily we were out for the day so this didn't effect us. What did effect us was a problem with the sewer/plumbing system over one night, we were advised not to use/restrict as much as possible using the bathroom. The staff were polite, friendly and very helpful. We got the impression it was a family run business rather than a corporate one and this showed in the service.

Every hotel I have stayed in LA has been better than this place (definitely more than 7 others). It is like I stayed at a different hotel from these other reviewers. My wife was shocked when I told her this hotel was ranked this high. Two stars is generous for this hotel. I use TripAdvisor all of the time for my travel and have used it for hotel recommendations all over the world. This is the first time I have found the ratings to be so far from the reality I experienced. We paid $149/night and stayed in room 111 on the left side of the hallway as you enter the hotel. The rooms on this side face the pool area of an apartment complex next door. The rooms on the right side face a walkway to the remote parking area, then the wall of another building (this may be the preferred side). The first night (Tuesday), twentysomethings were partying outside our window at the apartment complex pool area until 5:00am and I could not get to sleep (should have used earplugs like my wife). I figured it was a \"special occasion\" celebration, but it started again the next morning around 1:30am. I called the front desk this time and it stopped around 2:30am. The place is very noisy. Marble floors down the long center hallway look great, but don't sound too great when baggage is rolling and high heels are walking on it. Although it \"appears\" clean, it doesn't \"feel\" clean. Dark carpeting and dark bedding can hide things. The room was in need of major renovation, including a new coat of paint. I have never had a room with no drinking glasses, so I had to take the sleeping pills required to get some sleep due to the ongoing noise outside with a handful of bathroom tap water. The towels were thin, gray and dingy, something we would use to dry off our car. The mirror in the dressing area was so low I had to bend over to use it (I'm only 5'11\"). The vanity was permanently stained and desperately needed painting. We felt uncomfortable setting our things on it. The \"celebrity\" wall hangings were spackled and looked horrible. We needed some bottled water and tried the vending machine in the hall. Tried twice for water and got 2 Cokes each time instead. Not the best thing to drink with sleeping pills. The parking area is as bad as previous reviewers have described. You will be required to leave your keys with the front desk so they can squeeze your car into a very small lot, blocking other cars. Do not take your personal car here or a very large rental. Our daughter just moved to the area, so we were trying a new hotel in this area. We have stayed in several hotels in the downtown area, much nicer and less expensive. Overall, the front desk people were very pleasant, however we were not asked anything about our stay when we checked out. We will absolutely never stay here again! Will try the Magic Castle and Renaissance Hollywood on our next visits.

But where should I stay? Should I stay at the Celebrity Hotel or the Orchid Suites? Both have good reviews, were just meters apart and were both in my price range. A difficult choice. My solution? Divide my stay between the two hotels. Since my actual stay in L.A. would be divided into two by a short trip to San Diego and Anaheim in between, I decided to spend the first couple of nights at the Orchid Suites and the second bunch at the Celebrity. So having stayed at the Orchid Suites earlier, I was a bit disappointed at the Celebrity upon arrival. And the culprit is the parking area. Aside from it being full with cars (a number double parked), the gate is constantly open. And since my family with small kids arrived close to midnight, this did not offer much in terms of security. I also had to park the car in such a way that a small part of it's tail is exposed out the sidewalk. In effect, I had to repeatedly look out the sidewalk to see if there was anyone around as I opened the trunk. After the parking lot experience, I entered our hotel room not helping to notice that it was less appointed than that of the Orchid's. The kitchen in particular paled as it didn't have the same number of amenities. An in-room safe was sorely missed, too. While wi-fi signal in the room was poor, a wire for broadband access was present in the room. Neat. Aesthetically though, the room at the Celebrity looked better and newer. The same could be said of the hotel as a whole in comparison to the Orchid, which still looked like an apartment which was just converted into a hotel. The front desk personnel were helpful when I needed some info during our stay. Not as cheerful in my opinion, but still to the task. The biggest difference that the other hotel didn't have was the breakfast that came with the Celebrity's room rate. Though some may complain that it didn't offer much, to me the bagels, muffins and croissants together with juice and coffee were enough to start my day. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the amount I payed for our stay here was actually cheaper than that of the Orchid's by $10/night. Surprised because the quotes here in T.A. are cheaper for the Orchid Suites. Lastly, I might be mistaken but I didn't see any elevators. So if your room is in the upper floors and have heavy luggages with you... So which to me was a better hotel? Let me sum it up this way: if you have a car, the Orchid Suites might be a better option. But if you don't have one, then let the free breakfast and cheaper rates sway you to the Celebrity instead. To expound on the parking situation, firstly, the number of parking slots in the Celebrity is not enough for all their guests. One night, I heard a European man giving his car keys to the person manning the front desk insisting that he park his car. I can tell that he was exasperated from finding a parking slot himself. The front-desk person did not take it reasoning that though parking was available, it is limited. Second, parking at the Celebrity is actually to the side of the hotel accessed via Franklin Ave. So if you are coming from the direction of Highland (as I always do) in heavy traffic, turning left to the garage entrance is impossible, not to mention illegal in the first place. Turn to Google Earth for a better picture. In comparison, the entrance to the Orchid's garage is along Orchid Ave., turning left to which from Franklin is aided by a traffic light. No problem. A solution to the Celebrity's parking woes would be to return late at night when traffic at Franklin is light (drivers at your back will honk at you for stopping to turn left into the garage). But since the garage gates are always open, and chances are yours will be the last car in, one can't help but feel unsafe with nobody around late at night in Hollywood. Third, if you park farthest from the gate the night before and leave the earliest the next morning, be prepared to wait a while since backing up all the cars blocking your way will take some time. But despite all this, I would have honestly considered coming back to this hotel. Afterall it is hard to disregard the free breakfast and the slightly cheaper rates. The parking- you get used to it. I however have a beef with the front desk person who promised to e-mail me the breakdown of my expenses since their printer was malfunctioning when I checked out. I've e-mailed them a reminder as I got back and still no answer to my request. I just have this impression that they are nice when they need your business but don't care when your business with them is done. So it's Orchid Suites for me by a whisker. Remember, this is my pinion and I just hope that with this I help you formulate your own.", "Date": "April 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cGREAT location\u201d", "Author": "Jeanette_8", "ReviewID": "UR15212911", "Content": "I stayed there with my 12-year old for 3 days in April.

Neighborhood The hotel is on the 'back side' of the block that houses the Hollywood&Highland Center and the Kodak Theater (where the Oscars are held). In the same street (more like an alley) there are two other cheap hotels, \"Hollywood Orchid Suites\" and \"Liberty Hotel\". This is the nice part of Hollywood, with a lot of tourists and a lot of people even late at night, so you won't feel unsafe here. The expensive Renaissance Hollywood Hotel is around the corner (literally 150 yards). There are places in Hollywood where we'd feel unsafe at night, but this is quite ok. The hotel is close to Franklin Avenue which has some traffic, but the noise didn't bother us at all. Parking may be tricky in the hotel's small lot. We found a spot every time, but in the peak season, you may have to look for a spot further away. Room The room was large, with a big bed, a sofa and a table. The furniture isn't exactly new, but the bed was comfortable and the sheets were clean. The decor is a bit dated, but since we didn't go to Hollywood to stay in our room, that didn't bother us. There was a fridge and a microwave in the room as well. Bathroom The bathroom was nice, with black and white tiles, a tub, a toilet and a sink. Clean and practical. The shower cabinet was a bit hard to close, otherwise ok. Service The breakfast included consists of juice, bagels and muffins. Not a full buffet, but a quick bite before you start your day. It was nice to sit out on the patio and sip juice in the shadow of the Kodak Theater. There is a computer in the lobby where you can surf the interenet for free. Summary This is a clean hotel with a nice decor. It's comfortable, clean and reasonably priced for LA. We can recommend this hotel for people who plan to spend most of their day out sightseeing or whatever and not hanging out in their room.", "Date": "January 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cNot bad...great location\u201d", "Author": "kaur_parm", "ReviewID": "UR12582715", "Content": "Myself and my husband stayed for 3 days at the beginning of this year.

The breakfast was basic but enough to get you on your way. As for Hollywood-not quite what we had expected. We found it to be very dirty and we felt unsafe. It is unfortunate that some of the shops along the main tourist drag are unsavoury as they seemed to attract not such nice people. The people we actually met elsewhere (cafes etc) were nice and helpful however. We took a stretch limo tour around the stars' houses-or gates!, and that was fun, although we felt that the notice inside the limo suggesting at least a $45 tip was ridiculous. Also, if you like 50's style and the movie American Grafitti, try Mel's Diner for lunch or dinner-their food is great and so is their butterscotch milkshakes!

Overall, it is a hotel that provides good value and a good location. It is not a glitzy place, and services are limited, but for the person who knows what he is getting, it is a good option. The hotel is located about a block off Hollywood Blvd., near the Chinese theater and the other famous Hollywood sites. It is, however, on a relatively quiet side street, so you're buffered from the noise of Hollywood Blvd. There are plenty of restaurants in the area, so one needn't drive to eat. That's important for two reasons: first, traffic around the hotel is always bad. Second, the hotel does not offer room service or any other in-hotel dining, other than a continental breakfast. The hotel is close to the Hollywood freeway, which makes access convenient to places such as Universal Studios and the valley. It is also close to the Hollywood Bowl, Griffith Observatory, Paramount Studios, and upper Sunset Blvd and Santa Monica Blvd. It would not be ideal for someone planning to spend lots of time at the beach because the drive to the ocean is brutal because of traffic. My room was spacious. There was a large living room area, small kitchen, and large bedroom. The bathroom was small, but adequate. The hotel provides free internet access via an ethernet line. It worked fine. There is free parking in a lot near the hotel. I would stay here again.

I stayed eight nights, with no major problems at all. The hotel staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the location is incredibly convenient, and the accomodations are clean and comfortable. This is a superb value for the money. I stayed in a room with a kitchen, and it was stocked with the various cooking necessities, so it was incredibly convenient to cook a few of own meals. Housekeeping staff was great. For example, not once did they wake me up even though I slept in late. They just took note of when I left, then tidied up the room. The lobby has a computer with Internet access, but I brought my own laptop, and each room has free internet access via an Ethernet cable. The cable had to stretch across the floor to the table, but this was a small inconveniece to pay for broadband access. The continental breakfast each morning was spartan but nice, with four different juices, coffee (regular and decaf), fresh muffins and croissants, with condiments. The hotel is located on a quiet side street nestled in the hills behind Graumann's Chinese Theater, the Kodak Theater, and the Hollywood & Highland (H&H) Mall. There is a Metro train entrance there as well. The Walk of Fame is right there. Hollywood High School is a block over. I loved the daily parade of characters in front of the Chinese Theater. Within walking distance to many shops and restaurants, tour companies, etc. The hotel has a nice patio to sit and enjoy as well. The rooms were actually fairly spacious and quiet (tip: run the A/C fan to drown out the slight traffic noice in the morning). Hotel was usually very quiet, even early morning. Try and stay on the first level towards the rear (no elevator and it is quieter). Some more tips: there is a shortcut through the mall...find it. If you have a car, there is a hidden shortcut to Orange Street as well. Even though the hotel has a fitness room (with a steam room) I needed a larger gym and there is a huge LA Fitness one block over that was only $40 for the whole week...nice club and definitely a bargain. Another tip: prearrange transportation online from LAX via a shuttle (Super Shuttle or PrimeTime Express)...will save you tons of money over a cab ride. $31 for two people. I know someone who also stayed there and paid $80 for a cab ride from LAX. The parking lot is very small, so a smaller rental car might be better. Be careful backing out onto Franklin, and park closer to the street so you don't get blocked in (there were a few mornings where there were more cars than spots).. More tips if you have time: see the Getty Center, Rodeo Drive (run into Heidi Klum there), Santa Monica Pier, Venice Beach, Malibu/PCH (someone I was with saw Sting and his wife there), drive Mullholland between the 101 and the 405...stop at the overlooks. Breathtaking homes and views..slip into a canyon road (watch out! locals drive fast in their beautiful exotic cars). Take a studio tour (Warner Bros is the best). Also try and see a show taping (Jimmy Kimmel is across the street). Also, there is usually someone handing out free tickets in front of Grauman's daily. Or check www.tvtickets.com or tvtix.com to see what's taping. Buy a stars map. See what shows are playing...esp. in West Hollywood. have a drink at an 'old' Hollywood club like the Formosa. Or, hit a hot club like the Cabana Club on a Thurs. if you can get on the guest list (search and ask for stuff like this). Take an hour to drive down Sunset Blvd. past Beverly Hills and Bel Air and UCLA to the ocean. During rush hours, avoid the freeways at all costs. Main side roads are usually quicker.

On occasion there were a few bagels present but rarely any jam. We found other chains \"free continental breakfasts\" to be infinitely better for the health-conscious. *stairs by lobby had a strong cat smell---I suspect someone had illicitly smuggled a feline into their room.

I made bookings over the internet after liasing with a staff member (whom I have now come to believe is the manager/owner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife). My friends and I booked for 5 nights in total but with a gap after the first night as we were going to visit Vegas. The staff member offered us a AAA members discount (I think it was about $5-$10) despite the knowledge that we did not hold such membership. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by its friendly staff and were presented with keys to our room which was clean, spacious, cozy and had a full kitchen. The location was excellent, within walking distance to the subway station, the Kodak Theater and the Chinese Mann Theater, in the heart of Hollywood. We checked out the next morning as we were heading to Vegas for 5 days. When we came back to the hotel after our Vegas trip, we were confronted by the hotel manager who insisted at the counter that the rates we were quoted shall be increased for the remaining 4 nights as we were not AAA member. I was prepared to show him the email with the quote but he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem too interested. After some argy-bargy, he finally said that he would let it go. The room he gave us was on their top level right down the other end of the corridor. Noone must\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in that room for months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it smelt horrible and the bed-clock was set 5 hours late. When we tried opening the windows to let some fresh air in the traffic noise was so loud, we had to close them. The bathroom door would not close properly either. In addition, the room did not have a full kitchen, just a microwave and a small fridge. So even though he did not increase our rate, we got a crappier room than what we paid for. Over the next few nights, I received dozens of bites all over my body from bugs most likely from the bed sheets. They were so itchy they kept me up all night, and the worst thing was they spread and can be passed on by skin contact. I will upload some pictures later. We were duly transferred to another room when I showed the bite marks to a staff member on our last night. It was still not the same standard as the one we stayed in on our first night but by then we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve half given up on the place. The owner came and offered me $30 cash. That was not even enough to cover the ointment and tablets from the pharmacy (they were that bad, I had to take 2 packets of tablets). Having said the above, the location was really good, the staff members (other than the manager) were super-lovely and helpful, and the cost of accommodation included a generous breakfast. I wish the other 4 nights were like the 1st, because I would have highly recommended the place. But the fiasco with the owner/manager really pissed me off and the bug bites were so disgusting I ended up chucking out some of my clothes. I mean who wants to take tablets when they are on holiday, I felt like a sick patient and I had to be so careful around my friends as to avoid passing them on. All this because the owner wanted to charge us $40 ($10/night) more than what we were legitimately quoted.

The room we stayed in had a kitchenette, which was stocked with essentials. Breakfast was supplied, consisting of bagels, muffins and juices plus tea and coffee was set up for the whole day. Whilst not gourmet, it was adequate, and when there are 8 mouths to feed (we traveled with another family of 4), it saved us a lot of money! But best of all was the SERVICE!

We are trouble with our rental car company, and they promptly helped us (thanks to Bechir at Basic Car Rentals who opened up the office on a Sunday to help us out). Alben booked dinner reservations for us, taxis, gave us so many helpful hints about shopping, transport and dining, and always with a smile! Oh and FREE internet access in the lobby too!

Upon arriving, at 10pm PST, my wife and I were informed that our room would be located directly adjacent to the entrance of the hotel. But we were assured that the sleeping quarters were near the back of the room and that the noise of people entering and exiting would hardly be heard if we noticed at all. I could not help but notice that the door to our room was slightly blocked by the service door to an employee basement (service area). The clerk was very friendly, this did help. We entered the room; it was spacious, clean and sadly reeked of natural gas. I am not a paranoid person, being a former employee of a restaurant that used natural gas I immediately knew the odor. My wife and I asked if we could have a new room. The clerk, who was very friendly, sadly informed us they were sold out for the night. After I informed him of our problem, he first attempted to turn the oven, off himself instead of calling someone in. I had to inform him hours later that his plan did not work. The clerk said at that point that he would have maintenance look at in the morning. We shared an awkward moment of silence, then I asked if they had a sister hotel were we could stay instead. I was told there was, I was refunded for the night at this hotel and charged for the night at the sister motel which was located at the end of the same block. The entire exchange took until 1am. Both clerks at both Hotels were friendly but neither offered more than verbal compensation for my displacement or troubles. I was happy they were both sorry for my trouble, but I would rather have been sleeping rather then trying to work out how to solve their gas leak issues at 1am, and then trying to find a place for my wife and I to sleep for the night. We were actually quite lucky I knew of the problem, the dumfound clerk had no such experience with natural gas and had asked that we just sleep in the room anyway. Granted he suggested we leave a window open, and even that we put a fan near the window. But if we had done so we may have gotten deathly ill or worse. What I do know of natural gas is from Avista. Avista (a power company in Washington state) has told its customers that if you smell natural gas, GET OUT! And stay out until their technicians can look at the problem. Not go inside your house and sleep on it until maintenance can look at it in the morning, oh and put a fan in the window. I repeat, he was a really nice guy and meant well. End of Day 1 We stayed for another 6 days, instead of giving you a play by play of each day, as I had above. Let me sum up. Positive comments: All employees and managers were very kind and also acted as quickly as possible to serve us as they could. Negative comments: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Unfortunately, our room was not serviced until we called at 7pm on one day. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The toilet didn't work on 3 different occasions, and the service toilet they have for just such an occasion was also out of order. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Bed sheets shorted every night \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Not enough electrical outlets. I own a CPAP machine which requires an outlet near the bed, no outlets located near the beds. Only behind them which required my wife and I to move the bed before I could use my medical device. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 No working clothes iron in the room. They did have one, but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. And after the week we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had so far I was sure they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d give me another one, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to risk what it might do to whatever I would try to iron. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 No elevator to the 2nd floor (which normally wouldn't be an issue, but I didn't pack expecting to be lifting that kind of wait up a flight of stairs) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Poor cable TV reception, I'm not even sure how you get back Cable reception. It's cable, how do you get bad cable reception? I don't know but somehow we didn't get all the channels that were listed in their hotel guide book as \"local\" \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Moldy sponge in which to clean the dishes provided by the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Had to run the taps for a while to get hot water, then couldn't get cold water, even though they ran out of two different faucets. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The toilet seat would tip as you sat on it, so if you didn't try to balance while you were using it you might tip it over. More Positive comments: But don't let all these negative comments fool you. If you don't rent a car, and you want a location that is close to the metro (rail and buses) as well as a place that is within walking distance to many attractions,** and a friendly staff. This hotel will have what you want. The staff is very friendly, and so is the management. Summation: In summation we were within 10 minutes of so many excellent LA attractions it almost made the hotel room worth it, almost. Our trip was schedule for a total of 9 days 8 nights, you might have noticed above we only stayed 7 nights. We decided it would be more cost effective to pay $100 to fly home than pay $129 to stay another night at the Hollywood Celebrity. Footnote **Man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese theater is awesome! Make sure to stop there on a weekend evening or a Friday night. The street performers are something else. And sign up to see the Jimmy Kimmel live show, its right across the street!

It's nothing like the adjacent Renaissance Hotel, but it's a far better value (in my opinion). For starters, it has that \"old world\" Hollywood charm -- the interior has an \"art deco\" look, and the walls are lined with nostalgic Hollywood posters & memorabilia. The beds are not as \"comfy\" as the nearby \"Hollywood Hills\", but the location is better, and the staff is every bit as hospitable as they are at \"Hollywood Hills\" & \"Magic Castle\" hotels. We only stayed for 4 nights, but it was a perfect fit for our needs. BTW, if you want to visit the Magic Castle, the Celebrity hotel is a member and can get you tickets (but be sure to bring a jacket & tie). Its best attributes are: 1. A great location, you can walk thru the adjacent Koday Theatre complex, right onto Hollywood Blvd. It's an easy 5-10 minute drive to Universal Hollywood 2. Value & price -- the rooms are large & adequate and a great value. We had a double-king room (it was huge). 3. Helpful & friendly staff. They bend over backwards to make your stay enjoyable 4. Decent amenities, free internet access, cool lobby, and a nice garden/patio outside the front of the hotel 5. Rooms have a small kitchen -- this is really convenient for those who want to \"eat in\". 6. It has a nostalgic Hollywood charm, complete with one-of-a-kind mural in each room (we had John Wayne in ours). The negatives are: 1. Parking is free, but it is very tight (it's best to have them park your car for you) 2. The beds are adequate & acceptable, but could be a bit more cozy/comfy 3. The room decorations remind me of the Ramada Inn, but they are adequate Overall, this is a great value hotel with a great location. I'd definitely stay here again.

He would greet us every time we entered and seemed like he genuinely cared about how our day was and what we did. He also gave us many tips on where to go, where to eat and how to get around as we didn't have a car for the first couple of days. Although I stayed there a month ago, I have stayed in around 12 hotels since then as part of a worldwide vacation and my girlfriend and I still talk about how he was the nicest 'front desk dude' we have come across. Another positive is the location. The hotel is on a dead-end street behind Hollywood Blvd. The Highland Shopping complex provides a great backdrop to the hotel and is a top place to grab a bite or browse the numerous shops. The rooms are very spacious and there is plenty of room to relax. The free parking is a nice touch, and we never had trouble finding a park. The breakfast was also simple, but a good way to tie your stomach over till lunch. My biggest gripe was the fact that there was a fair amount of noise at night from the apartment block next door. However we were there during Spring Break and from the sounds of it, the teenagers were really enjoying themselves. If you are a budget traveller and you enjoy quality service, stay here.

I had read several reviews on this hotel on this site and felt I'd give it a try. Here's my review: The hotel is conventiently located (within walking distance) to many of the Hollywood attractions. Parking is free and wasn't a problem. Check-in took forever. I was the only one checking in and I'll bet it took 15 minutes. My travel agent booked the hotel for me and typically I just have a credit card impression taken for incidentials. The clerk took my credit card and pre-charged the room cost, then took my drivers license and wrote down my license number, etc. Anyway, I got in. The hotel apprears to once have been apartments that have been converted into hotel rooms. As a result, you have a small kitchen in your room and the room is spacious enough. Unfortunately, the room needed some updating. I kind of felt like I was staying in a tired Econo Lodge on the side of the freeway. Other than the room decor, it was nice enough. Free high-speed internet, coffee 24/7 and continental breakfast is included in the rate. Unfortunately it started at 8:00 a.m. and I was out by then. The workout room was pretty lame but there were steambath's if one chose to use. The neighborhood can get pretty rough at night so I couldn't rate this for children.

While the hotel website photos looked really nice, we found the upgrades were only done at the front foyer. The rooms were old. Check out the pictures taken by a reviewer posted on Nov. 12, 2005. They are quite representative of what we saw. On the bright side, the location is excellent; five minutes walking distance to Hollywood Blvd, Kodak Theatre and Mann's Chinese Theatre. Parking was included which was great. Although there's parking for $2.00 an hour for the first 4 hours at the Hollywood and Highland Shopping Centre (next to the Renaissance Hotel). The hotel staff was very helpful, especially Alvin at the front desk. The breakfast was adequate although the coffee was terrible. The room was also average and it had a moldy smell to it. The only thing that really needed improvement was the shower head, we had water trickling the whole time. Overall, we chose this hotel for its location and free parking. The points of interest in LA are pretty spread out so having a car was definitely helpful.

The room was a bit noisy as you can hear everything in the room above you, including people walking around, so request a room on the 2nd floor. The hotel offers a good continental breakfast with a variety of juices, muffins, croissants & bagels. They offer free use of a computer with internet access in the lobby which is really a nice touch.

When we arrived, the hotel told us that they had a \"plumbing problem\" and offered us a room at their sister property the Hollywood Liberty Hotel across the street. They told us we could have a room at the Celebrity if we wanted to wait until 10 pm for it. This was not acceptable for us, as we had just driven for seven hours and needed to get ready to go to a party. I took the room they offered at the Liberty out of sheer exhaustion, I wish I had inspected it more closely before I agreed to spend a night in this dump. The halls and rooms smelled like cigarettes- despite the signs indicating that the hotel was non-smoking. What can I say about the room- my attached photos tell most of the story. The heat was a space heater! The shower didn't have hot water until the manager came in and said, \"You have to find it...\" and then calibrated it just so until a lukewarm trickle came out. The bathroom looked like it had been outfitted on a trip to the Dollar Depot, with a cheap plastic pink tension rod to hold up the shower curtain (actually it was just a liner). The bathmat was a hand towel. The coverlet on the bed was obviously stained and yellowed when we turned it down. The bed had no fitted sheet on it, so within five minutes of lying in it, the sheet was off and we were lying on the mattress. The most disgusting feature of this room was the walls. The walls were heavily stained with and looked as if they were last painted in the Nixon administration. There were cigarette ashes pooled in the windowsill of the bathroom. The biggest affront was that this room was supposedly comparable to the Celebrity. This room made the Super 8 seem like a four star resort by comparison. I never saw any of the rooms at the Celebrity but I can guarantee there was no steam room at the Liberty! I can't believe the owners have the gall to charge more than $40 per night for this place. The most outrageous thing is that Hollywood Celebrity offered no apology, no discount off the room or a free night at a later date, which would have been totally appropriate. They basically told us we could still come over for the continental breakfast at the Celebrity. No effort was made to refund any of my money, even though I had pre-paid a higher rate for the Celebrity. I hate to say it, but the way in which management treated us, I had the sinking feeling that they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really have a plumbing problem, but that they had overbooked and given our room to someone else. Buyers beware! If they offer you a room at the Liberty, politely decline and take your business elsewhere\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6", "Date": "November 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay - Terrific Location!!\u201d", "Author": "Pharmgrrrl", "ReviewID": "UR4107704", "Content": "Stayed at the Hollywood Celebrity from Nov 2nd-6th, 2005. The rooms were nice and large....everything was really clean. The rooms were not brand new, but everything was in great shape. The lobby area was nice and bright. Everything seemed to sparkle! The front patio was nice to sit and take a break. The beds were comfy and it was a really quiet place to stay - no loud parties while we were there. Probably one of the key sellers for this hotel is location. Just a 5-10 minute walk from the center of everything in Hollywood. Right behind Kodak Theater and Hollywood and Highland. We were even able to cut through the parking lot for Hollywood and Highland and felt completely safe at all times. As some previous posts have indicated - the parking lot is small. We never had a problem getting parking while we were there though. The day we left - we had a flight out at 6am, so we left the hotel in the morning hours. Our car was blocked in - but the front desk guy had all of the keys for the cars blocking ours and had our car unblocked in minutes. One thing i would suggest for improvement in this hotel is more counter space in the bathrooms. That was a bit lacking. We used the window sill for our bathroom items, but there was not much room there. A small shelf was also on the mirror. Another thing that would be beneficial is better lighting in the bathroom/vanity area. It was a bit dim. Oh - and the hairdryer in our room wasn't extremely powerful, but it got the job done. Would definitely stay here again in a minute.

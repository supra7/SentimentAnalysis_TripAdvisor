{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Clean and adequate This place was convenient to my purpose (taking a language class at the nearby Irish Cultural Center) so it was fine. The place was fairly clean, except for a wet spot in the carpet when we checked in. I was able to check in early, which mostly involved dropping off my luggage at noon while I went to visit the zoo across the street with a friend. When I checked in, I was asked if I was paying or my friend was paying (we were both using the room), and I said it was half/half. He gave my card back. When we tried to get in the next day, it was locked - I had to go give my card again for the rest of the stay. He should have taken care of it when we checked in!There were some strange folks hanging out about in front of the hotel the nights we were there, and one night they came inside - evidently they were guests as well (a group of young men, rather rowdy). However, it was quiet inside the room, no worries. I checked out quickly for my early morning flight. Continental breakfast was pre-wrapped danish and juice, tea. We passed and went to a GREAT breakfast place about two blocks down towards the beach with wonderful omelettes.", "Date": "Oct 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR162012278", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "GreenDragon9"}, {"Content": "Confirm reservation and beware! I booked this room for my wife and son through Cheaptickets.com. I had stayed here in May and found the room acceptable and fairly clean. I booked for my wife a Non -smoking room and called a few days before to make sure it was on the books. My wife arrived (it's the only hotel near my son's college) and her credit card was swiped. She went to her room to find a smoke stenched smelling room. She went to the desk and explained she had a non - smoking ( with a copy of the reservation confirmation in hand) We had booked the hotel for 2 nights. The unhelpful and rude person at the desk explained that was all they had, to take it or leave it and no matter what would be charged for 1 night. A call to Cheaptickets was unhelpful ( it seemed to be an overseas call center) My wife left and found another hotel by the airport, with a helpful staff. I would advise you to look elsewhere for a hotel and to avoid this hotel.", "Date": "Sep 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR320288716", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "dellgang"}, {"Content": "Great For The Zoo........ But... I booked this hotel thinking that there would be more in the area, however with no transport once the bike was returned unless pizza is your favourite meal, it's a good 15 min walk to anything else.

The hotel itself is in really good nick and the staff friendly and helpfull, but for me the location and amenities let it down.", "Date": "Jul 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR388925421", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "rideruk"}, {"Content": "Good value for money I can recommend this Days Inn straight away although I consider myself being quite picky. It is located 5 minutes from the beach and half an hour from Union square either by tram (2 min walk) or drive.The room looked refurbished and very clean.The rate was very low for San Francisco in comparison to the quality of the room.Obviously you do not get a real breakfast at a Days Inn (Coffee, Orange juice and muffins or similar) but this is understandable at this price.Though it is quite far out it is worth to stay there if you are a budget traveller and don't care about 30 minutes drive to downtown or Fishermans Wharf.Side note: This Days Inn is so much better than the one on Lombard Street - you can't compare.We enjoyed our 5 nights here.", "Date": "Sep 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR465876616", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "TravellerfromGermany"}, {"Content": "Reservation Not Honored We made two reservations a couple of weeks in advance for two nights, a Thursday night and a Saturday night skipping a Friday side trip.

Seemed like you had to run into it to get it unjammed. Next, top quilt on bed had cigarette burns all over it. But, this was not the worst of it. We came back 1 night and found about 5 cops in front of our room talking to someone who was staying there. Still don't know what that was all about, but they were right in front of our room and they made it seem like we were inconveniencing them getting into OUR room which we were paying for. (This was late at night, so were were tired and just wanted to go to bed) This same night, at about 2 AM some weirdo came running through the halls claiming to be SFPD yelling and knocking on all the doors saying open up, open up, SFPD. I'm assuming he meant San Francisco Police Department. We asked to see his badge and he just covered up our peep hole. The problem with this was that the outside doors are supposed to be key only access after 10 PM- and this was well after that. I'll guess they forgot to lock them that night. Anyways, moving on... Their Deluxe continental breakfast consisted of cheap packaged danishes or an apple. I still can't figure out how they get deluxe out of that. Finally, when we checked out, the management gave us conflicting stories to what we heard from the night before and would only give us 10% off for the 1 night we couldn't sleep. After all this, I would tell anyone to not stay at this shack of a place that feels unsafe and where the staff doesn't care a bit for their customers. I would never stay here again. I'd rather pay more and feel safe.", "Date": "Jul 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR668401853", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "mikeflora1"}, {"Content": "Unprofessional and very poor customer service I made reservations for this location a month in advance and was given two confirmation numbers one for each room. When I called to confirm my reservations a few days prior to my arrival I was told they did not have anything in their system under my name or reservation numbers and on top of that they were sold out. Instead of apologizing to me for their internal system errors, they made me feel as those I was lying. Bad enough they can't keep accurate records, compound that with rude customer service and it is no wonder they get bad reviews. This management team needs a reality check. I would not stay here if it were free. They did me a favor in losing my reservation.

The rooms are clean. The staff was accomodating to me. There are no elevators, so be prepared for that if you have a room on the second floor. It is a very nice budget hotel.

This hotel turned out to be great. We made the reservation less than a week before, for less than $100, which is a very cheap price for San Francisco. It wasn't the Four Seasons, but it worked perfectly for the night. We had no problems checking in or out. Our room was fine, with no visible signs of problems (Bugs, noise, grime etc.) It actually had five bay windows and was very roomy. There was no real breakfast, but for $100, I wouldn't expect it. The woman at the front desk was friendly. I would not reccomend this for someone who really enjoys spending time in their hotel all the time. As I said before, it is not the Four Seasons. It is right across from the zoo, and the beach is down the street so there is plenty to do. However, if you are going to spend a lot of time downtown and in the Union Square, Fisherman's Wharf area, be aware that you will have to drive there or take an expensive taxi ride. Driving in San Francisco can be a challenge for some people not used to it. Also, this hotel does not have great parking, but the neighborhood was pretty safe.Overall, I was pleased with this hotel and I would probably stay there again.", "Date": "Jan 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR612290630", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lipstickLIT"}, {"Content": "Did the trick!

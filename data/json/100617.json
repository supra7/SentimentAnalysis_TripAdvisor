Through out my travels, they have not disappointed me. This particular hotel has a large layout. There is an open large court yard in the middle of the hotel with the rooms wrapping around it. One very large square. I am sure the court yard is very pretty during spring and summer. I am from the Seattle so I can say that previous reviews regarding noise from the surrounding area should not be given much attention. The hotel is right next to Seatac Airport! You are going to have the usual hustle and bustle that comes with staying near the airport. There are plenty of rooms that do not face the main road. I only heard one plane the entire night. It is to be expected. The room was very nice, usual Hilton standards. The bed was very comfortable as well as the pillows. The pillows impressed me so much that I looked at the tag inside to find the manufacturer and I will be purchasing a few. Nice layout of room, large flat screen TV, desk, safe and chair with ottoman for reading. The cons: no free wifi unless you are an HHonors member. The bathroom was one of the smallest I've seen at a Hilton, though very nice with basic toiletries provided. The ice and vending machines are difficult to locate, no map provided by the hotel. Plan on paying for parking! Self parking is $20 per night in the hotel garage. I did not ask about valet, however I noticed cars parked via the valet service were NOT parked in the large garage but out in the elements. Odd... I like the zip in/zip out option for check out. However, in regard to this particular hotel, you must use your hotel room key to enter and exit the garage. There is a drop box for your room key after you swipe it to leave but it was NOT noted on the bill slipped under the door. You have NO way of knowing about this beforehand. If you follow the directions on the bill, leaving your key in the room, you can not exit the parking area. The devil is in the details. A little more customer service at check in would help OR this hotel can not this on the bill. Overall, happy with my one night. I would stay again but I would ask more questions at check in. ****Hotel restaurant is expensive**** Try the 13 Coins restaurant, it is less than a block away and is a local hot spot.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cClose to the airport w/paper thin walls\u201d", "Author": "lionesslight", "ReviewID": "UR124985088", "Content": "Rooms are very nice, beds and pillows are comfortable.

The hotel is only about 4 storeys high, and the numbering of the rooms basically reads \"1\" + \"floor\" + \"room number (on that floor)\". If you have a lot of luggage with you, I highly suggest that you emphasize on getting a room closer to the entrance. I had 5 pieces of luggage as I checked in, and the receptionist handling the check-in assigned one of the furthest rooms possible which took me over 7 minutes to push the luggage trolley all the way to my room. After getting all my luggage into the room, which I'd expected to be a larger size considering I was supposed to be paying for a \"deluxe garden view\" (the room is smaller than what you would find in a Hampton Inn), I headed out to get food as their restaurant was closed. Along the way I asked the receptionist why I was given a room so far away when I had all that luggage. The girl just frowned and said the hotel was fully booked and that I should have made the request earlier. When I told her that I had requested - as I booked on-line - that the room not be far from the elevator, she then said \"can I send someone to help you then?\" Being a Hilton Gold VIP member, I am entitled to either a free upgrade (where available), or breakfast, or a 1000 points HHonors bonus. I had an early flight out so I skipped breakfast. Upon check-out I asked if she would note on the bill that I should get the 1000 points, and the girl (a different undertrained person) looks at me and smiles as she recites, \"oh, just tell the Hilton Hhonors people that you didn't have breakfast and they should give you the miles.\" What Hilton Hhonors people? It was unfortunate that I didn't have time to speak to her more, but perhaps that's a blessing as I don't think it would have helped me, but possibly only help her learn that I don't work for Hilton, nor are there Hilton Hhonors people standing around me to hear a plea about me not having breakfast at one of their lesser properties so they award me with 1000 miles. Being a Gold VIP member, and having to deal with this kind of lack of service, I don't recommend staying at this hotel unless you're travelling with over 400 other people and all of you want to stay in the same property. While the hotel is very near the airport, and that right out the back-door of the property is the lightrail stop, downtown Seattle is not 15 minutes a ride away as their website claims.

Access is fairly easy although parking can be a chore unless you're willing to pay for valet parking (and even if you \"self park\" in the garage behind the hotel, you will pay a stiff daily charge).

While some rooms are a fair walk from the lobby area, my room was close to the elevators located just across from the check-in desk. The room itself was average size and was in all respects updated and very clean from the bedding (duvet) to the bath and shower. Surprisingly for being so near the airport there was virtually no noise (from the airport) and little noise from the hallway. The one surprise was the so-called \"business center\" which is essentially a closet with two internet equipped PC's located at the far end of the lobby near the large meeting rooms. To sum up, this Hilton has been updated and is well-maintained. Rooms are a reasonable value given the convenience of the hotel's location (the hotel offers both a shuttle bus as well as \"park and fly\" packages).

Once for convenience as we began our trip after a late night flight arrival and once at the end of the trip before a morning departure. For a business hotel I'd rate as generally acceptable but nothing special. On the plus side, even at late night, there was a valet on premises to park your car. On the negative side, you had to go find him if you wanted his assistance (both nights). Didn't come to greet us or offer to help with luggage. As a result we decided to simply save the six bucks extra for valet parking. The good news is that the self park is an enclosed garage. The bad news is that it costs $20 a night and seems to be about a quarter mile walk (perhaps a tad exaggerated) from the room elevators. There also seemed to be quite a difference between the rooms we received on the two nights. The first one seemed less fresh and you didn't need an alarm clock because the toilet flush and shower of the room next door served that purpose. The second had turn down service prepared for us when we arrived. The first room had a pillow on the bed with several stains on the cover (but we just tossed that one on the floor -- there were plenty of others on the bed.) The second bed was comfy and spring time fresh. So I guess it's also luck of the draw. The breakfast buffet, however, was pretty nicely done both mornings and it seems as if that is consistent. Not quite as extensive as some Hilton buffets but more than adequate for our purposes and nicely presented. The staff at breakfast seemed a little confused about what is or what isn't included in the complimentary continental coupon for Diamond members but for $3 you can upgrade to the hot buffet, although one day the upgrade included an offer of made to order eggs and the other day it didn't. So for convenience, it's hard to beat -- although International Blvd is lined with alternatives that can be considered. For service it's pretty average and unusually uneven.

Most others we have ranked 4 or 5, so we are prone to like the Hilton chain. That said, the Seattle-Tacoma Airport Hilton seems like a distant cousin. Checking in at the Honors Desk and using points, I was treated indifferently and with a yawn. The hotel layout is a monstrosity -- most rooms are located much to far from the elevator.

The Hilton at SEA-TAC does everything we want in a hotel, and more. There are two wings of rooms, a 4-story building right by the check-in desk, where they house people who are Hilton HHonors guests, and another long wing, which is just fine, but a bit of a schlep from the lobby and restaurant. The bell desk is run by people who are obliging and friendly and helpful. Whatever help we need, they provide, cheerfully. You can tell how good the bell desk is by the fact that there are lots of bellmen who have been on the desk for years. The restaurant is basically a steak place -- with really, really good steaks -- but also has a good selection of other dishes, including vegetarian options. We often make a whole meal out of two or three of the appetizers. But even though we're not spending the money that others might spend, the service is never grudging or slow, and we're always treated as if we're buying the big ticket dinners. The restaurant also does a nice breakfast -- buffet style or off the menu. In the lobby, there's a nice bar area with several big-screen TVs, and there's a Starbucks (it is Seattle after all). The rooms are clean, quiet, comfortable. If something isn't right, housekeeping tries very hard to make it right, and quickly. Most recently, we wanted a couple of extra feather pillows -- we called down, the person said \"right away\", and literally 30 seconds later, there was a knock on the door. Wonderful. 99% of the time, the front desk is seamless and efficient. Sometimes, a new hire or trainee checks us in, and forgets to tell us our options -- for example, as Hilton Gold, I get a couple of breakfast coupons; the most recent stay, when I said I couldn't use them, the clerk said \"you can use them for credit on dinner\" and I said we would be leaving on the shuttle at 5, well before breakfast, and eating out for dinner with friends. He then FORGOT to say \"well, we can credit your account 1000 points instead of giving you coupons which you can't use...\" If I had not known I was entitled to the points, I would have lost them. But to the hotel's credit, when I called down and spoke to the front desk manager, she said she'd take care of the credit right away. Their airport shuttles run at :05, :25, and :45 past every hour from about 5 AM until about midnight, and if you need to get to the airport in the middle of the night, they get you there.

We were visiting Seattle for a banquet in the Renton area and felt that this location would be satisfactory enough for an overnight stay even though we would be driving quite a bit between the hotel, the banquet and other activities we had planned to do while in town. The first thing I realized after booking this hotel was that parking was not included. In fact, you are pretty hard pressed to find too many 3 star or better properties near the airport that do not charge for parking in addition to the room price. There are a few 2 star and 2.5 star places that do offer guests parking as part of their stay and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m actively seeking them out when I stay in the Seattle or SeaTac area. I suppose the parking is the only issue I have with this property, $20+tax/night for parking is a little high. I was pleased that we had unlimited in/out privileges with the parking and the room key card was utilized to let us in and out of the parking garage. The parking garage is at the rear of the property and also houses a large chunk of the Hilton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference center. A covered walkway connects the parking garage/conference center to the rest of the property. Our room was quite spacious even though it was a double queen room. The room did adjoin another guestroom, however we never heard or saw any of the guests that might have been staying in the rooms next to ours. Linens were bright and clean and the room was very well kept up, in keeping with typical Hilton standards. I was pleased to see that there was no bedspread, but only a small decorative cover at the foot of the bed. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m always very glad when I visit a hotel that has dispensed with full bead spreads and covers beds in linens that are fully launderable after each guest. The room appeared to have been upgraded and updated at least in the last couple of years. Plumbing features and the bathroom had been fully updated with tile and granite. Coffee service in the room was good, but there were only disposable cups for the coffee. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a bad thing, but an observation as one of the photos for this hotel on Trip Advisor indicates that there are china mugs for the coffee station. The mugs must have gone away at some point in the past for some reason. For a one night stay, or longer for a conference or a weekend, the Hilton at SeaTac is a very nice property.

The snow was snarling traffic around the airport so it is somewhat understandable about the Hilton shuttle's delay. The check-in staff were quite friendly. The lobby of the hotel was very cozy with a huge fireplace and comfy chairs. The room was standard Hilton. Nice appointments, clean. I love the Hilton pillows so much I ordered one for my own bed. I ate at the bar. The restaurant had a wait of an hour, although it was only half full. Took a while for the hostess to arrive and assist me.

Got killed with the $20/night parking fee that Priceline fails to mention. Now for the surprises. Checked in around 7pm on a Sunday post Thanksgiving and got a \"free upgrade\" upon check in which surprised me! First offer was for a single king bed with court yard view. Asked if that was easy to get to for unloading 4 suitcases and 4 carry on's. The desk agent thought about it for a minute and then offered me a better room (double king bed!) a short distance from the parking garage and easy access to the side doors. It had an obstructed view of the courtyard, but this time of year who cares. We had more than enough space to spread out and repack our luggage one last time. The TV in the room is a large 37 inch HD flat screen with 95% of the channels shown in HD. There were 5 or so analog channels (Fox News and some others) and 5 or so audio only channels. So now to pro and cons of staying here. Pros: Free 2 computer and printer business center (room key required) Computers are not secure like the Fedex Office computers. Public and house phones across the hall from the computer room. Friendly staff. Convenient location to airport with large parking garage at hotel. Wifi free if you goto the lobby and sit in the big couches. Small retail store for travelers aids. Starbucks hot coffee served at lobby restaurant, which is a steak and chops and wine restaurant. Rooms highly insulated against aircraft noise (still comes through a bit) State of the art temperature control for room on wall. Window heater/arico unit is quieter than most. Beds are comfortable but pillows are really soft. Free USA Today delivered to door early in the morning. Checkout easy if everything is prepaid, can be done via a button on the phone. Ipod ready radio on night stand with multi button generalized music style selection. TV has a flight departure channel. Rooms are modern and new looking (found some paint on the sprinkler head). Bath/Shower has railing for lesser mobile persons to hold on to while getting in and out of the shower. Two levels of soap/shampoo holders Cons: $20/night + tax parking fee (covered and monitored parking garage) and $26/night + tax for Valet. (mostly outside parking) $4.95(?) for 30 mins of wired in room internet or $12.95(?) for 24hrs. $4 a bottle \"artisan\" water in room. Water pressure in shower head really low (flow restrictor) compared to faucet output to tub. Housekeeping left the carts near our room (end of hallway) on Sunday and cleared them out at end of the shift on Monday. Housekeeping did not clean up sticky mess on TV remote and TV counter top before we checked in. Also did not refresh the room on Monday morning, called them Monday night and they sent someone over to give fresh wash clothes and empty the trash cans. Told them to forget the beds as it was 7pm at night. They offered 2 bottles of \"cheap\" water on the house for the inconvenience. Blackout curtains work ok, but do not really \"blackout\" the early morning light. Did see one \"working girl\" leaving the hotel in the hallway since the hotel has many entrances to the rooms hallways and this part of Seattle is known for this trade to be around. Note: They offer a recycle bag, but when the housekeeper came at night (see above) she tossed the bag and all the rest of the trash into a black trash bag.. Maybe it is sorted out later.

My experiences here have been very favorable, and I have found the staff polite and helpful. The rooms, while not huge, are quite comfortable. Beds feature down comforters and pillows with medium firm mattresses. Each room also has a nice size flat screen T.V. One of the downsides is the sheer size of the property. The first time I stayed here it took about 10-15 minutes just to walk one way from the conference end of the building to my room. With bags you can imagine how that might be. If you have a car, parking can get pricey (i.e. $20/night), however this opens more dining and sight-seeing options for you. Without a car you are pretty limited to a few restaurants within walking distance. Also, you need to be careful walking alone, because the nearby neighborhoods (a moderately transitional area) could be a safety concern.

I could have walked away from the desk, opened up my laptop, and booked the king room at the same rate without paying the $10.00 and then returned to the desk and informed his smug face that I had a reservation but it was after 1:00 am and I was too tired to argue so my wife and I stayed in a room with two double beds.

Throw in the fact that we were able to book our room via Priceline for $53 (including tax) and it becomes a perfect experience.

The first thing is that the hotel is undergoing some flooring/carpeting upgrades in some common areas and hallways. The second is that non-valet parking is $20 a night, which is a bit higher than other hotels in the area, but is still within reason (especially considering the parking garage is a secure facility, unlike at some other hotels).

I wanted to stay near the airport or near downtown because the plan was to take advantage of the public transportation system rather than rent a car. I chose the Hilton Seattle Airport beacause of the location (3 blocks from SeaTac, 1 block from the bus stop), and the ridiculously good price on a package deal from Priceline.com. The hotel is vast, and the lobby area is spacious and elegant, but warm and welcoming. The room we received was probably the \"Priceline Special\", facing the noisy street and right across the hall from the elevators. The beds were hard as rocks and they aren't very generous with the usual toiletry items that hotels usually provide. I found better at Hampton Inn, a less expensive cousin of Hilton. However, for the price I got, I won't complain much. It was clean and safe, which was my primary requirement, and service overall was friendly and efficient. The free hotel shuttle to the airport and nearby restaurants/shopping was nice, and the drivers were courteous and helpful. Definitely noted the change in attitude when the young lady at the front desk saw we were Priceling guests at check-in. She was less friendly than when we first approached. Whatever...getting a good deal on anything these days is a good thing. The food from Spencer's restaurant in the hotel was very good from what we sampled, but not stellar. A bit pricey compared to places that serve equivalent fare. There is an espresso bar with coffee, beverages, and pastries, and it opens at 5:30 am - great for those on the go. After hours, the bartender can help you with the coffee or sweets, and it's more reasonable than room service. There are other eateries nearby, from your friendly neighborhood Denny's within a mile in each direction, to a local favorite called \"13 Coins\" that is 2 blocks away, tucked away in an office building. Not cheap, but really good. Go back toward the airport entrance and a little further beyond, and there is a busy intersection with other places to eat, as well as a few places in the airport itself that are not beyond security. The hotel does charge for every little thing including the high-speed internet in your room, so watch out for the services you use. The business center only has 2 computers, and can get crowded, but a good alternative to being charged $12.95 a day for using your laptop in your room, plus being charged for printing documents. Near the front desk there is an ATM, SeaTac flight information display, and a kiosk to print your boarding passes, all easily accessed. If you need odds and ends, there is a Seven-Eleven just up the hill on 176th Street, behind the hotel. Go during daylight though, because it isn't the best neighborhood. After dark, definitely stay close to the hotel or travel in groups if on foot. If you can get a decent deal, I'd recommend this hotel, but not sure if I'd pay full rack rate for a stay. I don't usually give it a second thought for a Hilton, but at times I felt it was lacking for a hotel that carries that name.

We never got a room clean-up for the second day and I had to call at 6:30 p.m. and ask if anyone was going to service our room and could we at least get fresh towels. There had been a cleaning cart two rooms down for most of the afternoon but the front desk explained that not all rooms were on the cleaning list. Really? For $159 a night and it doesn't get freshened up unless you call to ask? When someone did appear, it was creepy. He knocked and before we could go to the door, he had his key into the lock, and was in the room. He had no cart. No towels. Spoke very broken English and we couldn't figure out what he was doing in our room. Which speaking of service--the morning gals at the coffee stand need to be learn some customer service. One in particular was just downright surly and snotty to every customer in line. The prices for the restaurant are extremely over-piced and the meals were greasy, and every time we tried to eat they were extremely busy and the service was slow. However, even if you wanted to bring food in with you..there is no refrigerator in the room. ALTHOUGH, there was a locked cabinet where one had obviously at one time been. When we asked the front desk, we were told they took them all out! The hotel itself needs some attention. One of the gates at the pool didn't work, and there were numerous people trying to use it and banging the gate before someone inside would let them in. In the room, one of the desk drawers was broken. At check-out, two room service charges were billed to my room, even though we told them to bill them to the other party's room traveling with us. And don't even bother trying to order a pot of coffee--there is only two small cups in the room--not even a small coffee pot to make your own. But if you try to order from room service--that's $29 bucks for a pot of coffee, plus we waited 40 minutes for our pot of coffee. 40 Minutes for a pot of coffee??? The guy who delivered it was very nice and apologized saying they were under-staffed, and he took off our food delivery charge since it was just a pot of coffee. Kudos to him--he was pretty much the only nice thing about this hotel. And then, the worst of all is the $20 PER DAY parking charge. Oh yes, plus a tax which looked like it was 18%. On parking???? When every other hotel in the area is free parking. This hotel is a total rip-off. There are so many other hotels in the area--pick one of the other 5 star ones--including a Radisson right next door.

We were staying overnight before our Alaskan cruise out of Seattle. The hotel is directly across from the airport and, with a little direction, we were able to catch the Doubletree/Hilton shuttle that lets off at The Doubletree first. It took us about 15 minutes to get to the hotel after a driver change and the first stop. The shuttle was free and pulled right up to the door. The lobby was very nice with a faux firepalce and plenty of couches and recliners. Very easy and friendly check in. There were a bunch of little Irish Dance contest girls clogging up the hotel which meant free entertainment watching the spectacular performances of the contestants in the conference center. The room was nicely decorated and plenty big. The bedding was luxurious and very comfortable. The grounds were immaculately maintained. There was an outdoor pool and a very large hot tub. We were very impressed. We did not try the hotel's restaurant, but ventured out instead. Pass up 13 Coins unless you are wanting to pay $100.00 for dinner and go to Gregory's Bar and Grill about two blocks further south. We got there for the 9-11 p.m. \"happy hour\" and got some great food and drink specials. No exaggerating....most appetizers were $3 and under. We had a couple of drinks and stuffed ourselves for $22 plus a tip. We felt safe walking down International Boulevard, which was very well lit. There was a 7-11 just up the hill across from the Hilton's Conference Center to get our forgotten tube of toothpaste and a light breakfast. We did not hear any noise from the airport. We were glad we weren't driving and having to pay the $20 per night parking the hotel charges in a parking garage that is quite a walk to the lobby.

So, when i saw a Japanese airline crew at the check in desk, I was set for a comfortable room and a great meal. But my personal opinion of this property is somewhat mixed. As others have commented, Spencers, the hotel's restaurant, is more a big, noisy community tavern than a place to have a quiet meal. Whether it is expensive or not is beside the point. I find the place offputting. And from from the number of room service trays in the hallways, I'd say others probably agreed with me. Another issue I had was the walk to the parking garage. Okay, I'll be 66 next birthday, but I'm in pretty good shape. I found that once on the main floor, the walk to the garage was at least a city-block. Picture the hotel as the shape of a shoe box. My room was at the front of the box. The parking structure was out the back of the box and in another buildng that faces a street a block away. Granted they do valet parking. But if what you remember about the property is the long, long walk to the parking garage, then the property can't possibly be five star. I will say I had a comfortable room. And in response to the reviewer who complained about the housekeeping, I find that hard to believe. I got two to three knocks on my door in the morning with offers to clean my room. This is *with* my 'Do Not Disturb' sign posted on my doorknob. Perhaps the maids can't read? No matter -- better clean than dirty. As I say, my room was comfortable and at night I slept like a baby. There was a strong Wifi signal and I moved some gigantic graphics files -- whatever the cost -- so I feel I got my money's worth from the hotel's Internet.

( We've stayed at a lot of hotels near the Sea Tac airport, and I think that we've finally found a good one that meets our needs.) Dozens of flights in and out of the airport had been canceled because of a snowstorm. Three feet of snow had fallen at our home in Spokane and the city was coping, but three inches of snow in Seattle and the city grinds to a complete halt! The shuttle easily took us from the airport the short distance to the hotel. Our check in was perfect without any problems, which was a little surprising considering the long long of guests waiting at the counter. Because of the storm, many employees had been held over at the hotel and not gone home. Dozens had worked back to back shifts and many had stayed overnight themselves. (When it snows in Seattle, the city stops suddenly and transportation is very difficult.) The front desk staff could have been cranky but they weren't. I could tell they were tired, but they all seemed to pull together to help out. That's a good sign in the hotel industry. I came in contact with quite a few hotel staff members and they all seemed to want to pitch in and help to get through the crisis. I saw more smiles than frowns. We had connecting king rooms 2105 and 2107 on the ground floor across the hall from several conference and meeting rooms. ($119 plus tax) They were big and comfortable. Everything worked. The bathrooms were a bit small and, for some reason, the toilets were angled diagonally out from the corner of the bathroom, but everything was neat and clean. The business center's two computers and two printers worked. There is a Spencer's steak restaurant in the lobby, and while the food was pretty good it was unusually expensive and the service was unbearably slow. I'll give the restaurant staff some credit for dealing with the bad weather and I'm guessing that a lot of employees weren't able to show up for work, but dinner for four took two hours and cost $250. The waiters all seemed to ignore us, as did the receptionist and the manager. That could have been a better experience and the restaurant itself is not a self-contained unit, it's in a corner of the lobby and during our stay it was extremely cold and drafty. Our nights were peaceful and room service breakfast arrived precisely at the time we had ordered it, which is a very good thing! The fan/air conditioning/heating system in our room seemed extremely noisy. It would have been nicer if it was quieter. Even though there's an outdoor pool on site, it would have been nice if a facility this big had an indoor pool as well. But you can't have everything!

Since I live in Spokane, Washignton, I did not want to start my vacation by getting up at 2:00 in the morning to catch a 5:00am flight from Spokane to Seattle and then take a 9:00 flight to Hawaii. On the way back, the flights from Hawaii to Seattle get in after 10:00pm making it challenging (but not impossible) to make a connection back to Spokane. I think that this was a good choice to make and I would definitley do this again. The accomodations were very good and the staff (with one exception) was excellent. An on-demand free shuttle to and from the airport is another highlight. The hotel is almost across the street from the airport. It can be a little noisy but that's to be expected at an airport hotel. I would caution anyone who has never landed at Sea-tac airport that the courtesy shuttles are all in the parking garage. It is necessary to take a skywalk and an elevator to the shuttle area. If you have a lot of baggage definitely rent a cart in the baggage claim area. On my first stay, the shuttle driver was very attentive and friendly and offerred to take my bags up to my room upon check-in. The shuttle drivers take turns and also serve as bellhops. This was very welcome to me because I have been recovering from surgery. However, on my second stay, I did not receive as nice a welcome either from the shuttle driver or the front desk staff. I did arrive around 1030pm and there were other guests checking in at the same time. When I did arrive at the check-in desk, the clerk was apologetic for my wait for the shuttle. This kind of puzzled me because I didn't have much of a wait. It turns out that he thought I was someone else. I was never asked if I needed help to my room. I know I should have asked for assistance but did not which was not good for me physically. It just didn't seem like there was anyone available. Since I am a hilton honors member, I was given an option with my reservation confirmation to order something light through room service in advance. I did so. I inquired about this at the front desk. Without checking at all, the same front desk clerk said that it is the room. This was not the case. It was delivered to me fairly promptly. I do not fault the food service department because I actually arrived earlier than anticipated. However, I felt that the clerk just couldn't be bothered to check. I also called down to the front desk about a problem with one of the room phones in that the speed dials to the desk did not work. The same clerk who had helped me previously answered the phone. He was neither helpful about this situation or very helpful regarding my quesitons about the hotel's business center. I believe that this was most likely a training issue with this individual employee and the not overall service orientaiton for the hotel. All of my other encounters with hotel employees were very postiive. Speaking of food, the hotel restaurant, Spencers is first class. I am familiar with this restaurant since there is also a Spencers at the Doubletree in Spokane. This is not an inexpensive restaurant but the steaks are first class. The restaurant is open for breakfast and dinner. I did have breakfast in the restaurant the second time I stayed there. They had a very extensive breakfast buffet for $17. It was excellent. I'm not sure if they offer this buffet every morning. I would definitely stay at this hotel again for similar circumstances. I fly out of Seattle a lot to go to other parts of the country. It is very convenient to break up the trip. Personally, I probably would not stay here if I was spending any length of time in Seattle itself since it can take an hour from the airport to Downtown Seattle when there's a lot of traffic (which in Seattle is most of the time!). It is doable to do this though.

For the priceline rate I got, I'd give it a 4.5 or a 5 (in comparison with other hotels which list that rate on their websites) The Hilton airport (right across from the Seattle airport) is rated a 3* and in my experience, is a pretty good hotel for that level (and for the rate we got -$65; the priceline rate for the hotel was much higher, as was the lowest rate on the Hilton web page). The airport shuttle is free and was quick for us, with a great driver who was very helpful with all our luggage. He was also great about answering questions, giving helpful advice, and so on. The hotel was very nice, although the layout was not terrific: there are two different buildings with rooms, and the pool and fitness rooms are in the center of one. To get to them from the other building, you have to walk back through the lobby, past the restaurant, and past the conference rooms. The pool is fairly decent for a hotel pool ( lap swimming would be possible - it's rectangular) although it's probably only about 10-12 yards long); the hottub as well. Towels were provided at the pool. I didn't use the (free) fitness room but there seemed to be a large number of machines as I walked past (didn't look closely so can't comment on quality). The rooms around the pool likely suffer from pool noise, but we were in the other building. I suspect the rooms in the building without the pool get a lot of traffic noise - we were on the backside, away from International Blvd, but the loading dock was outside our window. We left fairly early but there were already a couple of trucks. Other than that, however, noise was non-existent. We were able to pick up free wireless, although it wasn't the Hilton's (they charge). Obviously, any time you use any wireless, you shouldn't be putting in credit card numbers and other sensitive information. The rooms were fine - we didn't get a mini-bar (which we appreciated) but there was a refrigerator. The furnishings seemed pretty new - at least, they didn't look old and dreary. The Hilton's shampoo/conditioner/shower gel were very perfumed which wasn't a plus - I was glad I brought my own (why they think most customers would want such perfumed toiletries is beyond me). The sheets were very nice and soft, with a duvet over the comforter (either down or down-alternative). The rooms weren't overly spacious but were fine, unless someone wanted to hold a business meeting or something (iif we had had a king-size bed (we requested 2 doubles), there might have been a bit more space). Housekeeping was helpful. The Hilton was quick to bring up a suitcase (as soon as the airline delivered it) that the airline had failed to get onto our flight. We paid $65 plus about $17 in extra taxes and fees, which was a decent deal, given that the Motel 6's in the area charge close to that per night. We didn't try the restaurant or the coffee cart. One of the coffee cups in the little coffee maker in the room was obviously not clean (a few coffee drips right on the top edge, so the housekeeper had failed to check it!) but that was the only negative for the room. Parking at the Hilton will set you back $18/night (that may not include about $3 in taxes) but we were able to park at the Clarion right next door for about $7.50 plus almost $3 in taxes (they advertise that they allow \"airport\" parking). They do fill up (morning seminars need parking) so get there as early as possible; you do have in-and-out privileges (not sure if you have that at the Hilton) as they give you a card to put on your dashboard; the card is not time stamped so you should have until midnight of the last day you pay for.

Wouldn't stay here at the rack rate but for $55 it was fantastic.", "Date": "May 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, OR", "Title": "\u201cUpcharges everywhere, $$ Parking charge is ridiculous\u201d", "Author": "TravelSchmavel", "ReviewID": "UR7270175", "Content": "We booked Priceline $58/night and it seemed like a great deal. We did not expect all the upcharges being so far away from downtown. $16 parking was extremely excessive especially when this is a location where land is abundent and cheap. I've paid less in downtown Seattle. $9.95 Internet chage is expected at a full-service hotel, but this hotel did not seem to be full-service. Pool and hot tub were out of service. Nothing is convenient, you have to drive far for good restaurants and amenities. Pros: - Near airport (great if you are catching a flight) - Nice business amenities (if you are there for a conference) - Clean rooms Cons: - Very expensive parking - Not convenient location unless you are going to the airport - No pool/hot tub in service, they are being torn up - medicore service", "Date": "April 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "calgary", "Title": "\u201c$$ Parking Surprise\u201d", "Author": "sarakamoli", "ReviewID": "UR7253173", "Content": "We stayed here Feb 2006 for one night. Beware that you have to pay 16 self park or 20 full service.

They directed us to one of the best seafood restaurants in town (Saltys) and even gave us $20 off coupon PLUS two free dessert coupons. I found them very friendly and helpful. We had a wonderful time.

I chose the Hilton for it's location (right across the street) and quality (I could get some work done). I booked through the Hilton website, where I am a silver member. This hotel, while clean and well-appointed, is far below the standards set for the chain for service and amenities. It is a sprawling horizontal building, rambling over a hillside with very poor markings. We drove around it several times trying to find the entrance. The checking was slow: they were understaffed and lingered over the many questions of confused travelers while the lines grew longer. The room that I was given turned out to be literally a quarter mile away: across the lobby, around the restaurants, down one long hall, through the convention area, down another hall (at this point a hotel employee pointed me onward as I studied a map), around the fitness center, up some stairs, an elevator, another long hall...amazing! The room was huge but spartan. Internet access was extra !! well over $10 for the night. There are lots of outside lights from signs and traffic, parking lots and streets. Bathroom was as-expected, good hot water and pressure. The morning was the same in reverse, a long trek to checkout, endless lines that didn't move because of chronic under-staffing, and no breakfast snack or coffee offered. The shuttle bus was confusing: but was on time. I'm sorry, this experience was rough, and well below Hilton standards.", "Date": "December 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "southern california", "Title": "\u201cgreat airport hotel\u201d", "Author": "businesstraveller2", "ReviewID": "UR6178650", "Content": "Prepaid rate on hilton.com $84 a night.

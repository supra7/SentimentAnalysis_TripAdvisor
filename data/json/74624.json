The Hotel Highland has soft beds that are hands-down the best hotel mattresses I've found in a long time. The rooms are a bit small, but are decorated nicely and laid out well, negating the size a bit. The flat-screen TV makes a big difference. There were a few small problems with our stay, though. The cleaning staff needs to learn that bleach will get rid of mildew on shower tile grout. The sink faucet was plumbed backwards - moving the lever to the left should make the water warmer, not the right. There is a cubbyhole for the iron right above the luggage stand; From the look of the bottom corner, I'm not the only person to hit my head on it when getting something from my suitcase. A list of TV channels would be good, as would a list of services. The breakfast food was nice, but the lounge area is not the place to eat it. If you can, take your food to the patio where there are real tables. The lounge/restaurant has a couch-seating type arrangement, so familes need to stay away unless your kids are really good at balancing plates on their knees. It may be trendy, but nobody's buying - the lounge was completely empty at 10 pm on a Saturday night. We stayed on the front-desk floor and although there is an alcove for an ice machine, it was empty. Hotels need ice machines, especially when the fridge in the room doesn't have a freezer section. If you can overlook the smaller problems in favor of mattress comfort, this is THE place in Phoenix.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whidbey Island, Washington", "Title": "\u201cOne of 2 NON-chain hotels in PHX and the hands down winner.\u201d", "Author": "Sb360", "ReviewID": "UR127160747", "Content": "Clean, spacious, touch of luxury, lovely inside and out, and a decent if not good breakfast.

It met our needs well, but didn't excel in much of anything. Except, of course for the FANTASTIC beds. I am very particular about beds, and have traveled pretty regularly. I've tried a few hundred different beds. This one is by far one of the top three. Ever. Including my own at home. The walls were thin and the hallways were loud. You could literally walk down the hallway and hear peoples conversations in their rooms without even trying. The doors were heavy and incredibly loud when they closed. Anytime one of the doors on my floor closed, I woke up. If you are a light sleeper like me, you will need earplugs. The bathroom was small, and the shower was barely warm enough to call hot. Could have used another degree or two. The water tasted terrible, a lot like soap, in fact. It's not their fault, as anyone there is subject to the water supplied by the city. But bring extra drinking water. The nice thing is that the hotel provides strawberry water downstairs that was delicious. But the glasses are small, and it would be awkward to bring your water bottle down to fill up. There was a nice gym with a decent array of equipment. Not world-class, but enough to work out the majors. The breakfast was pretty good, and there was plenty of it. Seating is a little odd, mostly conversational couches, but it worked. There might be a nightly reception in the same area, but we were never around during that time of day. Delightful pool area with a fire pit for nighttime gathering. Though the pool was mighty cold, even for the most young at heart. The hot tub was nice with plenty of room. Don't think I'd stay here again. Even with one of the best beds ever.

The staff was VERY friendly, letting us come a little early and leave 45 minutes after the official check-out without charging extra. They have an airport shuttle that I believe would also take you to some local spots if desired and the driver gave us excellent directions to the airport since we had a rental car. The pool and spa were glass enclosed with plenty of lounges. Outside of the pool area there were tables with umbrellas and chairs. Also a gas fire pit was blazing in the evening. The full breakfast was in the lounge which has couches and coffee tables or tall bar stools at 2 bar areas. The breakfast had almost everything although it was all pre-packaged food, nothing made on the premises. The only negative, other than the pre-prepared food was that the food was not terrifically hot.

I would reccomend it, we got a deal on it so it was worth the $ but I would not pay the 150 regular price per night.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, nice rooms, so-so service, weak internet...\u201d", "Author": "RockiesExpert", "ReviewID": "UR100745385", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Highland last week for four nights while going to spring training baseball games. They had a great promotion going, and it seems that many baseball fans were staying there because of it. This is not the first time we have stayed here, having been guests of this property both when it switched to the Highland ownership a couple years ago and when it was a Phoenix Inn and Suites property. We just love the location, near the Biltmore Fashion Square mall and all the shopping and restaurants you could ask for, all within a 10 minute walk. Freeway access to all parts of the Valley of the Sun is easy, and this is a big advantage if you have many different destinations to go to within the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. The rooms are nicely appointed, with a boutique hotel feel. Flat panel TV is mounted on the wall. The beds are very comfortable, and good sheets and linens are used in the rooms. Beware, though, that some rooms are in a noisier location than others. Our first room assignment was right across from the elevator, and boisterous baseball fans could be heard talking and laughing as they waited for the slow elevator to arrive. This brings me to the main issue we had with the hotel. On our first night, we called to the front desk about the noise, and the clerk told us that they could move us to one of two rooms down the hall, away from the elevator, the next day since people were checking out. She put in our request, and said we would be given one of the rooms after checkout and housekeeping was done. Then, late the next morning, we got another call from the front desk from a different clerk, telling us that unfortunately we could not be moved since the hotel is sold out,.even though these rooms were vacated and we had our request in. It's not like we were asking for an extra room, I told her, since we'd be leaving our current room. Then, the clerk said that would cause extra housekeeping work. Huh? Weren't they going to clean up our room anyway during the day? This was quite frustrating, so we asked to speak to the on-duty manager. She was very nice and understanding, saying the front desk may have some training issues. Both rooms we requested, by the way, had already been cleaned as we saw the housekeepr in them, so they were available for immediate move-in. The manager delayed our move, though, saying that they needed inspection first before we'd be given the key to move down the hall. This took an extra 45 minutes, but we finally moved. All in all, this was a hassle that didn't need to happen, but we were glad with the outcome as our new room was quiet, bigger (a corner room at the end of the hall), and we were fine for the rest of our stay. The wireless internet would be my only other problem. It was either extremely slow or completely unavailable. They told us a new T-1 line was about to be installed in the next week, so this weakness may be solved by the time you want to stay here. The breakfast room was packed every morning with the baseball crowd, and it was hard to find a seat to eat. Food was standard fare for a 3-star type of hotel, with some warm items such as flat sausage and eggs, to go along with a good variety of cereals, breads and bagels. The elevator, as I mentioned earlier, is slow. But we stayed on the top (4th) floor, so we noticed it more. We just used the stairwell near our room to go down every time instead of taking the elevator. It was that slow. In summary, this is a good boutique hotel choice at a reasonable price if done on a promotion, and in a great part of town. Beware of inexperienced or poorly trained front desk staff there, however.", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Luxury at super price\u201d", "Author": "jponsford", "ReviewID": "UR100174952", "Content": "My partner and I stayed at the Hotel Highland while attending the Heard Museum Native Arts show and were very pleased.

So I talked a group of friends, who were all coming into town for an event to also stay at the Hotel Highland. Even before getting to the hotel, my expectations were heading downward. As with traveling in winter, mother nature sometimes does not cooperate. So due to a winter storm, one of my friends was not able to make it to Phoenix and had to call the hotel to cancel his reservation. But Hotel Highland doesn't care what mother nature throws you, instead they changed a full night to my friends credit card for having to cancel his trip. Lets not forget it was me who talked everyone into staying here and we had 3 more rooms booked. After talking with the Manager at check it, it is their policy and they stick to it! If it had not been for one of my friends reserving it thru a 3rd party website, I would of been moving all my friends to another hotel the next day. I might also want to add that when I decided to book at this hotel, I had emailed the email provided on the website to get the special online offer they were advertising. Two weeks went by and I had never received a response. So I called the hotel up and asked to make a reservation. I mentioned I wanted the special rate that was advertised on their website for $89/night. I was informed their was no special and that rate shouldn't be on their webpage, but clearly my internet browser does not lie. So after some discussion over the phone I was finally given the $89/night. Clearly someone needs to be returning emails to their customers and know what they are advertising on their website. To the room I go, which not to my liking I'm put on the first floor. I reserved a one bedroom king and since this hotel seems fairly refreshed, everything was pretty new. As I did like the overall decor of the rooms, I found it very odd having the bathroom sink right in the open of the room. Since it was just me I had no problem, but if guests had more then one person in the room. This would get odd when one is sleeping and others want to get up to use the sink and wake everyone. My friend thou informed me the rooms upstairs have the sinks in the bathrooms, so this may be just a first floor issue. A few small complaints in the room. The TV does not swivel. At the base of the sink post was long human hair, which should of been easily cleaned, and while in the bathroom I noticed very small black bugs crawling around the base tile boards at times. Overall, I suppose if the trip didn't start off on such a bad note, my stay here would of been better. But just take note, this hotel does not care of mother nature throws at you.

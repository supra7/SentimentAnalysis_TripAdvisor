After reading many reviews for South Beach and Miami Beach hotels, I came to the conclusion anything affordable was run down, scary or had no parking. Considering I had a car and was a Marriott rewards member, my search turned to hotels further away. This hotel turned out to be a good choice for me. It is convenient to the Dolphin Expressway which goes directly to South Beach. It took me about 20 minutes to get from the hotel to South Beach. I had no problem parking at South Beach either Saturday evening or Sunday morning. Both days I parked at the end of South Pointe Drive which is steps from the beach. Back at TownePlace, parking wasn't a problem. The best part of my stay was the bed. It was awesome. The mattress was plush and the sheets felt high quality. I didn't spend a lot of time in the room so the kitchenette didn't matter. The bathroom was large and very clean. The television was an old 27 inch tube TV which was adequate while getting ready for bed. The remote was missing a battery but the desk clerk replaced it right away. There's a small-ish rectangular swimming pool which might be good to cool off but I didn't use it. Maybe I was lucky but the room was quiet and there were no cooking smells. Overall the room and property were clean, stylish and didn't seem worn or run down like other reviews state. I can see the hotel is meant for business people on extended stays but it worked for my needs, which was a place to sleep while I went to South Beach.

In fact, this hospital caters to those individuals, not necessarily to travelers. The sofa sleeper was disappointingly small, maybe a double, with a pretty bad mattress.

Close by (driving distance) restaurants are Applebee's, Pollo Tropical, Tony Romas (NW87th Ave) , Red Losbter, Pizza hut ect.. A very small plaza is located next door has limited choices in retail/shopping. Amenities BBQ for guest to use. Ample parking available on site. Also, small pool with limited chairs.

Also, a computer with internet was available to all guest at n/c if you needed to quickly print out your boarding pass, check your e-mail, the weather or touch base with home for a while. This was very valuable and useful to us. Accomodations We had 2 Bedroom unit on the first floor, each BDR with one queen bed and TV.

In room Kitchen/Dining room Small kitchen with basic pots and pans did the trick. Had a dishwasher, large fridge, stove and microwave . Had to ask front desk regularly to provide dishwasher soap to us. They obliged with every request we had. Lobby has continental breakfast n/c every day, fresh fruits (banana/apple), juices, muffins, granola bars ect. The dining table only had 2 chairs-my only pet peeve of this hotel. Also, note that housekeeping was not offered on a daily basis. They had 2 partial cleaning (providing fresh towels) and one full cleaning during our stay. If you are looking for full service cleaning- I suggest staying at the Marriott's Villas at Doral. Overall, this hotel has a very nice outside apperance and landscape and is very is well maintained. Equally comfortable inside, I think this hotel makes it a great value for the Miami Area stay for families.

To be there on vacation would be a bit depressing. The surrounding area is light industrial. My room overlooked a loading dock of a warehouse.

I was and I suffered for it. I stayed here Feb 1-5,2005 and I was very disappointed by this hotel. Based on this experience I would be hesitant to stay at any TownePlace. The list of problems: 1. I called for directions to the hotel from MIA airport (given the location a question they must get all the time). The person I spoke with was not a native english speaker. When I wanted to get more detail, and asked a follow-up question, she just kept repeating the original directions like she was reading from a script (maybe she was?). 2. Wireless Internet Access in the hotel is horrid. It would drop every 5 minutes and then come back on after 1 minute. If you expect to get work done, don't. 3. Paper thin walls. The people in the unit next to me tended to come in at 1a and I was woken up every night. This was not because they were being particullarly loud, their speaking volume was not loud but, I could hear them like they were in my room because the walls are so thin. 4. Room cleaning. Apparently the rooms are not serviced every day. This is not something that you find out until you are there. Maybe that is my fault for not checking ahead. But, when I called to find out what the cleaning schedule would be, no one at the check-in could tell me. 5. On Fri. night at about 7p the fire alarm went off. It continued for about 5 minutes and then stopped. After about 1 minute it went off again. When staff was contacted to find out what was happening the response was 'we have no idea'. For tunately I was on my way out to dinner so, after ascertaining that the hotel was not actually on fire, I left. By the time I got back later that night the problem was apparently solved.

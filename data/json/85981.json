We've stayed right on Disney property in the past so we were a little apprehensive as to the convenience of this hotel. We stayed 9 nights and right from the time we arrived until our departure we can't say enough about this Hotel. All the staff was so pleasant and accommodating but our biggest bouquet MUST go to Manney, Chief Chef and his crew. They were outstanding. Every morning we were greeted with such hospitality that it made the start of each day great. Manney never failed to take a few minutes of his very busy day to come out and chat to find out our plans and wish us well. As an added bonus kids under twelve eat free with their parents. On Saturday night when the Hotel was completely booked the restaurant staff ran their legs off trying to accommodate everyone and did a great job considering they were short staffed. The quality of the food was in no way compromised even under these stressful circumstances. My grandson left his DS case in the restaurant and it was taken to security and locked up until we finally realized it was missing. Everyone at this Hotel was so professional and caring right from Valet to the staff in the Gift Shop. They even sell Disney Theme Park tickets, same price but you can avoid the long lineups at the parks. The Housekeeping Supervisor, Josue and his staff were incredible and we \"THANK YOU Josue\" for going the extra mile on the Saturday night when our adjoining room needed extra attention. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION...just a few blocks from Downtown Disney. There is bus transportation; however it's only a 5-8 minute walk even with kids. The Disney Theme Park buses arrive every half hour at the Hotel and are always on schedule, Our biggest joy was finding the rooms so spacious and CLEAN with a fridge, microwave and safe so you don't have to carry all your valuables with you. One suggestion for the Tower Rooms would be to hang a longer rod in the closet area. We can't wait to return; maybe we can spend more time at the lovely pool.

We were given a free upgrade to a downtown view room. The view was ok (not worth paying extra for if though). The room had a small balcony. The room was clean and comfortable. It is a great alternative to staying at a WDW resort. You get the shuttle to the parks for free. The front desk staff are fantastic. The boys working concierge were great. The cleaning staff were always friendly...in fact, everyone at the hotel was very friendly. The only reason I did not give a rating of 5 was because I found the buffet waitresses to be lacking in service. We ate there every morning so this began to irritate me. Once the hostess seats you, a waitress brings you one beverage then you never see her again. No refills, no plates cleared.So what would I be tipping on? As I said, this occurred every day. Every day I would ask for a refill on orange juice. If they remembered to bring it, it would come 10-15 min later. Perhaps the Holiday Inn could look at a self service juice area to avoid this issue. Otherwise, a fantastic stay. I would highly recommend it. Pros: Service of everyone except wait staff in restaurant was fantastic Friendly, pleasant rooms and hotel are clean, no wait times for elevators pool is just a basic no frills pool but my 7 yr old loved it Cons: limited menu in restaurant--look at eating out Laundry-aweful...try to avoid. $4.50 for wash, $3.00 for dry.

My 14 year old daughter and I spent 3 nights at the hotel and could not have asked for more. Over the past 10 plus years we have stayed at one of the onsite WDW properties. I stayed at this hotel for a business trip in September and given the positive experience I had decided to give it a try for a pleasure trip. I am so glad I did. From the moment I checked in I felt welcomed. The employees were kind, professional and made sure that all of our needs were met. The hotel, including the rooms is clean and modern. The room is well appointed and offers a microwave, fridge, safe and coffee maker. We had a balcony and it was so nice to sit outside and relax. The beds are very comfortable. The hotel has a lovely pool that never seemed too crowded or noisy. You could order drinks or food if you desired to. We did eat breakfast at the restaurant 2 days and got a to-go breakfast at the take and go area. They offered yogurt, cereal etc. It was perfect. My biggest worry prior to staying was the shuttle service to the parks. This turned out to not be a problem at all. The shuttles were reliable and once you knew the times they would come you could plan accordingly (get there about 5 -10 minutes prior to be safe) and it was no problem at all. We always had a seat and while the trip to and from the parks varied timewise it was never extreme or problematic. The walk to Downtown Disney is not very far at all. There is nice path to walk on and it took no more then 10 minutes. I can not say enough good things about this hotel. It is evident the employees (from the valets, to the front desk, to the housekeeping staff, to the restaurant folks) love working at the hotel and their happiness shows by the way they treat their guests.

The breakfast in the Palm Breeze restaurant was buffet style with made-to-order omelets and Mickey Mouse waffles, fresh fruits, pastries, yogurt, toast, bagels, cold/hot cereals, bacon, sausage, potatoes, eggs, pancakes, french toast, and corned beef hash. It was a great deal for us. Our server most days was Edwin and he was great.

We stayed on the 12th floor and never had a problem with noise. We did not have a car so the free shuttle worked very well for us.

Two buses come every 30 minutes beginning 1 hour before park opening and then 1 1/2 hours after parks close. One bus runs to EPCOT and Animal Kingdom and the other runs to Magic Kingdom and Hollywood Studios.

I've stayed in many hotels either in or just outside of Disney, and the room we were in at the Holiday Inn is probably the smallest we've stayed in. In addition, the bathroom offers very limited space. I will say that the beds are comfortable and the overall decor of the room is nice. The hotel offers little visual appeal for Disney enthusiasts.

First of all, before we even arrived, Holiday Inn staff e-mailed me back regarding questions I had and I was a bit indecisive which view I wanted - whether I wanted the tower with DD view with balcony or a pool view was sufficient but also wanted to be nearby my sister who wanted the DD view in the tower - eventually Kelly helped me to book a 7 night breakfast rate for $139-149 rate/night with DD view with balcony during the busy President's week while my sister unfortunately who was not staying for 7 days paid a slightly higher rate per night with her AAA deal for same type of room. We were placed on the 9th floor and we had a view of the pool below us as well as the DD view. What's nice about being in the tower instead of the wing is that when you are on the inside, you can look down to the restaurant below. The staff is very friendly, always saying hello as you pass through, lobby is very bright and smells good. Check in was quick as no one else was there in front of us. Check out was easy too and they were able to make corrections as they accidentally charged us self parking fee when we had no car. I also was able to do late checkout by 2 PM b/c I was a priority club member. Guest services also helped arranged car service pickup to the airport. Cost of car service was $65 plus tip and able to use credit card for such. My sister used taxi that was metered and her trip back to airport cost $48 plus tip. Room/amenities: nice comfortable beds, refrigerator and microwave available, Bath and Body works shampoo/conditioner/body lotion provided, along with citrus mint bar soap and mint mouthwash. Rainforest alliance coffee and coffeemaker (not used). Rooms are clean. Bathroom shelf convenient - would have liked another towel bar besides the one towel bar and the hook provided. Nice flat screen TV. In-room safe a plus. Daily newspaper. Can hardly hear any noise from the other rooms. In room electronic thermostat - not noisy when A/C or heat is on. Used the pool one afternoon - it is moderately sized and heated - would have preferred that the spraying sprinklers were off on that windy day b/c it's cold to have water sprayed in your face - it's zero entry and goes as deep as about 4 feet 5 inches in the center. Also there is hot tub (not used). Towels are provided. It was never crowded. Also has fitness center and gift shop and grab and go food outlet and business center that we did not use. Food: buffet bkft was great - they make omelettes and Mickey mouse shaped pancakes to order, also the usual hot items: pancakes, toast, hash browns, bacon, sausage, corned beef hash, various cereals and pastries - I didn't always sit down for buffet but also can take items to go - they gave us 2 vouchers/day for bkft since I had the 7 day bkft rate and so only paid tip. We've also eaten dinner at the Palms Breeze restaurant for late night at 9 PM and the food was actually very good and reasonably priced, esp since the kids 12 and under eat free. We've also eaten lunch as well but had to sit in the bar b/c at the time we arrived, it was not busy so service in the bar to eat lunch was a bit slower but still reasonable b/c there was not the entire wait staff available. By the time we were done, we noticed that they did eventually open the main restaurant area for other to have lunch. Food choices are pretty good. Great option when we're too lazy to walk to Downtown Disney or when DD is very crowded. Definitely try the T-Rex (make advanced reservations), Earl of Sandwich and Wolfgang Puck Express. Shuttles: shuttles come about every 1/2 hour - supposed to come on the hour and half hour but hard to predict b/c sometimes they arrive 5 minutes after or even later. we are the 2nd stop with Hilton being picked up first and then followed by Royal Plaza and Doubletree suites. we are on Bus A. There is another Bus B that picks up 3 other hotels on the other side of Hotel Plaza Blvd. Most of the times, the shuttle buses does 2 drop offs to the theme parks: usually it's MK then DHS and the other bus goes to Epcot than AK. When dropping off to MK, it's really the TTC (transportation & ticket center) location which then you have to take either Monorail or ferry boat to actually get to MK. Other times, I've seen the buses only go to one park so it does vary. One time, Bus B also picked us up from theme park to go back to the Bus A hotels too. It seems that the buses are most crowded around the 9 and 9:30 AM times that sometimes it has to skip picking up at the other 2 last hotels so I think they have other back up plans for that. Pickup times at the theme parks are announced usually and pretty accurate. At times, I've seen the shuttles come to Epcot and then pick up from DHS before heading back to the hotels and not to AK so it seems which two parks they drop and pick up vary. Downtown Disney - the marketplace is about 8 minute walk with Hilton being the closest hotel to DD. They also have shuttle buses that go to DD starting at 6 PM but we've never taken such. At times, when we are already in Downtown Disney, we take the Disney transport buses to one of the Disney hotels and then take the monorail or buses to one of the theme parks so we don't have to walk back to our hotel to catch the shuttle. Plus the white Disney transport buses come more often at evey 20 minutes. Our buses are blue with a yellow oval that says Downtown Disney Resort Area so they are easy to spot from a distance. Overall, we loved our stay at this hotel and these Tripadvisor reviews did help me pick this hotel and I'm glad I did. I've stayed at Disney resort hotels twice in the past and in comparing cost/convenience - I think staying at the Holiday Inn was a better deal and experience - it's a moderate sized hotel so it has a cozy feel without feeling the crowd.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincoln, Nebraska, United States", "Title": "\u201cHoliday Inn = Excellent Stay\u201d", "Author": "Lucas_2020", "ReviewID": "UR125146080", "Content": "Had a wonderful experience at this Holiday Inn Hotel.

We reserved an ECV from Scoot Orlando for my father and the hotel front desk brought it to us immediately upon check-in which was quick and easy.

We used Disney buses during our stay to go to EPCOT, Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom (dad's a scooter expert, so he could back on the buses with no problem). In the evening we walked (dad scooted) to Downtown Disney for entertainment and dinner. It's only 10 minutes EASY walk to Downtown Disney. FANTASTIC.

Free buses to disney parks and also to downtown disney (downtown disney buses start at 6pm) or you can walk there leisurely in 10 minutes. Buses pickup every 30 minutes and never had a problem going to and returning from the parks. Was able to get on the first bus back to the hotel everytime, unlike disney resort buses which you can wait for up to three buses due to them filling up when you stay until the parks close. Restaurant and Bar had good food and drinks with more food choices a short walk or drive down the road. There is a Disney Store inside the hotel where you can buy Tickets to the parks and souvenirs from. Will definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it over Disney Value resorts and most moderate ones.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Town", "Title": "\u201cI'll be back\u201d", "Author": "catloversCapeTown", "ReviewID": "UR123208178", "Content": "This is a lovely hotel.

Overall, I rate this property 4 out of 5. Included in our room were the standards; mini fridge, coffee maker, microwave, nice flat-screen T.V., mini safe, desk and chair. A hi-speed wireless network was available, however we were unable to connect at any point during our stay. The WIRED hi-speed worked like a champ, however. THE GOOD... Customer Service - OUTSTANDING (5/5) I arrived late (after 10pm) yet front desk staff were pleasant to speak with and worked quickly to get me checked in. I was offered the 'package deal' for Disney/timeshare which I declined and did not feel pressured to accept. There was a mix-up with regards to parking ($10 per night/self and $16 per night/valet) as the Priceline.com website which I booked through listed parking as 'free'. While it raised a few eyebrows when I brought the error to their attention, the hotel honored the mistake and waived the parking fees for not only myself, but my daughter (who joined me 2 days later), saving us a total of $100 +tax in parking fees (Woohoo!) Super Comfy Bed! - 5/5. I love a softer bed, so a soft yet supportive pillow top mattress was a pleasant surprise. The bedding was comfortable and I liked having a choice between firm and soft pillow. The A/C in the room was a bit tricky to master, but very efficient (very cold to very warm in only minutes). Adequate Water Pressure - 4/5. Both my daughter and I have long, thick hair, so this is a big issue for us. Water pressure on the 10th floor was sufficient for washing our hair without too much fuss. Bathroom Storage - 5/5. I'd read reviews stating limited shelf/counter space in the bathroom, however I found the wall shelves behind the door more than adequate for my plethora of haircare items! There is only one hook, so I ended up using clipper-hangars to hang my towels to dry (or leave them on the floor and housekeeping will replace daily). Interior Atrium - 5/5. Very nice! The glass elevators made for a stunning ride up and down from our 10th floor room. We were located quite near the elevators, yet never heard any noise. Exterior Noise - 4/5. While I-4 was just outside our window, the noise was minimal. Both of us are light sleepers and it was not loud enough to prevent us from falling asleep or wake us up. It is noticeable, but not a nuisance. Easy Access - 5/5. There are MANY hotels on Hotel Plaza Blvd and not all of them are easy to access. Holiday Inn is located at a LIGHT, which makes entry/exit a breeze. Fun/Functional clock radio - 5/5. Has a nightlight (which can be turned OFF) and a plug for MP3 devices. Little things, but I thought they were nice touches. THE BAD... Balcony - 3/5. We had a lovely balcony with a table and 2 chairs, perfect for a cup of coffee in the morning or enjoying the night air in the evening...too bad it faced I-4. The road is busy (read NOISY) 24/7, so while the balcony looked inviting, it was never used our entire stay. Access to Hotel Plaza Blvd - 2/5. While not Holiday Inn's fault, access to HPB is a nightmare if going in blind. TIP - If coming from I-4 Westbound (North), use the INSIDE of the two exit lanes to make that right turn. The left turn onto HPB is about 100 yards down. Without exception, each time I traversed this section of road, there were at least 8-10 cars attempting to cross 3 lanes of traffic to get into the left turn lane onto HPB. Shuttle Service to the parks - 3/5. Free is free and while I can't really argue the quality of a free service, I will anyway. Route A picks up Hilton, Holiday Inn, Royal ??? and DoubleTree (in that order). We were always able to get on the bus, however seating was unavailable all but two times (and we are only the 2nd pick-up). Coming home in the evening was even more chaotic with large groups of people jockying for a spot on the bus. They do seem to have additional buses in the evening, to offset the high demand as it was only about a 25 minute time lapse between the first, second and third bus. This is off-season and it was still a headache. I would be wary of depending on shuttle service during peak season (summer months). THE DISAPPOINTING... Holiday Inn is ON Walt Disney World property, however IT IS NOT A WDW RESORT. This may not be a big deal for some, but for us, we were really looking forward to utilizing the Extra Magic Hours (extended park operating hours available only to resort guests). The Magic Kingdom was open an additional 3 hours our first night, however we were unable to take advantage because I didn't know Holiday Inn wasn't included until it was too late. The Hilton (next door) IS a WDW Resort and DOES get passes/access to EMH if that is something you are looking for.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Moody,B.C.", "Title": "\u201cAwesome staff and very clean hotel\u201d", "Author": "Marguerite D", "ReviewID": "UR121871602", "Content": "All the staff are very friendly and Spencer went above and beyond to help us get 3 rooms together on very short notice.

The shuttle can get crowded especially with the strollers, but they were on time and beats paying $14.00 a day to park at the parks. The hotel is very close to Downtown Disney...a 10 minute walk you have many options for dinner, shopping and bars. There is also a pool at the hotel, gym and arcade. We bought our park tickets at the Disney store in the hotel. There is a Holiday Inn Vacation Club desk in the lobby that sells discount park tickets but you have to sit though a timeshare presentation.

We arrived to find our A/C not working properly and within a matter of minutes we were given an upgrade (free of course) to a Downtown Disney view on the 11th floor. That was very nice of them. (I had purchased the pool view on the 6th floor.) The view was nice and watching the fireworks was nice (but every night?)... too me not worth the extra money every night...go with the cheaper room but not the rooms facing I-4! The pool view would have been fine. There is traffic noise from I-4 with the upper floors but not when the door is closed. The room was decent and the beds very comfortable. Fridge was nice to have for leftovers and drinks. Nice too have balconies too to dry off clothes! Purchased package to get breakfast buffet every morning. It was worth it. The buffet had eggs, bacon, french toast, pancakes, home fries, grits, hash, cereal, toast, muffins, oatmeal, and fresh fruit!!! Plus an omelette and waffle station. What else more could you want every morning? The food was good...not great. The dinner food was good...not great. However...the prices were decent and kids eat free was nice. My kids tend to only eat chicken nuggets, hamburgs, grilled cheese and mac/cheese anyways! Do not get me wrong the dinner food was good...I liked the burger, chicken parm, turkey club, and pizza. My steak was very good but it took awhile to get it cooked right. The manager immediately told me that my meal was free because it took so long! My wife wished they would change the menu up because there is only a set list to choose from. The staff are all very nice and are there to help. The bell/valet's set me up with a taxi to get to Universal...expect about $30 one way. The pool was a very nice feature and my kids were in it every night! Very warm and relaxing. You can purchase Disney tickets right there in their store. The give you a paper every moring at your door for free. The buses were very easy to use and were there on time. You just need to make sure it says \"A\" and it has the Holiday Inn sign on it. You do not need the bus to Downtown Disney because it is less than 10 minute walk! Also there is a grocery store about a 20 min walk where we got food for our lunches for Disney. The bar had good drinks and there are two computers to use for checking stuff online or printing out tickets (airlines/parks.)

This hotel is sub-standard at best. They may have spent millions of dollars on renovations, but new paint and fixtures can't hide the age of this property. They should have spent a few million of the dollars on a time machine to bring the property out of the 1980's. This property is made up of two sections--the tower and the wing. The wing is HORRIBLE! The air conditioning is non-existent, but the years old a/c system ROARS all night long producing no cooled air. The hallways are hot, smelly, and stuffy. We called the front desk on the second night of our stay to see if the air conditioning could be fixed. The person at the front desk was rude and no one was sent to see if the problem could be resolved. We found ourselves staying out as late as possible so we did not have to spend one minute more than necessary at this hotel. An additional \"bonus\" for our first night was a planned electrical shut-off at 1:00 AM that lasted several hours and further complicated that fact that there was no air conditioning. Also, if you choose to stay here (I don't know why anyone would with so many other options), be aware that when you reserve a room with two queen-size beds, the beds are in no way \"queen size\". This was one of the reasons we chose this property instead of a Disney value-property which was the same price per night, but only offered double-beds. Hot water is hard to come by as well. If your family is going to shower in the morning, get up and showered early if you want everyone to have a chance for lukewarm water. This is truly the first time that reviews on Trip Advisor has led me astray. I have used the reviews for restaurants, hotels, and sight-seeing reviews all over the world and have always found the reviews to be helpful and honest assessments of a property or tourist site. I seriously question the authenticity of the reviews for this property making it the #10 hotel in Orlando. The staff seems very skilled in telling customers that they are \"sorry\" for any guest issue that arises. They don't have the desire or skills necessary to resolve issues in a positive manner. Their smile and apology seems very disingenuous. The fact that no one even asked how our stay was at check out leads me to believe that they would prefer not to hear about it.

For the latter I would say this was definitely true - you will pay a fraction of the cost of other hotels actually on the resort site. The reason is because you get in effect what you pay for - and you get a 3* facility despite the impression given by several of the over-enthusiastic reviewers. For the former, I am still at a loss as to where the astronomical sums of refurbishment money went. The lobby is functional but uninspiring, rooms are standard fare and not spacious, eg our room was a double queen and could not even accommodate a 2-seater couch, moreover we were forever tripping over our 4 suitcases. There is just one suite on the property. The bathrooms are clean and the granite countertops make them a pleasure to use. However, I have long since come to expect fluffy robes and slippers as a standard offering of the higher class of hotel. Neither was available here. This is disappointing (as robes are far too bulky to carry around with you). Hotel amenities are relatively sparse - however the games room and pool will keep the kids occupied if (heaven forbid) it is raining. No complaints re breakfast. Having said all that though, if the purpose of your hotel stay is solely functional as you will be spending almost all of your waking hours (and $$) at Disney and you are looking for a no-frills but comfortable place to rest your weary head, then this IS good value for money.

If you want to go from any of the parks to Disney Downtown, take the same shuttle bus and get off at Hilton, I think this is faster than what Disney recommends is to take a bus to a nearby Disney resort and then another bus to Disney Downtown, since there are no buses from any of the theme parks to Disney Downtown directly. Back to the hotel, the room is spacious and clean, the free Internet is bonus. We tried the breakfast, although the buffet is more value for money, ala carte is better quality. If you can get a rate under $100, this is a great hotel compared to any of the Disney resorts. Even the budget hotels can not compare with this price. I don't think Magic hours provided by other Disney hotels is very useful for people staying multiple days, because you get enough after 5-7 hours in the parks everyday. I recommend getting a Disney gift card to use in the park, for 4 days, we did not use any cash. We only needed cash to pay for cab rides to Premium Outlet, which the fare is $12 including tips.

The hotel structure itself is old and has been remodeled. The rooms were nice and the elevators efficient. My only gripe was that the bathrooms were so small it was hard to access any of your toiletries. Also there were no hooks to hang anything. Beds were also on the soft side. The Downtown Disney hotel area was a pleasant surprise. I had assumed it would be an urban area, but actually it is a very nice grassy boulevard. The hotels are all in a row on both sides of this road. Our parking lot was back to back with the Hilton, which would have been much more expensive with all the fees. Seeing that we were barely in the hotel and the time we spent was at breakfast and at the pool, I was overall extremely pleased with the pick.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverview, Florida", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!\u201d", "Author": "murmaniac", "ReviewID": "UR117848219", "Content": "What a wonderful hotel.

The hotel also runs free shuttle buses to the disney parks and these are really convenient and much better than the overcrowded disney buses. Universal is a 15 minute ride away in a taxi which only costs about $30 to get there. Secondly the staff in the hotel are fantastic. The man who checked us in was very friendly and when I asked for later check out this was not a problem. The staff in the bar and the restaurant were also extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them. Finally, the hotel itself is also fantastic. The room we had was on the 14th floor and was amazing with extra room and two large king size beds. The view from our room was of the pool (also great and never overly busy) and also Downtown Disney. We also saw the fireworks from Epcot if we were in the room at around 9pm. The restaurant and bar serve really tasty food and there is a small self serve section where you can buy drinks, pastries etc most of the day.

We stayed at the hotel based on the reviews and all walked away feeling underwhelmed. While the hotel was nice and the rooms were clean there were a number of issues I didn't see raised that I wanted to pass along. First, while we had originally planned to take advantage of the shuttles we decided at the last moment to rent a car to make it easier to get four adults and three children back and forth in a timely fashion. The hotel charges $10 a day to park your car - not valet, just the right to park your car in a lot that seemed to have plenty of open spaces. Second, the hotel seems to market itself as a Disney member and while we weren't expecting the levels of amenities one gets from an official Disney hotel, I do think we were disappointed at the level of service. There is a desk in the lobby to provide info on Disney World. Great, right? Except that EVERY question we poised got a curt, confused, or befuddled response. Do you have info on the attractions at Animal Kingdom? Nope (delivered in a bored, please go away manner). Which parking lot would be best for eating at the T-Rex restaurant in Downtown Disney? I don't know, I think I have a map. (seriously confused young woman, who while pleasant seemed as knowledgeable as my 6 year-old). Third, walking distance to Downtown Disney??? Really??? Are all you people writing this coming from Manhattan??? It's summer, it's hot, three tired and whiny kids. No I don't think that's a walk I'd advise every night. Do-able, but I don't think it's a selling point for real. In summary, there's nothing wrong with the hotel but I think that people are better off viewing it as a run-of-the-mill Holiday Inn. We all agreed on our way to the airport this morning that all things being equal we'd have probably got the same service at a hotel in Kissimmee.

While I did miss the novelty of AKL, this hotel was perfectly adequate if you want a clean, safe place to sleep at night that's not too far from attractions. The rooms were nicely updated and clean. We did come back to the room one afternoon to find that all the toilet paper had been taken by housekeeping. Not sure what that was about, but they brought 2 more rolls soon after I placed a call to the front desk. We had a pool view room with balcony which was a nice, large balcony with a small table and chairs. It felt kind of weird looking at the other balconies across the pool with people sitting on them looking right back at you. The buildings were a little too close, IMO to have them facing each other. I wasn't crazy about our room location either because we were in the wing building in the room at the very end. It was quite the trek at the end of the day. Luckily, we had laundry facilities on our floor, although you have to go the 4th floor to get detergent. I think it would be pretty easy to put detergent machines in each laundry room. We ate at the buffet each morning, and I thought it was decent. Would've been better if free, but that ain't gonna happen in the Disney area. I loved that the kids ate free though! That was a big money saver, especially since I have to force mine to eat anything in the morning. The walk to Downtown Disney was easy and convenient. We ate at Fulton's Crab House the first night, which I found to be extremely overpriced with limited selection and bland food. Wish I'd just gone to Capt. Jack's instead. We only used the shuttle buses on one day, since we went to Universal the rest of the time. The ride there was fine, although a bit crowded with standing room only by the time it left our hotel. The bus to go back to the hotel at the end of the day was 20 minutes late with no explanation or apology from the driver. We'd already gotten there 25 minutes before the bus was scheduled to arrive, so we waited 45 minutes for the, once again, standing room only bus to arrive. The only other gripe I have is that we asked valet to call us a cab to take us back to the airport on our last day. He called a shuttle, which I really don't know if there's a difference, but it was $65 one way to the airport. I didn't expect it to be that much, and am not sure if a cab, which I'd requested, would've been cheaper. All in all, the hotel is clean, convenient, and very reasonably priced.

They charge a $10 parking fee for self-parking but then do not provide adequate spaces for paying guests.

We are both mid to late twenties. We stayed on the top floor and in room 1401. I initially looked for us to stay here because I had previously stayed here prior to the building being closed due to hurricane Katrina. The hotel is based on Hotel Plaza Boulevard; it is a 10 minute walk (maximum) to Downtown Disney and in the opposite direct 15 minutes to the Crossroads complex. DTD has lots of restaurants and Disney themed stores. DTD can get pretty busy for eating, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably best to go relatively early or then wait for the rush to decline to minimise wait times. The crossroads has a 24 hour supermarket, crazy golf (great fun) and many very reasonable restaurants. We booked to stay here via Florida4less and felt we got a good deal. On arrival we were impressed with the reception areas modern decor and the friendliness of the front desk staff. Check in was quick and hassle free. Our room was very spacious. We were facing the I4 and initially concerned the road noise would keep us awake. Fortunately it did not however, a lighter sleeper may struggle. The road noise was prominent in the background but did not cause us any problems. The room had 2 queen beds, HD TV, mini fridge, desk and an armchair. We felt the storage for clothes could have been a fraction bigger. The bathroom was spacious and had a very convenient cubby hole behind the door to store wash bags etc. The hair dryer was excellent and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend you leave yours at home to save the luggage weight. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use mine once! The only very minor point worth making is that we felt the cleaning standard / regime seemed questionable at times. There was some dust and marks on surfaces etc and upon our final room check before leaving we found a receipt under the bed from 3 May (5 days before we arrived!!). The beds were made / changed and clean towels so we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overly fussed and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it as a huge problem but think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth mentioning. The pool is very nice and large. There are plenty of loungers and towels available but limited parasols for people who like shade. A plus is the pool fountain to drain out any road noise. The pool is open late too. The front desk staff are excellent and very helpful. The day before our departure we planned to check in our flight on line but the business centre was down. They allowed me to use their front desk computers free of charge to check in without a hint of inconvenience. There is a complimentary bus to all Disney parks that runs every 30 minutes. Getting to the park it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great but can seem to take a longer period of time to get home. Tip - the water park bus only collects you at 4 and 5 so if you want to leave earlier you can catch the Disney transportation to Saratoga Springs. If you get off the stop titled Congress park it is a short walk to DTD and the hotel. Quite frequently the Saratoga Springs bus does also stop off a DTD so always worth checking with the driver. There is a bus stop 5 minutes away from the hotel where you can catch the 55 to Seaworld (20 minutes) or 111 to the airport (50 minutes) for $2 pp. The hotel is a 20 minute cab ride to Universal (about $25 each way) - tip order a Mears cab and do not use Star that have slots outside the hotel. Our single journey with Star was not enjoyable (poor control of bodily functions and appalling driving!). Overall we had an amazing holiday in Orlando and great stay in the Holiday Inn.

The view of the pool was beautiful, the room was quiet to extraneous noises, the bed was extremely comfortable and the in-room coffee and coffee maker were among the best I've ever had period. Oh, and let me not forget the wide-screen HDTV - a real treat for those of us still tied to the tube. Our one visit to the dining room was fabulous, although pricey at $40 for breakfast buffet for two, juice and coffee. The waiter was politely pleasant, and the omelette, prepared on the spot for you by a world-class omelette-maker made it quite worth the price. The bartender, with a quite empty bar, was attentive and quick to recommend an alternative wine when the ordered wine was not in stock. Where the hotel fell short was in the housekeeping department -- and it's those little things in that department that can make or break a guest's perception of a hotel. First night - no extra roll of toilet paper or extra box of tissues. A gasping moment for a person suffering from intense allergies. The toilet seat was unfastened on one side, making utilization of the throne not only an endeavour in paper conservation, but a physical balancing act as well. Chalked it up to, \"oh well, maybe they're running low, and will discover the missing seat fastener when they clean tomorrow and will promptly fix it.\" Yeah. No such luck. The seat never was fixed during our stay. No, I didn't call to complain about it because I believe things like this should be taken care of without guest intervention. Housekeeping should have alerted necessary staff to the problem and it should have been fixed without us having to call about it. Not that calling would have gotten us anywhere -- as eveidenced by the call we DID make to the desk about the toilet paper situation. \"We'll be right there,\" said the voice on the other end of the phone. No toilet paper ever came, necessitationg a trip to the public restroom -- outside -- on the other side of the pool deck -- where we swiped a roll of toilet paper to replace the empty roll in our room. You know what? A call about a lack of toilet paper would be considered an emergency if hotel staff suffered from a bladder infection. Third night -- the extra roll of toilet paper and extra box of tisses (over which we celebrated jubilantly) was quickly tempered by the lint explosion left behind on our bodies, clothes, hair and eveything else in the room after using the towels after a shower. Seriously. Like sand. Everywhere. Again, I wish to chalk up these little disappointments to an overwhemled staff or a fully packed house or a very busy week or whatever.

I find after staying there that there were several things that are positives which haven't been mentioned yet: - Hotel is short walk from Downtown Disney, but also a 12-15 minute walk from the Crossroads restaurants and stores with numerous restaurants as alternatives to the macro downtown disney (Chevy's, BUff wild wings, fuddruckers, McD's and many more plus a grocery store) - there are also nice restaurants at the Hilton property close nearby (and a disney gift store there) - Hotel restaurant was good...at times slow but food good. very convenient alternative at the end of a long day at the parks. - Elevators work fast - Hotel's official online photos seem to be drab and uninspired, but the pool is nice, there is a small bar and grill (indoors) next to the pool, a nice casual sitting/dining area next to the pool where one can have a bite from the grill or a drink. - Clientele is mix of business and some family -- not teeming with kids but many seen with families. - Don't forget kids eat free and free wireless. - Disney buses every 30 minutes to the big four parks -- we didn't need a car. There is a decision to be made on whether a disney property is what you want (extra park hrs, theme, etc)... but we found this to be a very comfortable, convenient alternative that allowed us to get a lot of park time in yet come home to a very civilized hotel.

Transportation to the 4 Disney parks was effortlessly easy being that the shuttles stopped right outside the hotel front door every 30 minutes. We rented a car to eat and shop outside Disney but really wasn't necessary with so many stores and restaurants so close.

Nice big rooms (recommend Disney Downtown views - worth the extra mullah) and toiletries (barring the rather odd smelling bars of soap - gel is much nicer I think).

Takes a somewhat roundabout route to get to and from the parks, which makes coming back all that more tiring - but hey it IS free.

Had the room service breakfast been a bit more imaginative and permitting selection (bagels??) we would have eaten from that. Just used the GardenGrocer food and the coffee machine (lovely filter coffee provided) and we had breakfast done and dusted. We ate once in the restaurant and thought it excellent value but clearly needing a bit more publicity to get the punters in. Special mention to the lovely Chrystel who managed to get us back to the hotel after Gatwick's inability to clear snow in two days meant that on our first attempt in early December BA pocketed all our fares money (and the equally deplorable Gatwick Sofitel the overnight room money) as we were unable to get to GWK for the outward flight.

We spent the first week of January 2011, 6 nights total at this hotel. I'll just go ahead and enumerate the pros and cons; Pros: The pool, it's big and very warm. We spent a few hours each day in the pool and really enjoyed it. The hotel has been completely renovated and it looks great inside and out, very contemporary in style. The rooms are very nice. The beds are comfortable, our room had an lcd tv with good quality tv (no picture noise). There's a safe which I used to fit a laptop, ipad, and the usual passports etc while we were away. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I forgot my toothbrush and they got me one right away, with complementary toothpaste. Daily housekeeping was very good too, the room was always kept clean. I also had a billing issue related to the parking pass (see further below) and the front desk resolved it at my satisfaction which I think is exceptional. The location is very convenient. It's a 10 minute walk to Downtown Disney. There are also free shuttles from the hotel to each Disney park running every 30 minutes all day long. The service is reliable, and did I say FREE. The shuttles are also a direct connection to any Disney Park so no need to transfer buses on the way there which is nice and better than some of the other Disney resorts. There are two shuttle buses and each bus covers two parks. Buses are operated by Mears. It takes the shuttle between 30 and 45 minutes to get to the park. The buses were not very crowded either when we were there so it's a comfortable ride. The on-site restaurant serves very good burgers and food was very good overall, as was the service. The bar service is also top notch. We got to enjoy a glass of red wine every night and the selection was good. Kids eat free at all times at the restaurant which is a nice touch too. Wifi internet was free and very fast too which was a nice touch. Cons: Well there's nothing really that would prevent me from recommending this hotel. We did find the bed pillows a bit on the thick side so we'll bring ours next time around. We were there on December 31st so of course people were partying out later than usual and on that night we found the room walls' noise insulation insufficient as we could hear our neighbors shouting and having fun. But the remaining 5 nights were perfectly quiet so no big deal. When checking in I was presented with some papers to sign and I mistakenly signed the parking pass form. This resulted in a 10$ per day fee being added to my bill even though I didn't have a car all week (we flew to FL and took a limo to the hotel). I had to dispute the charge at the end of my stay and the front desk resolved the situation to my satisfaction. I guess the con here would be that they should present the parking pass as being an extra and not an item included in the price of the room - which I thought was the case and is why I just signed it and whatnot. So just be aware that you'll need to specifically opt out of the parking if you don't want to incur these charges. The breakfast buffet is only on weekends, and is never free unlike some other Holiday Inn Express hotels. But kids always eat free and the food is very good.

I requested a second room and since none was available, I slept on the floor (I was brought additional bedding). The next day I called Priority Club and was told to speak to the hotel manager. I was told that he would deal with the problem or I could transfer to another Holiday Inn property nearby that could provide a cot. I went to the front desk and asked for the manager and was told that he was busy and not available. I wrote my name, room number, and cell number and asked that he call me when available. I never received a call. When I returned that night I had to pay for a second room to avoid another night on the floor. I have never been contacted by the manager.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Experience\u201d", "Author": "angelgarciabroker", "ReviewID": "UR91467968", "Content": "Holiday Inn exceeded all of our expectations.

Remodeled to Perfection.\u201d", "Author": "Linda Margaret", "ReviewID": "UR91232262", "Content": "First, let me say that this hotel has been remodeled to perfection!!! Everything is NEW on the inside and beautifully & tastefully done. Lobby is smallish, but in marble with several areas to sit/wait for your car, etc. Parking costs per night, valet service extra. Once your car is parked, you never have to move it again. Front desk was VERY accommodating and curteous. Hotel has a bar and menu selections into the wee hours. A lovely restaurant fills an inner area with a ceiling that soars upward to the 13th floor area. Staff is very pleasant and the menu sports just about anything you might want. We opted for the \"breakfast package\" and could order ANYTHING from the menu, including the $12.95 steak and eggs. Saturday and Sunday morning was a buffet with made-to-order waffles and omlets. You are responsible for the breakfast vouchers presented upon arrival and must give these to your waitress. Three elevators available to take you to your floor. All new carpeting in the halls/paper and paint fresh. Rooms were beautiful with big bathrooms, marble floors & sink tops, fluffy towels, minty soaps, etc. Water HOT and plentiful. We had a balcony on the ninth floor (well worth the small extra cost) which overlooked Disney Village. At 9:30 pm we could watch the fireworks in Epcot. Balcony has two chairs and table. Ask for one with the open iron grill-work so you can watch the sunset, etc. and still sit in a chair. New bedding with soft mattresses, four pillows, feather comforters, CLEAN-new carpeting, thermostat heating/cooling, well lit, computer locking safe, refrigerator. (no microwave). Staff wonderful! Heated swimming pool open late and shaped like an hour-glass. Hot-tub offered outside. Water sprays add soothing sound. Shuttle service every 30 minutes takes you from the hotel to any Disney site you want to go. One con here, though, and that is the Hilton Hotel which is the first pick-up stop on the route. At 8:00 AM, seating on the bus is no problem, but at 8:30 or 9:00 Hilton people fill every seat and then some. Usually, standing room only when it gets to the Holiday Inn! But, on the flip side, the shuttles run like clock-work with destination schedules clearly marked on the outside of the A & B bus. Loading and unloading docks everywhere were marked on the pavement & included attendants to guide you. Bus drivers know everything...ask them when in doubt. One day we took a shuttle to Animal Kingdom, from there a shuttle to the Boardwalk, then a boat to Epcot, then a boat back to the Boardwalk, then a shuttle to Disney Village and from there the \"A\" bus back to the Holiday Inn. Scheduled every 5 and 35 minutes, we never waited any longer than 10 minutes for any one conveyance. I only mention this because you should not let the thought of traveling by shuttle in anyway influence your decision to stay at the hotel. We are country-folk and were rarely at a loss to get to and from the Holiday Inn during our five day stay. The cost of $179.00 per night (which included the breakfast package for four adults) and the brand-new-ness of the place was short of miraculous.

You can use it free in your room, if you bring a nettbook with you because the room only have a RJ45 connect. There's no wi-fi. I had to use the internet near the lobbly. It's a safe and closed room that you can open with your room card. If I remember, its 1 dollar for each 4 minutes, but the system doesnt work correct. When you remove and insert your card or log in or out you loose 0,25 cents. The real thing is you'll spend about 1 dollar for 2 minutes.

As with any Holiday Inn, it is not some type of luxurious hotel but the rooms are incredibly comfortable and SPOTLESS. As mentioned by previous reviewers, the hotel has recently gone through a major renovation and it really shows (the elevators seem like they were not updated for some reason though). The bath products were nice. The bed was comfortable. Our room, 301 (and it looked like all of them), had a balcony. Unfortunately the balcony face a parking lot and highway (which could be a bit noisy when standing outside). But as soon as you closed the door to the balcony the sound was completely gone. The sound-proofing on those doors/windows was great. Frankly, I would have loved a room on the other side with a view of downtown Disney, but I'm a realist. . .I paid about $90 a night for the room. . I can't have it all. The pool area is very nice. Also, clean and modern. I was determined to get some time in the pool but started becoming reluctant when it seemed a bit chilly outside. However, the pool was heated to a perfect temperature and the hot tub was a great touch for spending some time in the later afternoon breeze. The bartender in the lounge area (Jon I believe. . ??) was very friendly, talkative, asked about our stay, etc. Plus he made good drinks that were perfect to relax with for a bit after a long day at the parks. Little things like that make the stay much more enjoyable. The breakfast buffet was a bit over-priced, but no more so than any other dining option in the disney area. The only thing I was not too fond about was after leaving the room one morning (9:00 AM) to go to the Animal Kingdom and returning at 5:00 PM for what was supposed to be a rest, I was surprised to find that the room had not been serviced. After we walked in, someone knocked on the door to take care of it. So we had to go sit in the lobby for a bit. However, I just considered this an isolated insident (maybe a lack of staff that day or something). This didn't happen any other day. The shuttle buses to the parks were very efficient and the walk to downtown disney is less than 10 minutes. There really is no need to rent a car whiel staying here if you intend to spend all of your time in Disney World. (Helpful tip: a taxi from the airport will cost about $60. There is a public bus (lynx 111) with an stop directly across from downtown disney that will get you to the airport in less than an hour for $2.00. It certainly is not as efficient but it does spent several parts of the journey on the highway and only makes a few stops along the way). You are going to be spending a LOT of money while in Disney. So why not save where you can.) Overall, this has to be the best hotel value in downtown disney.

Due to the age of our children, 9 and 10, we would catch the 9.00am bus to the theme parks and return anywhere between 5.00pm and 8.00pm in the evening. The hotel rooms were well appointed (they even had a bar fridge) and were extremely clean. The housekeeping was done daily and to a very high standard. There was a soda vending machine and ice machine in the hallway to our hotel room which was very convenient. Our children loved the pool area (and so did we). What also really impressed us about the hotel was that children who are 12 and younger are able to eat at the hotel for free. This made a huge difference to our holiday budget. Breakfast was always well catered for and very fresh. Every morning we started our day with the buffet breakfast which was just lovely (the omelettes were delicious). We also chose to dine in the restaurant each evening rather than queuing at the various Downtown Disney restaurants and paying the high prices there. Although the choice of meals in the evening were slightly limited the food was cooked to a very high standard. The restaurant staff were always extremely friendly and accommodating and nothing was ever too much trouble. We regularly asked if a fresh salad or a bowl of fruit could be prepared to go with our children's meals and this was always made possible. Our children were always made to feel very welcome at the restaurant. During our stay at the hotel we also spent a day at Universal's Island of Adventure and this was about a 20 minute taxi ride, from the hotel, which the hotel staff organized for us. The taxi driver charged us a round trip fare of $50 for this and we arranged a time and place to meet him after our day at Universal and this worked out very well (The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is a must see for any fans of the movies). Also for those of who are interested when we arrived at Orlando International Airport we went to the taxi area where a fee of $52 was confirmed for the drive to the hotel from the person organizing cabs. At the end of our stay we needed a hire car and very conveniently across the road and a 4 minute walk from the Holiday Inn, there was a hire car counter for Dollar Rent a Car at the Regal Sun Resort Hotel so we were able to conveniently collect a hire car for our drive out to NASA. We would definitely consider staying at Holiday Inn when visiting Disney World at a future date due to the value, cleanliness, location and welcoming staff.", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Disney Location\u201d", "Author": "mbmb81", "ReviewID": "UR84158707", "Content": "Got a great discounted rate on this hotel.

The bed was great & had the choice of firm or soft pillows on the bed. There was a small refrigerator and safe in the room. What I noticed most about the hotel is that in the halls & my room at night --- it was so quiet --- no noise to keep me awake. I never had to wait long for an elevator. The only problem I had dealt with their breakfast buffet. They have a lot of new people and not all of them knew what the buffet included. First day, I didn't get charged for tea with the buffet, 2nd day I got charged which I thought was unusual (even asked the waiter about it), saw the manager that night and he gave me credit on my bill for the tea, and the 3rd day I was charged again - spoke with a different manager & it was taken off. Everyone seems to blame it on the new help so hopefully the servers will get trained on what is included. I've never had an all you can get buffet breakfast where tea was charged extra & coffee wasn't - normally the waiters are always asking if you want more. Plus, for the price there should be no question that it should be included. So they need to be consistent in what they do. If you eat breakfast there --- make sure you ask for waitress \"Que\" --- she is a wonderful server. Everyone I spoke with wanted to correct the situation --- they are trying hard. The Disney Store inside the hotel was not open yet - Disney is responsible for it so seems to be dragging their feet. The pool looked nice but I don't swim so didn't check that out.

I read other reviews on Trip Advisor prior to staying so I was expecting good things. The hotel and its staff did not let us down. We had an excellent experience. Check in was a breeze. The room was immaculate and comfortable. It had a nice size fridge which is not mentioned on their website, but was a nice amenity. The hotel has only been open for 6 months and everything is brand new. The beds were very comfortable. The room was very quiet, as we could hear no other hotel guests when in the room. Granted, the hotel was relatively empty because of the time of year, but it still seems as if it would be quiet during more crowded times. Being a Holiday Inn, children eat free with a paying adult. This meant for all meals - breakfast, lunch and dinner. I actually felt bad sitting down to a meal and not having to pay for anything but my meal. The service in the restaurant was great. The food was also excellent. My children loved all of the menu selections. There were nice options of substituting veggies or fruit salad as a side instead of always having fries. The adult fare was just as good. It was nice to be in a place like Orlando, where you expect to be eating a lot of burgers and greasy park food, to sit down and have healthy and delicious food. The restaurant is in the main lobby which is open to the interior of the hotel. You look up 14 floors to the glass pyramid at the top. You can also see the two glass enclosed elevators making their way up and down. The hotel has great facilities. There was a grab-n-go snack area which had basic quick selections like yogurt, muffins and pre-made sandwiches, in addition to a coffee station and other drinks. There was what looked like a very nice bar that was open any time we passed by it, but I didn't get to utilize it being with three children. There was also a Disney gift shop. However, it was undergoing renovations while we were there and was closed the entire time. I would have liked to see its contents, but then felt like it was a blessing in disguise because I didn't have my children walking by it each day asking to look around. The pool facility was excellent and very relaxing. I saw another post saying it was too small. I cannot see anyone calling this pool too small. It is a great size. Landscaping is beautiful and there is ample seating around the pool. Music was playing at all times which I enjoyed. It was never too loud and I loved whatever selections were played. There is also a hot tub next to the pool - very relaxing. The one negative thing I have to comment on is the mandatory $10 per day parking fee. I knew about the fee prior to checking in, but it still seemed like a rip off. The parking lot was empty, but they had the bulk of the spots near the main entrance coned off for valet parking which comes at a $16 per day price tag. I just factored the daily parking fee into the price of the room for the night, and I felt the hotel was still a very good value for the price I paid. All in all, we all loved this hotel. My children said it was the best hotel they have stayed at. I have already told several people about our stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good value in Orlando. I know it doesn't come with the perk of Extra Magic Hours, but it did have free shuttles to all Disney parks. We did not use them as we tried out Universal Studios on this trip. Even though the rides at Universal are excellent, we definitely missed the \"Disney magic\".

This actually stuck with us because we would have been perfectly content if she pointed us to the elevator and walked her merry way. A very nice way to start our weekend. The location is great, but we were only in town for a few nights so couldn't take advantage of the nightlife in Downtown. We used the hotel just to sleep for the nights we were there.

The only *minor* negative was that the place itself was really bland, especially for a hotel located in the center of the \"magic\" of Disney and other theme parks. I realize that they have to cater to both leisure and business travellers, but the overall feel was too business-like for me as a leisure traveller. The walls are all beige and cream...very boring.

The hotel is definitely a good value and probably, in my opinion, the best place to stay in the Downtown Disney area of seven hotels. I've had some trouble (particularly with mold) with the other hotels. Because this hotel was gutted to its core and rebuilt (can't really say the hotel was renovated as that would not do the hotel justice), it is clean, comfortable, and a good value. I attached a picture from the panel on the back of the door to show the room layouts. Note this is for the tower (the wing is a bit different). Basically, rooms 01-04 are at the back of the hotel and have balconies and face I-4. Rooms 05-09 have balconies and face the Downtown Disney area and the Hilton next door. Rooms 10-13 also have balconies and face Hotel Plaza Blvd and the Epcot area (can probably see Disney fireworks from these rooms). Rooms 14-18 do NOT have balconies (except on the 14th floor) and face the Royal Plaza next door and I-4. As you can see, it looks like room 18 has a smaller living area as the service elevator is in that area also. The windows and sliding glass doors are of a strong glass so you don't hear the traffic from the road. The common areas of the hotel are well-maintained, modern, and clean. The restaurant is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Lunch and dinner feature an asian-inspired menu. The bar serves the restaurant menu as well as its own small bar menu with bar-type foods. The bar also has a small outside area beside the pool that is good for eating, drinking, or hanging out. The food is very good, and a decent value compared to what one would pay at the parks. The Disney gift shop remains under construction. The Grab 'N Go selection is limited, and better options can be found at the neighboring hotels. The Royal Plaza next door has a better Grab 'N Go area with fruit, sandwiches, salads, etc., and the Hilton next door also has a decent selection of prepared sandwiches for quick meals. Also, the Doubletree hotel two hotels down offers a limited Pizza Hut menu. The Holiday Inn also offers a small fitness room and business center on-site. As for the rooms, they are roomy and the housekeepers do a good job keeping them clean. The LCD TV offers a generous selection of channels (35 or so), although I don't think they were in HD. There is no LodgeNet-esque service so there is no pay-per-view or video game option. The rooms offer free wired high-speed Internet, a nice work desk, plenty of lighting, an in-room safe, and an in-room refrigerator. Some rooms have a stand-up shower stall whereas others offer a traditional tub/shower combination. The beds are comfortable and the triple-sheeting is a nice touch. The maintenance staff members were extremely outgoing and friendly. The housekeeping staff was a little too persistent about getting into the room to clean. The front desk staff were generally helpful and friendly. Overall, since this hotel was rebuilt it is going to offer the best rooms and amenities. You can most likely find cheaper options at some of the other hotels in the area on the popular hotel price finding web sites, but it's worth paying a couple more dollars to stay here for the quality and service. My only suggestion for improvement would be to enhance the Grab 'N Go area to be comparable to what other hotels in the area offer -- you don't want your guests to have to go next door to get a snack.", "Date": "August 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, VA", "Title": "\u201cCan't beat this place for the price\u201d", "Author": "Andrew B", "ReviewID": "UR74063973", "Content": "I was a little upset when I first checked in, since my room wasn't ready until exactly 4.

They have an omlet/waffle bar or a cold cereal, yogurt and pastry bar for $9.95 which includes the coffee (omlets and waffles were great but pastries were dry). I found this to be a great value and time saver. BUT we found each morning that the waitress tried to give us the $14.95 breakfast which was both sides with juice. REALLY - who could eat all that! So when they ask if you want juice when you sit down say no until they explain the buffett prices to you. The last morning my daughter noticed that the waitress charge my husband for the $14.95 buffett and she did change it to the $9.95. You can also order off the menu which some did and the food looked great. Downtown Disney is only about two blocks from the hotel. Very convenient to walk to at night. The bus to Magic Kingdom, Epcot, etc. is right outside the front door and runs every half hour. It was great not to have to drive and pay for the parking (of course we paid parking at the hotel). FYI......My daughter has Celiac Disease and we had our lunches and one dinner inside Disney (Magic Kingdom and Epcot). They could not have been nicer and to our surprise both resturants had GF Buns for sandwiches/burgers. Also, fries are made it separate fryers.

Folks may not know that this is probably the largest attended group event in Orlando every year. This Holiday Inn was full with mostly gay men, who can be the most discerning (fussiest?) travelers on the planet. Well, we only heard very good things all around. The pool area is nice, the food in the restaurant was good, and the staff very nice. The new renovation is very good. Rooms are more basic and big than posh, but who hangs in their rooms with the theme parks outside anyway? The only hitch may have been slow elevators, but remember the hotel was packed and the pool was busy with parties from morning til late night - boys were traveling the elevators constantly. So there was a lot of activity that the new staff handled very well. We paid $8 a day for parking, no big deal, but that may have only been for our event - check with the hotel ahead. It's only a few minutes walk to Lake Buena Vista so location is perfect for Disney. Highly recommended and we hope the Holiday Inn is a host location for this event next year. Progress has come a long way with most major hotel chains now fighting for this business.

We walked in to the hotel to check the rates and found it a little expensive, however as we are Platinum members we were given a discounted rate and upgraded to a fantastic room on the top (14th) floor - everyone wanted a room on the 14th floor ! Great view of the pool and Downtown Disney and not much noise from the nearby road. Staff were all friendly and efficient and this hotel really felt like a home from home for us. ALL staff were always friendly and courteous and made us feel very welcome. Lovely pool with great restaurant and bar - Matt is the best bar tender an Orlando ! Easy walk to Downtown Disney and also Crossroads in the other direction - didnt really need the car at all. We had a problem with noise one night from the next door room which kept us awake but when we cpmplained to the manager he was very apologetic and gave us $60 vouchers for the restaurant and credit our Priority Club with 25,000 points - how good is that ? Thank you Edward Lopez !! Overall this was a fantastic stay - do not mistake this hotel for any of the other Holiday Inns in this area as this one is by far the best.

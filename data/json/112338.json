{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great boutique hotel We spent three nights at Hotel Boheme in November at the start of our honeymoon. I travel a lot with work and so we wanted something different. The four poster bed was great and although the room was small (even by UK standards), it was clean and full of character. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There were lots of local restaurants, cafes and attractions, including City Lights book store which is a couple of blocks away.

A lady called kate checked us in and gave all the information we needed, she even one night phoned through a takeaway pizza order for us as our mobile didnt work! Our room was very comfortable with two double beds, tv and shower room. Only little thing it would have been nice to have coffee making facilities in the room. We were located in italian quarter so lots of great italian restaurants. Not far from china town either which is worth a wonder. We found a fantastic cafe for breakfast called pats cafe it has a bright yellow front. and is located in taylor street. Found it on our first morning we were jet lagged and starving, food and service were excellent and the coffee kept comming! Kept us going till the evening! Not far to pier 39 but we recommend going in the morning its quiet but a little tacky and go and see Alcatraz its brilliant book tickets before you go we went 9am boat and its quieter.

We didn't think the room was too small at all, especially compared to hotels in the Centre of London. We had plenty of natural light on the back and it was quiet.

The tv is small but we didn't go there to watch tv shows.Our room faced the street on the second floor. The neighborhood is great! My favorite in SF. I had a good time just sitting at the window and people watching. The one negative thing is that we slept with the windows open and it was a bit loud.I thought that the negative reviews were a bit unfair. I don't think anyone should expect this place to have all the amenities of a modern 5 star hotel. If you do, check into a Hilton. This is a hotel of older elegance and it does feel special in many ways. It is also very reasonably priced (considering location).

I looked over the hotel's website before booking, and nowhere was it mentioned that there is no air conditioning and there are no elevators.

There is also no parking or valet, not even temporary parking while you run in to get directions to the nearest parking garage. My husband had to circle the block repeatedly while I got the garage directions, not an easy feat in this neighborhood.After lugging our suitcases up two long flights of stairs, we were hot and sweaty and had only our creaky open window and a small fan for relief. We marveled at the tiny TV, in a size we didn't even think was still manufactured. Then we flushed the toilet, and the flush handle fell off. Yes, fell off. In a $200/night room with no AC. Fortunately the lady at the desk was able to fix it, but I told her I expected a discount, as the hotel was full and we could not be given a different room.The free sherry in the reception area was no longer a perk after this, but a necessity.Unless you're the kind of person who enjoys backpacking through Europe, avoid this hotel.", "Date": "Aug 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR623213340", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "LexiSterling"}, {"Content": "Great Location We just spent 3 nights at the Boheme - the staff are really friendly and helpful the rooms although on the small side are clean the bathroom was excellent. i would definItely stay here again.

Within walking distance to most tourist attractions in the city and there are bus stops located very close to the hotel as well. The restaurant located to the left of the hotel when exiting was terrible. I think it was called Calzones. The following night we had dinner at The House which was only 1 block from the hotel.

It is original and distinctive, which in this age of tedious standardization is a real plus.For our group, there were 2 disadvantages:First, the large room we stayed in is located at the back of the hotel, and there was very little natural light. I would have traded the quiet of our rear room for some light in one of the front rooms, and if I ever have the pleasure of staying at the Boheme again, I will definitely request a room at the front of the hotel.Second, the Boheme lacks any sort of public spaces except for a small landing near the reception desk.

I paid for a comfortable (vs. cozy) room, so hopefully this is what I got... but it was certainly very small! The decor was okay, although my husband wondered aloud if we should be expecting a swarm of mosquitos.... (romantic mosquito netting around the bed). The bedding was pretty shabby  the pillows were flat, and at the same time, lumpy. I got the impression that everything was very very nice, maybe about 5 (more?) years ago. Definitely needs an update. I wasn't there to watch TV, but in case you are, it is a small (15 inches?) set. We also had an interior room - no view.

We arrived around 10:00pm Friday night and actually missed the entrance and had to have our cab driver go around the block. Upon our arrival and greeting, we knew we selected a great place. Stan, who was working that weekend, gave us the lowdown on the best restaurants and neighborhoods, and the best time to get in line at Mama's for breakfast (before 8am). He really made our stay memorable. We asked for an interior room because we read previous reviews saying the noise from Columbus Street below could be bothersome. We never heard a thing. Our room was comfortable and clean, with a beautiful bed and decent size bathroom. The room, and entire hotel for that matter, really reminded us of the pensiones we stayed in when we visited Italy last year. Hotel Boheme is small, intimate, romantic, and worth the stay. Another plus is the hotel location. Columbus Street is the heart of Washington Square and Little Italy, and is only a few blocks from Chinatown and a short walk to Fisherman's Wharf. Lots of great bars, restaurants, and a fantastic gelateria nearby - closest thing to real Italian gelato we've found. We would definitely stay at Hotel Boheme again.", "Date": "Aug 21, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR694703350", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kkic04"}, {"Content": "This is where the action is! My fiancee and I LOVED this hotel. Check-in was a bit worrisome, due to the fact that we are not used to driving in a big city and we had to stop in the middle of the street to unload luggage. There is complimentary sherry in the evenings and the neighberhood is very good for the middle of a major city. The rooms are too, too charming (in a good way!) and you can't ask for a better location. There are six very tasty eateries within 50 yards of the front entrance. Fabulous pastries, Italian food, and Chinese food as well. Chinatown is within walking distance (next door in fact).

It's located in North Beach and a lot of the regular tourist sites are within walking distance. Have a cup of coffee at Cafe Trieste around the corner, grab a morning snack at the Stella's Pastry, take in the great show of Beach Blanket Babylon at the Fugazi, hang out in Washington Square park. There are also a ton of great restaurants to choose from. Downtown is probably about 6-7 blocks away, or you can walk over to Fisherman's Wharf. The hotel rooms are small, but they feel very home-y. The decor is kind of artsy. Bathrooms are a little small too and they don't have a separate toilet room from the shower. The front desk staff are incredibly nice and accomodating. I don't think I've ever experienced any hotel staff who seemed as truly genuine as they were. At night, a carafe of sherry is put out for guests to sample. It was great to come back from a night out, and then be treated to an after-dinner drink. This is a hotel for people who want to get away from it all (TV was about a 14 inch) and feel like they are staying with their friends in the city.

The hotel is surrounded by some of the best Italian restaurants in the city. It\u9225\u6a9a a near perfect San Francisco experience. Hotel Boheme itself is located on Columbus Street in the heart of an old Italian neighborhood. The only sign of a hotel at 444 Columbus is a single innocuous doorway covered by a small awning. That doorway is wedged between the sidewalk caf\u8305 \u9225\u6dd0alazones\u9225?and a small Italian bakery. You have to buzz at the door to enter but you get a key for this door on check in. Past the door is a steep and narrow staircase leading up to the next floor. On the second floor to the right of the landing is the hotel office. A bottle of Sherry surrounded by cordial glasses is set out for guests on the landing sideboard each night. Hotel staff are always friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about everything San Francisco. They have always made our visits to stays in the city easy and fun.Our last trip to San Francisco, June of 2006 became our fourth time staying at the Hotel Boheme. The rooms are small and simple but quite elegant. Our room had a queen bed, armoire and a bistro table with two chairs. Our bathroom was tiled and had a glass front shower. Everything was spotless. The hotel motif is straight from the beat generation with names like Laurence Ferlengetti, Jack Keroac, Ken Kesey and Jake Cassidy dominating the hotel art and some of the furniture as well.Two comments for your consideration is the difficulty with parking. Parking is a problem all over San Francisco. The closest Public Parking to Hotel Boheme is on Valejo street about a block and a half way. Be prepared to pay $26 dollars per day for public parking.

It's a great area for urban hikers, especially if they don't mind some steep grades -- Russian Hill, the Coit Tower, and Chinatown are all fairly close, and may other parts of San Francisco are a long walk (or a cab ride) away.Entrance to the hotel is tucked between patio tables of restaurants below, and you climb a flight of stairs to the concierge desk. Then, if necessary, another flight to your room.Stan was our concierge, and he began making suggestions about where to visit before we even asked. Charles was equally solicitous on our way out. These guys really want you to enjoy your stay, and really know both the neighborhood and the city.Rooms are small, cozy, and retro, with decor celebrating the Beat era of North Beach, and rooms painted deep colors. Our room was in very good shape save one patch of damaged ceiling.Hotel Boheme does not try to be a full-service hotel. Room service consists of a limited menu of beverages only. Our room had a very small TV set (which we didn't need anyway). No fitness center or expansive lobby.Complimentary sherry is provided from the concierge area in the evenings.Here's the main thing: if you take a room fronting along Columbus Ave., you can sit near the window and watch the sidewalks below, which is fun. You also get a lot of street noise (Saturday night brought a lot of late-night revelry to the sidewalk cafes below; Sunday wasn't as bad). So either take the street-side room and be prepared (bring ear plugs for sleeping?) or else ask for a quieter room, or stay elsewhere.We'll be back to Hotel Boheme -- with earplugs.During our stay, we enjoyed a martini at the Beat-culture-soaked Vesuvio bar (next door to the famous City Lights bookstore), a focaccia sandwich and capuccino at Mario's Bohemian Cigar Shop  Restaurant, a decent dinner at Calzone's under the hotel, and a very nice dinner at Steps of Rome Trattoria.

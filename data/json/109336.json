We chose the Hyatt Place based on price and location, as it was a quick cab ride from an event we were attending at the Angelkia Theatre. I have to say I was blown away with how friendly everyone was!! As soon as we entered we were greeted by two wonderful gentlemen, who made us feel like part of the family (Jerome and Matt) We even got to pick our floor. The room was amazing, so clean and such a cool and functional layout. It had a nice living room area which was perfect for us to relax before the event. The front desk was able to quickly call us a cab and we were off. When we returned later that evening, Adrian was on staff. He poured us a couple of nightcaps and got us some snacks, even heated it up a second time so we could bring them back to our room. He was soo friendly and again, made us feel at home. The bed was so comfortable and we had a great nights stay. In the morning, there was a great selection of breakfast items to choose from.

We were actually kind of excited about this hotel because it was such a great deal and being a Hyatt we were expecting great quality and service. After the 4+ hour drive we check in and get into our rooms, ready to wash off a bit and realize that the water coming out of the faucets is a dark brown color and smells of sewage. I was mortified. We checked both sinks and the shower and actually got video footage. Then we called the front desk and asked if they were aware of any problems expecting them to be apologetic and maybe even having us move to another hotel. No reaction. They said they'd send someone up to our room. No one ever came so I went downstairs to try to find some potable water. When I turned on the faucet in the ladies down stairs-- same thing! Disgusting. I asked the front desk person if they knew of any plumbing problems and she said no but called her manager. When she was finally able to track someone down by phone he said that yes by the way they had shut the water off earlier in the day and this happens. We should let the water run a while and it should be fine. We never received an apology. No one ever checked up on us to find out if the situation had been resolved. Nothing. Very, very disappointed.

Plans had to be changed a bit, so my husband called this hotel to adjust our reservation, and it was not a problem, they honored the rate I booked under, which was a pretty good rate. We stayed for three nights. This also happened to be a day after Dallas received snow, which doesn't happen very often, so there was a lot of ice in the parking lot in the front. Not to worry, we just parked in the back after our initial slippery experience. My girls had the best time playing in the snow at the front of the hotel! The fellow we dealt with at the desk, unfortunately I misplaced his name, he was very helpful and the kind of guy you would like to be running your front desk if you owned a hotel. He tried to help us find someplace to eat, as it was Christmas day, and pretty much nothing was open. He gave us a list of restaurants, and even made some phone calls. Eventually, we struck out on our own, and discovered that the nearby NorthPark mall had some restaurants open, because there was a huge movie theatre there. The room was decent; a bit small, but at least bigger than a regular hotel room. Our two girls slept in the fold-out couch, which was a fun treat for them. The only complaint I have is minor or typical, the heater/ a/c unit (better than a window unit, but not central) cycled on and off all night, and I would wake up w/ the changes. If I just left it on, it would have been too hot. Also, w/ the ice on the road, I heard several sirens throughout the night on our first night, but not too many thereafter. I like these Hyatt Place hotels because of the suite set up, and the small refrigerator and sink in the room. It was also nice to have complimentary internet access, which you don't often get. The complimentary continental breakfast was okay, but it would have been better if the folks in charge of it kept the utensils stocked. Each morning, I noticed there were either no or just a few forks left in the holder, so I would grab what we needed so we were covered. I almost chose a Hampton Inn(Hilton family) over this hotel because they offered a complimentary cook-to-order breakfast, but my lower room rate was enough to cover the cost of breakfast if this one was not enough. Fortunately w/ all of the mini yogurt cups, bowls of cereal, bagels, and donuts, we were plenty full, and saved money to boot. Actually, I bought Hyatt gift certificates at Costco for $80 per $100, and saved $50 more on my trip. However, I didn't get Hyatt points for anything but the part I actually charged at the hotel. I prefer the Hyatt Gold Passport loyalty club over the Hilton Honors club, because w/ the Hyatt club, your points don't expire, and the Hilton ones expire after one year of no activity. With young kids, we don't always get to stay at hotels of our choice throughout the year, so it's nice when your stays count without expiring.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wf", "Title": "\u201camazing hotel and gm brad is great\u201d", "Author": "tmbas", "ReviewID": "UR49499701", "Content": "Everything about this hotel is amazing would recomend it to anyone.

You can get detergent and softener at the front desk for $1. The breakfast in the AM consisted of scrambled eggs, sausage, make it yourself waffles, pastries, cereals etc. It was very crowded and they ran out of plates. They have one waffle maker. They also have the slowest elevators I have ever seen. All the staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel is just off the interstate and easily accesible to downtown. It is in a safe area and the hotel clientele were mainly tourists. I stayed here for two nights using my Hyatt gold points. I would not stay here again unless it were free but I am partial to \"nicer\" hotels.", "Date": "April 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cnot very nice\u201d", "Author": "loriyand", "ReviewID": "UR7217645", "Content": "When I got to my room it was musky and then I realized the airconditioner didn't work..

The hotel is really clean although I did receive a double room when I reserved a king room. The problem was fixed very quickly.The room was clean although in no way shape or form a suite in my opinion. There is a wall that separates the bedroom from the sitting area and I found the room the smallest suite I've ever seen. The kitchen is functional with small fridge, microwave, and stove. However, the problem is insulation. We heard every noise going on outside from the construction, the people upstairs, the people walking by outside in the hallways. There is no insulation to guard against noise. Didn't get a good nights sleep at all. The heating unit is one of those in the wall units that only heats the immediate area which wouldn't be a problem if Texas was not having an ice storm that day so it was freezing! The breakfast buffet was decent as long as you don't mind warming it up. There are very few restaurants nearby and the staff is not very knowledgable. I would not return but may be economical choice for business travelers", "Date": "December 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fife Scotland", "Title": "\u201cLoved It\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1925114", "Content": "Hotel was fantastic, well presented and clean.

I am (as noted in my other reviews) a die hard hotel snob (typically a Hampton girl )but went to this hotel with our softball team over New Years weekend and was pleasantly surprised. It is a remodeled Hampton Inn, extremely clean, great front desk service and a clean, nice hot breakfast. The bathrooms were a bit small but given the fact that they were very clean, the size is no big deal. I highly recommend this hotel and it was great being less than 5 minutes from the SportZone where they were playing. Also super easy access to the freeway.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cGood Spot for IMS Activities\u201d", "Author": "cac2582", "ReviewID": "UR121935628", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here during qualifications weekend for the 2011 Indianapolis 500. It's a clean, quiet, well located and very serviceable Holiday Inn Express and I'll definitely be back. My wife and I very much enjoy Holiday Inn Express. We've found them to be typically more modern and better appointed than your other run of the mill motels and this one is no exception. Free hot breakfast in the morning is also a great touch and is done very competently here. One of the biggest perks for us was the proximity to IMS. Just a ten minute (or less) drive from the Speedway up I-465, this hotel made it very easy to get back and forth. In fact, I believe if we just wanted to take a taxi back and forth that would have worked just as well. Another nice perk was the free wi-fi. We were able to keep up with news from Qualifications and also get the up to date weather. This hotel is also very close to a lot of dining options on the Northwest side of Indy, and isn't far from the North side attractions either. I believe a nice movie theater was near there as well. Anyway...for what it is, it's a great spot and I'll definitely stay there again.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gainesville, Florida", "Title": "\u201cFunctional\u201d", "Author": "SVG108", "ReviewID": "UR120794550", "Content": "Fairly functional...nothing fancy.

Over-All, we had a good time. Breakfast was nice and the beds were comfortable. My only complaint deals with the AC units in the rooms. Hotel management has set all the AC units with a minimal setting of 66 (the fitness room went lower). Most people would think that is fine, but I like to sleep in cold conditions. I am also a light sleeper, and the AC unit was inconsistently loud and quiet. When the fan was on, it was quiet. When the AC cycled on, it was very loud. I asked the front desk to switch our rooms and they did. The second room was better, but it was still annoying. I had to use earplugs.

The staff went out of their way to insure my stay was pleasant and that I received answers to my questions immediately. I felt like they had known me for a long time and treated me like a valued guest. The shuttle service was ready every morning and a quick phone call in the evenings had them there to pick me up within 10 minutes. I also took part in one of the two evening Manager's Receptions that included a light dinner and refreshments. I utilized the fitness room the entire stay, and although it is modest in size with two treadmills, a stair stepper, a stationary bicycle, and a couple of benches for sit-ups and leg exercises, it worked for my needs and I never had to wait for a machine. The pool area was clean, although I did not utilize either the pool or hot tub during my stay.

The breakfast was pretty good as well and the breakfast person was very upbeat! Also when we checked in to the hotel the lady at the front desk noticed that we had children and offered them some candy that they had in a trophy at the desk.

The location is a little farther from downtown but is near a lot of different restaurants so that is nice. I slept very well. The value was quite typical for a Holiday Inn Express.

There was ample food with an entire breakfast room of people and the breakfast servant was pleasant. Checking in, they did not put any effort at all into helping me to find my Priority Club number. I was not traveling with a laptop or I would have looked it up myself. Had to call my husband to ask him what it was. When I checked out the next morning, I asked for a receipt for my room. The desk clerk asked me if I received one this morning under my door and I said NO. She acted like I was wasting her time and it was my fault I did not get one with my newspaper. Obviously, if I am asking for a receipt I did not receive one previously. So when I told her I did not receive one, she proceeded to tell me that I had a zero balance bill and that people never asked for a receipt that was cash paid. I told her that I had to turn it in for an expense with my company for reimbursement. That was the only part of my stay that I was unhappy with. Their customer service is not very desirable.

The valet parking and the welcoming was first class. Check-in took longer than I would have wanted as I had booked a suite and the front desk manager had to release the room before the staff could allocate one to me.

The bed in the middle of the room provided an excellent night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. Unfortunately the room was behind the pool table and facing the room so was noisier than I would have liked. The bathroom was of a good size but did not have a bath tub. I did not miss it but would expect a room in the $500 category to have one. The darkness in the bathroom is a design fad but not practical. The gym is state of the art. Although it gets busy the equipment is one of the best I have seen in a hotel. The food in the restaurant was excellent and the staff attentive. The breakfast buffet was disappointing. The quality of the food and the staff were great but the choice was far too limited for my taste. Breakfast only starts at 7am so if you have an early start you will only be able to get complimentary coffee. WiFi works well. The hotel charged me $14.95 per day per device. When I complained at check-out the charge was reduced to $14.95 per day. The SLS is not cheap. The amenities and the standard of service is what you would expect in this price category.

Clearly the alarm is intended to wake you up, so it is not gentle, it literally jolts you out of bed. Being on the top floor I was apprehensive, is it real? Is it a false alarm? I tried phoning downstairs to no avail. Got dressed and ran out only to be told in the hall to go back to bed, false alarm. Now these things happen, they are after all for everyone's safety, however when I called the lobby to ask what the cause was, I was told it was unknown. I asked if this has happened recently but the answer was \"we are not allowed to disclose.\" Understood, so I asked to speak to the manager. Hold, hold, hold. Gave up. Called again a few minutes later as at this point the headache prevented me from sleeping. I was told manager would be right with me which really meant hold so long that I again thought of hanging up; this time i didn't. I expressed my concern for safety and asked what had really occured only to be vaguely told it was a 'false alarm,' I asked when was the last time this happened and the manager replied he did not know. When I pressed, I was then told 'well I have only been here a short while so that is why I don't know.\" I asked the manager who would know, he replied the operations manager; I asked him to please find out and get back to me as he seemed rather uncooperative regarding what I considered to be a safety concern, he replied he would. He never did. No one did. I called the fire department to ask about safety issues at the hotel. First thing I learned was that this hotel, in spite of the name and all its marketing, is not in Beverly Hills but in Los Angeles, so I was redirected to the Los Angeles fire department. The local inspector told me that in fact there had been 'quite a few incidents' in this hotel but they were mostly attributed to incorrectly placed sensors in the kitchen, the inspector was under the impression the hotel had resolved this but he would follow up. Since management never gave me a response i asked a member of the cleaning crew, he told me that this happens often and always at the worst time, he said, 'it recently happened at 3 a.m.\" I am shocked that management completely ignored my request for info and never replied. It is clear that the \"I don't know answer\" really means \"I don't want to answer\" as in the truth is not pretty. I will be cutting my stay short here. While most fault this hotel on lighting, which really is terrible, or staff attitude, which has room for serious improvement; or the gym, which is tired and dated and has no shower, steam or locker facilities unless you pay to use the spa, my main concern is one of safety and given the lack of reply I caution others.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Experience\u201d", "Author": "D Q", "ReviewID": "UR125716221", "Content": "Upon arriving at the SLS I realized that I had actually not \"confirmed\" my reservation.

It looked very little like the bright, sunny and spacious room that was shown on their website. I definitely felt like I got a bait-and-switch. The room was extremely quiet though. The window was grimy and wasn't floor to ceiling as the website picture showed. The room is loaded with dark mirrors which gives you a sense that someone is always watching you through two way glass. I found it very unnerving. And there isn't a single place in the hotel to actually see yourself clearly. It is a but maddening and I'm not even female! I get te definite sense that the interior designer had absolutely no consideration for function or comfort when designing the SLS. A word of caution about the Internet. The SLS is the only hotel that I have ever staid at that charges BY DEVICE attached and not per room. I chened out and had three charge per night for Internet because I had connected my phone, iPad an computer. It is inexcusable tha Starwood allows this sort of policy at one of their hotels. Are they stuck in the 90's??! Also their app tells you that if you Like the SLS on Facebook that they will give you one day if free Internet access.

It's California - let some natural light in thru the windows and feel the California vibe! (Mondrian is hip and still has natural light!) I have turned every possible light on in my room, in addition to opening the curtain, and it is still dark in here. When a light was out in my bathroom yesterday, I didn't even notice because it is that dark in here. Not helping was the family in the room next door that was up at 6am every day playing loudly with their children.

It's a little bit tricky to complain about family noise at 6am (as opposed to music at 3am), but it was disturbing nonetheless and should at least underscore how thin the walls are here.

We all found our stay at the SLS to be a very enjoyable and unique experience. The decor and ambience throughout the hotel is ultra-cool and trendy, and so was a lot of fun to experience. Staff in the hotel and associated restaurants were all friendly, welcoming, helpful; and there was no \"attitude\". We had an outstanding dinner at the attached restaurant Bazaar - expensive but great fun. As part of the dining experience be sure to check out the museum-like display area, and the trendy washrooms.We also had a great breakfast in Tres, the lobby restaurant. As part of your SLS experience you should splurge in both Bazaar and Tres at least once. The complimentary coffee at the self serve station in the lobby was a nice touch, as were the complimentary newspapers and trays of apples throughout. We also enjoyed a dip in the stylish roof-top pool, and there is a very well-equipped fitness center. Parking (valet only) is efficient but a little pricey at $35, and all business center services are for a fee (except for printing boarding passes). Internet access is $13/day from anywhere in hotel.

I made the mistake on a recent visit to Los Angeles of staying at the SLS Hotel for about 4 nights. My expectation in a rated luxury hotel is that my room will be safe for me personally and that any belongings I have in the room will be safe. Not so at the SLS. We had purchased some clothing at Barney's and left it in the shopping bag in the room. Upon check out we noticed that the bag had vanished. That's when the so called Luxury Hotel showed it's true colours. I immediately called security about the missing bag and a security person came to the room and wrote a report. As we were in the process of checking out I was told I would hear back from the security officer within a few hours. Upon check out I asked for the General Manager as I wanted to make sure he knew of the incident. As he was not available I made sure the front desk was aware of the situation and asked that a message be left for him to call me. About 4 hours later after not receiving a call back as promised from the security person I called the hotel only to find he was not available but would return my call. This back and forth went on for about 6 weeks with no results of their investigation. I had also talked to Sarah the General Manager's assistant a number of times and asked her to have the General Manager call me but to no avail. I never recieved a call from the General Manager. Eventually after leaving several messages for their lead investigations person he did call and tell me that the results of their investigation had turned up nothing and of course they would not be reimbursing me anything as it was my word against their word. There were suggestions made by this individual that there were perhaps other ways they could look after me and he would get back to me on that but I never heard anything further. In all my years of travelling I have never had a worse experience than this hotel delivered to me.

I point this out because my wife and I are people that love different hotel experiences and rarely stay at the same hotel. We've stayed at the Beverly Hills Hotel, L'Hermitage, Four Seasons but after that first stay at the SLS, we couldn't wait to go back. So much so that I had won a weekend stay at another luxury hotel and I choose to PAY to stay at the SLS again. From the moment you arrive,you feel like a movie star. The hotel staff is one of the best I encountered. Whether it was the valet or the housekeeping staff, everyone treats you like you are their primary concern. It is truly a level of service that you read about in travel magazines but rarely get to experience. The restaurants and room service are all run by Jose Andres, an innovative chef who's The Bazaar at the hotel is one of the hottest tables in LA. All of our meals at the hotels were unbelievable and again the staff were some of the most accommodating and courteous we've encountered. Be sure to have breakfast at Tres and have the French toast(like s bread pudding). At night, have a drink at the bar next to The Bazaar and order the Jose Andres Gin and Tonic or a Margarita with salt air foam. Keep your eyes peeled for celebrities as they flock here. After you check in, you'll enter an elevator with \"other guests\" muraled on the walls upon exiting your floor, you'll see a pool table with the words \"Satan Loves Sinners\" stitched on the side. There's an electronic painting of a victorian era man than slowly changes into a monkey. Your room is as funky as the rest of the hotel. Amazing beds, modern decor, and a tv hidden within a mirror. The roof top bar looks like something out of a movie set with a beautiful and attentive staff to match. The gym and spa leave nothing to be desired. You literally forget you are in one of the most congested parts of Los Angeles within the walls of the SLS. They also offer a chauffeured car for short trips. You can't help but feel like one of the Hollywood elite when you stay here. And you should because all the SLS staff treats you like one! Take my word and stay here on your next trip to Los Angeles. My hat is off to the General Manager of the hotel who not only directs this fine staff but heard about a special event we were celebrating and made our stay extra special. Keep up the amazing work!

It's well located, it's Starwood (as I try and stay in Starwood hotels wherever possible), trendy, and has some great restaurants both in the local vicinity and attached to the hotel, including Mortons, which is decent, and The Bazaar by Jose Andres which is supposed to be stunning but I'm yet to try. The rooms are very well designed, the gym's 24 hour, the room service menu is solid... so why I am complaining? Firstly, the rooms are very, very, very dark - the extent that seeing the contents of your suitcase is difficult, even with all the lights on maximum, and good luck getting ready, because even the bathroom's don't contain any bright lights at all. Which I understand is cool and relaxing and trendy etc, but a total nightmare if you want to style your hair - or for females - apply makeup. I was constantly seeing myself in the hall mirrors upon leaving my room and being horrified. But I guess my issue is with the service - it never seemed to be quite up to par for a hotel of this standard. Check in was downright unfriendly. I don't expect to have the red-carpet rolled out (although as a Platinum SPG member, it often is), but some basic politeness would sure be nice. As part of the benefits of SPG Platinum, you receive guaranteed upgrades to the best rooms available - and whilst that doesn't always happen, you're generally told \"Sorry Sir, we're actually fully booked, so although you're a Platinum member we won't be able to improve your room, but will being whatever we can to make your stay great\". I wasn't told anything, but when I asked if any better rooms were available, I was simply told \"No\". Long story but the short answer is, don't come here expecting any superior treatment for spending a huge amount of money with Starwood each year - you won't get it. As it happens, I had booked a suite anyway so the lack of a huge upgrade wasn't a huge issue, but as a top-level member of the hotel chain's loyalty scheme staying in a $400 suite booked with cash (not SPG points or anything), I would have expected a slightly better attitude. That sort of experience seemed to be a running theme throughout my four nights. For every helpful, ready-to-serve individual you'd encounter, they'd be another who let the whole place down. I called down at 11pm to try and arrange a laundry collection and was flatly told \"The laundry opens at 9am Sir\". \"But can't you come and get my laundry now, for the morning?\" I asked, as tends to be the procedure in any decent hotel, and was told again \"Sir, the laundry opens at 9am\". After calling back, frankly bewildered and asking to speak to a supervisor, I was told \"Oh, I didn't understand what you meant. I'll send a bell-hop now\". Er, yeah. I could go on, but I guess you get the drift. The concierge who seemed utterly unconcerned that I waited 15 minutes for a taxi when I was clearly bugged at running late for dinner. The fact that my mini-bar wasn't restocked once during a four day stay. The room-service chicken with mashed potato that came without mashed potato. It goes on. In short, it's good. It could be a lot better. Next time in LA, I'll be back staying at The London, which is a very similar sort of hotel and only about a mile away, but where they *do* get the service right.

Bed is in the middle of the room, bathroom is all slate and tinted mirrored glass.Little trinkets all over the room (for you to purchase, of course).

My room was incredibly appointed, with the highlight being the dark-mirrored wall with the TV directly in the center of it. The bathroom had a standing shower only and plenty of modern amenities.

What set it over the top was that it had two, $10,000 each Kinesis machines from TechnoGym. These things are out of this world cool looking and work you out incredibly well. There was a really packed restaurant and bar on the 1st floor that I did not eat at, but given the popularity and star rating, I've heard it was good :) All in all, I would return in a second.

They have a bunch of toiletries in the bathroom which I thought was a nice touch until I realized you had to PAY for them. How tacky. Second, the bathtub/shower combo is just bizarre- the shower head is in the ceiling and water splashes all over the floor outside the bathtub.

Also Danny who did the room orientation and made us feel right at home. It was a lifetime experience to stay in the heart of Beverly HIlls and experience the star treatment but not my cup of tea.

The hotel is high gloss modern with a nice sense of humor about itself. One has to appreciate any property where there is something new. Here mostly, clever design and details count. Plus it is built on an old-school foundation of good service. Marriott lovers beware: this is not the place for you. There is enough glass in the rooms to rival the Crystal Cathedral, and the color palette is cascading shades of gray with a bit of dark brown thrown in for excitement. I find the rooms quite minimal and relaxing. Video is hidden behind a wall of glass and another glass wall slides back to reveal the bath. All the usual high end amenities are at hand. The custom built furniture is unique and mostly successful. If one looks carefully some clever details reveal themselves. The lighting is on numerous dimmers and custom fixtures. Unfortunately the stlagtight-like fixtures over the table hang too low and are, literally, painfully awkward. In the deluxe room I would hit my head every time I stood up from the modern seating. In the Studio Suite it hung inches from my left shoulder when I sat at the elegant table. I think a brighter and friendlier fixture is in order. There is electronic maid service which is always convenient. The baths are large and full of slate and glass. One has to choose between shower or tub, with the tubs is the double bedded rooms. At this level there should be a tub and separate suite. Of course there is twice daily service and they do freshen the room with a proper turndown. The fitness room is excellent with a good selection of strength machines, dumb bells, and a good cable machine. The usual selection of good cardio machines are neatly lined up between glass walls and repeating gray lamps straight out of DWR. It is a nice effect when on the machines. The only missing element is a lux locker room. There is none here. But it is easy to get a good workout if not a good shower and steam. The rooftop pool has good views, plus some unusual elements like massively oversize mirrors and paintings scattered about. Service is good and food is excellent but it is a bit of scene. The Bazaar speaks for itself: 4 stars from the LA Times; a lofty rating. However the Hotel resturant Tres is equally excellent as is room service. This is some of the best hotel food anywhere. The Mon-Fri breakfast buffet is unique and really great with highest quality ingredients and presentation. But the real revelation is the Weekend Buffet. Forty-five dollars buys a carefully curated selection of the the worlds best meat, cheese, fish, salads, breads, pastries and desserts. There is a ton of cleverness and innovation in the food here. Despite my relentless attacks, the presentation is always flawless as is the service: correct and friendly; They remembered me on my second visit and always since. I always see the management walking the room and greeting guests. There is good coffee and a selection of newspapers free to guests every a.m. I really appreciate this. I have found the service to be 5 star which is not always true in these trendy places. They have kept the same edge that is sometimes lost after a big opening. Here they are keeping up standards. Sadly the ubiquitous loud, drunk, posers and the \"On-stage\" hipsters,that blight trendy places in LA are here. Just try to enjoy their antics. This is one hotel that is better then some of its guests. This is a one-of-a-kind-experience where quality and service are maintained. They treat SPG guests quite well too.

Everything at this hotel is very dark, with lots of dark tones, to include the uniforms. We were greeted by name everywhere we went, and services were offered promptly, courteously, and without attitude, which is something I unfortunately *did* expect. It was a very pleasant arrival experience. Check in was not as perfect as the valet/bell service. It wasn't bad by any means, though. We arrived at about 1:45 pm, a little before the general check-in time of 3 pm. I know that's not unusual, but that I shouldn't expect a room to be ready. What irked me a bit, though, was that several other parties decided to check-in early as well, which overwhelmed the front desk staff a bit - and only 2 of 3 check-in terminals were being used while several bellmen/concierge staff stood around. I would have appreciated if someone on staff would have noticed the line forming at the front desk, and called over another person to assure that all check-in stations were manned. This did not happen. One clerk was a trainee, but she was doing her best with what appeared to be a reservation with a bit of a hiccup. The other clerk was dealing with what I thought to be an overly-demanding-but-not-deserving guest who swore that she found a rate online for a particular suite, but nothing in SLS system said that was even remotely true. Both clerks handled the situations with grace and smiles. Kudos to them for that. As I said, it wasn't a bad experience at all, but I disliked having to wait 15 minutes to check-in when there was another station available. It just seemed like some disconnect in personnel management. However, it should be noted that the trainee, who eventually helped my partner and I, was very apologetic about the wait and overall incredibly friendly and helpful. The room was amazing. We only had the lowest grade of room available, but it was great. The decor was very posh, and done with impeccable taste. It's a blend of modern and maybe...art nouveau? Either way, the set up of the room itself, to the furniture used, to the bathroom were just remarkable. The pictures provided on this site will do a better job of showing the details of the room, but in my examination of the room itself, all the furniture was very, very well-kept and incredibly clean. The rooms contain a LOT of mirrored surfaced, to include, walls, tables, and the bed. And you can imagine what a nightmare that must be. Their housekeeping staff definitely has their work cut out for them, but appear to be doing a superb job. I have only one complaint about the room: All the mirrored walls have a smoke tint to them, making the rooms very dark, even with all the lights on. This is especially troublesome in the bathroom where sufficient light is necessary when getting ready to go out. Even though the bathroom mirror over the sink wasn't tinted, the other surfaces are, and they just seem to absorb all the light. The shower and the bounty of bathroom amenities almost make up for the dimness, though. The shower products come in large bottles, so you never have to worry about running out or opening tiny little vials of shampoo or conditioner with already-soapy/slippery hands. We used the valet and requested turn-down service. Every time we called the front desk or the valet, they were extremely gracious and accommodating. My partner and I aren't terribly needy, but felt as though any desire we would have expressed, would have been met with every effort to see it met. The location... It's just down the street from the Beverly Center and a short drive or a decent-ish walk to West Hollywood. However, the surrounding areas are light commercial and not the kind of area I'd necessarily think of for this kind of hotel, especially given the oasis you experience once inside the property. Perhaps this hotel, itself, is an effort to gentrify the area. Either way, though, the drive from the airport to the hotel left my partner and I wondering if this was the best choice. Again, I'd definitely return and the location *is* convenient, just don't be dissuaded by the surrounding neighborhood. I regret that we were only able to stay one night, as I would have loved to use the pool or the spa, and just experience a day or two more of the hotel. It's a great place and is definitely on my list of places to look at the next time I'm in LA.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cSLS will be my go-to LA hotel\u201d", "Author": "jlontos3", "ReviewID": "UR117807878", "Content": "My partner and I were just in LA and had a fantastic stay at the SLS.

Service: I have been staying at the SLS for 2 years and most any request has been fulfilled. Unlike the large hotels, the SLS employees have a personal attentiveness to the needs of the guests. They thrive to make the hotel experience as best as possible. Entertainment: The Bazaar has exceptional food and the bar is one of the most trendy in LA. Having a drink with clients is much different than most hotel bars. This place is an LA hotspot. I have seen multiple celebrities and the typical local fashionistas. Although it is swanky and popular, it isn't very loud. There are plenty of tables to sit and talk without the need to yell. I have also attended business parties at the hotel. The PR/ Marketing dept is top notch. They have indoor and outdoor facilities and know how to coordinate any type of event. I have seen many types of events. Private parties after the ESPYS, filming of Entourage, and other business functions. The PR dept makes sure none of these special events interferes with the guests personal experience at the hotel. Misc: I exercise at the hotel every morning and love the fitness center. Most fitness centers at other hotels are small, dirty, and have old equipment. The SLS fitness center has all the latest equipment for any fitness need. Cardio machines, weights, mats, balls, anything a gym has is available. It is very large and meticulously clean.

Later, I realized that they charge $6 for the candy bar and $10 for a bottle of Evian. That's too much. No reason for that. * The door to the shower slams closed every time, and that caused all the items on the shelve inside to fall on the floor every time. * There is a showerhead on the wall in the shower that is basically immovable, and no other options. That means that when you turn the shower on, you will immediately get splashed with cold water. No matter what you do, you cannot avoid this! * $36 / day for valet parking is too high for guests. * The sliding door to the balcony was faulty, and you had to use all your strength to open and close it.

I had a confirmed upgrade through American Express and when I arrived the person checking me in told me that I had been upgraded but when I got to my room, I realized this was the room I paid for. When the hotel admitted it was wrong, they told us we could move rooms (we were already unpacked) or they would refund us the difference. We chose the refund, but when we checked out they had no recollection of that conversation and it was a hassle to get resolved. 2. A friend of mine had sent us a bottle of champagne as gift but I didn't find out until he called me and asked why i didn't call him and say thank you. Maybe it's because the hotel never sent it, although they told him otherwise. 3. The hotel has a nice car service that will take guests anywhere in a 2.0 mile radius.

We came back to the hotel with colleagues after an evening out. I have stayed here once a month( usually 3-5 nights) for the past year.

They told us to go to the other lobby. They could not serve since they were setting up for breakfast. We were told to get up and move to another area 3 times until finally I mentioned that I had stayed in the hotel a dozen times and that they were being totally inhospitable. It was frankly sort of embarrassing. A manager would tell us we could sit in one place and then another or a server would say we could not. As hotel guests we were told that the desert tables were reserved for diners from the restaurant as part of the \" experience\" . I have eaten in the restaurant and was never made aware of \" the experience\". It sounded ridiculous. We were trying to have a couple of cocktails, maybe some appetizers and tea at 11:00 on a Friday night. Trying to cop a NY attitude in LA just doesn't work for me...especially when I am a hotel guest not a clubber...so annoying.

The hotel had not deducted for a 20% spa credit, and meal/beverage coupons. The front desk could not look at the details of each transaction so they had to call the spa and restaurant for details for all the transactions. Because it could not be figured out expeditiously, the manager gave us an additional $50 off the bill. We accepted the rebate as close enough, after all we had a plane to catch.

I'm going to write the next review and my stay went. Check in/Check out So we arrived at this beautiful hotel through the Red Carpet. The check-in wan't what I was hopping. I had already paid my full stay through Expedia but they still needed a Credit Card which I don't have, last time at the Beverly Hilton they just ask me for a 200 usd deposit, but at first the guy just told us \"This isn't how we do it here\" a bit rude, but after checking with his manager we just put a deposit. The check out was very good and fast. Normally it's at 12:00 p.m. but they leave us check out until 1:00 p.m. without charges Because of the guy rudeness Im putting a 4.1 out of 5 Room The room was very nice with two double beds. The bathroom had a shower, which I thought it was a tub, and some great body lotions and shampoos. The t.v. is probably the coolest t.v. I've ever seen in a hotel, inside a furniture, WOW! There is also a desk with an internet cable (it should be already included!). What I really thought it was a bit dangerous it was the metals next to each bed and the lamp of the desk, my son hit himself twice!! I booked the room and the flight together but the room itself was about 230 usd per night, very good price and it was a Premiere room, which cost me 20 usd in total more and the only extra is that we were at the last floor and had two bottles of Evian. Before coming we asked for a nice view of the hills and 50% of our view was the Hospital, then a little bit some buildings and just a bit of the hills. The pool has better views and is on the 6th floor. I really liked the room I just thought the view could have been better. I give out a 4.6 out of 5 Restaurant We never had lunch/dinner at The Bazaar but it seemed cool. Anyways we had breakfast at the TRES, very expensive. Their eggs for adults are just greats but for kids are not. The food was good but seriously 8 usd for an orange juice? I know it's Beverly Hills but it just seems a lot. And then we had an issue the last morning with the waiter ALEX, he was asking something and I was translating it to my son, and because we didn't order he really got angry. The mexican waiter and the blond lady were just amazing in their work. Price, service and because of food I give a 4.4. Location I think this hotel has the best locationI've ever stayed at L.A. Last time I stayed at the Beverly hilton and the Beverly Wilshire both at Beverly Hills, but I'm not going to buy at Rodeo Drive so this hotel is just great. At the edge of Beverly Hills, is just 2 blocks away from the Beverly Center mall. There is a beautiful house car that it was always available so it can drive you to The Grove, Hollywood Blvd, Robertson, etc.. The best thing is that I didn't had car, (parking is 33 usd a night, EXPENSIVE!), and I spent less than 200 usd of taxi, including to the airport. The only bad thing is that is right to a hospital, so at least you will hear a lot of ambulances I give out a 4.9 Service Well apart from the Alex at the Tres and the check-in guy everything else was great. The housekeeping, the driver, the waiters, the concierge were very good. The concierge mad our stay. First we asked for a tour next day for the celeb house, but apparently he thought we didn't want it so he didn't booked it, but anyways Alex (Concierge) booked us for the best private tour of the Celebrity Houses, THE BEST TOUR I'VE EVER TAKEN. I will give out a 4.7 Amenities The hotel has a great pool at the 6th floor but because of the weather we didn't used but it was a really glamorous pool. I liked the House Car service, it saved us a lot of $$. There is also a business center, 6 usd for 15 minutes! and there is a Spa and a Fitness Center which looked fine. Apparently if you have a dog they will also give you an amenity kit. I give out a 4.7 Value/Price We booked the whole trip with Expedia and it was 2000 usd for 3 with airplane included from Mexico and 3 nights. So yes! it was less than 250 usd per night. I've seen reviews that said that it's the same price like the Four Seasons, but not for me. Something I really didn't liked was the over-priced breakfast. I give out 4.8 Overall. Great hotel, with bizarre decoration, I've never got to know what kind of decoration was, but still cool. It has an amazing pool and staff. The rooms are just very nice and the location is the best part. So the big question? Would I will stay here again? 90% yes, if I can find a low rate like this one, but I might try another hotel. I give out 5 points to this 4-diamond hotel in West Hollywood.

Thank you for your reply to my letter, I sent it a few days after we stayed with you and had wondered why no reply, yesterday I discovered my other email program had not sent so I apologize for my tardiness in contacting you. My concerns fall into three categorys. I travel a lot and stay in a variety of settings, including small motels, bread and breakfasts, larger motels and 4/5 star hotels. This holiday was shared with my sister who does not travel so often and was a special time for us to share, she did ask me how much I had paid for giving her the experience of SLS but I did not tell her, I was too embarrassed. You did however provide my primary reason for choosing your hotel, proximaty to The Getty Museum and safety. 1. Decor : I know you are proud of your designer and some features are striking. However I do not want to spend my time in someones fantasy of modern art. Our room with its many mirrors with no real benefit but one and the there was no ceiling mirror to enhance that one use. The mirror between bed and bath served no purpose As you could not even clean teeth from room side. The beds while comfortable are surrounded by edges that could do someone real damage if they slipped. I want to do my retail therapy in a shop not in my room, every where you looked things where being sold from the fridge to the bathroom. My sister and I where afraid to touch anything. There was no coffee making facility in the room, we where told on departure it is in the foyer, but who wants to get dressed to get a cup of coffee. The bathroom required a degree in mechanical engineering to turn on the shower, my sister after 5 minutes woke me to work it out and 5 minutes later we had success. There was no where to place cloths or towels for easy access after shower. Towels where placed to far from shower. I did notice a few hanging hooks but at 5' 2\" a little out of my reach. The hand basin is large and to shallow resulting in water going every where when taps turned on. As retired nurse I have a pet pev about Wet surrounds around sinks and allowing germs to breed. While I am in your establishment it should be a place of succor. In the dining room the chairs at the bar where we where sat, while lovely to look at where most uncomfortable. When we asked if there was no where else we could sit we where taken to the smokers area and seated in the only comfortable chairs we encountered. After dinner we where escorted to the sweets are where the tale of the torturous chairs continued. A comfortable 2 person lounge blocked by a heavy table requiring movement to gain access, on the other side 2 mismatched chairs of questionable comfort. 2. Dining Room: We where told about your signature restaurant being Tapas themed which I thought unusual but as my sister and I are small eaters sounded good. So I rang for a table, no room at the inn for paying guests and why we found ourselves perched on the afore mentioned bar stools. We choose 3 dishes to begin, the first a salad arrived quickly. However an hour later we where still awaiting the other 2 dishes. I finally asked our waitress what was going on after what seemed a heated discussion with another waiter our meal appeared not long after. at which time we received one plate with a very tasty base and a few pieces of rare cooked lamb, and another with 3 squares of chicken and 2 dates cut in half with a mustard filling. Both tasted delicious, however as a cook I know it did not take an hour to prepare, This was early in evening and in fact dining room was nearly empty. I did complain at the time and when we had dessert we where not charged for dessert. As I said your staff are excellent and have received good training . I recently had a Tapas lunch in Palo Alto a much happier experience more interesting dessert menu, featuring delicious desserts I had never seen before. 3. Add Ons: As previously stated I stay in many levels of accommodation it never ceases to amaze me that I have to pay for internet access and parking when I pay the most. When I am travelling I want comfort and easy access to a meal that I can enjoy, I thank you for your kind offer, but it is unlikely I will be Los Angeles again. I am a retired Director of Nursing and used to visit patients and relatives to make sure we where doing things correctly. What I took to be a satisfactory performance was if they said like being at home, or like staying in a 5 star hotel so you see I have a high expectation of comfort and caring. I know things have changed but I do remember when I would be greeted with a small bottle of wine or champagne and a chocolate on my bed when staying in a better hotels.

It was a great experience overall and we will be returning next year to celebrate my 50th as well. We flew in to Burbank Airport, although the hotel is almost the same distance from LAX. The hotel does not offer shuttle services to the airports although they will arrange car services upon request. Cab fare from Burbank to the SLS will run you about $55 if there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any traffic, so plan accordingly when deciding whether it is more cost effective to hire a car service or take a cab. STAFF The hotel staff and service are incredible. Concierge - I was in email contact with our concierge, Alex Niezgoda, several times prior to our arrival. Alex was able to readily obtain the reservations for even some of the toughest restaurants for us, as well as being a valuable source of information. Once we arrived, we received excellent and professional service from all of the concierge staff. BONUS points for Alex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expertise and assistance. Bell Captain/Valet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c friendly, efficient service every time Front Desk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Also friendly, slightly less efficient, but still exceptional. Minor hitch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we had requested early check in because our flight arrived a bit before noon. Upon arrival, our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite ready. However, the Bell Captain secured our luggage and we went to lunch at Tres while we were waiting. As soon as it was ready, they came and found us in Tres and brought us the keys. Housekeeping \u00e2\u20ac\u201c great job! Our room was spotless throughout our stay. Transportation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c BONUS points for our driver, Daniel. The SLS has three vehicles available to take guests to any destination within a 3 mile radius of the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an Audi, a Range Rover, and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153jet van\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Bear in mind that the hotel does not provide return service so keep your cell phone handy to call Yellow Cab to pick you up when you are ready to go back to the hotel. I would suggest sticking with Yellow and avoiding United as we had a very bad experience with a United driver \u00e2\u20ac\u0153getting lost\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We were lucky enough to have Daniel as our driver throughout our stay, and we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say enough about what a wonderful job he does. Daniel is extremely knowledgable about the area in particular and LA in general. He was a significant contributor to making our trip stress free and successful. Wait Staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c TRES \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our waiter at Tres was Alexander. Excellent service, cheerfully provided, with solid knowledge of the menu. Kudos to Alexander. BAZAAR \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our waiter was the one true DISAPPOINTMENT of the weekend, the only NEGATIVE to our experience. We had a 6:30 reservation on Sunday, the 24th. We sat at a table in the red room right in front of the cotton candy machine. Our waiter was more interested in repeatedly, loudly, berating one of his colleagues who was serving \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or trying to serve \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a nearby table than he was in answering our questions regarding the menu. Every time we started to ask him a question he would suddenly dart away and begin chastising the other server. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing that the rest of the Bazaar serving staff filled in the gap, as our main server was largely absent until the end of the meal. His behavior made all of the guests distinctly uncomfortable. While I certainly intend to eat at Bazaar again next year, I am hoping that I will not be subjected to that server\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unacceptable behavior when we return. His lack of respect and poor performance stood out that much more strongly in comparison to the gracious service we received from everyone else we dealt with at the hotel. THE FACILITIES The Room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We stayed in Room 523, a Premier Double. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the D Porthault sheets are a treat. I love the clean, modern lines of the room and the minimal clutter. At the SLS it is all about the unique details \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like the ironing board with the open bird cage on the cover, and the flying bird on the back wall of the closet. The bathroom, with its sliding walls is elegant, yet comfortable. If you are short like I am though, be very careful with the deep soaking tub. It can be tough to climb back out of! I think half the fun of staying at the SLS is wandering through the public areas trying to spot as many of the funky and whimsical elements that are at the core of its design. If Tim Burton has designed a hotel, the SLS would be the result. FOOD Jose Andres and his team \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Wow! Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother eating anywhere else while you are there. Stick to Bazaar and Tres. All in all it was everything we hoped for in a celebration weekend.

For instance while Philippe Starck's signature eclectic opulent style is clearly in evidence, it fights for supremacy on your senses as guests must walk through what is essentially an outdoor smokers room every time they come and go from the hotel. It might be cool for those wishing to smoke and be seen there, but it makes for an awful gauntlet to run for guests. The front desk staff are professional in the extreme, confusing being professional hospitality with being a hospitality professional, they lack warmth and sincerity and I would say they're more officious than empathetic to a traveler's needs. The bathroom is large but the room was small but stylish and well appointed, but that's not appreciated when the logistics of the novel wardrobe or room door in the room next door are being repeatedly left to close without the necessary human assistance to stop it slamming at 1 or 2am. And judging by the noise permeating the paper thin hotel room door from guests returning to their rooms all night, the party palace nightlife is obviously fun, but not when you want to sleep after a 14 hour flight and be prepared to do business the next day. I was repeatedly woken each night of my stay this way. On one night, an exotic car was left idling in the hotel driveway and the reverberation came through to the hotel room, suggesting the acoustics seem to have been compromised in construction, which is less than ideal given the dual purpose of the hotel. I wasn't aware of the hotel courtesy cars when I booked, but had I known I wouldn't have had need of a hire car, as I could have used the cars within the hotels requirements. My hire car sat valet parked most of the three days I was there. The restaurant in the lobby and the Bazaar are both good at what they do and I enjoyed both of them. Although I can't see them changing the 'smokers gauntlet' anytime, I would give the SLS another chance because of it's location and as it's a relatively new facility, but I would ask for a room at the end of the hall and up high to avoid the noise from the driveway and partying guests getting to their rooms.

It is a great location in Beverly Hills and easily accessible. The Hotel is similar in style to a Schrager hotel - oversized pieces in the reception area, digital art, mood lighting and sound. So from the get go I would say that unless you place some value on innovative design and modern interpretations it is not going to be for you and that you would be better off with a more traditional luxury hotel. I am Platinum with Starwood, booked a standard room and got a Terrace Room which has a decent outside space - a nice option. So check in desk was exceptionally helpful, in fact the experience with all the staff has been positive from the lobby to the two restaurants to the valets. The rooms value design over function - expensive custom furniture and lighting, an oversized shower (no bath) - but very little space for clothing and storage. There are opulent touches such as the hand blown glass lighting, smoked mirror that hides a TV and custom Stark furniture. Beds are very comfortable. Couple of comments: the oversized toiletry bottles are not for take away and I personally like the large bottles as opposed to fiddling with tiny things to squeeze out little globs. However, although the texture of the products are very nice the SLS have missed a trick by not having a signature scent for any of the products - they are simply bland. The towels too are not bath sheets and feel rather cheap to me for a hotel of this standard. The bath robes though are large and luxurious - the kind you want to lounge in all day. Food for breakfast is expensive other then the buffet which again is innovative and a nice follow through from the superlative Bazaaar which is a must try - incredible food. The pool area can be a little intimidating - clearly pitched to the beautiful people of LA but again I found no problem with the attitude of the staff there.

Can't beat the location in terms of access to shopping, dining, nightlife. Overall, very sexy hotel.

We stayed at SLS because of Bazaar and the reputation of Jose Andres. To me the hotel is kind of a juiced up W where the guest better be willing to part with a LOT of cash. When I checked in I was told I was upgraded to a Studio Suite and that room is the only room they upgrade Platinum members. I would love to see a standard room, because our room would not be described by many people as a suite. Was it somewhat larger than a typical hotel room....maybe? I guess it would depend on who you were talking to. So we got upgraded to a larger room and the decor is very typical of a W. I thought the amenities were tacky. They provide oversized plastic bottles of shampoo, body wash, conditioner, which I am positive that if a guest took one they would get charged. For those of you who enjoy taking nice amenities when you leave, there's NO reason to take them. When I'm dropping well in excess of $300/night on a hotel room I want to see L'Occitane or Bulgari or something name brand plastered on the amenities. I don't want to see generic \"made for the SLS\" shampoo. Furthermore, do I want to handle the soap bottle after the last guest who used the toilet or had God knows what else on his hands? This was a bigger issue for me. Yeah, it's a funky quirky vibe the designers are going for with the reusable soaps/conditioner, and I'm sure it's green because they aren't wasting as much plastic, but I'm about not handling things other people have handled. As per other guests critiques, there isn't a bathtub, probably because there isn't room for it, even though we were supposedly upgraded to a suite! HA. Closet space is fine, but the ironing board is a strange little thing meant to sit on the table top. I've never seen anything like it. CHEAP would be the word that comes to mind. It wasn't trendy or minimalist, so all I can think is they needed to save money. The rooms are HIP, modern and minimalist. If you're not comfortable walking through a Design Within Reach store then this isn't the place for you to stay. A friend suggested it's more along the lines of Roche Bobois, but I can guarantee the furnishings don't come anywhere near the price point of Roche. Lighting is dim, which wasn't a problem for us, but others might not enjoy the look. I actually thought the room was quite pleasant and the bed quite comfortable, but CLEARLY not worth the final bill. So, other details. The Sunday brunch was $38/person and $48 with a cava Mimosa. We thought it was too much like a continental breakfast. Little pastries, chocolate, yogurt, fruit cups. There was caviar (we don't eat caviar) and there was Lox and also some roast beef being carved....otherwise it felt like continental breakfast on steroids. We opted for the choice without the cava Mimosa. Price for two with tax and tip $96. Not exactly a bargain. Parking $35. Depending on your arrival and departure from the hotel I would suggest parking on the street around the hotel and using meters. With a little ingenuity you can bypass the fee. On Sunday we sat poolside (it's a small pool) on the 6th floor and enjoyed watching the 20 somethings that the hotel personnel kept escorting up to the pool area. The signs are explicit that hotel guests only are at the pool, but we noticed that the younger set would be escorted from the lobby by the help and allowed into the pool area, which was packed and had a variety of guests waiting for cabanas and chairs. There is a DJ on Sundays and the music is thumping. This is the same company that owns the Abbey nightclub in West Hollywood and I think they are trying to cultivate an atmostphere at the pool and fill it with young Hollywood wannabees who think it's glamorous to have entree into a swank hotel's pool area for a Sunday DJ party. We had two drinks, thank God. The mojito is just $16 and a Campari $13. With automatic 20% gratuity added and the tax we went back to our room with a $38 bill....for two drinks!!! The Sangria is $50 a pitcher, so imagine with food what kind of bill some guests run up during the day. One of my friends who parties constantly around Beverly Hills suggested that SLS attracts a lot of younger wealthy persian/middle eastern 20 somethings. I thought that was an odd comment, until we got to the pool on Sunday. Same with Bazaar, the later it got the more it felt like a Persian nightclub. And the best part for the hotel is they appeared to be spending, spending, spending. Dinner at Bazaar was wonderful. $55 prix fixe is the way to go. They have several tapas and unless you just want one or two items, it will be far cheaper to order the set tasting menu. Also, we chose to drink tap water over the sparkling or still they try to sell. Most are only $10 a bottle and yes they have quite a selection. Some of the beer is reasonably priced as is iced tea and sodas. Hot tea $8. Here the cocktails are as high as $20 each and the wines can become stratospheric. It is a wonderful wine list with equally wonderful mark-ups from the labels we recognized. The staff was nice and we had no needs. The gym is great. It's got excellent new equipment and I would highly recommend it. Some woman at the pool was carrying on about her spa treatments.....apparently she wasn't impressed, especially when she got her bill. I'm not sure whether she didn't like noises she heard or whether her services just weren't up to her level of desire. So would we stay here again? After all for one night, brunch, prix fixe dinner and two cocktails at the pool we checked out with a nearly $600 bill. NEVER. It wasn't worth it. We've paid more than that on a few occasions previously, but this just didn't cut it. Would I recommend Bazaar? Absolutely.

I do not recommend spending your money here...\u201d", "Author": "mcfeagle", "ReviewID": "UR72095203", "Content": "As a Starwoods Platinum Preferred Guest, I was excited about my upcoming stay at the SLS Hotel in Los Angeles (NOT Beverly Hills, like it is advertised). I had two free nights so I used them for this stay. Lets just say that I wish I would have used my two free nights at another Starwoods Hotel. When I arrived, I was met with a couple of gentlemen who showed me to the front desk and took my bags. That was nice and welcoming. Let me preface the next part this way: Starwoods nicer hotels, such as St. Regis and Westin, usually treat their Platinum Preferred Guests as VIPs and with warmth and hospitality. In addition to this, their Platinum status is stated upon check-in and they are upgraded to available suits or the next level of rooms. However, when I arrived at the SLS, I had to tell them that I was a Platinum Preferred member and no upgrade was given. Usually, when this happens, they say so, this was not done here. I know that I sound a little snobby, but I have spent plenty a penny through Starwoods Hotels and their standards have been set high by other 6 star hotels, so I have come to expect this sort of treatment at their Luxury Collection Hotels. For instance, when I last stayed at the St. Regis Monarch Beach in Dana Point, CA, I was upgraded to an Executive Suite with Butler Service. It was amazing. When I arrived to the room, I was extremely let down. There were stains on the rug and leather window seat. In addition to this, I really looked forward to soaking in a nice bathtub and when I looked into the bathroom, no tub was found. Big Bummer for me. I really desired to take a nice long bath a read a book. You would think that with the amount they charge at the SLS, a bathtub might be included, but apparently you need to book a Double bedded room and not a King to get this extra attribute. I also booked a Spa treatment at their supposed \"renown\" Ciel Spa. I do not recommend spending your money at this Spa. The therapist was nice enough, but sped through the massage. The worst thing about the 60 minutes was that the room my massage was in was situated right next the the steam room. The rooms were not sound proofed and this was apparent--There were two rather loud women in the steam room and we could hear their whole, loud, 30 minute conversation. At one point, their loudness drowned out the relaxing music in our room. This did NOT relax me, but annoyed me as I was supposed to be in a tranquil setting. The women continued to loudly talk in the hallway, ruining my experience. The therapist apologized and stated that this NEVER happened to her before. Well, my $215 felt wasted. The therapist seemed to want tot fly through the rest of the massage because it was finished early. When I entered the lounge area, Ciel seems to not be able to clean up after their guests. Every little couch area had garbage and glasses of other guest's leftover drinks; I ended up having to clean off a space to sit. At that point, I did NOT want to be there anymore and left. Have I stated my warning to NOT spend your money here?? This review is very harsh, but I do firmly believe that at 6 star hotels should have a certain amount of class and standards. The SLS Hotel failed to live up to their own hype. Big letdown; go to the ST. Regis Monarch Beach in Dana Point, CA if you would like a classy, luxurious experience.

To be fair our expectations might have been a bit high as previous to our arrival we stayed at a Shangri-La and St. Regis hotel, which were both simply spectacular and elegant. On our arrival at the SLS we found half eaten food in our bar fridge, jewelery from a previous guest that was left on the furniture and a strange yellowish pee-stain on the floor. We also found that the shower didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drain properly and within minutes nasty murky water was up to our ankles. Although all of these problems were taken care of in due time, that they existed in the first place was really embarrassing for a hotel that prides itself on luxury and refined service. It also set a very negative tone for the rest of our stay What we found most unexceptional about the SLS however, was its staff. Except for the valet guys (who were wonderful) the front desk people were very unprofessional. When we raised our concerns about our room we were bounced back and for the between a bunch of people who were all equally clueless on what to do. One even asked sarcastically if we wanted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153compensation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as if we were somehow being rude in asking them to remove a previous guests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 garbage. In this regard, everything at the SLS was a chore. Even the rustic cabin that we stayed at in Big Sur far surpassed the SLS in customer service and in making our honeymoon experience special. And another thing, if the SLS is going to call itself a luxury hotel here is a little advice\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it is beyond tacky for their servers to tip themselves on the bill and conveniently call it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153service tax.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tips are earned, they are not an entitlement - especially for a party of 2.

There is nothing wrong with the hotel, it is really beautiful and rooms are lovely with comfortable beds and amazing bathrooms. TV is an enormous flat screen and everything is just top class. My only negative comments are the overly expensive extras, that should not be extras in a hotel of this standard. Internet costs 13 dollars per DAY, which is just crazy these days, especially when they make a big deal about lending you a lap top... For the loan of an adapter I was charged 15 (refundable, of course) and breakfast is a massive 25 for the tasty but somewhat small buffet. This to me seems strange when rooms are quite pricy and clientel posh - do I really need to first reserve 500 dollars on my credit card for minibar and then 15 for an adapter? And to me 500 dollars for an overnight stay is way too much money. I also think it's strange not to give any extras at a hotel of this standard. Internet costs as does everything in the room, and I mean e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g. From the small piece of chocolate to the designer dice to the minibar snacks to the schampoo bottles - everything has a price tag. And you do not get anything when you check in, not even a mint on the pillow. When you pay for this standard a complementary fruit basket would be a nice touch. Instead you have a 10 dollar price tag on the bottle of water that looked like a welcoming gift. Unclassy. I stayed in a room with an extra door, I guess it can be opened to make the next door room to a family room. This caused me problems. My neighbour decided to take someone \"home\" for the night and woke me up at 3:30. I thought I had Mary J Blige in my room but soon noticed it was his stereo blasting away. I called about this twice and the second time he kind of got the message. I was able to fall asleep but I do wish they had been more firm.

They should invest in some soundproofed doors. I hate to think what small kids would have been asking mommy would they have stayed in my room.

The rooms are amazingly designed. Period. The Philippe Starck design team has done a wonderful job with the rooms interiors with wonderful accents throughout the room, from the bed's headboard, to the desk. The bathroom's are a work of art. That being said, the rooms are a bit on the dark side, the addition of lamps everywhere breaks some of the sleek modernity of Starck's design. This wouldn't be as much of an issue, but the windows to my room faces a wall. Really, if I wanted to open my window and see a wall, I would've stayed in New York.

As a hotel guest, I agree with other reviewers on some things that aren't great for a business traveler, such as the dim lighting in the rooms. On this trip I had a few issues that have turned me off quite a bit, which is a shame because i want to like this place! I left my room at 7am, returned at 5pm and the room had not been made up. I was deciding whether or not to call and complain/request when there was a knock at the door. The housekeeping staff asked, \"do you want your room cleaned?\". It just seemed really late and half-hearted. I said no thanks. I also noticed that the shelving around the bed was very dusty - looks like it hadn't been properly cleaned in a few weeks. The bathroom sink had a very slow drain, which is a bit unpleasant with those giant sinks. The biggest turnoff, however, was my experience in the bar/restaurant. Was seated (solo) promptly in the practically empty space. It took quite some time for anyone to come over and acknowledge me - first water, then several minutes later a waiter. I ordered a gin & tonic and a salad for dinner. Took way longer than it should have for the drink to arrive, when it did I noticed/commented that it looked fancy and the waiter agreed. I enjoyed my drink and meal and requested the check. $18 for the gin & tonic!!! I was shocked, the waiter wasn't around and I needed to get going, so I paid the bill but on my way out checked with the hostess. I asked if the drink I ordered is considered a \"regular\" gin & tonic (I still had the remainder with me). She replied that no, it was considered their SLS Utlimate drink, which had been noted on the bill. I was explaining that I did not order the special version and that I was surprised at the cost and she replied, \"well, are you enjoying it?\". Please! At that point the waiter came over seeing that I was talking to the hostess and he had some lame explanation that \"most people\" order the ultimate so that's what he got for me, and he offered an apology - but not to refund the difference in price or any other kind of compensation. I should have demanded that but frankly I had an appointment to get to and had to go. Bottom line, I felt taken advantage of, and when I called them on it they didn't handle it well at all.

There is absolutely no \"in room\" sound privacy, if someone is in the bathroom, you hear everything (sorry to be so frank) unfortunately this is a real life design fault. Design vs practicality. 3. The amount of people through the hotel is large and that leads to some unfortunate issues: Concierge was very efficient but not warm, \"Bazar\" restaurant waiters are \"too cool\" and rarely present (getting the bill took 15 minutes+).

If you're looking for a space that will amaze you and create an unforgettable experience from the food to the service to the decor, this is it. I had heard about the SLS becuase of all the press coverage about their recent opening. To be honest, we were nervous they would not have any kinks worked out since they were new on the scene. We were also afraid they may be pretentious, expensive, and difficult to work with becuase they cater to a wealthy celebrity clientelle. But, from the moment we stepped inside, we knew we were wrong. This place was unbelievable, the staff was friendly and warm, and the prices were reasonable. The food, staff, service, decor, location, amenities, and ambiance are all top of the line. The design is chic, modern, hip, and eclectic. It's like you've stepped into another world when the doors open. Not only did the place look amazing, but it didn't cost an arm and a leg to stay there. It was $299 per night for a suite in the summer time. Pretty amazing for a five star hotel. And you don't just get a beautifully appointed room for that price. The Spa is so chic and calming. The staff are friendly and inviting and give you one heck of a manicure. The hotel also has an amazing pool surrounded by giant mirrors and beautiful people. The staff are attentive and accomodating and the atmosphere is upbeat but still super chill. You should not miss it. I'm told there's also a great work-out room, but I was too busy eating, drinking, and being married (pun intended) to notice. Maybe next time. And, let's not forget the food. The food is incredible. I've eaten at every restaurant in the hotel, and the food is amazing no matter where you're sitting. The Bazaar is one of the few four star restaurants in LA. Famed chef Jose Andres runs the joint. If you don't know who he is, Google him. You'll see why the food is something to talk about. The restuarant focuses on small plates, but you can get entree sized portions as well. The menu is creative (fois gras cotton candy) and inventive and is incredibly delicious. They have the best bread in the entire world. I don't know what they do to it, but don't miss out on the tomato bread they make. It's to die for and goes perfectly with a charcuterie and cheese plate. Die. The food at our wedding was equally as amazing as if you're dining directly in the Bazaar. We had an assorment of delicious hot and cold appetizers (including a killer mini kobe beef burger) for the cocktail hour. As a kind gesture, Dana Cohen (the catering manager/wedding/event planner/the best thing that ever happened to LA weddings) also threw in a complimentary caprihina (a popular Brazilian beverage) bar for our guests. At dinner we had a tomato, basil, mozzerella salad that was full of flavor and freshness. Next, our guests dined on ribeye or seabass and ended with a chocolate cake. The wine pairings were also perfect. We also had cookies flown in from an Italian bakery in Brooklyn to accompany the complimentary coffee bar after dinner. And then, ater a few hours of dancing, Dana arranged for our guests to enjoy mini gelato cones. Also complimentary. I'm telling you, they really know how to do it right. They don't miss a beat. The entire staff is kind, patient, helpful, friendly, knowledgeable, professional, and had amazing contacts and recommendations. The hotel is also centrally located. You can be shopping and dining in Hollywood or Beverly Hills in minutes, or you can be at the Santa Monica Pier or Downtown LA in a short 20-30 minute car ride. It's the perfect location. I can't even tell you how happy we were to have our wedding at the SLS. Our friends and family are still talking about what an amazing weekend it was. My husband and I wll definitely be back to the hotel for dinner and we even plan on staying another weekend or two a year.., And, I live in LA.

I did have very good experience with Luxury Collection Hotels, e.g. the Sheraton Grand in Bangkok - so I did have some expectations when I arrived (even I saw some mixed reviews). To be honest, the best thing about the SLS had been LEAVING this spot. The \"cool\" SLS hotel is run by a bunch of unprofessional youngsters who know nothing about \"luxury\" and \"service\". The hotel is very modern and chic, a bit similar to a nice W hotel of SPG. The lobby is very nice and tasteful. When I checked in I got a room which was nothing else as standard, even I've got Platinum status. Only after I complained I got another room which I would also concider \"standard\". Since it took too long until my luggage arrived at my room and I had to leave for business I asked them to take out my jackets and hang them. When I returned hours later I've been informed that my luggage is still in the storage room because they didn't know my room number. Can you imagine??? The rooms are pretty dark - and so are the bathrooms. It's a bit complicated to shave... But the biggest mistake is the shower: you can only switch it on while you're under it. Result: you get all the cold water over you. A joke is the bed. The linen has been too shot and therefore the matress the last 10 inch down at the feet had been bare. Disgusting!!! Even you're Platinum member, there's no free water (only a bottle at $10+), no fruits, no chocolates, nothing. The first day I had a bathrobe but then they took it away. Slippers aren't standard (at a Luxury Collection Hotel) but free only upon special request. I like modern hotels, but as I business traveller I request service, that's why I'm staying at a 5* priced hotel. But the SLS is just below Holiday Inn. Btw - Internet is $ 12.95+.

The desk help was pretentious but upgraded us to a suite as we are Starwood gold members. The room has a contemporary vibe although overdone with too many mirrors. We also didn't like the shared shampoo/soap/lotion bottles. With viruses an issue, who wants to touch bottles strangers have in the shower? There has to be another way to be earth-friendly (how about pump bottles that can have santitized pumps replaced between guests?) Anyway, the restaurant looked fabulous with cozy, private eating areas. However, we chose to eat at nearby Matsuhisa which was a little crowded (sat us at the sushi bar due to \"previous table reservations\" which never materialized) and although delicious with good service, way too expensive ($270 for 3 people?). The hotel beds were fine and we like when hotels stretch design to be fresh and exciting. The rooms just aren't as inviting as they could be as the furnishings are a little stark and uncomfortable (and I love modern--it just needs to be more user-friendly). Finally, we are so tired of the $10 waters in the rooms of so many hotels! If a hotel wants to be environmentally conscious, just have filtered water available for free. It's insulting.

Actually, most staffers at W's are really as friendly as someone at a Homewood Suites (which is probably one of my favourite brands). The SLS is like a W, in fact, but not really a Luxury Collection Hotel...at least during my stay it definitely had a mover/shaker busybody feel, and whether it was due to the crowds, not sure if property could fulfill expectation, regardless, I found most staffers quite genial, but it only takes 1, in this case my check-in host, to make me question who is the guest and who is the staffer - a smile and hello can go a long way vs. a stiff \"may I help you?\" Upon checking me in, with his Twilight inspired demeanor, I asked about internet and was told there was a fee, but after re-stating my status, I was told it didn't really apply, since after double checking it was included in room rate. Outside of the shaky start, most of lukewarm reception was due to room design. An odd club-inspired bathroom Most of my other complaints are around the area of getting prepared for the day (or the night) depending on activity. The bathrooms are dark and counter space is limited, almost non-existent due to the kitchen-sized sink in the bathroom. Mirrors abound (even in the shower) so you should be comfortable with your body at all times (even while in the shower). The shower was a bit awkward, at first inspired looking drainage system, but as I showered as the water failed to move down the drawn, I found myself standing in a puddle of water (never fun in any shower). The shower door did not create a watertight seal, so a little water sprayed out through the sides. Oh and lastly I don't understand the concept of shared toiletries -green indeed, but 1) they didn't seem special and 2) how many people have used this bottle of shampoo? Thankfully I travel with usually travel with my own anyway. After the bath, it was time for wardrobe, and well, I was surprised to find a mini iron board available...unfortunately my gnome did not join me on his trip, so I did encounter some challenges with ironing (and once again find a plug for the iron). When you finally did make it out, most of it was good, enjoyed the restaurant immensely, always enjoy roof pools (though 1 was more ornamental than purposeful) and a scene it was (but fully expected), fitness center was phenomenal and the house car and driver were distinguished. Final Outcome That said, it still feels a amalgamation of a lounge and a hotel where style did trump substance and experience (at least from a hotel development standpoint). A very cool hotel, with very posh notes but almost seeming designed by someone who is better tailored for other areas of hospitality or Vegas. True luxury? No. Fun? Sorta. Stay again?

My girlfriend flew in from New York for 4 days so this trip was work/pleasure. We were excited to stay at the SLS in Beverly HIlls, it was even on Entourage. I arrived on a Thursday night and could not pull into the entrance of the hotel. The driveway was packed with Ferrari's, Bentleys, and Roll Royce's. The entrance is small and impractical. There is no self parking, only valet ( $35 a night). The valet attendants are decent, and if you call down ahead of time they have your car waiting with a bottle of water in ti. The hotel is located on La Cienega in Beverly hills about .3 miles from WIlshire Blvd and two miles from Rodeo Drive. There is a lot of traffic to get to the hotel and it is tough to get in the small entrance coming from either direction. I was not a fan of the location. The room was ultra-modern with sliding mirror doors in the bathroom and plasma tv behind a mirror. The king bed was floating in the center of the room with a desk behind it. There was not enough room to sit in the chair at the desk comfortably. The room had interesting lighting and a terrace, but overall was too small. It was clean, nice but small. The bathroom was nice and had a large shower with great water pressure. There is no bath tub. The hotel provides full size shampoo, conditioner, face wash etc which is nice. I liked the bath products. The beds are comfortable as well. The hotel has very nice fitness center with all new modern equipment. There are treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, and stair machines. There are also dumbells up to 50 lbs and machines. Water and towels are provided. All the aerobic machines have tvs in them. The rooftop pool is nice. It has a great view. The regular pool is heated ,but the salt water pool isnt. The lounge chairs are comfortable and there are cabanas. Food and drinks can be ordwered but during the week take time. The concierge services were helpful. The hotel has a fleet of cars that can drive you around the area.

While it's not the full compliment that you will find in the restaurant, it's a nice selection-and for room service, it kicks a**.

It not only reflects the quality of the kitchen, but moreover a synergy of executing the experience and getting it to the guest (me). This \"synergy\" is not a foregone conclusion and should be expected at properties at a level as the SLS and they deliver where many hotels fail in this seemingly minor detail. Then the California factor, there are some \"colorful\" individuals here-including the sometimes less than savory behavior of its guests for which it is not responsible. But certain well heeled guests can dress in what I view as non-standard for a luxury resort, but it's California hey.........but when an eccentric old man leads you to a seat and 20 minutes later no hostess comes to check on you, one can wonder if in fact he's not part of the colorful if not useful background-it crosses borders-but as a SPG Platinum customer at an excellent restaurant-how do you take ownership of \"vibe\"......this is a challenge. But sacrificing on service is a bad approach as I found this to be much as leaving condiments that may accompany burgers and such (e.g. mayo) off the menu is a pointless error-it's easy to do right.

I have to say that I was totally impressed with the SLS. To me, it is a luxury hotel that has no trouble making fun of it's luxury moniker. My room was very nice. I loved that bed and the TV in the mirror. I loved the bathroom. Yes, it's dark, but I had no problem with that. There was a lighted makeup mirror on the table to help out. I really wish I could take that whole room and transplant it into my house - it's what I'd like as my master suite at home! I was treated like a celebrity by all staff I encountered, from the valets who graciously took my red rental Ford from me and didn't make me feel like a commoner, to the front desk who greeted me and acknowledged my SPG status. They even asked if I would like a late checkout, which I was going to ask for (it's usually like pulling teeth to get a late c/o). I really enjoyed the outdoor lounge at the guest entrance - comfy chairs to sit and watch the people coming and going. The location of the SLS was just fine for me. I got to walk over to Beverly Center for some shopping (boy has that mall changed for the better!!). It was a short drive up to Hollywood to meet up with some friends and eat a Roscoe's.

My friends and I had never been to LA before and since our friend recently moved there and was getting married we figured it would be a great opportunity for a bachelor party. Upon arrival we were greeted by numerous staff at Valet Parking, the main door, and the front desk. Checking in was a breeze and we entered our room to find simple yet tasteful and modern decor. We got cleaned up and headed down to Tres where the bartender took good care of us and even took back a drink I wasn't satisfied with and made it right, no problem! 5 cocktails later we wandered over to Bazaar where the concierge was supposed to have made a reservation for our party. Unfortunately they didn't have our name on the list (tsk tsk Casey, I even confirmed before flying in with your colleague...) Fortunately Thierry, a gracious french host, consulted briefly with Joey the dashing Italian manager and had us seated very quickly. The night took off from there and we left hammered, full of food and memories from a wonderful night. Thanks go to Andrew, our server, as he had his hands full with us! The next day while the amateurs slept off the hangover I went for breakfast around the corner and came back to the SLS to enjoy the weather and pool. WOW! It was wonderful! The service was great as were the surroundings and I had a great time meeting new people poolside! When I returned to the room the friendly housekeeping staff asked if we would like more time and we said yes :) The afternoon was spent at the beach and the evening at a local nightclub. Sunday we checked out no problem and jetted away back home with many fond memories of LA and particularly the SLS! The beds were simply divine in my opinion. I slept as good as I did at home. The rooms were roomy enough and the bathrooms were fantastic. Loved the shower! Temperature controls in the room were great and very responsive. Too hot? Turn it down and within a minute or two it's where you want it to be. Staff? All very friendly and attentive. No complaints and we had a nice time chatting with quite a few employees who as it were double duty in the Hotel/Resto/Pool etc. One was even a trained opera singer and serenaded us at the end of the night Friday! A real southern belle from Alabama and a looker to boot :) Intangibles? Well, let's just say this Hotel was featured in Entourage...Lots of beautiful, friendly people from all over and we all enjoyed socializing at Bazaar.

The hotel definitely makes a good first impression. The service was quite professional, and despite looking a tad grungy after our day at Universal Studios, and despite coming in on a \"free\" night, I was made to feel like an honored Gold SPG guest. I was told that instead of the handicapped room the SPG phone rep said I would have to settle for, I would get an upgraded room on the top (7th) floor, and my internet and room water would be complimentary as an SPG Gold guest. I did not at all get this courtesy when I checked in for my free night at the Niagara Falls' Sheraton Fallsview hotel. I have one more free night pending at the Zuerich Sheraton, and we'll see. The hotel is immaculately clean and well-maintained, albeit pretty dark everywhere, including the rooms, as many have commented before. Every floor has a pool table, although one has to go to the front desk to get the equipment, and I suspect they're mostly for show. Most floors also have \"portraits\" which morph from men to apes or monkeys. I had a reasonable Hollywood Hills view from my room. The rooms are visually striking. There are multiple etched-glass drinking glasses of various colors in the room, as well as full-sized bottles of multiple soaps (body, face, hand, etc.). While some people commented on getting sprayed on when turning on the shower, it is actually possible to direct the flow to the opposite wall. The \"mini-bar\" is actually a full bar with full-sized bottles of fairly premium liquor, such as Patron tequila, and Russian Standard vodka. No prices were marked, and I assumed this to be a case of \"If you have to ask you can't afford it.\" As others have pointed out, the lighting is rather poor, and one of the weaknesses of the room. Another was the hard-cornered metal framing under the mattresses. I bumped my shins on it. I thought I was just being clumsy, perhaps, but my partner did the same thing, so this is one of the instances of \"form over function.\" Another example of \"form over function\" was exemplified by the pools. One of the pools is literally only 1 foot deep (30 cm), and the other 3' 6\" (a bit over a meter). If I were paying over $300/night for a room, I think I'd want a pool one could actually swim in. The gym, on the other hand, is possibly the largest hotel gym I've ever seen, certainly for a hotel of such modest size. The business center, too, is very adequate for the hotel's size. Unlike some hotels which have 2 or 3 terminals, this hotel has a whole array for guests' use. This is one of the most unusual hotel's I've ever stayed in. It's one of the most visually interesting, albeit perhaps not one of the most functional hotels in which I've stayed. I can see why some love it and some hate it.

We travel frequently, and have stayed at beautiful hotels in Australia, Asia and Europe- thus we KNOW what constitutes good service and that is where this hotel fails miserably. 1. We called ahead to see when our room would be ready for our arrival. We were still jetlagged from a long flight from Sydney, Australia, so we were looking forward to relaxing in a lovely hotel room. We were told 3pm. We arrived at 3pm only to be informed that the room wasn't ready, and we could go up to the pool deck and wait. Up we went. It was absolutely stinking hot up there. Shade is extremely limited, as is service. The waitstaff were very young and seemingly lacking the knowledge of how to properly look after guests. We sat and waited and waited and waited. In the heat. With a small boy. My husband ended up finally getting a young guy to take our order for a drink. And we waited and waited and waited some more. Finally the drinks came, and rather small and stingy they were. Anyway, we ended up waiting for our room until it was almost 5pm by which time we were completely fed up and wondering if we should simply go to another hotel. As we were leaving to finally go to our room, we were presented with a bill for $65 for our drinks. We thought this was a bit rich, and asked for this to be taken off the bill when we checked out 2 days later. If this hotel is going to be so slow in ensuring rooms are ready by a given time, then herd unwitting guests onto the steaming hot pool deck- of course management should show a bit of goodwill and at least offer a couple of complimentary drinks! 2. The rooms are ridiculously dark. 3. The only possible way to get food in this hotel is to order to your room. The restaurant is either fully booked or shut. We tried to get some tapas in the restaurant one afternoon, and were shown to a table. No one came back to take our order. It was absolutely incredible. I've NEVER seen anything as inept as the service in this hotel!! We waited and waited and waited. The waiter didn't return, so we left. Funny thing was, as we left the waiter was hovering about at the door and asked \"Going already?\" (really surprised) and we responded with \"Yes- why would we hang around when you're clearly not going to serve us??\" So stupid, it's almost funny. 4. I really resented the message on every bill I signed for room service\" \"For your convenience we have added an 18% gratuity to your bill\"... or something similiar. Where does this place get off helping themselves to MORE of your hard-earned money??? Then we really didn't want to tip the staff bringing the food to our room. One guy threw a mini-tantrum and snatched the bill folder from my husband's hand and knocked my coffee over when it became clear he wasn't going to get a tip. I'd like to give this hotel a TIP: TIPS ARE MEANT TO BE GIVEN IN GRATITUDE FOR GOOD, PROFESSIONAL SERVICE. THIS HOTEL DOES NOT OFFER THIS. The few positives about this hotel would be: 1. The linen on the bed is lovely. The beds are extremely comfortable. Mmmmm... I can't actually think of any other positive aspect of this hotel. I have certainly told friends and family to avoid staying here. Go somewhere a bit more traditional.

On the negative, the hotel \"concept\" was definitely a case of design over functionality - as with the Hudson in New York, guests should be provided with a flash-light/torch to navigate this hotel as lighting does not appear to be top of Phillippe Starck's priority list and why would anyone place a pool table in a communal area on each and every floor unless hotel management was actively encouraging its guests to stay up all night - in which case, this was an unnecessary step as the noise from the lobby party-bar was more than sufficient.

So, as for the hotel... simply amazing. Here are bullet points about the stay: (1) There is something in the air here at this hotel, where you just know you are part of a very special hotel. Hard to describe other than a very positive vibe; (2) The staff is incredibly friendly. Before we dined at Bizarre, Lucas Paya took the time to put together his recommended menu for the evening for us!! And, he picked some dishes we would have never selected and they were incredible - such as traditional and modern olives, the \"Philly Cheesesteak\", the \"hanger steak\" - our favorite dish from the (9) items we ate in all! We did not get to the dish made with cotton candy - we are saving it to come back next month with the kids!! The staff at the pool was super friendly as well - not to mention the room service staff. And, of course, Peggy, who truly felt bad that she could not do any better for us (roon wise) on our special night and told us to speak to her directly before setting up our next visit (can't wait); (3) The restaurant - \"Bizarre\" - I believe one of only 2 restaurants in LA that has received a \"five star\" rating from the LA Times(??) or something like that - and we quickly found out why! If you want an incredible experience in dining - don't miss this restaurant! We ordered (9) items in all and with tax, tip, drinks and all included our bill was under $140 - not cheap, but certainly not expenisve by any \"LA\" measure; (4) The room was clean, great bed, TV that is part of the mirrored wall, large bottles of shampoo, etc., access to nice pool tables on every floor; (5) good location - an easy 1 block walk to the Beverly Center mall, a Mortons right next door, easy access to all the local attractions; (5) Nightlife inside the hotel - WOW.

We wanted a base from which we could reexplore such shopping/dining areas as: the Beverly Center, The Grove/Farmer's Market, Third St., Robertson Blvd., Melrose Ave., La Cienega Blvd., and Beverly Blvd. The choice came down to the SLS and the Sofitel; the new Montage Beverly Hills was enticing but too far west. We opted for the SLS because it is newer, a Starwood Luxury Collection property, nightlife guru Sam Nazarian's first hotel, and home to The Bazaar by Jose Andres, only the second restaurant to ever receive the highest four star rating from the Los Angeles Times (the first, Bastide, is now closed). Monkeys are the SLS's mascots because, a front desk staffer told me, they are \"fun, yet sophisticated\", which is the hotel's aim. Designed by Philippe Starck with typical whimsy, humour and modern style (sometimes at the expense of practicality or function), the hotel also tries to provide a high level of service. For the most part, it succeeds. The staff is young, friendly and largely professional, but certainly less formal than at a Peninsula or Four Seasons. On weekends, there are lots of young partying beautiful guests usurping the pool and restaurant/bar, causing commotion in the hallways and rooms (think HBO's \"Entourage\"), but come Sunday, the place settles down. There are separate entrances to The Bazaar and hotel, which has its own quiet restaurant, Tres. The hotel's lobby lounge is actually outdoors. Typical Starck touches abound--mismatched furniture everywhere, long tall communal tables in the restaurants, mismatched glassware in the rooms, all varieties of chandeliers and huge mirrors. The front desk area is dark. The meeting rooms are named after famous monkeys. A room key is needed to ascend any elevator. Each floor has a pool table with a silver floor lamp shaped like a rifle. Throughout the lobby and restaurant are myriads of shelves filled with books and tchotchkes--a housekeeping nightmare! THE ROOM. I had reserved a veranda room, but the very accommodating receptionist quickly upgraded me to a Signature Suite with terrace when no veranda rooms were available. It was large and so very chic. The terrace rooms all seem to be on the 2nd floor with the terraces exiting onto 3 different garden courtyards. As mentioned in numerous prior reviews, the rooms are dark, with many tinted, almost useless reflective smudgeable surfaces/mirrors (even in the shower)--another housekeeping nightmare--I was compelled to leave a larger than usual tip out of sympathy. The desk lamp looks hand-blown but is insufficient. I'm sure the floor lamp styled like a tree trunk and the lighted makeup mirror in the bath were added in response to guest comments about darkness. The sofas and chairs in the living area were chic but not cushy/comfy/plush. There were several design elements that did not seem durable: the white upholstery was stained, the handles on the heavy mirrored sliding doors to the bath were loose, the leather pulls used to open the unique closet doors were frayed and weakened. The large safe is situated too high. To encourage a festive atmosphere, the minibar is very amusing and complete--large bottles of booze plus interesting mixers, a martini shaker, 2 bins of treats labeled Saints and Sinner. The bed was queen size, low (to fit into the sleek custom headboard/nightstands), not quite Westin Heavenly. The terrace showed evidence of past revelry and lack of maintenance--many cigarette butts on the ground, a cigarette burn in the sofa. The shrubs by the wall were dead (hopefully not from urine), but the bamboo was alive and the potted Meyer lemon trees were bearing fruit. There are W Hotel-like catchphrases all over, some of them \"SLS\", like \"Scribble Little Secrets\" on the pen, \"Society's Latest Scandals\" on the newspaper bag. In the bath, several common items were forsaken for style--no wall towel racks (just 2 stylish hooks), no bars of soap, no soap dish, no luggage rack. There were, however, huge Costco-sized bottles of hand, face and body washes, plus body lotion, shampoo and conditioner. The guest directory will tell you these are green because they are refillable. I asked the housekeeper if people take them like they do the usual mini-sized ones--she said yes, so we did. The shower is slate, mirrored, huge, with a concealed drain. I found the towels a bit small and thin, though they are custom made by D. Porthault for SLS/Starck. We could hear others guests through the bathroom vent. The guest directory makes for a fun read, is titled the \"SLS Illustrated Dictionary of Services\" and includes such listings as \" 'Tight Buns'--see personal fitness training\" and \" 'zzzzz'--see linens, mattress and bedding\". THE RESTAURANTS. Dined Sunday evening at The Bazaar. We had peeked in on Saturday night--the place was teeming with foodies and revelers, the noise deafening. Sunday was much calmer (the NBA finals, which the LA Lakers clinched on this night, probably contributed). All four venues--Rojo, Blanco, Bar Centro and the Patisserie were accessible. There is an outdoor terrace, but it faces the valet drop-off area. Apparently about $22 million was put into The Bazaar alone. I was expecting a molecular gastronomy experience along the lines of Alinea or Moto in Chicago, where a meal is a 3-5 hour, sometimes solemn affair. But The Bazaar is different--tapas (traditional and modern) with some molecular gastronomy elements like liquid nitrogen, trompe l'oeil presentations, specific instructions on how to eat a particular dish correctly. Very theatrical and playful, but serious and delicious. And fast--we were done with the tasting menu, presented in \"waves\" rather than one dish at a time, in under 2 hours. I was a bit disappointed that the tasting menu was simply dishes off the regular menu yet cost a bit more than if ordered a la carte. The food is much better than it has to be--this place would be popular even without the foodies and four star review, and it meshes so well in atmosphere with the hotel. Apparently, there is a \"fine dining\" restaurant within the restaurant (it is mentioned on the website) that serves a set tasting menu 3 nights a week. There is an outpost of Moss, the great New York Soho design store, here. Hotel guests also apparently have special access to Nazarian's other restaurants/clubs/lounges. The other restaurant, Tres, is a quiet retreat, never crowded. The menu was quite similar to the room service menu, with some prices identical as well. Tried the continental breakfast buffet one morning and it was fine, included cheeses, chacuterie and aguas frescas. THE POOL. Located on the 6th floor. Reminiscent of the pool at the Starck-designed Mondrian Hotel. Quite See and Be Seen on the weekend, with the pools, one no more that a foot deep, secondary to the cabanas, lounge chairs/beds, and restaurant, named Altitude. The fitness center on the 2nd floor is large and well -equipped. Did not try the adjacent spa. The business center charges for internet use. Overall a fun, relaxing stay. We were able to walk or bike to all target areas, with the Grove being the furthest (1.2 miles) away. It doesn't seem too business oriented (except probably show business), nor too kid friendly. It is a decent value, especially compared to the luxury hotels in Beverly Hills proper (SLS is one block away from BH), though perhaps not quite as pampering an experience. Would definitely stay here again, and in fact plan to do so. Kudos to management for reading TA reviews and responding to each individually. This is especially important since a guest comment card is not offered, although I did receive a thank-you email from the hotel afterward, and there was a link for comments.", "Date": "June 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Every Where", "Title": "\u201cthe good, the bad, and the grumpy ;-)\u201d", "Author": "aceexec", "ReviewID": "UR31537991", "Content": "we're all staying at the SLS HOTEL in LA (previously Meridian) it's very \"hip & cool\" ! My company picked this hotel for us all due to 'connection' but I'm finding it REALLY hard to relax here. This trip, I'm in LA for TWO weeks and this Hotel is not doing it for me. I would have checked out by now but unfortunately the rest of my group arrive in a couple of days and they have pre-booked this place also, so i'll stay and try to get into this 'vibe' ;-) Currently, i am here alone but in a few days friends (with their kids) arrive! I was booked to have a Signature suite but upon arrival i was told the room did not have a bathtub (I'm a water babe and need the tub to relax!) so i'm down graded to studio suite This room is almost HALF the size of Sig Suite ;-( and being here for a two week stay i was hoping to have 'some space' (i previously stayed in a deluxe room for one night, hence knowing to book a larger room this stay. i wish their website gave room size/ lay out) It was slightly irritating that just two days prior to my arrival i was told it wasn't a problem having a big tub suite, that maybe I'd have to move rooms for one or two nights, which i said i agreed to, yet upon my arrival, i was told the ONLY suite with a bath tub was now booked the whole time i was here! aaaahhhhhhhhh! anyway, as i'm here, i decided to write my own little 'review' as i'm always utilizing 'trip advisor' and want to give something back. please NOTE, what i have written in this column is a 'how i personally feel' not a reflection on the Hotel chain terms+conditions ; this place is not kid friendly nor practical (watch this space, i'll let you know how the kids get on here once they arrive!).... but here is an 'honest' review from me of the experience so far- fyi P.S. stands for Philippe Starck, the Hotel designer. i have tried to be positive for every negative statement made (just the kinda girl i am he he ). 1, no bath in 98% of rooms (it's ok, if yr only here for a night but any longer and can be a pain!) 1a, beautiful designer large bath tub - if u can get it! (only a handful in the rooms in Hotel, and then, only in rooms with two twin beds, not KING bed rooms....)If you do manage to secure one, it's heavenly.... 2, in the standard shower cubicles (not rooms with bath!) shower has one angled head which is so high up that yr hair gets wet ALWAYS regardless if you wanted to wash yr hair or not! Also have to walk and stand IN shower to turn it on (getting splashed in cold water until it heats up) Bring shower cap as not supplied! 2a, shower cubicles HUGE -could put a bath in here hint hint ha ha ;-) or get up to mischief in this space he he 3, safe is on TOP shelf in wardrobe, so you need a chair to access it (unless yr a basketball player!) 3a, safe big enough to put a laptop 4, wardrobes so small that if you stay any longer than 3 days yr screwed 4a, pretty pictures on wardrobe doors (VERY signature P.S. design) 5, no drawers to stash underwear etc! 5a, nice shelves with martini makers and drinks cabinet 6a, hangers in wardrobe are beautiful but HUGE, more than 5 and no more room for clothes! 7, restaurant ALWAYS fully booked in hotel (even as in-house guest i cant get a table till 10pm+ and that's a booking for a Thursday night- trying to book for 3 days in advance!) so unless you pre-booked weeks in advance, go find somewhere else to eat. 7a, Bazar restaurant really nice, try getting a booking MAKE IN ADVANCE or hang out for a drink at the 'be seen' bar instead ;-) or have afternoon tea here at the chocolate counter, VERY yummy! I actually really like this concept, though i worry the kids will knock over the statues etc surrounding the place inside - even i got conscience of knocking anything! 8, hotel rooms are VERY dark! (EVERYONE complains about this) they have had to give me extra standing lamps just to do work on my laptop. it's also quite a challenge putting on makeup, not sure if i'm looking like a Vegas Show girl going out ;-) 8a, upside to this is it's romantic (?) 9, paper thin walls. i could hear my neighbor unzipping their suitcase and talking in the morning 9a, guess the upside is security can hear anything and help if need be ....(i heard them walking around and talking on their walkie talkie last night) 10, not enough 'table top' area in room or bathroom to put laptop, mobile phone etc (let alone make up, wash bag etc etc ) 10a, the Starckness makes the room appear bigger ;-) 11, teething problems with 'housekeeping' so far both days i left the note on bed and towels on floor to be changed, yet i was given the same linens just folded ;-( 11a, they really are trying very hard to improve and welcome the call to fix the issues. 12, personally, i like a coffee / tea maker in my rooom, there isnt one here 12a, as i had some issues upon check-in, the very very sweet man at the front of house, who showed me to my room, brought a coffee maker to my room for my personal use *this i'm most grateful for* 13, my simple breakfast order arrived wrong. I ordered green tea with soy milk on the side, got Earl gray tea with regular milk (and the hot water smelt of coffee.....word to mgmt, use different pots for tea and coffee pls!) 14, the pool is not a 'swimming pool' but 'be seen' dipping pool. i'm just a little to self conscience i guess. 14a, upside, it is VERY beautifully designed and modern. great views on a clear day as it's on the roof top. i also, enjoy eating at the restaurant by it, grabbing a simple sandwich. 15, concierge are a little all over the place. messages never get followed up if the person is not around i.e. if you asked one member of staff to book something, then ONLY liaise with THAT member as it seems to get 'lost' in the system. (heavy tipping still doesnt help!) 15a, ......eh, they look cute at their door table. Actually, Casey (one of the staff) was very sweet and gave our group a complimentary drink while we waited for him to make a restaurant booking for us *Bazar was full so we had to go elswwhere, admittedly, it was a Friday night last minute booking after all* 16, the spa - it was FREEZING! which made me quite tense and i caught a slight chill from it ;-( the 'wet room' faces the waiting room so you hear people coming in and out constantly (the jingle of their locker keys and hum of conversation) 16a, even with all that, i had a truly awesome experience and would definately go back (even as an outside guest!) the girl doing the treatment was exceptional, she put heat packs to warm me up and did a fantastic job of the treatment. It was over and above service expected. i highly recommend this! i have to say overall STAFF is the greatest thing about this whole Hotel experience! *well done!* They are All very attentative are SO very sweet and are really really trying hard to be accommodating (one guy in particular is worth his weight in gold as a staff member here! always smiling and going above and beyond the call of duty, trying to rectify things and make the guests experience an enjoyable one! thank you!!!! *sorry if i seemed to have been snappy at you*) In all honesty, it's just the way the hotel has been designed it's not user friendly. nice to look at, not so nice to stay at! Philippe Starck should stick to make his beautifuly pretty pieces of furniture and other items and leave room / interior design to others (unless he has LOADS of space to put his beautiful designs, as unfortunately, they dont seem to work on a practical, every day level) ahhhhhh.... i HAVE to try liking this hotel (i am SO trying to be *cool & Hip* ha ha, i must, i must, but not sure i'd stay here again if my trip is any longer than 3 days (unless i manage to secure a bathtub Signature suite!!) hope this review helps you make up your own mind? happy travelling!", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cNovelty vs. Quality\u201d", "Author": "JACAtlanta", "ReviewID": "UR30839344", "Content": "While the SLS hotel is striking in it's design, it isn't always functional.

They had sent him a 'founder member' card for the SLS, so thought we would give it a go. Normally stay at the 4 Seasons, but as the pool was closed for maintenance work, we decided to try the SLS - Big mistake! Had booked for a week but left after a couple of days. The hotel is a triumph of style over practicality and substance, everything is designed to death. First the positve stuff: Stayed in a 'Signature Suite', which was large, stylish and comfortable. Now the not so good: Check in took 20 minutes, they had one person on the check in desk and a line of about 10 people waiting to check in/out. Needless to say the room wasn't ready and was not ready for over an hour after the time they said it would be. Pool area really looks attractive, but it doesn't work well - no shade, unless you buy a Cabana, which don't come with sun lounging chairs. Also no shade in the Cafe by the pool which is very odd - particularly when it was 95F. We took breakfast in the lobby area one morning - strangest buffet breakfast ever. They put three of everything on the counter...three croissant, three glasses of fruit salad, three parfait's and a plate with a few bits of ham on it - very weird. Once a couple of guests have been to the buffet, there is nothing left on the counter and they were very slow at replenishing it. Looks lovely, but just doesn't work. The next day we had breakfast in the room, which was fine apart from the fact that the coffee came in a couple of French Presses, that leaked and the coffee was cold. Overall the staff were a bunch of young kids, who were generally disinterested. Not the professional hotel staff you would expect at a top quality hotel and not in the same league as the staff and service of the Four Seasons.

When we arrived I had a pretty good idea of what was to come ... there was a Porsche, a McLaren and an Aston Martin parked out front (among other high end and six-figure vehicles). The restaurant / bar next door (Bazaar) was already bumping and overflowing at 8p - it was full of packs of cougars, celebrities, gawkers and industry people. Bring your glamour gear - everyone is dressed to the nines. And don't expect a quiet stay. If you are interested in celebrity spottings, this is definitely a place for you ... over the course of my short stay, I saw Alton Brown, Keenan Ivory and Marlon Wayans and Brittany Daniel among others I couldn't place names to faces. About the room - another reviewer said it best: overpriced Aloft decor. Spot on! There are some very quirky pieces, which make the room interesting and edgy (but it hardly warrants the cost). I have to admit, the bed and robe were exquisite. The minibar had some different selections and a lot of booze and mixers. This is a party spot!! The bathroom has a sliding mirror / door that opens the bedroom and bathroom, which make it feel a bit more open. In fact, nearly the entire room was mirrored, so it feels much bigger than it really is. Despite all of the mirrors, it is difficult to apply makeup and do hair because of the extremely poor lighting. I had every light on in the room and even opened the drapery to let sunshine in and couldn't get enough light (it was a gorgeous day outside but the walled in patio blocked the light from entering. Overall, not impressed. Certainly not worth the cost - even if you're a luxury traveler. About the restaurant, Bazaar - the place is packed. Even though you're a hotel guest, expect to wait 3+ hours for a table. The bar has wonderful tapas and appetizers (pricey though!!) but don't expect to get a table here either without bottle service. We ate at the bar (my colleagues had befriended a server, who slipped us into a table) and the food was tasty. I highly recommend the kobe beef \"philly cheesestakes,\" which are like butter. Literally, they melt in your mouth. Also, the magical mojitos are wonderful (and dangerous). A cocktail glass is brought over full of cotton candy and the drink is poured over it (dissolving the confection entirely). FYI - lots of drugs happening in the bathroom (don't be surprised). About the room service - arrived promptly, but was cold and overcooked!! Very disappointing. Also, very limited menu. About service - SNOBBY SNOBBY SNOBBY! I had some slight issues with my reservation, which I had booked through my employer's travel agency of record. The desk made it a point to belittle me for using a travel agency to other folks checking in - really?? Not appropriate. The irony is I normally don't use the agency; I just happened to get an exceptionally great rate for my last minute trip. When I had issues connecting to the WiFi, I had to call three different folks to get it situated. And, upon checking out, I was told my revised receipt would be emailed to me. I had the front desk repeat back my email address and assure me it would be sent in just a few hours. Three days later, it still hasn't arrived. I called and was told my email was never on file.

Very very crowded with the LA set every night. - Maid service: 2 times out of my 10 nights I received no maid service - Noise: lots of partyers stay at this hotel.

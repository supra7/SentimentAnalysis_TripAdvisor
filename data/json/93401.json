We were shopping, eating and sightseeing hard all weekend, so didn't spend much time in the room. Perfect for our purposes.

We was very pleasantly surprised when we got there. Although the room is small, especially the bathroom, it was well-decorated and clean. We had a king-sized bed which was very comfortable. We didn't have the best room in the house by any means. We had no view from the window except for another building directly across the courtyard. However, the hotel itself was well-maintained and had a lot of character. The original ceilings in the lobby had just been repainted and looked terrific. There was a small sitting area in the lobby with decent furniture. They were renovating the breakfast room to make it larger. Breakfast was the usual Comfort Inn fare. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is practically at the corner of 25th Street and Broadway. Only two minutes at most to the subway and the subway line took you either all the way up to Central Park or all the way down to the Battery without having to change trains. Very convenient. The hotel is only 5 minutes away from Macy's and the Empire State Building and a 15 minute walk at most to Times Square. All-in-all a very well-located, convenient place to stay in New York. There were a number of restaurants nearby. We ate at a place called Rogues on 6th Avenue which was reasonably priced and had good food. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a more reasonable place to stay in New York. Times Square hotels are so expensive!

I was put off first of all by the make shift ramp right in the middle of the steps leading into the hotel. I understand the need to handicapped accessibility but this was a hazard to persons without a challenge to walk. Checked in without any problems, and was given room 705. I realized quickly that the hotel elevator(s) were slow and non-responsive and it was easier to take the steps, which I did. The elevator, when I did use it was more like a broom closet and hot! When I got off the elevator, I was met with a vacuum cleaner and a huge garbage bag full of trash. I litterally had to step over them and move the vacuum. I winded my way to Room 705 which was in the back of the hotel which was quiet, thankfully. Two double beds in a very small room and a regular bathroom. The trouble started when I tried to take a shower. NO HOT WATER. I was in a hurry to meet people for dinner, so hurriedly took a wash cloth but informed the front desk that the hot water did not work in my room. The woman at the front desk replied to my concern with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No one else has complained.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd! Are you kidding me? I told them I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go with the maintenance person at that time, but would check with them when I returned. When I returned, I used my key card and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work, so down the steps I go to the front desk. They gave me a new key card and told me that my hot water problem was fixed. Back up to the room I go, start the shower, get ready and low and behold, NO HOT WATER. The only thing hot in that room was me!!!! I called the front desk and they sent some up, and long story short, I moved to another room directly next door. But this time, I knew I would only be staying one night. I checked out of the Comfort Inn Chelsea that next morning and went back to the W Hotel Union Square! This is what I get for trying to save a little bit of cash. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind 1) Slow and non-working elevators 2) No hot water, or a chance of 3) Rude check in and checkout people 4) Your concerns not being met 5) No wireless working (and you must pay when it does work) Then definitely stay at this hotel. The hotel itself is conveniently located on 25th Street right off of Broadway, and the N Q and R Uptown and downtown trains are a block or 2 away which is nice.

There was a weekend market in the church parking lot with antiques and vintage items to peruse through and a 24-hour CVS right down the block.

So to expect an extravagantly sized hotel room in Manhattan - especially at an affordable price - is an extremely tall and rather unrealistic order. That being said, I stayed at the Comfort Inn Chelsea recently with a friend. This hotel has a great location - right in the heart of Chelsea. Very walkable to many points of interest. It was an unexpected treat that there were several regular weekend flea markets that are held within walking distance of the hotel. I found it a plus that the hotel was located on a block of 25th St. that was not too noisy. Despite that, I felt safe walking around the hotel in the wee hours of the night / morning. Anyway, the building is old, strikes me as pre-war era but appears to be decently maintained. The lobby is rather small but the hotel makes up for that with their friendly staff. They have a business center on the 1st floor as well which offer internet access. Admittedly, the hotel rooms are on the smaller side. However, they were clean and well maintained. We were able to find a room with 2 beds for approximately $160 for a Saturday evening in NYC - a deal which is simply hard to beat in midtown Manhattan. The bathroom was pretty modern though the bedroom decor seemed to be a bit dated. They did not have a flat screen in the room, rather an older television set with cable. I do have to reiterate that these are all minor details compared to the fact that the room was CLEAN. Especially in a place like NYC where there is so much to see and so much to do, you'll likely just need a place where you can lay your head down at night.

They always had time to give us directions and information and help in or out of the hotel. It was like staying with family.

My relatives stopped by before we went out, and they live on a noisy NYC street. They made the claim that they couldn't sleep in our room because it was too quiet! I used frequent stay points for 3 nights for Halloween and the NYC Marathon, and I was given the top floor (11th floor) in the back (quieter than street noise). The room is bigger than any other NYC room I have ever had, and there was plenty of room for both of us to walk around and live comfortably for the 4 days, 3 nights. The room I got has a seating area with a full-sized pullout couch, a small closet, refrigerator, coffee maker, safe, desk, ironing board and iron. In the sleeping portion had 2 double beds, a night stand and cable TV. The beds had good sheets and were comfortable for me. The bathroom is small, but it has a full sized tub and shower. There was plenty of soap, shampoo, conditioner, and moisturizer for us, and 4 sets of towels. The windows open in the bathroom and bedroom in this hotel, so it was nice to get air in the room, and air out the bathroom after a shower. There is free wifi in the room, and there is an hardwire internet cord if you don't have wifi on your computer. There is a business center on the 1st floor, and there is a minimum $3 charge to use the computer and printer (we printed out tickets to the Empire State Bld). There is only one ice vending machine on the 1st floor. There are 2 well maintained elevators in the building, but they are slow, so going and getting ice from the 11th floor took a while. So, as we were going out for the evening, I took the ice bucket plastic bag in my purse. When we got back for the evening, I got ice from the ice machine on the 1st floor in the plastic bag to save me a trip back and forth on the slow elevators. There is vending on the 1st floor for soft drinks and snacks. Conveniently, there is a CVS at the end of the street if you need anything CVS carries. There is also a \"Greek Deli\" convenience market almost across the street from the CVS, so if you want any type of snack, soft drink, fruit, prepared \"Greek Deli\" foods 24 hrs/day, there you go. There is also a Chinese takeout place next to the lobby of the Comfort Inn. I don't know if it is good or not, but it is convenient. There is free breakfast at this hotel which includes breads, hard boiled eggs, cereal, juice, milk and donuts. The breakfast room looks like it used to be a bar before the building became a Comfort Inn. There is also a small but efficient and free workout room with a treadmill and 2 other cardio machines, and a bottled water. The street this hotel is on is quiet, and not a main road where taxis drive, and our stay was very quiet! Along the street are some well established antique stores. On weekends, across the street in a parking lot, is NYC style flea market that has been there since the 1980s (or as long as we have known about it), and the trinkets, gifts, antiques, carvings, art, jewelry, jade, records, etc are well worth taking a look at on your way in and out of the hotel on Saturday or Sunday afternoons. Down at opposite end of the street from the CVS is Madison Square Park (where the original Madison Square Arena used to be). It appears for the month of October is a street fair with food vendors, and artisan shop vendors. There were crepes, beer, wine, frites, bbq, apple dumplings, Belgian waffles, and other tasty treats that were so good! The shop vendors had hand and artisan made jewelry, craft toys, hand bags, dolls, clothing, home decor and a lot of other craft goods. After Nov 1st they all were moving to Union Square for the holiday shopping time. Because we were there on Halloween, the Halloween Parade came down 6th Ave and ended about 2 blocks away from the hotel. Surprisingly, we heard no noise from the parade at all, inside the hotel! It was fun to people watch along the parade route, and it was almost better than N.O. during Mardi Gras.

I found the majority of staff to be very rude. For our entire stay, the majority of staff completely ignored me and only spoke to my boyfriend, beginning at checking in, where the booking was in my name, not my boyfriends, so I was the one they were dealing with, all during our stay, so for example if we walked in I would say 'Hello' or 'Good Moring' etc., they completely ignored me and only ever spoke to my boyfriend who hadn't even spoken to them, saying 'Good Morning Sir', right until the end, which again was me checking out! This might sound petty but it annoyed me enough to ruin our whole stay. I wouldn't recommend this hotel, for the price you could most likely get a nicer hotel nearer the action.

I have to admit, this hotel was not my first choice, but the NYC Marathon was taking place the same weekend I needed to be in the city for business, so I had to take what I could get. After reading mixed reviews on this site, I was hoping for the best but expecting the worst. The hotel is a bit shabby around the edges \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the common areas and rooms themselves could do with small maintenance upgrades that would improve the aesthetics all around. Some fresh paint on luggage-scuffed molding and cleaned-up sticky tables in the bar/breakfast/coffee area would make a rough-around-the edges hotel much more welcoming. Having said that, my room was comfortable and clean. Since the only room left in all of NYC for marathon weekend was #702, with three single beds for one person, it was sort of comical that I had my choice of three beds! However, the room was adequately sized, and probably for two people would also be comfortable. I think that three people sharing this room might crowd each other a bit. For three people, the narrow wardrobe and three full-sized drawers (plus nightstands) could be inadequate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for me, it was fine. There is also a full length mirror in addition to a large mirror behind the desk. There was a utilitarian bathroom, which was clean and stocked with hotel brand shampoo, conditioner, etc. Hot water took some time to kick in, but was adequate once it got going. I am a harsh judge of hot water supplies, since I have long, thick hair that is time-consuming to shampoo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c finishing a rinse in icy water is not fun. Happily, this was not the case here. I did have trouble figuring out the idiosyncrasies of the hotel hair dryer, but Maintenance showed up in my room within minutes of my requesting help and showed me the right combination of buttons to push to get it started. Since it required some non-intuitive steps, I suggest updating the dryers or at least placing a short, well-written set of instructions next to the dryers. The fall temperature fluctuated between chilly and just-right, and the combination heating/cooling system in the room was fine and kept me comfortable. To my relief, there was a small desk in the room so I could easily set up my laptop properly. I was glad I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d brought along my own Ethernet cable since the one the hotel provided wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working. The hotel room fridge had some unappetizing stains in it, but was obviously scrubbed and I felt fine putting take-out food in it. On a side note, the fridge was also properly cool. My boyfriend has diabetes and needs to store insulin when we do travel together, so I have become somewhat of an expert on hotel room refrigerator temperatures. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m happy to say, this would have been fine for his needs, too. However, I have no idea why the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carpeting left black marks on my new white socks! The carpet appeared clean, but the sooty stains on my socks were definitely suspect. Linens were clean and the mattresses and pillows were comfortable. I should note that the hotel lobby and also my room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bathroom had a strong smell of the type of odor-neutralizing spray they use to mask cigarette odors. Although my room was nonsmoking, underneath the smell of the disinfectant I could tell someone had smoked something in my bathroom in the not-too-distant past. However, this is not the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault, and the spray\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s odor was obnoxious but not unbearable. The hotel breakfast is a nice touch (cereals, muffins, etc), but nothing extraordinary. I certainly have had worse \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel continental breakfasts, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bland\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is the keyword here, but not unappetizing. The coffee doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much kick, but since it is free and to-go cups are available, it is a good boost until you can find better coffee in the neighborhood. It was easy to hail a cab \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re plentiful outside. Seems there is also a little flea market across the street on the weekends, and every kind of store you could want in the neighborhood. The walls are thin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at one point my neighbors voices sounded as if they were in my room! But, that lasted about five minutes, which made me wonder if perhaps they were in the lobby after all. At about 2am, there was a commotion down the street \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a celebration or street party or some sort of Saturday night revelry. I turned on the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s air system and the white noise drowned the street noise. The evening front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The daytime desk staff were also helpful, but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153friendly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is not a word I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d use to describe them. There is a difference between a NYC non-nonsense attitude and the day staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downright brusque attitude \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they might want to try a smile or two or consider eye contact when speaking to guests. All in all, I would stay here again with a caveat about price. My real sticking point is that there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nicer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd boutique hotels in Murray Hill for the same price as the Chelsea Comfort Inn, but with some luxury amenities and arguably better location. If the Chelsea would lower the room price, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay here again.

The continental breakfast was nice with fresh fruit, juice, bagels, hard boiled eggs, cereal, toast, and milk. The hotel staff was courteous and helpful. It costs to use the hotel computer and there was no free internet hookup if you bring your own computer. The hotel is in the most perfect location because you can catch the subway only about 2 blocks away to go any which way. If you want to go to Time Square it is only 2 subway stops away. We found that if each of us bought a week long subway pass that was the best deal for us. The kids were pro subway riders in no time. Only four people can ride a cab at a time so we would have had to take two to go places. We were able to walk and take the subway everywhere! We bought a site seeing package on the 2nd day so we could go by double decker bus to see Brooklyn and all of the major popular places in Manahtten. We were able to identify places that we would like to spend more time at this way. We also took a two hour boat ride around Manhattan Island and that was awesome. We spent a lot of time in Time Square but it was cheaper for food and souvenirs down towards Chelsea area or in China Town. There is a flea market and antique stores all along 25th where the hotel is located. There are many deli's, restaurants, and a pharmacy within 2 or 3 blocks. The chinese food restaurant outside the hotel lobby was a favorite with the kids. Our favorite tour was to see the Statute of Liberty, which is really inexpensive but the lines are really long... so be prepared to wait in line. Central Park was beautiful in March and we just happened to get a few days of warm weather and sunshine in March! Bring an umbrella though... it rained some of the time. We bought tickets on line to see the Knicks and we saw the Pirate Queen on Broadway. We bought reduced tickets down on Time Square. To get to and from the airport we scheduled with Super Shuttle and we were dropped off and picked up at the front door of the hotel.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cA pleasant surprise\u201d", "Author": "JoshuaVincent", "ReviewID": "UR8368934", "Content": "My usual Murray hill hotels were booked, so I took a shot with this, and loved it.

It is in a great location for me and the price was reasonable. My room was decent, it looked to be updated within the past year or so. It was much nicer than I was expecting. A little small but size was really OK for NY. However, I had a very difficult time getting hot water, thus the bad rating. I came to NY for a cooking class so when I got back to my room at 10:00 pm I was filthy and covered with grease. Definitely looking forward to a shower. I ran the shower for 20 minutes and got no hot water so I called the desk. An engineer was sent up to my room and confirmed no hot water. He did make a flippant comment though\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the summer anyway, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really need hot water, do you?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Uuhh, yes! I called down to the front desk again. This time I was told that nobody else had called and it must be just my floor. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer me a room on another floor where I would supposedly find hot water. He said they would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153re-set\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the system and in 20 minutes I should have hot water. Well no hot water was available after 45 more minutes so I went to bed unhappy. I had a hard time sleeping. When I got up around 8:00am, there was hot water. When I came back at 11:00am there was none. When I checked out I complained\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6they do have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153guarantee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The manager told me that yes, sometimes the boiler is turned off in the summer. But kept waffling about the details. Maybe it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153accidentally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd turned off. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite get an answer with him going in circles trying hard not make good on their promise to not charge for an unpleasant stay. The impression I got was that hot water is available only during certain peak hours. So if you only want hot water during these hours then I could recommend the hotel. A hot shower available 24/7 is important to me especially during the summer when I am walking around in hot humid weather. So unfortunately I will not be returning. As a side, checking in and out took a while. Even though there appeared to be at times several folks available to help, only one person did the work, thus the wait.

Yes, there was some traffic noise and much merriment coming from the 4040 Club on Saturday night/Sunday morning, but not enough to make having a room at the front of the hotel a problem. Everything worked as it should and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in. Also, there was a good range of channels available on the TV which was great for that hour where you're collapsed in a heap before heading to bed. It was also nice to have the fridge to store drinks and small snacks. The location is also great - far enough away from the main tourist area to avoid the tackier side of NYC but with excellent access to everywhere you might want to go, either on foot or by public transport. On a slightly less positive note, while the decor and furnishings were fine the recent renovations seem to have been rushed, as it was obvious that a good few shortcuts had been taken. Also, the air conditioning/heating is very noisy, so could not have this on while trying to sleep. The desk staff were efficient if rather indifferent and the complimentary breakfast was okay if you just wanted to grab some cereal or a bagel - aside from that, it was quite dire. Weighing it all up though, I'd still return to this hotel quite happily. I booked reasonably far in advance so got my room for $107 a night plus taxes, a real bargain for the overall quality of the hotel and the area it's in. Also, as a lone female I never once felt threatened or unsafe while wandering around the area on my own.

There is also a nice view of the Empire State Building as you cross over at Madison Square Park. Parking was also a consideration for us.

It's situated by a couple of subway stops that are good for servicing the rest of the Manhattan area. I found the location fine.

However, the rest of the hotel (corridors, lobby, lifts etc) are a mess at the moment due to the work going on and there's paint and workmen everywhere (sometimes taking over the lifts making going up and down the floors a pain in the backside). The work looked as if it could be going to go on for a while though cannot say exactly for how long. Perhaps would be worth checking with your tour operator before booking. One thing I would say about the rooms and this is a bit of a pet hate of mine anyway is that they are arranged such that at the end of a corridor three doors are next to each other (forming three sides of a square if you follow me) which means noise does carry if people are hanging around outside the rooms. Also, the fire doors slam which makes a dreadful noise which can wake you up in the night/morning. Sound very easily comes into the rooms from the corridors.

Getting to your room involved either a miniscule, slow, crowded elevator, or climbing a claustrophobic stairway. (Most of the time I took the stairs, as doing so was much faster than waiting for the elevator). The room was tiny, but I kind of expected that to some extent. The view was of the adjacent building, but one doesn't go to a hotel like this for the view. TV reception (which seemed to be over the air, not cable?) was fuzzy. The phone required a deposit, even for local calls (and they were expensive). My cell phone didn't work inside the building, so I had to step outside each time I needed to make a call. The bathroom was ok, if a bit musty. However, in 2002, I noticed some flaking wall material near the radiator. This was unnerving, as visions of asbestos danced in my head.... In 2000, there was a little breakfast room, and upon check-in, customers were given vouchers good for breakfast. After one breakfast dealing with low-quality food and snotty staff, I decided to have my breakfast elsewhere. This facility had closed entirely when I went back in 2002; I don't know if they've ever reopened it. (There's a adjacent Chinese restaraunt that may be associated with this hotel, but I didn't try it). The immediate neighborhood is fine, (on 25th between 5th and 6th Aves) is fine, but somewhat dim after dark. You're not too far away from busier streets (and 24-hour delis) though....The subway is just a block south, and plenty of buses and cabs ply 5th and 6th ave.

After booking my holiday to stay at the Carter Hotel, a few weeks later the travel agent advised me to change to the Arlington because of all the bad reports, and after seeing the Hotel Carter in the flesh, I am grateful. This was my first time in New York. I went over by myself to fulfil an ambition of mine - to visit this fantastic city. I couldn't believe the location of the hotel, it was great, right beside the junction of 5th & Broadway and next to the Flat Iron Building. I enjoy antiques and got a further surprise, when I found that the street was full of antique shops and home to a flea market at the weekend, where I got some great bargains. The street does look a bit rough, but I never had a problem with anyone. The hotel has good facilities for its price. My room was clean, and kept clean every day by the cleaners. It had a shower with hot water, a large comfortable bed and a TV with about 20 stations. I know we don't go on holiday to watch TV but its good if you don't want to be out at night. The room also had an electronic safe. The view from the window was a brick wall, I laughed when I looked out and thought it was quite novel after seeing so many movies featuring the city. It's all part of the experience. In the reception, there are vendors, phones and a computer offering internet access, which was great for communicating with people back home. The staff were very helpful and friendly - I bought a phone card at the Empire State and couldn't get it to work right, asked the receptionist at Arlington for help and she phoned the number and put me through free of charge. The card wasn't working because I forgot to skip the \"0\" at the start of the area code, there's a handy tip! There is also a Chinese restaurant on the ground floor, I never ate there, so can't tell you what the food's like. Just around the corner is a small grocery shop which offers a good selection of hot and cold snacks. I usually went there in the morning for breakfast on the move and then on to McDonalds, Burger King and loads of sandwich bars at night. There is a nice restaurant at the Rockefeller centre, but if you want to eat there, remember and pack for the dress code. I never took a taxi or the subway anywhere except to and from the airport. I just liked to walk from place to place and take in as much of the city as possible. Add to that, they drive like maniacs, practically every car has a dent! The hotel is only a short walk from the Empire State Building, which offers stunning views of the city and is close to many points of interest. Overall, I thought the hotel was great. The decor was out of date but who cares? Your here to admire and enjoy the city, not the confines of your hotel. It it does the job especially for someone like me on a budget. I can't understand all the negative comments other people have made. The staff were friendly, the room comfortable and clean, great location and cheap - What more do you want? If you have the money, then spend it on a better hotel rather than be a stooge. You get what you pay for. If -no- WHEN I go back to New York, I'll be staying here again for sure! The attached photo is a view from the top of the Empire State looking towards downtown Manhattan. I have pinpointed where the hotel is. You can see hotel from the ESB.

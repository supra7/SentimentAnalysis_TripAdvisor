On check-in the clerk said he was upgrading me to an executive room, as if I had already not reserved it. Oh well, if he wanted extra credit for being good to me, no harm - no foul. The kicker was that both nights, the upper executive floor was occupied by a couple of families with noisy, misbehaving young children allowed to hang out in the hallway. I would expect that an advertised \"executive\" floor would not be where they put young families, especially when the hotel had a high vacancy rate during these days. My other issue was the very loud traffic noise from the adjacent freeway all night long.

Totally appreciative for the staff of this hotel for making a VERY difficult day, that much easier. Now, on to the room. WATCH OUT! The toilet, when flushed, sounded like a jet had just launched from our room to Mars. Seriously. The hotel is older and FEELS older, but it is VERY clean. The non-auto air conditioning/heater is old school. There is a LOT of freeway noise, but I like freeway noise because I guess I am a city guy. Bathroom is small. If you have kids, be prepared. No kids channels on the tv. My wife liked the shampoo, conditioner and soap. That is saying a lot. Beds were actually really comfortable. Or maybe I just passed out after a tough day. No, I think the beds were comfortable and so were the pillows! Within a 1 minute walk you have Trader Joes and Paquito Mas (Mmmmm) This is not a resort hotel.

Now the negatives: 1) \"Gym\" is a joke. Gear must be 15 years old--upright bike, no-name stairmaster, and two treadmills (one broken). I spoke to Ryan Block (GM) on my first visit and he assured me that the treadmill would be fixed when I returned the following week It wasn't. He didn't call to let me know and he didn't return my call (I have his business card with what is supposed to be a direct number on it) when I tried to find out the status. Since nobody uses upright bikes or stairmasters (some people might never have seen the latter if too young), working out at this hotel might be impossible, especially since the \"gym\" closes at 1100P -- it was for me on two separate times with people already waiting for someone to get off the treadmill. 2) I had a signficant load of dry cleaning and laundry -- about $50. Suit, jeans, dress shirts, casual shirts and a few tee-shirts. A tee shirrt was not returned to me and I inquired about it a number of times without anyone ever calling me back or finding out. Called Ryan, but he didn't return my call. It was only a Banana Republic tee so I gave up on the $25 or so item and guess I'll just have to pay to replace it myself. Fortunaltely they didn't lose my Armani suit. Other than losing an article of mine, the dry cleaning was probably a bit better than average. But it seems you have to sacrifice a piece of clothing (I couldn't find the offical rules on how this works) from time to time so you be the judge of whether it's worth it. 3) They have no store onsite which is fine and they do have a soda/snack vending machine. I tried to break a $20 at the front desk a little after midnight and the front desk clerk only had 3 one-dollar bills. IT was a little frustrating because I had a $10 and was at the hotel there for three nights and wanted to tip $15 ($5/night) and couldn't leave more than $10 as a result. I also couldn't ahve the bag of Cheesy Poofs I had my eye on. This lack of attention is a little odd because of one factor. I'm currently leading an engagement where one of the sales people signed a lousy T&E reimbursement policy so my team has to suck it up and stay in a less expensive alternative than say a Marriott or Hilton. I picked this hotel primarily because of location -- less than a mile to the client means that I can walk there and back. I indicated to Ryan that I was going to be in town three or four nights per week for 10-14 weeks, depending on how the engagement develops. As I indicated, he promised to fix the treadmill the first week -- I told him in no uncertain terms that I could not stay in a hotel where I cannot work out. I also indicated that the 40+ nights I would be there should generate enough revenue to not only fix the treadmill, but buy something like, say an elliptical trainer. And maybe some dumbbells. 4) TVs are not flat screens. Not that I watch a lot of TV, but if I do, I think that a hotel can spring $500 for 37\" flat screen for each room. Anyway, I've gone on long enough. Nothing special about this hotel (could use a remodel) and many problems. Nice staff can't come close to making up for deficiencies. I think that owners/management are just greedy and trying to make as much money while spending as little as possible. Some people never learn that soemtimes you have to spend money to make money -- I'll never return losing them about 40 nights of guaranteed business and some my team as I staff up this engagement. If you like Holiday Inns, I've heard that the Holiday Inn Express (apparently different owners) a couple of miles down Ventura Blvd. is nice enought, very new and about the same price.

I'll go there again when visiting relatives in Woodland Hills.", "Date": "December 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Haven, CT", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "Madigan", "ReviewID": "UR5764703", "Content": "I just returned from a stay at the Holiday Inn in Woodland Hills and feel compelled to write a review. We were here for a few days visiting family in the area. We had two rooms that were clean and comfortable. Small bathrooms would be the only drawback. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were a decent size. The staff at this hotel were exceptional. Friendly, professional and courteous. The hotel was clean, the pool was clean and the grounds were kept really nice. I had misgivings about coming here at first but would definitely stay here again. If you are looking for a place that had a restaurant, pool and a good location this is it. It is in a busy location and right off the 101 Freeway but then again we didn't find much in that area that wasn't. I really recommend this hotel. The staff couldn't be nicer and the hotel was really clean.", "Date": "September 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Hollywood, CA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel, Wonderful Staff\u201d", "Author": "Keatho", "ReviewID": "UR5607662", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at this hotel twice in the past six weeks. The first time we stayed there we had a regular room that overlooked the swimming pool. It was great. You could see the pool but you couldn't hear the people in the pool. We ordered room service and it came very quickly and was delicious. The room had excellent air conditioning and the bed was very comfortable. We just came back from our second trip to Woodland Hills and this time we stayed in a suite. The room had so much space in it and the bathroom had a jacuzzi tub with sliding louvered windows that could open or close for privace. The shower was in a separate glassed in area and the water pressure was excellent. We had a 32 inch TV, a chair and a small couch in the room as well. My wife likes to sleep with a fan blowing on her and requested onr from the front desk. It was no problem, they said, and we soon had a fan in our room. Robes were provided for us as well. And of course, a coffee maker was provided, along with an iron and an ironing board. The staff couldn't have been nicer to us. Room service, again, was swift and delightful, and the food was excellent. All in all, both trips were excellent. The rooms are so nice and clean and the staff is the most friendly and courteous I have ever met. We will definitely go back to this hotel again.", "Date": "August 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central Point, OR", "Title": "\u201cShop Around!\u201d", "Author": "Trube", "ReviewID": "UR5600442", "Content": "We were a little uncomfortable with the area.

Nice big screen TV, almost new bathroom (marble countertop) very comfy bed, and high speed internet for free. Coffeemaker and a free newspaper.

The carpet was clean and the furniture was nice enough I would actually want to touch it, unlike many other hotels! We got the family suite and had 2 adjoining rooms, and both were nice.

The rooms are very clean, many have balconies, and the pool area is a nice place to lounge or eat breakfast. The free breakfast was really good too--with fresh fruit and orange juice every morning and a Belgian waffle maker! They even gave us vouchers for free drinks at the bar when we checked in. The beds were super comfy with real comforters, not those cheesy hotel bedspreads. Even the products in the shower were nice. The location was incredible, right in the heart of the French Quarter.

The only thing I would change would be to have a refridgerator in the room, but we could have asked for one. The pool area is small, but clean and cute. Iced tea and cookies are put out every afternoon. All of the staff were friendly. We borrowed umbellas from the front desk and they made a couple dinner reservations for us, which was great. They were very helpful. We ate at the hotel one morning for our breakfast and it was quite good. They have the waffle marker, sausage, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, fruit, cereal, breads, etc. Finally, the free drink tickets to Mae Baily's was a nice touch. It is an old and unique bar that is part of the hotel. This provides a close by place to grab a drink before or after dinner. If you are coming to New Orleans, I would consider staying here.

We have been home for a couple of days and everybody is still talking about this trip. New Orleans, we missed you after Hurricane Katrina and we are glad you are back! The rooms are so nice and easily accomodates our family. We had a room, with a balcony, that overlooked the courtyard with the parking entrance and had no issue with noise. After reading people's issues with noise, maybe these are the rooms you want? Regardless, I do not know why people are even complaining about noise. You are in the French Quarter for goodness sakes! Enjoy the experience! My recommendations for families travelling to New Orleans is to stay at the Dauphine Orleans, take the Haunted History tour (loved that!), go to the wonderful bookstore across the street, ride the trolley down St. Charles and eat at Camilla Grill, tour the Historic New Orleans Collection (love!), Jackson Square, go down Bourbon Street way before the \"celebration\" happens, and drink a Hurricane at Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop (oldest bar continually serving in U.S.). Don't even bother with Pat O'Briens Hurricane, Lafitte's is so much better and they have a virgin Hurricane for the kids. Plus - the bar is haunted!

Basically it is all the annoying noise without any of the party or excitement of actually having a balcony on Bourbon St. The beds are not uncomfortable at first, but a couple nights into it you can feel lack of quality sleep on your body.

We left our cell phone number and went to get something to eat; when the room was ready they gave us a call. I didn't care for the wristbands (not sure of the purpose).

Large room with king size bed, desk, dresser drawers, night stands, exposed brick walls and wooden beam ceiling. Also had a safe and refrigerator along with a jacuzzi bath, central air/heat. Considering the amount of time we spent in the room, it was perfect. Continental breakfast was provided with the waffle maker, juices, breads/muffins, coffee, fresh fruit, breakfast meat. They only offered boiled eggs. If you want something more, go to Krystals at Bourbon and Canal streets. Mae Bailey's bar is attached to the hotel, convenient but drinks were slightly pricey.

We quickly referred to it as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd during our stay. The May Bailey bar is a little musty smelling but HEY this is a old brothel from around 1857! It oozes history and boy if those walls could talk!! The Dauphine is in a great location away from all the shenanigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of Bourbon street but a quick walk to it if you are looking for excitement. There is a beautiful salt water pool with lounge chairs and fresh towels to use. Grab a cocktail at the May Bailey and go lounge by the pool for a quick \u00e2\u20ac\u0153refresh\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So quiet but accessible to all. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. The husband and I are going back in March and will be trying out the Herman House section of the Dauphine! Stay tuned! The ROOM: Our room was LARGE. We had a King size bed/balcony room. First, THE BED is a tempurpedic. This WILL be the next bed we own\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I have ever slept so well (we were down in August and were on the edge of heat exhaustion ever day so that could have helped!). The beds are heaven! Wonderful pillows and crisp clean sheets. There is a lovely fluffy robe to use in the bathroom that I will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stealing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd next time we are there (they charge your card). There is a coffee machine with ok coffee (I think it is Wolfgang Puck brand?) and a small refrigerator\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6no microwave. The fridge is quite handy for water and BEER! \u00ef\ufffd\u0160 There was a nice couch sitting area. It was very roomy feeling! I did not spend as much time on the balcony as I thought I would. I was insistent on having a balcony if I could get one and thought I would be out there daily drinking coffee and a cocktail, but really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. So, if you are traveling on a budget, and you are looking to stay at the Dauphine, I would say that you could omit this additional cost (20-30 dollars extra a night depending). Dauphine street is a bit more quiet in regards to pedestrian traffic than say Bourbon or Royal so there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much \u00e2\u20ac\u0153action\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to sit and people watch. It is a LOVELY view however. Also, no matter what hotel you are staying at, trash is picked up at 3 AM so if you are a light sleeper this will wake you up nightly.

We did not run into any spirits however, unfortunately. http://goneworleans.about.com/od/hotels/tp/hauntedhotels.htm VALUE: There is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coffee bar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the morning with a decent coffee and tea selection, continental breakfast and you get a coupon on check in for a free wine or beer at the May Bailey. The breakfast is basic, fresh fruit, cereal, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, assortment of juices, etc. and cool waffle maker. Even though basic, we found it to be a great way to start the morning for FREE knowing we would be spending probably a hundred dollars or so later on lunch and dinner. It was clean and well stocked. There is valet parking right at the hotel, however, we did not rent a car\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much of a need if you are visiting specifically the French Quarter or anywhere in the Garden District.

I took a photo but I won't shock you with it. It was clear it had not been cleaned in a very, very long time. very small, but that's understandable in a historic hotel and it was ok very noisy- despite my request for a quiet room (well, as quiet as possible given the locale) we were put next to the coffee area and people slammed the door and talked loudly outside our room starting very early in the morning.

Our king bed was large and comfortable, and standards of house-keeping were high. The quiet but effective aircon was appreciated as even in November we discovered it can be warm and humid in NOLA. Our room had only one very small window with shutters, so the amount of daylight entering the room was very limited. The complementary breakfast was fine, though if busy, you have to sit in the bar area as an overspill (which has a rather damp musty smell to it). Choices included croissants, bagels, toast, cereal and self-made waffles (which were very good).

There were plenty of great qualities about this hotel. It was clean with modern furnishings, the staff was very attentive and service was excellent. They even cooperated with us about a slight misunderstanding. That was very cool. They use Tempur-Pedic\u00c2\u00ae mattresses which were the main reason I booked this hotel. We have one at home and my husband cannot sleep well on a spring mattress. However, if sleep is what you are after so close to Bourbon Street, then you might wish to reconsider this location. The street is active 24/7. We stayed in room 214 which was not our original booking. I had read other reviews about the noise so originally I booked the Hermann House across the street in a room that was off of the street. Upon our arrival they informed us that the room we booked had a/c issues and was unavailable. They upgraded us to the suite in the main hotel which is directly on Dauphine St above the garage entrance. This would have been beyond cool if we wanted to party all night. But sleeping proved difficult especially with the garbage trucks that seemed to show up between 3am and 4am. Super loud. Also, being that this hotel is a block from Bourbon Street, you see all kinds come by. Keep in mind that you will definitely hear drunken people with very colorful language yelling in the street below all night if you stay on a street side room. You can take advantage of this free entertainment by setting out some drinks on the balcony table and just enjoying the show. We did just that the night my husband unfortunately broke his toe while exiting the bathroom door. Speaking of bathroom; it was pretty small and really only practical for brushing your teeth or washing your hands. Make up and hair styling was awkward with no real room to spread out all of the products most women require. Bring a mirror with you if you can.

There is no room service at this hotel but the bartender at May Bailey's has a ton of menus for local delivery options. Just ask them and they should be glad to help. Overall, this is a great choice hotel for being in the French Quarter. You can walk just about everywhere and easily walk to hop on a street car for a short ride into the Garden District.

We booked a Superior Carriage House room with a large jacuzzi for 2 nights, September 30-October 1 2011. The Good: The hotel could not be better situated to all the best the French Quarter has to offer. If you live close enough to make the trip by car, the Dauphine offers valet parking on site for an acceptable fee, this is one reason we chose the Dauphine. The rooms are tastefully decorated, and the toiletries provided were better quality. Additionally, we had plenty of towels to last us our entire stay, and I use a lot of towels. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were nice. The saltwater pool is small but lovely. The complimentary continental breakfast was good. We were provided a bottle of complimentary champagne upon our arrival. The hotel bar May bailey's is sweetly glamorous. The Bad: After we unpacked and sank into the jacuzzi tub after our eight hour drive from DFW, TX, the phone rang. We ignored it. Then it rang again. We ignored it. Then there was a knock at the door. Seems our use of the tub was causing a leak into the bar May Bailey's below. After verifying that the tub was the source of the leak, the maintenance man gave us a pained look and fled. No one apologized to us or instructed us re: future jacuzzi use. The UGLY: The room was dirty when we arrived, the tub unscrubbed and the floor unvacuumed, and coffee supplies were unreplineshed. My husband scrubbed the tub with a washcloth and some shower gel. The mirrors were smudged, the shower door filthy, there were cigarette burns on the bathroom sink's edge. It was really disappointing. The ceiling vents were covered with a hideous amount of mold. The whole place smelled very musty and smoked in, and the hotel is supposed to be non-smoking. However, when we went into the hotel bar below our room people were smoking, and the worst is....when we got home ALL of the belongings we returned with had to be immediately laundered or dry cleaned as they smelled like cigarette smoke. I understand that standards of cleanliness might be more lax in the quarter, but much of this filth was easily preventable with normal routine cleaning one would expect for $279.00 per night. not sure we will stay here again.

I noticed a bit of a musty odor but when we turned down the thermostat, the AC was able to eliminate it. As with most hotels in the French Quarter, the building's very old so this usually happens at all hotels. My only improvements to the room would be curtains over the plantation shutters which let just enough light in to wake me up too early. Also with the wonderful beds, the pillows were just so-so. The beds had extremely comfortable temperpedic mattresses. First time I've ever slept on one. Once I layed down on it I didn't want to get up. These beds were especially welcomed after I broke my arm at the end of a Segway tour on our second day there. After the weekend was over and I got back home, I missed the hotel bed. The housekeeping staff, especially our housekeeper was wonderful. The day after I spent the day in the room resting from the \"incident\" she asked about cleaning the room and was genuinely concerned about how I was feeling, as my friend had told her about my arm. She was so kind, I always forget to tip the housekeepers but I remembered this time. If I could specifically request her next time I would, though I didn't get her name. The inluded breakfast was served until 10, a little later than many hotels and there was a good variety from cereals to croisssants to hard boiled eggs and a Belgian waffle iron to make your own. First time I've seen one of those with a hotel continental breakfast. Stay away from the English Muffins though, not very good. We didn't use the complimentary beer/wine coupons we got t check in, but the don't have a date on them so we'll use them next time.

The bathroom was especially nice and really spacious. The room also had two small balconies (you could set out and that was about it).

The hotel also has a great breakfast bar full of options and afternoon tea (coffee, tea, cookies) which was a nice touch. The staff was always very friendly and very helpful. We were able to get directions to restaurants and were able to order a taxi for the morning of our departure without a problem. A note on the location: this hotel is perfect for people who want to experience the French Quarter but also don't want to be smack dab in the middle of the craziness. The Dauphine is literally one block away from Bourbon so it's easy to get there if you want a night out, but even having a room on the street, you can't hear any of the noise (which is great when you actually want to sleep at night). The neighborhood also felt pretty safe, though we didn't venture further north as the north part of the French Quarter is bordered by the housing projects.

It was german, the Jagerhause and it had the best inexpensive breakfast, and a great hamburger- cheap for lunch so after spending $$$ on dinner it was a nice break. Dejavue bar and grill is on the corner of Conti so we ate there- food was very good & cheap but it is a smoking bar and everyone has to be over 21 so we only ate there once due to the smoke.

We once again stayed on the Courtyard side of the hotel - which is across the street from the main building. The room is spacious, seemingly larger due to its vault ceilings, and quite comfortable. The room had exposed old red brick on one wall and the king bed was very comfortable with quality linens. The sink area of the bathroom faces towards the bed with the toilet and shower behind a closed door - not a set-up I particularly liked but functional. The room has a mini-fridge, which is almost essential for a city like New Orleans. The room has two french doors that open into a very pleasant courtyard with a fountain. The breakfast buffet is very basic but provides all the essentials. I have not used the pool either time I have stayed here but the pool seems to be active and pleasant, albeit a bit small.

All i can say is that we LOVED LOVED LOVED our room and the whole vibe of the Herman House (its across the street from the actual hotel...very safe and private). I requested room on the 2nd floor (#238 to be exact) and away from the street. It was perfect. After a long drive from Ohio, our check-in was a breeze thanks to Becky at the reception desk. As as soon was we crossed the street to the Herman House, we knew me made the right choice. We loved the exposed wood and brick on the inside of our room. Really gave it a cool feel. Our room was very clean, smelled great and was quite and dark. Loved it!!!!! The bed was SUPER Comfy...no joke! The complimentary breakfast was very good. The onsite parking garage was a nice feature and Paul in the garage was awesome! He always asked if we needed directions, told us to have a good time, asked us how or days was when we returned. Truly a great guy! All in All....we truly enjoyed our NOLA trip. We spent 4 days total in the French Quarter....we walked around everywhere. The hotels location is PERFECT.

I'll start with the positive things about this hotel: - Price for the French Quarter is pretty good, especially the mid-week rates. - Location is wonderful - it is centrally located in the French Quarter and most everything we wanted to do and see in the Quarter was within good walking distance. - Canal and St. Louis line streetcar stops were very close by. Here are the negative things: - Noise, noise, and more noise. Now, I've stayed in other French Quarter hotels before, even on right on Bourbon, and this hotel was MUCH worse. We stayed for 5 nights, and didn't get through one night without being woken up by loud, drunken, raucous shouting and laughing. That, combined with guests AND staff dragging metal-framed outdoor furniture across the bricks surrounding the pool throughout the night, equaled terrible sleep conditions. Turns out that the hotel bar allows customers to hang out by the pool whether they are guests of the hotel or not, making the tiny pool courtyard an extremely popular, extremely noisy hangout until dawn. - Customer service was lacking. On the last night of our stay, as we were trying to fall asleep amid the noise, we suddenly caught the scent of something burning. We briefly investigated our room and balcony, determined it was not cigarette smoke, and then called the front desk to report the smell. The lady on the line first insisted it was cigarette smoke wafting up from the courtyard. I told her that no, it definitely was NOT cigarette smoke, and she then said she would send the \"engineer\" to come check it out. We waited outside of our room (which has a full view of the pool courtyard) for said engineer to arrive. We waited 30 minutes and no one came. By that time were we so exasperated with our entire stay, we decided to go back to sleep (as best as we could with the noise) and leave early the next morning. - Complimentary newspaper that the hotel's website claims is delivered to your door each morning was nowhere to be seen. - Hotel also claims to be \"fully non-smoking,\" but that must not include the courtyard areas, where guests and bar hoppers can smoke all they want, and where we had to consciously avoid stepping on cigarette butts as we made our way to and from our room each day. - Plumbing in our room's bathroom could desperately use updating. It was hard to get hot water in the shower, not because there wasn't any available (easily got hot water out of the sink), but because the shower knob was loose/broken. Bathroom also smelled moldy and dank. We were afraid to use the tub Jacuzzi because it looked moldy and unhygienic. Mold in the grout and growing on the shower curtain - gross! Overall, this hotel was one of the worst we've stayed in. I cannot recommend it and I wish I had chosen a different hotel for our stay. While its location was awesome, and the price was affordable, I'd have been willing to pay more to stay somewhere cleaner, quieter, and more relaxing on my vacation.

We opted to stay across the street at the Hermann House and were able to get our first three nights in the balcony room overlooking Dauphine Street. It is by far, the coolest room in which we have stayed. There is street noise in the early hours, but we expected it. There are quieter rooms in the back of the courtyard. Other reviews complain about the noise from the garage-my suggestion-talk to the management,don't stew over it. If they can do something, they will. Our last night, we moved across the street to the main hotel as this room was reserved already, but management went out of their way to make sure our accommodations were great. we got a third floor room with 2 balconies! Once again, the management 's goal was to make sure our stay was the best it could be.

We chose the Dauphine based on a combination of the low price and the high ratings, and we were very pleased with our choice. We booked the reservation on Expedia and pre-paid for the trip to guarantee a double bed room. We arrived late at night due to our flight being delayed, and the person at the desk let us know that they no longer had any double bed rooms due to overbooking, so they upgraded us to one of their cottages. We only got to stay in Cottage 5 for one night, which was a complete tease because it was incredible! Stashed away in a lovely courtyard with a semi-private pool, high ceilings, a big private patio, TVs in every room, big jacuzzi bathtubs, and probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Getting into that bed after a long day of traveling was like heaven. There were two bedrooms so both couples got some unexpected privacy that night, which was great. The next day we were moved to a regular double room located on the third floor overlooking the street (Room 318). Since Dauphine Street is one block north from Bourbon, it was relatively quiet, and we never had any issues with street noise waking us up. We had a great balcony with three chairs and a table that we unfortunately never had time to take advantage of. It would have been nice if the guys had been able to sit out there and smoke cigars, but the hotel understandably asked us not to, so we didn't. The room was very elegantly decorated, as nice as any other hotel room in its class. Everything was clean and pretty. We loved the bar, May Bailey's, and the people at the front desk kept giving us tons of drink tickets so we spent a good amount of time there (their hurricanes are really good, as well as their St Germain). The pools and courtyards were always nice and clean (and well shaded, which was nice during the hot days). Every staff member was incredibly nice and helpful and we never had a bad experience with any employee. The hotel had FREE WIRELESS INTERNET, which was high quality and fast (and not often found at nicer hotels, oddly enough). The free breakfast was an unexpected perk and it was really really good. There was a waffle-maker, lots of pastries (we loved all the fresh croissants), sausage (which looked gross but actually tasted amazing), hard-boiled eggs, oranges and apples, yogurt, a small collection of cereals (mostly healthy cereals, nothing kid-friendly like Fruit Loops or Frosted Flakes), and a variety of drink options. Everything was refilled quickly so it was always warm, and there were plenty of tables to sit at. We went every morning and loved it. We have a few complaints, but they are minor ones. The beds were not very comfortable. Maybe we were just spoiled by the amazing beds in the cottage, but the ones in the hotel rooms were hard as a rock - almost literally. They used those memory foam mattresses, but not the soft cushy ones, the really firm ones that barely have any give to them. They also don't breathe very well, so we all got very hot at night, despite the AC being as low as it could possibly go. We all slept well regardless, but after reading reviews about how great the beds were, I was disappointed. We also had an issue with our TV remote not working properly. We wanted to order a movie one night, and we were unable to do so because the remote in the room didn't have the appropriate buttons. We called the front desk and they brought us a different remote, but that one didn't work either, and the staff member messed with it for awhile but didn't know what else to do so we just watched regular TV. A minor annoyance, but it did take up an hour of our night trying to figure out. The cold water in the faucet did not work very well. It came out as a trickle, with no ability to adjust the flow. A bit frustrating when brushing our teeth, but otherwise not a big deal. We did, however, love that there was always an abundance of hot water. All four of us would shower each day and there was still plenty of hot water to go around. The area around the hotel is not the best. We saw a few shady characters hanging around that street when walking back late at night. Generally, as a tourist, you want to stay between Bourbon and the river, and the Dauphine is one block off Bourbon on the other side of the river. It's not that it's a high crime area, it's just much quieter and more secluded than other streets, so there's more of an opportunity for someone to do you harm without being seen. If you're traveling alone you might feel more comfortable staying in more of a highly populated area. As I said, these are all very small complaints. In general, we really liked the hotel and we would definitely stay there again if the price was right.

Quiet location one block from raunchy all night Bourbon Street with a cute balcony but all night car alarms and revelry of street drunks contradicted the advertised \"serenity\" and made closed windows essential (no jazz wafting through our windows as they claim).

Our \"fresh fruit\" included old, moldy strawberries. Breakfast was nothing at all like the china & wine glass pictured on their web-site!

I was looking for a romantic property with great character in the French Quarter. We stayed 4 nights (Th-Sun) in room 105, which I requested upon check-in after doing some research. The front desk personnel were very helpful and accommodating. The room was great. It had a huge, corner jacuzzi tub (that worked great) along with a small shower in the separate toilet area. The room was spacious but not huge. It had a vaulted ceiling with exposed beams. There was no room above us, but the exercise room was adjacent (very few folks actually used the exercise room). The king bed was very comfortable. There was a small refrigerator and a key-operated safe. Water bottles were available but would incur a $3 charge each. I found the tap water more than adequate to drink, although I'm not really particular about that. The closet was quite small, and luckily my guy let me use all the hangers. I brought 2 sets of clothes for each day of our 4-day stay, as well as 3 swimsuits, 4 pairs of shoes and tons of toiletries, and I found the storage drawers to be too few and too small for my needs, but I made them work (again, I have to thank my guy for letting me have all but two of the drawers). I think there were a total of 10 small drawers between the night tables and the TV console area. The room looks to be recently renovated with marble counters and tile in the bathroom. There are wall mirrors in the bathroom area, as well. The area with the sink (there is only one sink, but plenty of counter space for all my junk) and jacuzzi is a part of the main room and does not offer privacy. The toilet and shower are in a private area with a pocket door that does not lock (that door was a little tricky to open and close; you have to lift it a little bit as you pull it closed and push it open). There was also a desk of reasonable size with a chair and a mirror. I found that area too dark to use as a vanity, though. The sink area has great lighting. The room also had a comfortable chair w/ottoman. The door to the room was actually french-style doors that had plantation shutters as well as decorative outdoor shutters. The other window had wide-slat wood blinds. This room is in the Carriage House area, which is just behind the front desk area; you have to walk past the pool to get to the room. The area with the pool and the Carriage House courtyards is cozy. If you happen to be the only one using it, you will love it. When you add other folks to \"cozy\" areas, however, their presence can feel intrusive. While I expected that at the pool, I didn't really expect that feeling while sitting in the courtyard drinking my coffee in the morning. It turns out that the entrance to the breakfast/coffee area is in the Carriage House area, so everyone had to walk past our room (and through the courtyard area) to get breakfast. That setup added some noise and detracted from the feeling of privacy I was hoping for. However, it was not bad, and everyone who was staying at the hotel during the time we were there was quiet and considerate. This room is very close to the pool. There were a couple of vending machines with sodas and snacks on the 2nd floor of the main house, but that was the only food available in the hotel outside of breakfast times. The breakfast offered several selections of cold cereals, instant oatmeal, yogurt cups, fresh fruit salad, bananas, oranges, apples, bagels, english muffins, croissants, mini-muffins and make-your-own waffles. There was also coffee, hot tea, milk, OJ, apple juice. A couple of days, there were breakfast sausage patties and hard-boiled eggs. The expected condiments were also available. Of course, the location was fabulous. The sounds of Bourbon street DID creep in at times, but they did not keep us from sleeping.

He did not return.I also received an online coupon for $25.00 off a night, in which I presented to the desk clerk at the time of check in, she informed me that was a bogus coupon and does not know why it is still circulating.

There was a beautiful courtyard with a pool and some outdoor seating. May Bailey's bar was charmingly old fashioned (though the wine list is somewhat lacking). The breakfast spread was pretty decent as well. And while it's only one tiny block away from the all-night vomit fest on Bourbon Street, Dauphine Street is very quiet at night.

It was street side but not above parking garage. Told us that there would be noise anyway with cars, garbage trucks etc, but we slept well. Some noise but to be expected in NO. They were very accommodating in helping us with the room. May Bailey's is quite a nice bar. Used to be a bordello. We used our coupons for the free drinks. You can only get beer or wine, which was just fine. One night we saw one of the musicians from Steamboat Willie going in there and he said this place was his hang-out when he was done playing.

Breakfast consisted of sausage, make your own waffles, boiled eggs, croissants, bagels, pastries, cold cereal, apples, yogurt, oranges, bananas, juice, milk, coffee and tea and fresh fruit salad cantaloupe, strawberries, honey dew. You can get coffee and tea all day. You can eat inside or outside. Depending on the day of the week, I would get there early in the morning. Fresh fruit especially would run out and have to be refreshed. There is tea and cookies in the afternoon. Worked out great for us. We never went out for breakfast and we had early tours booked so we did not have to worry about going out and finding something for breakfast. We could eat outside, read and relax. Saved money for lunch and dinner. We were in main hotel, which is sort of a maze. The pool is not heated and is small, but salt water and very clean. There were people in it. There are tables and lounge chairs. Sometimes at night we would sit outside with our drinks. The staff was very nice and helped us whenever asked. You can print your airplane tickets on the computer in the lobby. Lobby is not big but remember this is an old building. Beds were good.

Dive bar open 24/7 with good food. Don't be afraid to go in there. Next to that is Jagerhaus. If you want a side street to walk up after dark, try Conti. Pretty well lite.

It's a GREAT location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c except that navigating New Orleans (referred to by locals as NOLA) by car can be a nightmare if you don't have GPS and/or a good map. You have to deal with narrow one-way streets which are either under construction or poorly maintained, sometimes requiring U-turns to get where you're going. Except on the Interstates, don't expect traffic direction signs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c New Orleans is about as informative to drivers as Boston, and sometimes street-name signs are missing, unreadable, or rotated by a prankster. Keep in mind that NOLA is expensive. Rooms at the Dauphine are comparatively reasonable, so the \"value\" in staying there is by comparison to other hotels in the area. The Dauphine was, by the way, booked when we arrived, so make reservations early. The main building is U-shaped. To the SE of the main building, there are a somewhat smallish pool, a patio, and additional first floor rooms. The buffet food area is off the SE pool area. We had four rooms on the 2nd floor, SW wing. Rooms are sufficiently spacious, and there is no difficulty moving about the room. In addition to two queen-size beds (in our rooms), there is a desk & chair, night table, and TV stand with drawers. The bathrooms are average size, with a tub/shower. Water is hot enough, but not as hot as in upscale hotels. There are the typical amenities, such as hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner/bodygel bottlettes. They also provide a $2.99 thinish monogramed bathrobe, which you can keep for $39. Also available are 79\u00c2\u00a2 bottles of water which cost you $3 if opened (or which you can get from the vending machine for $1.50). The rooms were CLEAN, and we are picky about that. I wouldn't eat off the floors, but then I wouldn't do that at a 5-star, either. The beds are comfortable, but not plush. The mattresses appear to be some kind of firm foam, slightly on the firm side. There were four foam-filled (not solid foam) pillows per bed (not much of a problem for a feather-pillow lover). Sheets were slightly thinnish (i.e., not high quality), but comfortable enough. When it comes to quiet, you have to understand the environs and layout. On the 2nd floor, even-numbered rooms from 202-212 face a back alley, have no view worth seeing, and are quiet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ideal for people who want to sleep. Even-numbered rooms 214-224 face Dauphine Street, which has traffic, but there are usually no loud parties along the street - not too bad for people who want to sleep. Odd-numbered rooms face each other, and the parking area below. The parking crew (which appear to be there 24/7) can be a bit raucous, and unless you are a very sound sleeper, you may find sleeping to be a challenge. All the rooms have tiny balconies (except 207 and its opposite - 217, I think), which open onto a spacious \"community\" balcony. There are 4 floors, and I believe the 3rd and 4th floor layouts are identical to the 2nd floor. First floor rooms are adjacent to the pool (which saw little use during our stay) and a courtyard, where there were sometimes guests lounging in chairs with a drink or something from the breakfast buffet. The courtyard did not appear to be noisy. The breakfast buffet was a bit more generous than the typical fast-food breakfast buffets seen at some motel chains. There was fresh fruit, juice, milk, coffee (Columbian, dark roast, and decaffeinated), tea, eggs, sausage (surely pork, but who knows), cereals, make-your-own-waffles, cereals - overall pretty good, although not something you'd go to a restaurant to get. Parking is pricey ($28/day + 12% tax), but parking in NOLA is slightly better than non-existent. At least it's in-and-out, and it takes but a minute before your car is delivered. Tourists are the chief economy of the French Quarter, and everyone seems to know that. Friendliness to tourists is almost ubiquitous, and the Dauphine hotel staff was no exception. There is no room service in the Dauphine, but why would you want room service in NOLA? Rooms have wi-fi, and there are two computers for guests in the check-in/lobby area. The fitness center is sparse (at best) with a treadmill, an elliptical, and a bike-machine. There are a variety of weights. There are also towels and water (dispenser with cups). The desk (like much of the French Quarter) is tended 24/7. Plan on walking to the various \"attractions\", which extend from Bourbon Street NE to the river. There is a plethora of restaurants/eateries, and many are quite small. Nearly all post their menus, so you can see what's available without going inside. Expect things to be expensive (would you believe $180 for 6 and not at an upscale place), with some exceptions. Expect Bourbon Street to be a bit sleezy. Even Hustler has a joint. And every watering hole and every other vendor-type is looking to get you to part with your money. There are even mimes and singers (some of whom can't) posing or playing on sidewalks (and even in the streets), looking for a donation. In summary, New Orleans is a place to visit (I wouldn't want to live there), and the Dauphine Orleans is an excellent choice, provided you understand the little caveats about staying there. Would we pick another place next time - maybe, but we would definitely consider the Dauphine if we can get the quiet rooms.", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cWe had a great experience!\u201d", "Author": "Shellz78", "ReviewID": "UR99273403", "Content": "In planning our first trip to NOLA I had been reviewing hotels for months.

We had just spent two nights at the Marriott (the one at 555 Canal), and while I wasn't expecting Marriott level service or accomodations at the Dauphine, I was expecting the front desk staff to be a bit more friendly. I mean- they weren't rude or mean, but I get a warmer greeting when checking in for an annual visit at the dr's office. Our room was ready, so we took our bags up. The elevators were loud, small, had mats on the floors and smelled like rotting mushrooms (both elevators), but they worked. I still didn't want to touch the walls in there and found myself taking the stairs when I could. At first glance our room looked nice, but after a few minutes- I started noting issues. The most unsettling was the lack of wall hangings. There were NONE...just lots of empty wall space. I guess if they want to make people feel creeped out in their haunted hotel- this is one way to do it. It just made the whole room feel- well, off. Think sink and toilet both looked like the maid was in a rush when cleaning, the a/c vent was loaded with dust, and there were chunky cobwebs hanging from the smoke detector. TV reception was also horrible. Half of the channels were fuzzy. I paid for the cheapest room, but I guess I wasn't expecting that to mean we'd be staying over the valet area. The only \"view\" I got was the morning of our checkout- the guy staying in the room across from us decided to leave his French doors open and walked around in a towel for an hour. We also only had one bathrobe in the bathroom and it looked dirty. YUCK! So, we ventured over to May Bailey's to get our free drinks. It is a pretty neat place and the bartender on staff that day was excellent, but it is definitely more of a \"locals\" bar. Which is fine- except - it just made for a few very awkward drinks. Fast forward to us trying to sleep...I was pretty exhausted and was out like a light only to wake up scared out of my mind at exactly 12:38am. I swear that it sounds like three loud raps on our door that woke me up, but the reality- it was likely the valets/passengers slamming doors to a car getting ready to be parked. And for the next few hours- I could hear the valets talking, laughing, parking cars, etc. Not Fun! Another thing that freaked me out- when I woke up in the middle of the night- I noticed that the smoke detector flashes like a strobe light...seriously. So, it was about 4am when I got back to sleep. I'm also not a fan of the location. Yes, I know it's only a block off of Bourbon, but the closer you get to Rampart, the less safe things start to feel. Granted, we were approached by people trying to get $ from us everywhere this trip - and more than any other past trip - but there just didn't seem to be as many non-panhandling people and not nearly as much police presence once you ventured below Bourbon. The gym has nice cardio machines, but too few for the morning rush. There is also too little space for people to really do much with the weights. Finally, the continental breakfast was pretty awesome. It was in the Audobon room and they had a variety of juices, cereals, fruit, bagels, croissants, muffins, sausage, hard boiled eggs, English muffins, and make your own waffles. Good stuff! - but, not good enough for us to return. We'll probably just spend the extra $ and go back to the Royal Sonesta or Monteleone if we want more traditional lodging.

Upon my various stays, I've had the chance to sample many different French Quarter hotels and Dauphine Orleans is by far my favorite for the price. We stayed at the Dauphine Orleans for 3 nights during our wedding. We had the actual ceremony at the Maison Dupuy, which has a gorgeous courtyard, but having stayed in one their guestrooms during a previous trip, I knew not to return to the actual hotel. We had a group of 15 people joining us and half of the group joined us at the Dauphine and the others were down the street at the Holiday Inn since the Dauphine is non smoking. The Lobby is nice, but small. Check- in was easy and pleasant. We stayed at the Hermann House across the street and the rest of the group stayed in the main hotel. Nobody had any complaints! We loved our Hermann House room, my only complaint was that it was pretty dark and I wanted more natural light for wedding pictures. I asked the front desk if we could switch and they were kind enough let me look at a few different rooms. We ended up staying where we were and took lots of pictures in the courtyard. The room was a good size, especially for New Orleans. Great bed, one of the main reasons I chose the Dauphine in the first place, it did not disappoint! The other amenity I enjoyed was the jacuzzi tub. It was only large enough for one person, but was so very relaxing. The location was perfect. May Bailey's bar was typical of New Orleans and just added to the charm. It was also the final stop of our Haunted Pub Crawl and we used our free drink coupons there. They were also kind enough to lend us a wine key when I needed to open a bottle of wine we purchased at the little liquor store down the street. Everyone we came in contact with was very nice and accommodating. The morning of our wedding, I realized that I couldn't find my travel partner, my teddy bear named Granola. I assumed he got washed with the bedding and the front desk had him waiting for us when I sent my Maid of Honor to search for him. :) Upon leaving, our Best Man, arranged a cab with front desk since we were departing at 5:00 am for our Honeymoon. Check out was so easy. The cab was waiting, took our luggage as we crossed the street for the lobby and quickly checked out. Awesome stay. Couldn't be happier.

The Dauphine is quaint, offers a courtyard, and also offers rooms with balconies (either overlooking the courtyard or Dauphine Street). The hotel had recently undergone a renovation, which was nice. Our room had two double beds with amazing mattresses (I think they were memory foam). Most of the bathroom had been renovated. The room itself had everything you'd need (a good size mini fridge, computer desk, sitting chair, dresser, flat screen tv, and free wi-fi). Our room also had double plantation doors leading to a shared balcony that overlooked Dauphine Street (my favorite part about the hotel).

(Sunday evening thru Tues Morning) We stayed in the Herman house which is across the street from the main building. THE PROPERTY: Well groomed an maintained, nothing stood out. Everything was clean. They have a nice little breakfast room with decent enough free breakfast. Make your own waffle, sausage, breads, fruit, milk, coffe, cereal. Work out room (we did not go into) a pool with complimentary towels. Parking garage is multi-story with a valet that was vey nice. Many small courtyards interlinked throughout. Across the street was the Herman House where we stayed. One large courtyard that was very nice with small fountains and patio furniture. Everything had the \"feel\" we were looking for. Old world French charm. Wooden shutters instead of blinds or curtains on all windows. Wooden balconies, black iron trims. THE SERVICE: This is part I always find fascinating in other people's reviews. People's exspectations vary so much. My wife and I are pretty easy going and do not need alot when we stay out of town. Now was the front desk overy helpful? That is a loaded question. Everytime I asked a question I received an answer and they were nice about it. I can see how some others would have issue. The staff is of the younger generation (like us) maybe why we communicated better with them, you never know. We did arrive about 4 hours ealry, but they took our car and asked if we could give them an hour to get the room ready. No problem, we were early. Did they go completely out of their way to suggest something for us to do? No, but then again we didnt ask. I do not expect the Hotel to give me all this information. It is my trip and I do all my own research. Id rather them tell me places not to go. But that's what Tripadvisor.com is for right? Our door battery went out and they had a gentleman there with-in minutes to correct it. We usually do not ask the hotel for suggestions to eat or drink because they usually have something set up with businesses in the area, so we pretty much fend for ourselves. Valet was good, but little pricey. $30 a night on the parking. We could have stayed in the regular rooms and had free parking, but the rooms did not meet my needs. Cabs were called for other guests promptly and arrived quickly. LOCATION: Was absolutely perfect. One block over from Bourbon Street in the heart of the French Quarters. Everything is in walking distance. We strolled over to the casino off of Canal street which was only 5 black or so away. Maybe took us 10 minutes. We never took a cab anywhere. Many restaurants around the corner n both directions and there was a neighborhood grocery close by. Forgive me but I cannot remember where, but it was only a block away heading towards downtown on Dauphine St. THE ROOM: We really liked our room. It had exposed red brick with vaulted ceilings and rafters. Decor was pleasant and jazz themed. My wife was pleased and said it was romantic. I also picked this room because the had mini fridge. We like to bring our own drinks and small foods when we travel so for us this is a must. Also great for left overs from a great dinner the night before to munch on. The bed was a king size tempurpedic. Never slept on one of these before, and it was amazing! Tons of pillows, more than two people would need so of course my wife loved it. Super comfortable. Small flat screen T.V. with basic cable. Jaccuzzi tub, marbled floor, iron board, hair dryer and a safe with key. Good size room, lots of room to move around. We have definately stayed in smaller. A/C has electronic climate control. Track lightingfor main light with dimmer switch was nice. Lamps in room were not a good source of light at all. i do not remember a phone being in the room , but im sure there was one. GRIPES: My only gripes were in my opinion there was not enough drawyer space for clothes. There was a large closet for hanging jackets. We basically kept all of our casual clothing and sleep clothes in our suit case on the floor. Socks and underware could fit in the dresser under the TV. The toilettries were basic. Soap, shampoo. Wished they had Q-tips though. Beware of the bottled water in the room. They are three bucks a piece. Easy to chug these down after a long night on Bourbon St without thinking. Walls were a little thin. We didn't hear any of the neighbors, but you do get an ear full of the Bikers that frequent the Quarters on their motorcycles. So basically road noise. We are hard sleepers, but i can see how someone else would have a problem. Definately request a room closer to the center of the courtyards and away from the street. WRAP UP: If you are looking for a romantic short stay in NOLA then Dauphine is a great choice. Clean room, authentic looking at a great price. Will you get 4 star treatment? No of course not. if you wanted that you should have stayed at the Double Tree downtown. It was hard to leave the comfort of he bed, and the free wifi made it easy to plan our days. When we did leavethe room, it was easy enough to get around due to location. Our valuables were always safe, our car was always parked and protected, and the one little issue with the door was fixed immediately. We may stay here again when we go back. The only reason we wouldn't is because we like to mix it up a little.

I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disagree more. The place scared me; it had a slight port-o-potty odor. I went to the Walgreen's on Decatur and Wilkinson and bought Lysol disinfecting spray and gave the entire room a once over. If you stay in this room, I left the remainder of the disinfectant in the TV cabinet in the bedroom. 3) We came back to our room after being out and about all day to find our room door left OPEN, yes wide open! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the housekeeping staff just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pull the door shut to latch it, and being an old building the door won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay closed unless closed properly. Nothing was missing from our room, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure it was an innocent oversight, but OUR ROOM DOOR WAS LEFT WIDE OPEN FOR SEVERAL HOURS. 4) Upon checkout, the front desk didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to ask us how our stay was.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cMaid stole our prescription medications.\u201d", "Author": "WiscMike", "ReviewID": "UR92537871", "Content": "We satyed there in early January and like the hotel.

I always roll with the punches when things are a little off, as every place has its quirks and drawbacks. But I have to note this B&B's problems. We booked a 'standard' room for 2 people on expedia, and it was a dingy, dark room with one FULL-SIZED bed. Not queen, not king, just a full/double. It was absolutely tiny and haven't seen a hotel of this price (or even motels!) have rooms with only one full-sized bed before. The room didn't have a dresser, and was much dingier than showed on the website. When we asked about this -- extremely politely -- we were told that there was nothing they could do by a defensive manager; she told us the hotel was booked so we couldn't switch rooms, and that we'd have to call expedia about the problem. After we spoke to Expedia and asked to be let out of the 2nd two nights of our reservation at least, so we could find another hotel, the expedia staffer called the Dauphine - and the manager refused to let us out of the reservation. You would think that they would want to keep up a good relationship with expedia, if not us as their guests. The next morning, a much friendlier front-desk worker switched our rooms to one with a king bed for no extra charge (so apparently there was room). Both rooms were poorly lit, and looked over their parking lot. You can hear every word that the parking lot attendants say , and it is sometimes quite loud when cars go in and out. We ordered a movie on our tv and it didn't work. The hair dryers in the rooms are absolutely ancient and one of them stopped working on me. I called and asked for a new one, but no one came in the 15 minutes I waited, until I had to leave to go to an interview with a half-dried head of hair. The air conditioning switches on very infrequently, so the room would get very hot and then cold for only a little while. The bathroom was not very clean in our second room; there was gross schmutz on the shower curtain and the toilet hadn't been scrubbed all the way. one night we came home and the toilet wouldn't stop flushing! They sent 2 people very quickly to fix it. The stairwell smelled of urine (seriously). And while we were there, the city had a water outage in the area, and there was a 24-hour \"boil advisory\" (to only use boiled or bottled water). The hotel only stated this advisory in the lobby - they didn't notify all the guests in their rooms or give us a call or anything, so only when I was checking out did I see a flyer at the front desk saying that guests shouldn't drink the water or even shower with it. Some of these things on their own would have been fine, but all together it was pretty bad. It's really unfortunate, but it seemed like they just didn't care if their guests had a good stay or not. On the good side, the pool is very pretty (though not heated), there's free wi-fi, the folks at the bar were very friendly (and the bar has a nice ambiance), they stored our bags for us with no problem and called us a cab when we needed one. The location is good if you like the Quarter, and it's also a short walk to the Central Business District. A recommendation: if you do end up staying at Dauphine, make a reservation for a meal at Bayona, the very highly rated restaurant across the street, as soon as possible as they don't take walk-ins when they are really busy.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cDidn't Honor Reservation - Ruined a full day of Vacation!\u201d", "Author": "jodi_123", "ReviewID": "UR88301675", "Content": "After much research we reserved a Hermann House room for 3 nights. I'm a light sleeper and wanted a fairly quiet room. Our reservation stated Hermann House Premium King clearly on it. When we arrived, they acted surprised that we wanted a Hermann House room and said that was unavaiable, but they were putting us in a comperable room that would be quiet. Before we were settled we went to the bar to pick up our free drinks and a lovely lady there stated, \"I just decided to come down today and they gave me one of the rooms in the Hermann House, I just love it.\" Unfortunately for us - room 103, where they put us, was over the pool and bar area is the noisiest room in the place and that is where they put us. There wer e3 wedding parties in the hotel and they were in the pool courtyard until 2:30. That is when I called the manager and asked if we could please get some sleep, we had started our day at 6 am to travel. The overflow from the bar continued in the courtyard until after 4 am and you could hear everything that was going on - there was little to no sleeping that night, every time you'd nod off someone would start slamming glassware or talking loudly - it was probably the worst room I've ever stayed in while in New Orleans. The following day I went to the front desk to ask about a move (the night manager said she would set this up - she lied, seemed to be the trend there). So, I very calmly asked about our move and also stated that we had paid for and reserved the Hermann House and that I did not feel we had a comparable room - I was told \"OH no, that room is a class above what you reserved - it has a balcony - so no discount (wait this gets better). Eventually we spent most of our afternoon moving. No-one would help us, we were exhausted, there were no carts available, it was hot and sweaty. We finally got to collapse in our new room around 4:30. We spent the next 2 nights in room 141 in the Hermann House and it was almost like night and day. Except.....we went to bed early that night - and at 11:30 they moved people in the room above us. At this point we are laughing hysterically because they are \"suitcase droppers\" It was comical, we'd almost get to sleep and BAM they would drop a suitcase. This only lasted about 45 minutes, but really - it was starting to feel like a conspiracy against sleep! One other note about room 141 - the AC blows directly onto your face on the bed. My DH ended up sick from the constant blowing on his face (too hot to not run the AC). Our last night ended up being fine, of course the entire trip we were drop dead exhausted which took a lot of pleasure out of it. Then we go to checkout and I find they are trying to charge us an extra $88 for the pool room (remember - it's a class above), they did take the additional charge off, but that took a chat with the manager Sean. There were a couple of things that were nice about the hotel. The beds are temperpedic and divine, if you can sleep in them. The linens are nice. The maids were some of the nicest people we've ever met in New Orleans and the only reason this is 2 stars instead of 1. The bartenders were pleasant and even when lying to us about the quiet room they were pleasant about it. We'll stay elsewhere on our next trip, there are many places that you can actually get sleep at night that honor the reservations you make.

(Which if you are thinking about going to New Orleans and are a foodie, stop what you're doing and book your trip. It was amazing on the food tip.) The hotel had a pool in a cute courtyard, and we were gutted that it was just a bit too cold for a dip. There was a small gym with a treadmill, elliptical and TVs which was nice. Again, the location was killer. The rooms were tidy, the beds were super comfy and the linens crisp. We even had terry robes! (We usually travel no-frills so it's the little things that excite us.) We snagged a room on the street side of the building with a small balcony (ask for one at booking) and LOVED grabbing a bottle of wine from one of the close wine shops and sitting on the balcony before heading out for dinner. We were only two stories up, so the view was nothing to write home about - but we just love watching cities go by.

The bed and the location. If that's all you want in a hotel, the Dauphine Orleans might suffice. Let's start with the lobby. It looks like a Best Western check-in desk, then you're off to the one working elevator with the cracked floor that sits outside the lobby area and in the garage with all the car fumes. The pool was actually OK, but forget sitting anywhere or laying out. There are about 4 deck chairs and 2 tables in an awfully cramped pool area. The bar/lounge smelled like a wet ash tray and looks like it hasn't been updated since the late 70s. One has to cross the damp ashtray bar/lounge to get to an equally horrible and dated breakfast buffet dining room. The dated and dank ambiance is surpassed only by what I would call the worst breakfast buffet I've experienced in years. There wasn't one hot item, if you exclude the coffee and waffle's you make yourself. The staff was decent. I feel bad they don't have a better environment in which to work.

Check in was easy and our room was very clean. We had not one, but two private balconies overlooking Dauphine Street. Bathroom was plenty big. We even had a small refrigerator in our room. The only complaint I have is that we were by the elevator which was loud (but it would be that way at any hotel with this type of layout). Also if you are a light sleeper you will not want a room facing Dauphine Street. There was some street noise but that's not the hotel's fault. It's New Orleans, so what can you expect? We ran the fan in the bathroom at night to drown out the noise. The location is perfect. One block over from Bourbon (if that's where to plan to spend your time, although we didn't). Close enough to walk to everything in the French Quarter including the Aquarium and the French Market. Also close enough to Canal Street to where you can get on the streetcar to take you to the area the Audubon Zoo is in. The pool and surrounding deck area are on the small side, but it was fine. Plenty of pool to cool off in and relax in a hot afternoon. Continental breakfast was like everyone else has said on here. It's basic stuff like oatmeal, toast, waffles. We only ate it one day. We chose to eat breakfast other places. I was hesitant to stay at the Dauphine because we always stay at a Marriott when we travel. We previously stayed at the JW Marriott on Canal. But wanted something different for this trip. We will be staying at the Dauphine every trip from now on. BTW, we had trouble at first booking a room with a balcony over Dauphine Street. We even called the hotel and were told told they could not guarantee a balcony overlooking Dauphine.

All of the above attractions were less than a safe 10 minute walk of our hotel. Bourbon Street was only about a 4 minute walk from The Dauphine Orleans. My flight arrived in NOLA first. I got an airport shuttle for $20 one way (we split a cab back to the airport $33 for 2 people). Upon arrival, I was checked in quickly. I explained that my friend was coming in later and they had a key waiting for her at the desk. There was a minor mix up with the room. I was initially given a huge and beautiful mini suite with a pool view. The only problem is that it was a one king size bed and a sofa bed. There were two of us ladies and we needed a room with two doubles. They handled the change quickly. However, the second room was not as plush and nice. It was very clean and had a great balcony view of the street and city. However, the carpet wasn't as plush and the bathroom was much smaller. We were comfortable and happy with the room, but I think that the first room was nicer. Both rooms were in the main hotel. The salt water pool area was very cozy and nice. It was nice sitting out there after a long day of walking around. Mae Bailey's is an onsite local bar near the pool area. It is cozy and full of locals and fun. The free breakfast is held in there. It was ok. My advice is when coming to NOLA, find any excuse you can to eat anywhere in the French Quarter. Don't waste a meal on hotel food. Check out was smooth, but check your bill. We were charged for 4 days of parking and we had no car. It was taken care of immeadiately. I will definately stay there again! I want to try the Hermann House premium rooms across the street.

What a pleasant stay! If you are looking for a hotel in the French Quarter this hotel is extremely well located. You are one block off Bourbon Street and in essence can walk within 15 minutes to any key point in that part of the city you wish. There are two sides to the hotel - the Courtyard and the Inn side. The Courtyard side is across the street and the doors to the rooms open to the outside like a motel. However the courtyard is very secure, with keycard entry, and each room has charming french doors. The room was well appointed with a wonderful king bed. I travel quite a bit and would say its one of the most comfortable beds I have slept on. The room had a 20 foot vault ceiling with exposed beams and brick. I thought it was pretty cool. Room had a nice flat screen TV on the wall. The bathroom is well appointed but its worth noting the wash basin and mirror are part of the bedroom. I tend to not like those set-ups but it somehow worked for us. The frig was very handy for some drinks and snacks we bought nearby. We did try the continental breakfast once and it was fine, if not crowded. Just has the basics - bagels, fruit, juices, milk, and a waffle maker. They did it in the area that doubles as a bar at night. While we did not use it, there is a small but rather nice looking saltwater pool with lounge chairs. I regretted not using it as again, its seemed quite nice. Also, having the free wifi in the room was nice, as I had brought my laptop. I should mention there is a wonderful restaurant next door called Bayona. The caveat of my review is this.

Courtyard and pool area not large but quite a few lounges and chairs available. We were generally able to get a lounge when we got back to hotel around 3:00 pm. That seemed to be the popular time to take a swim and pick up some rays. Pool isn't large but enough to cool off and do some laps. I could swim underwater from one end to the other. There was a fitness room but didn't check it out. There is a computer in the lobby area that you can access free to check emails etc. All the staff we met were very friendly. Only complaint I had was one of our lamps next to the bed did not work. Left a note for the maid but nobody did anything about it. Finally on our last evening there I decided to move the night table out and saw that it wasn't plugged in. Why couldn't the maid have done that? Checkout as smooth as checkin.

Speaking of security, if you walk down Conti past Bourbon, you will see the NO police station. There's a sign out front saying you can get a t-shirt inside.Since everyone else in NO is selling t-shirts, why not the police???

It's my 11th time in NOLA, my wife's 5th. We booked here because of the reviews on TripAdvisor. I must admit, however, that we were very disappointed. There are many nice things about the Dauphine Orleans - the staff seems friendly, responsive and helpful; the courtyard and the pool area are pleasant oases; the wireless internet is appreciated; the location in the heart of the French Quarter can't be beat. For us, though, these positives must be weighed against a fairly large number of negatives, and overall, I can only give this hotel an average rating. 1) The room was spacious and reasonably clean, but smelled dank and musty. There was one tiny window. Even with the plantation shutters wide open, the room was dark. We had to use all of the lights even during the high noon hour. 2) The bathroom was marble and also clean, but very small and cramped, with barely enough room for one. Also, there was virtually no water pressure. I couldn't even rinse the shavings out of my shaver. It's a sad situation when you have to flush 2X just to clear out #1. Place one piece of toilet paper in, and we had to flush 3-4X before it would go down. 3) The elevators are a disgrace. During the 4 days we were there, one or the other or both of the elevators were broken down at any time. We frequently had to climb the 4 flights of steps up to our room in the humid 87 degree temperatures. When working, the inside of the elevators were DISGUSTING - cracked, dirty floors; scratched wood walls; rusted metal door-frames. This is NOT what I expect from a hotel ranked as #21 in all of New Orleans. 4) The continental breakfast was complimentary, and while appreciated, was not what I would expect from a \"highly rated\" hotel. Tepid coffee with only \"non-dairy creamer\" available. A waffle maker that appeared broken - the waffles came out under-cooked and split in two upon opening the iron. The muffins were tiny and tasteless, and white bread only was available for toasting. The quality was more on the level of a Holiday Inn Express. I really WANTED to like this hotel, and while there are some high points to recommend it, overall I left with a sense of disappointment.

I have been visiting New Orleans for over 20 years and have stayed at many hotels, one of the better ones being the Chateau Le Moyne just down the street (also fantastic, though a chain and a bit pricier). I highly recommend the Dauphine; it is especially great for what you pay, and it is more authentic than many of the more expensive hotels. That said, I recommend calling for your reservation so that you can request specific rooms. Some rooms have balconies and more windows. From our lovely third-floor room in the main building, we had a view of Dauphine out front and a view of the business district from the side. The Tempur-pedic beds are incredibly comfortable, and the rooms are decorated in clean, light-colored linens. The colors are light and airy, unlike many of the dark boutique hotels in the area, and the morning sun shines in, waking you gently with loads of New Orleans charm. We are not the big Bourbon Street touristy types, but the Cafe Beignet on Bourbon is a very short walk away and is well worth the short morning jaunt. You are also a short walk from everything in the French Quarter, also a short walk from the St. Charles streetcar that will take you to Magazine Street, less touristy and filled with yummy restaurants. This is not the hotel for you if you are going to New Orleans to experience the sameness of a Ritz-Carlton, etc. But if you want a neat, clean, charming, well-located room in the middle of the French Quarter, I very highly recommend this hotel, especially for couples.

I would strongly recommend requesting a room that does not look on to the parking lot as the management seems to be nonexistent, and it's clear that the shouting is tolerated. I would also recommend finding your own cab service if you need one to get to the airport. The parking attendant (head shouter) seems to be in charge of booking the taxis.

Our main-guesthouse room was small, clean, updated, and functional with memory foam beds and nice white linens. Our balcony overlooked Dauphine Street. The hotel is non-smoking except for the courtyard and bar areas. (Word to the wise...do NOT let anyone smoke on your balcony or you will be charged a non-negotiable fee of $200 for smoke removal, even if you keep it outside.) Which is good news for non-smokers! Let me say that the staff and valets were always very helpful and courteous. The sales manager, Dawn, was very attentive and helpful as I planned my Big Easy destination wedding online. We were in contact for almost 6months while preparing for the ceremony and she consistently and promptly returned my MANY calls and emails. In order to reserve the courtyard for the wedding in October we were required to fill the 3 surrounding courtyard rooms, all of which were very rustic and charming. The suite was equipped with a slow-draining whirlpool bath (no shower); however, the jets worked nicely. The other 2 courtyard rooms were both equipped with showers only. We encountered a problem with seeing a little mouse in one of the rooms and some unidentified matter on the bed in another courtyard room. Although the thought of sleeping with mice was very unnerving, it is almost understandable that mice would be in the older building surrounded by courtyards. Once we notified the staff, they were very quick to assess the situation. Our other friends and family filled the main-house rooms and all seemed content with their stay. WEDDING FYI: I was allowed the option to personalize the reception and ceremony set-up to my liking. The Audubon Room (which adjoins the courtyard through a hallway corridor) is in need of some serious updating, but the courtyard made for the perfect setting of our ceremony/reception for our party of 50. Food and drinks were set-up in the Audubon Room while dancing & mingling commenced outdoors. I had priced and researched many other local hotel wedding packages and I am glad that we chose the Dauphine. Although certainly not the fanciest of locations, it was perfect to set the mood for the wedding we had in mind...simple ceremony, cocktails, dancing, and mingling in the spirit of New Orleans. Our wedding weekend motto was \"WE CAME FOR THE PARTY!\" If you have a sparkling, dreamy, pretty-princess wedding in mind you are better suited to host your wedding at one of the larger venues. If you don't mind a building with older character to house a no-frills ceremony for a party of around 50 guests, then the Dauphine is recommended. The courtyard provided a beautiful backdrop while maintaining some flare in our ceremony photos with views of some of the surrounding older buildings in the background. Overall, the hotel is extremely charming and a nice change from the common Super 6 Holiday Micro \"we'll leave the light on for ya\" hotel chains. Besides having lovely pool/courtyard areas, the \"infamous\" hotel bar is a great place to have some drinks and meet a few locals. If you are used to staying at upscale- luxury hotels, the Dauphine would not be a perfect fit. But if you are looking for some traditional, older New Orleans pizzazz then the Dauphine should be right up your alley. I have now stayed on two separate occassions and have been pleased with the hotel both times.

No quarrel with the location right in the French Quarter, but I would not recommend staying here unless you have very low standards. The website photos are deceiving and make this place look like a nice boutique hotel -- wrong! It is small, but it's a dump. My first clue was the lobby, which is small and shabby. When I checked in, the desk clerk was on the phone apparently responding to a complaint by explaining that the hotel was known to be \"haunted.\" Next clue was having to go outside in the parking garage to take the cramped, dark elevator to my room -- not exactly first class. Once I got to my room I unpacked and lay down to rest, only to be disturbed a few minutes later by a man unlocking the door and walking into my room! When I called out, he hastily retreated saying he thought no one had checked in yet! OK, not good. When I left to go to dinner I hung the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door hoping to make clear that the room was occupied. When I returned later that night the \"do not disturb\" sign was gone! Then I went into the room and noticed that the door to the balcony was open! Now I was worried and quickly checked to make sure no one was in my room (not exactly the feeling you want in a hotel room). Having found no one, I made sure the balcony door was securely locked. Was the desk clerk right? Was this place really haunted? No, just scarily bad. That night I could not sleep because of all the noise in the parking garage directly below my room. First there was honking, then loud yelling, then someone decided to power wash the floor of the parking garage at 1am. That was the last straw and I called the desk to complain. By now I was really sick of this place. Luckily I was only there for one night or I would have checked out and gone somewhere else. It didn't help that the key to my room failed to work not once, but twice, forcing me to go all the way back to the lobby in the scary elevator. Both times the desk clerk looked puzzled and said they thought I had checked out. Why is it so hard to know when the guests have checked in or out? Besides all of that, the bathroom in my room did not look or smell clean and had little flying insects in the bath (yuck). I would say this hotel depends on the myriad tourists who are either too drunk or hungover to care about clean bathrooms and secure rooms. One couple I encountered in the elevator early the next morning was having cigarettes and diet Coke for breakfast, which I would say typifies the guest at this hotel. So basically if you need a place to pass out after a night of drinking on Bourbon Street, by all means book a room here. Otherwise steer clear of this place and don't be taken in by the attractive photos on the website.", "Date": "August 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cNice location, but odd staff and very dirty bathrooms....\u201d", "Author": "bigdaddy1000", "ReviewID": "UR37368070", "Content": "We like to stay near Bourbon street, but not directly on it, so we chose this hotel as we had never stayed here before and it is about 2 blocks off Bourbon.

The rooms in the Herman house (especially those on the second floor) are relatively small but are very nice - exposed brick, high ceilings with beams, etc. The room itself definitely felt very old school New Orleans (note that the main hotel didn't appear to have this type of feel - we could see drop ceilings and flourescent lighting. It did appear that the rooms around the pool were old school as well. The bathrooms are definitely not old school - look more like a remodel occurred in the 80s with no update since. The bathroom was also pretty much filthy when we arrived. The toilet clearly had not even been wiped down (smudges and stains on the rim) and the bathtub still had wet footprints in it from the previous guest. We mentioned this to the desk clerk on duty on our way out for the day and they seemed genuinely surprised and advised that someone would be right up to clean up the bathroom. No such luck. We came back late and the bathroom was still the same - it was clear that no maid had been in our room to do anything. The next morning, we purposely left a small piece of hair on the rim when we went out. We stopped by and mentioned the bathroom situation to the clerk on duty and once again were advised it would be taken care of. Imagine our surprise when we returned and found the exact same problems. We complained at checkout and the manager who was available then acted somewhat put off by our complaint, actually stating that we hadn't specifically asked for the toilet to be wiped down - Since when is this a special request!?! After 20 minutes of dicussion, we were offered a $20 discount per night and sent on our way. It is also worth noting that you get a couple beer/wine coupons to the next door bar, which used to be a brothel. Neat place, but once again a bit too much of the 80s brass and glass re-do remains. We asked two different bartenders for food recommendations and got the lamest most indiferent attitude imaginable from both of them.

I was in New Orleans to attend a conference at the Ritz Carlton. My husband was tagging along so we turned it into a semi-vacation, and because he was with me, I didn't want to stay at the Ritz since the location was a bit out of the way, and I wanted more amenities. I spent weeks researching French Quarter hotels on TripAdvisor, other sites, and guidebooks, and decided on the Dauphine Orleans. What a great decision! This was our 4th visit to New Orleans in the past 9 years. Previously we stayed at the Sheraton, W French Quarter, and Omni Royal Orleans. Although the Omni has a slight edge on location, the Dauphine Orleans' rooms are twice the size for half the cost. We were only 3 blocks from the conference, which made for an easy walk to and from. My friends who stayed at the Ritz because they didn't know better visited my room and were a bit jealous... they all said they wished they had booked the Dauphine Orleans instead. They loved the charm and character. I had originally booked a Premium King Carriage House room, but called the hotel a week before my stay to upgrade to a Superior King in the Hermann House courtyard, which is right across the street. Another great decision. We arrived before the stated check-in time but our room was ready. We were in room #236, which is the upper level front room with a very large balcony. Amazing! There is a locked gate leading from Dauphine Street into the courtyard-- guests use their room key to open it. There is no elevator, so if you get a 2nd floor room be prepared to use the stairs. The room was huge! There were brick walls on 2 sides, a vaulted/beamed ceiling, and two doors leading to the balcony. A granite-top vanity was outside the bathroom, which made it easy for both of us to get ready in the morning. There was generous storage space in the vanity's drawers and cabinets. There was a closet with 10 hangers and room for more, plus the safe was in the closet. The bathroom had a jacuzzi tub (we didn't use) and good shower pressure. Towels were soft & fluffy. The room had a fridge, LCD TV, track lighting, and the VERY comfy bed. One of my favorite features of the hotel was the Hermann House courtyard. So lush & tropical! Tables, chairs, and benches were provided, which made it a nice place to read or relax... very quiet. I saw a hot tub in a secluded corner, but it was covered so I'm not sure when it is used. We did not use the pool in the main hotel area, but lots of families were taking advantage of it. We didn't use the exercise room, either. We did, however, enjoy some wine in the hotel bar using the free drink coupons. Nice little place, and we wished we had time to go back again. We ate breakfast two mornings in the hotel's breakfast room. Perfectly fine... my husband always enjoys making waffles, and I thought there was a nice variety of breakfast foods & drinks. All of the hotel staff members were very friendly and helpful... from the front desk staff, to the bartender, to the breakfast host, and the parking attendants we passed. Roger, the reservations rep who helped me with my room selection, was great, as well. Some minor inconveniences to mention... Although I loved the room and the balcony, the balcony doors were less insulating than I'd like, and street noise woke me up a lot. I'm a light sleeper anyway, and used to my quiet street at home... so all the delivery trucks, an occasional laying on the horn, and passing groups of motorcycles were a bit too loud for me. Not the hotel's fault, but I'd probably ask for a room in the back of the building next time, although my husband didn't mind the noise as much. Another minor problem was a lack of hot water on day #2 for me. It was only lukewarm, but got hot for my husband's shower 10 minutes later. Also, the hotel's guest computer was out of service during our stay so we weren't able to check the internet. We didn't bring a laptop to use the free Wifi, but just lived without email for a couple of days. No biggie, but if you absolutely need the lobby's computer you may want to call ahead to make sure it's working. From reading earlier reviews, I had been a little concerned about hordes of smokers congregating in the courtyards, but I didn't encounter this at all. I'm very sensitive to smoke so I would have noticed it. Even the bar didn't have any smokers in it when we were there. So overall, we had a wonderful stay at the Dauphine Orleans! I highly recommend it, and it will be our first choice when visiting New Orleans in the future. (This review was edited to correct the room number...

I had been to Nola once before, when I was sixteen, but he had never been there before, and I wanted him to feel the magic I remembered the city for. We chose the Dauphine because the descriptions and pictures looked like the kind of traditional hotel we wanted. Upon arrival, however, we were dissapointed to find that they were renovating. Our room was newly renovated, beautiful and very clean. Unfortunately, it was very modern and not exactly what we were looking for. After passing construction workers in the hall several times and walking past the \"Please excuse our mess\" signs several times, we decided to ask for a different room. She was very happy to show us another option, and we immediately fell in love. The large room was separate from the regular hotel rooms, and looked out into a beautiful area. It had it's own separate entrance and large balcony. The room was large, the bathroom was huge and it was gorgeous. There was also a small wet bar and small refrigerator. Unfortunately, New Orleans in August is stifling, and our air conditioner stopped working our third night. We called several times to have it looked at, and after getting it going again, it again broke. They explained that they couldn't fix it, and offered to move us to another room. This time we were moved to another incredibly private room above Mae Bailey's, the hotel bar. This room was incredibly large in size, had two separate bathrooms (a ladies and a gentleman's, the ladies had a large tub and dressing table area, the gentleman's held the sink, toilet and shower) as well as a huge walk-in closet and a second decent-sized closet. I don't recommend the room to non-smokers, as although you are not permitted to smoke in the room, it reeks of stale smoke. My husband and I attributed this to the fact that it was located directly above the bar. There was no refrigerator in this room, and the staff member who assisted our move offered to attempt to find one to bring up, though we declined the offer. In all, we loved the hotel, though I must say that we were not impressed with the staff overall. One employee was incredibly helpful - unfortunately, she was rarely there. They did give us a complimentary bottle of Champagne in celebration of our marriage (it stated on their site that this was included for all honeymooners), though we had to ask for it. While there isn't an on-site restaurant, there are many within a short walking distance. The hotel is in a great location, right in the French Quarter, but is far enough from Bourbon Street that the noise doesn't really reach the area. The hotel did offer a breakfast (I believe it was $6 per person). They serve it in a little room off of the outdoor area where the pool is located. It's incredibly informal, and things like fresh fruit bagels, toast, waffles, cereal, yogurt, croissants, were offered. The staff places the items there, but it is self serve, and there are toasters, etc. there as well if you choose to have a toasted english muffin, etc. Also, I recall there being orange juice, coffee and milk. The beds were incredibly comfortable (I still intend to call and find out what kind of mattresses they have on those beds!).

Property is very pretty, well maintained courtyard with a small pool and a small gym. Courtyard was very nice for just having morning coffee or a glass of wine after dinner. They serve a pretty basic Costco type continental breakfast which is a nice plus, but just beware of hungry families on the rampage for free food in the morning. Not everyone remembers manners when it comes to free danish, I guess. Still, a nice touch. They have a hotel bar called May Baileys, you get a free drink coupon when you check in. The coupon is ONLY good for beer or wine, no longer good for mixed drinks. While a nice touch, seems a little stingy. The bar is a nice little locals place. Went there a couple of times and it was mostly empty. This is not really a FULL SERVICE hotel, i.e. no concierge, doorman or room service, but when you need help, everyone is more than willing. Also WIFI is FREE!! And it worked fine. This will normally bump your stay by 10 or 15 bucks a day at a bigger hotel.

I was unaware of this level of a charge until I arrived (it was not mentioned on the Priceline page). That said, I got a fantastic price from Priceline (only $62 per night) so all-in-all, price was great. We were immediately greeted very positively by the parking valet who offered to tell us about the best places in town. The hotel is old (of course) and is located in the heart of the French Quarter just one block off Bourbon Street. Even so, it was quiet and very subdued and most of the people we saw were in our age group (50-60). Check in was very quick and courteous and we were in our room on the 3rd floor in a matter of minutes. Even with the Priceline pricing, we did receive a King Room (nice). The room was very clean and comfortable - lots of pillows - and a good A/C system. The bath was dated but still very functional. The flat screen TV was a nice touch and free internet is something that many hotels actually charge for (and it was actually high speed). May Bailey's (the bar located on the first floor) was a bit overrated - at least the night we stopped in. The drinks were done well but fairly pricey and the server was disinterested ..... took a while to get her attention and then even longer to get her attention a second time. By the time we were able to get her attention, we had pretty much given up on having a second drink. Breakfast is free but very basic (pretty much what you'd find in any mid-class motel). with strawberries and cantaloupe as the fresh fruit, bagels, toast, some cereal, and one waffle maker. There was plenty of fresh orange juice and coffee (both important!). The room was surprisingly quiet except for our last night there when people above us decided to simply throw their trash off their balcony rather than in the trash but that's not the hotel's fault. Our first night there was also our first night in Orleans (ever) and, frankly, our walk from the hotel to Bourbon Street was a little scary. Dauphine Street is dark as is the connector street to Bourbon Street (St. Louis). As the evenings went on, it became much less so and everyone we passed or came across seemed pretty friendly and normal. I'm not sure I would have been comfortable walking around too late when the crowds went down but I guess that would be the case in any city.

They were painting and putting finishing touches on the second floor while we were there. Our room was great...better than I expected. It was extremely clean and crisp. The decor is a nice blend of traditional and contemporary, all done in neutral colors.

Our room faced another building but that was ok. We weren't there to look out the window. The bathroom was clean and had extra towels, washclothes, bath products and a bath robe. There was minimal drawer space in the room so keep that in mind, you will need to hang most things up and may need more hangars. We were ok as we were not doing anything too dressy so it wasn't an issue. The internet access worked but was a bit slow. That was ok for the most part as it was free and wireless. There was an inroom coffee maker which we didn't utilize. The A/C was perfect for us, the bedding was clean our room was done up each day. No problem with our comfort in the room. The Breakfast: I have read mixed reviews of the breakfast. I agree with them. It was included so we did eat at it 3 of the 4 days. The breakfast room was always clean and there were more than enough tables. I think I counted seats for at least 25 people, plus more tables under umbrellas right outside the door by the pool. The food was what you expect for a free continental. You could make your own waffles out of batter (not frozen). Fresh cut fruit, really good mint tea and coffee was good. Ass't breads for toasting, cereal. Was supposed to be yogurt but it was never stocked when I went. I think that the breakfast attendant DOES stock and restock unlike what other reviewers have said, but the food is kind of all on top of each other in one little spot I think it was just as hard for her to stock as it was for us to get to the food. You were kind of on top of each other as you made toast and someone reached for cereal etc. The common areas: Far and away the worst part of the hotel was the elevators. They worked but are in a poor state-the wood paneling is coming off the interior, the floor tiles are cracked, they are dirty and the feel like they may be on their last legs. We never got stuck or anything but I always breathed a sigh of relief that we didn't. As they are redoing the hotel I hope the elevators are part of it. The hallway on our floor was always clean, quite and well lit. The lobby was small-as others have said. It was clean and pretty and it was a lobby. Who cares if it isn't a hot spot to hang out in? If you are going all the way to New Orleans to hang out in a hotel lobby that is your first problem! Swimming Pool-we never got around to using it but it was always clean, stocked with fluffy towels and it looked inviting to me. Just couldn't fit it in. May Baileys-We went for our free drinks, it looked like we had just missed a happy hour with cheese and some hot food. The bartender was very friendly, the mixed drink was great and my husband liked the Abita beer which is local. As some places are pricey for drinks it was nice to have one on them. We did not use the parking garage, but I am sure it was fine. Location: We were around the corner from the heart of Bourbon Street. We never heard a thing though. The hotel was extremely quiet and that was great for sleeping in. We were a 1 minute walk to Bourbon, a 10 minute walk to Canal Street or St. Charles. Very centrally located. This is a boutique style hotel so if you are looking for the sameness of a Marriott or other chain this isn't for you. (Don't get me wrong, I stay in Marriotts all the time but a city like New Orleans deserves something a little different) If you need room service and a big lavish lobby look elsewhere. If you want a quiet spot that is pretty and comfortable after a long day touring or a long night drinking then the Dauphine Orleans is a great spot for you.

The driver knew exactly where the hotel was and was able to point out some interesting places for us along the way - Bourbon Street, Harrah's Casino etc ;-) We had booked our room through the hotel's website and everything was okay when we arrived. We got a nice room overlooking the parking lot, which did not give us any problems during our stay. We also got vouchers for the hotel bar. After a quick stroll on Bourbon, only a block away from the hotel, we went to bed in the wonderful soft beds. The room also had a big tv and a large and clean bathroom and an aircon which worked with no problems. We also had a special air-cleaning unit as it was a smoking room, but the air-cleaning unit did it's job and we were not able to smell any smoke at all while there. The breakfast and coffee was good and we also enjoyed the small pool. A big plus as we were in New Orleans in August and it was very, very hot and humid. All staff were friendly and we liked the free car whose driver took us to Harrah's at night.

I was worried after reading several reviews about the staff and the overall condition of the hotel (as many have said as well) but it turned out to be wonderful! I was on the 4th floor in room 404 which is newly renovated and that floor is complete, the 3rd floor was under renovation but we heard no construction noise our entire stay (they are not renting out the unrenovated rooms). The air in our room worked perfectly, which let me tell you after walking around in 90 degree weather all day it was quite nice to come back to a very chilled room! The bathroom is updated (see pictures) with full marble (this was a standard double bed room). It has tempurpedic mattresses which mold to your body after a few min of laying down and a flat screen tv for your viewing enjoyment. Maid service was great except for one day when we slept in until almost 11 (long night on bourbon) and they skipped our room, but with one call to the front desk we had fresh towels and bed linens at our door in minutes. Valet parking was marginal, we had to wait numerous times for the parking attendant to show up, even with that problem I do recommend the service because street parking is horrible and you cant find a spot nearby thats longer than 2hr parking. They have a continental breakfast that is very good but be warned, get there before 10 (it goes till 11) because they don't restock anything, so when the last bagel is gone, its gone and thats it.....I recommend just doing brunch at a restaurant nearby. The grounds are wonderful and the pool area is clean but small. The bar is dark and outdated but great for your free drink voucher that you get upon arrival. The hotel is within walking distance to everything the French Quarter has to offer as well as the riverwalk, harrahs casino, and the aquarium/imax. It is a very family friendly hotel and it felt very safe for our stay. The elevators do open up to the parking garage and they do smell of gas, but what do you expect? it opens up to the garage! Space is very limited in this city. The lobby is upscale and the lady's behind the front desk are nice and helpful.

We learned that Katrina flooding landlocked the french quarter but it didn't flood, so the buildings were not damaged there. We found the staff to be welcoming (not effusive, but polite, professional and very helpful). The small courtyard was lovely (weather was unseasonably cold for us to use the pool. And we were lucky and bold enough to ask for a newly rennovated room They gladly switched us from the second floor to 417 in the main building. It was lovely - everything brand new, bedding, furniture, flat screen tv. Soft towels, a robe and comfy beds. We never used the coffee maker (a pod style 2 cuper) because the coffee at breakfast (available 6:30 to 11) was delish & strong. Breakfast was simple so we made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. They also had hard boiled eggs, croissants, juice and sometimes belgian waffles. Free wireless connection was powerful & easy to use. Guest computer in the lobby is connected to the office printer and the staff gladly retrieved maps & tickets we needed to print. We used the in room safe for our valubles, even our laptops. One Macbook and a 15\" dell lattitude which I was able to gently cram in after removing the battery. Honestly, I did not get the feeling we needed to use the safe, but well, just to be safe, we did. We highly recommend it and will return. Also a tip: We rented bikes instead of a car and were very happy about that decision. The traffic in the French Quarter (esp in the evening) is miserable. Getting bikes into the elevator and the room was a tight squeeze but better and far cheaper than dealing with parking. Lots of cyclists in New Orleans - very few seem to follow rules of the road.

It was hard to enjoy the tepid temperature of the jacuzzi, and every morning I had to face the prospect of a cold shower. I complained numerous times at the front desk, yet nothing was ever done. 2) The chain inside the toilet broke, and we asked them to fix that as well.

It was re-stocked every day, so our makeshift cooler (a large garbage can in our room) stayed nice and full of ice! The only complaint I have, and it was only on one day, was the maid service. Each day, the maid service manager would come by, knock on the door, and check to see that our room had been cleaned to our satisfaction. One day, the maid (who spoke zero English) came by, cleaned the room, took all of our dirty towels, and left no clean towels! And this was the one day the maid service manager didn't stop by. We called down to the front desk, but the towels never came. We finally had to call and fuss a little, but we did finally get clean towels. The maid did put clean sheets on the bed each day which you don't even find in chain hotels these days.

Both are shockingly uneven (at times very nice, the next moment just horrible). My partner and I, as well as friends stayed here for a few days over the Halloween weekend. Everyone in the group has been to NOLA numerous times both pre-and-post Katrina. Our stay was in room 219. Using the Trip Advisor rating system I give this property two stars because it is \"Okay, but with some problems\". Frankly I think this is very generous based on our experience there. How this hotel got listed on this site as a four star class hotel is absolutely beyond me. It is, AT BEST, a low three star class hotel. In fact, they don't even have a restaurant so this can't possibly be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153four star\" hotel because by definition it is not a full service property. One big part of the problem is that, even a year after Katrina, this property is STILL under renovation. Of course they don't mention this on their website. My understanding is that the renovated rooms are pretty okay, but the old rooms (such as the one we were in) are downright awful. I also don't appreciate it when a hotel makes misrepresentations on their website. From DauphineOrleans.com: \"In EVERY ROOM (emphasis added), you will find a hair dryer, bathrobes, goose down pillows, body pillows, irons and ironing boards, and a valuables vault. When you return to your room each evening, you will be delighted to find that your bed has been turned down and a treat left on your pillow.\" While some of the above is true, there are also several inaccuracies, if not outright lies. The pillows were foam (and hard), not goose down. There were no \"body pillows\" and there was certainly no turndown service provided or even offered. Their maid service in general was almost totally missing in action. I understand there are post-Katrina labor issues, but the other hotels I've stayed at in the Quarter seem to have conquered the bad housekeeping issue and the cleaning staff at the Dauphine is still skating along using that tired excuse. PROS: Okay location, we got a cheap rate, heating/cooling were very effective, soft water filter was nice, free welcome drink in the hotel bar. CONS: Elevators worked intermittently, hotel undergoing renovation but that isn't mentioned when you book, rooms are thoroughly worn out (beat up furniture, hard mattress, lousy foam pillows, heat lamp and regular bathroom light are on the SAME switch...you couldn't have one without the other so it was always swelteringly hot, housekeeping is very shoddy (even though we tipped daily), there is no door on the closet, light fixture falling from the ceiling, security chain lacked the hook part, rooms over garage are very noisy (cars coming/going, alarms in the middle of the night, staff whistling/singing in the garage, etc.), interior rooms have no view to speak of, rude and/or incompetent staff (were yelled at for calling the front desk to complain about a car alarm going off in the hotel garage for several minutes at 4AM)...honestly I could go on forever but I think you get the idea.

We had stayed at the Dauphine in December of 2003 and had an outstanding stay with them. We were thrilled to visit them once again a year later for our wedding anniversary. I had even written them a letter prior to our arrival stating how wonderful our first stay with them had been. I went out of my way to contact higher management as well to tell them how terrific the hotel and staff had been to us in 2003. With that said, we were expecting our second stay to be just as memorable and romantic. We arrived to a warm welcome and were sent to our room on the second floor. I was a little disappointed at the size of the room since we had stayed in a larger room the year before. Everything seemed wonderful though as we received a knock on the door a few moments later. They delivered a chilled bottle of champagne and anniversary wishes complimentary of the hotel. We were delighted. Our first nights stay was comfortable and uneventful. Upon waking the following morning, we realized we had very little water pressure coming from the the shower head. I contacted the front desk and they said they'd fix the problem a.s.a.p. We left for the day and returned that evening to a note stating that the problem had been fixed by maintenance. We turned the showed on and still only got a very small trickle of water. I called the front desk and they immediately let us switch rooms due to the problem. Everything seemed great and we were even sent to a much larger room on the same floor. The water pressure seemed better but not great and we were then told it could be a universal problem with the entire hotel. We were fine with that since they had done what they could to resolve the situation to our satisfaction. Upon retiring for the night I walked into the bathroom to find dried \"feces\" on the toilet seat. We had just checked into our room and neither myself or my husband had used the restroom at that point. I was disgusted. I looked outside the room to see if there was still a maid on duty. The room next to ours was still being cleaned at that point and I told the maid of the situation. She seemed busy and irritated when I told her of the problem. After the toilet was cleaned properly I contacted the front desk to speak with a manager. There was no manager on duty at the time but I was told that he would contact when he came back to the office. A few minutes later he contacted me and seemed as if the situation was not a big deal. He said we could move rooms once again but only offered us one room to look at. Upon looking at this very tiny room we decided to stay in our current larger room. I decided to lay in bed and watch t.v. before going to sleep. As I layed down and pulled the covers over myself I felt something on the bed spread. I turned the light on and to my surprise there were several \"crusty\" looking stains on the comforter. I could only imagine what this could be and told my husband we had to check out. He agreed since we were not staying in this hotel if our room had not been properly cleaned. We have stayed in many hotels over the years and I've never ran into anything like this. I expect a clean well kept room at a classy hotel such as the Dauphine Orleans. We contacted the manager once again and told him that we had to check out. He said okay and didn't try to rectify the situation any further. When I got home I contacted the hotel via a typed letter. I told the head of the hotel what had happened and after 3 months have still yet to hear back from anyone regarding our last stay. It's a shame that we had to experience these things at this lovely hotel. Unfortunately we will not stay at this hotel ever again.

A bright spark was the concierge; he had it together, but was bored as well. The new room was large, well worn, upstairs and in the back of the main building. The in-room safe had a key lock, no other security avail. The woman at the desk said, just take your key with you. The heater worked at 60 and 85 but nothing in-between, the bathroom, tho beautiful was exceptionally cold and the mini-bar had an alarm type thing go off at 7:30ish each morning for 10 mins. Let the desk know they said someone would fix. We were interrupted 6-7 times, people would rattle our door, (so no naps) and the maintenance man came at 7pm, said he had a fire in the laundry, and that the last maintenance man was unlicensed and everything was broken. He talked for another 1/2 hr, then said he had to go home, his shift was over and would be back at 10 am the next day to fix things. Tea was laughable, the room was dark and they made a joke about San Diego women being afraid of the dark and to just turn on the lights. You could heat your own water in your paper cup and use some teabags in the boxes and they had a plate of danish cookies out. The shuttle driver had to be found and then didn't know where 2 streets were in the quarter, mentioned we could have just walked. Mollys was usually closed or the staff missing. The morning after the 2nd night saw the desk clerk and she had no idea there was anything wrong in the room and then said if the maintenance guy said he would come back, then it was already taken care of.

It was my first time visiting The Big Easy and it surpassed all of my expectations. New Orleans is truly a wonderful city to visit, and from what I am told visiting in December when we did is the way to go. As for the Dauphine, where to begin. We booked our room through Travelocity and got an excellent rate. The room was a standard room so our expectations were pretty basic. Actually, my wife and I are not into spending large sums of money on hotels since we hardly spend any time in the room other than to sleep. As long and the hotel is clean, centrally located, and the staff is friedly, we are happy. We arrived at our room and I was really dissapointed. The hallway (the 2nd floor) reeked of cigarette and bad smelling disinfectant, not a good sign. Our room itself was adequate as far as size but there were a lot of small unsatisfactory details. There was a dirty towel left on our bathroom floor, one of the lights in the bathroom was out, and the remote control to the T.V. wasn't working, and our folding closet doors were falling off their hinges. Not neccesarily big issues, but enough things to give an overall negative impression. We were too tired after a long day of flying to change rooms so we just made the best of it and decided to get to bed early to get an early start in the moring. About 2:00 I wake up shivering, I got out of bed to turn the heat up...nothing. The heater had broken. I put on a sweater and crawled back into bed. The next moring I told the front desk of our situations and they immediatly offered us an upgrade to a suite. Of course, we accepted. They gave us the keys to three rooms and told us to check them out and pick the one we liked best. I think the suite we ended up with was the best suite in the main building. It was a corner suite on the third floor with three windows and two balconies. The sitting area was large, as was the room as a whole. The complimentary breakfast at the hotel is great. Krispy Kreme donuts, cereal, fresh fruit, juice and bagels, and of course Belgian Waffles fresh from the iron. A really great way to start your day off. Overall, our experience in the Dauphine was great. The location of the hotel is fantastic, the staff courteous, a generally nice place to stay for the money.

Some of her favorite places we only found because of advice from Dauphine staff. One incident that really sticks in my mind - my daughter left her pacifier out by the pool, and later that day we actually had a valet spot us walking on Dauphine St and chase us down, just to give it back to her. Incredible!! Thanks, Dauphine, for the beautiful hotel and impeccable service - we'll be back next year!

May Baileys is a quaint little bar attached to the hotel and you get a free drink coupon when you check in, be sure not to miss it. We highly recommend Petunias restaurant for a breakfast you won't soon forget. It's only a half block from the hotel on St.Louis Street. You can spend a fortune at the well known restaurants on authentic cajun and creole cuisine, or you could take our advice and try the Gumbo Shop and have some of the best local dishes at a fraction of the prices the \" names \" charge you. Try the Shrimp Creole, and Gumbo. For dessert, the bread pudding with whiskey sauce will make you glad you were born !! The Cafe DuMond, of course, is a must for the beignets and cafe au lait. Lines can be exceptionally long at peak times, try mid morning or early evening and you won't have a problem. If you find Waylon Thibodeaux, one of the greatest Cajun-Zydeco fiddle players ever, down on Bourbon Street, you are in for a real treat. When you hear Waylon play, you'll know you are in New Orleans. Last tip, Check out the French Market and attached flea market for souveigners before you buy them for 3X the price on Bourbon Street or Decatur Street. They are the same merchandise without the overhead of the high rent areas built in. We learned the hard way !! Have a great time, I know you will love this town as much as we do.

There was also iced tea with cookies in the afternoon, which was a nice touch. While you can book this hotel as part of a package from many on-line sites, we wanted a courtyard room and so called the hotel directly. We do recommend the courtyard rooms, but they are slightly higher priced. The courtyard provided a wonderful respite after a day's touring, but if you book a room in the main building if that is your price range, you can still use your key card to go into their courtyard. Either way, we highly recommend the Daupnine Orleans Hotel. Also, this hotel as seems to be the practice, will raise rates every weekend as there is some kind of a festival every weekend. We found out that Sunday nite is considered part of weekend festival rates, and so we scheduled our vacation for Monday through Saturday and had the benefit of the midweek rates. Discounts are also offered and if you qualify this will make this hotel an even better value. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful. When we had our bags taken to our room after checking in, the Bell Man was very helpful in recommending a nice place for lunch. Our room was cleaned thoroughly and disinfected to counteract the high humidity. There is a van to take you to the waterfront area, or the nearby business district, but there was no return pick-up. While this was free, a gratuity was of course expected. We also booked a couple of tours through the front desk, in one case they were able to get the van to stop for us so we could get on the earlier tour. The price was same, and any advertised discounts were honored by their cashier. Eating in the New Orleans French Quarter is not cheap, but during the week there are some coupons, discounts or free bottles of wine. We liked NOLA, Emiril's restaurant in the French Quarter proper, and Bacco, an Italian restaurant. Both were pricey but worth it. For a more economical dinner, we went to Petunia's just around the corner from the Dauphine Orleans. One dinner we had on the steamboat Nachez, and a wonderful ride up he Missisippi River. A lot of activity centers around Jackson Square and the Cibildo, a City Hall type building from the original settlement, which was where the Louisiana Purchase the signed and finalized. There are nearby places for lunch, or supper, and mule-drawn buggy rides on the water side of the park. The other big attraction is of course Bourbon Street. You can choose what you want here, jazz clubs, food and drink, or just walking up and down the street. We found that while they are required to serve drinks in paper cups, the people were very neat and properly disposed of the cups and the street was always clean. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to New Orleans and the Dauphine Orleans Hotel, and have no hesitation in recommending it for your stay in New Orleans.", "Date": "July 24, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bothell, WA", "Title": "\u201cCharmiing Place, relaxing stay !\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2311264", "Content": "This hotel was just great!

Check-in late Friday afternoon and get a bad taste of the hotel right from the start. Given our room key which was for a courtyard/pool view room. We got the courtyard in the buiding across the street from the main building. Up a couple flights of stairs, get to the room and the room had not been made and actually still had personal belongings in it. So it's back down and across the street to get another room - no apologies, just another key. Get into our room and none of the lights work - turns out everything is unplugged including the air fresheneing system they advertise (need to save on those electric bills?). Room is nice enough - exposed brick walls and vaulted ceilings with wood trusses add ambience far beyond any standard chain hotel. A bit on the small side but considering where you are and the age of the buildings - very passable. Jacuzzi tub with a dual shower head was great. Ask to use the advertised shuttle service to take us out to Commander's Palace for lunch and we are met with a deaf ear - no explanation just that they will get us a taxi. (Did take advantage of the shuttle later that evening for a ride to dinner.) Second day into our stay - need more toiletries. Ask to have additional toilet paper and bar of soap delivered - never receive it. Also, my electric shaver dies on me and I have no razor back-up. call the front desk to see if they have anything available and advise that there is a drug store 4 blocks away. Stop in at Mae Bailey's for a drink Friday night. Great atmosphere - but air conditioning is broken. Catherine the bartender says it is being fixed the next day. Air-conditioning is broken all 3 nights. On the up side - the Dauphine's location is terrific. The rooms were fine and had great character/ambience. Mae bailey's was great but a bit uncomfortable. Having spent an average of $190 per night for our stay, I would say that I am less than enthusiastic about the Dauphine Orleans.

The bed, complete with goose down pillows is wonderful after spending a night out on Bourbon street. Friendly staff all the way around, clean rooms & public areas, speedy maid service every morning.", "Date": "August 18, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Dauphine Orleans Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d111969-Reviews-Dauphine_Orleans_Hotel-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "Price": "$113 - $264*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">415 Dauphine St.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New Orleans</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">LA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">70112</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "111969", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/29/6b/296ba40fd3216abbd2267d4f9e10b9dc3large.jpg"}}

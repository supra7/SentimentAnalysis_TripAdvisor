The court yard was beautiful with flowers and pine trees and a fountain with brick walk path and gates around. Front desk was very helpful for finding a post office and getting logged in to internet. They had vending machines, ice machines, and bike rentals were 2 streets away. There is maid service but i kept the do not disturb sign on my door the whole 5 days. They put extra towels on the door knob and i told the maid thank you. A guy was pushing a sweeper every day trying to keep parking lot clean. Ice cream and 24 hr coffee shop was 1 hotel away.Internet worked everyday. Rooms were great for 2 people 4 people would be a little cramped. Bathroom was small but big shower made up for that. Bathroom very clean, tile floor and glass block window. New microwave, fridge, flat screen television, Mattress, air conditioner, sliding glass doors with 2 locks, lounge chairs, safe in closet. Big dresser and table and chairs were decent shape. I slept very well every night i was there. Honesty the only bad thing was the carpeting and i found out that the people that sealed the driveway was to blame for that not Days inn. Wear slippers thats what i did. From the minute i got there to the minute we left Days Inn made my vacation the very best. I would return in a heart beat and have a wonderful time. The hotel is not perfect but great enough for me and I'm a clean freak. When i go on vacation i take with me Pine sol, air freshener, Ant spray, baggie for remote and i won't let anything ruin my vacation. Adelina was the maid and she had our room spotless when when we arrived and she was very polite like everybody at Days Inn.

The rooms were disappointing. The ceiling was grungy in all the rooms I had been in (4 total). In my particular room, there was water damage, the ceiling was even peeling. The sheet on my bed was stained. The toilet ran all day and night. There was a bulb out in the bathroom. I mean, come on, there are, what?, 4 bulbs around the mirror and they couldn't take the time to replace one. Between my friends and I, I don't think anyone's safe worked either. Then the worst of it all was, the room where I was located was right next to the hotel bar which was actually underground so the sounds traveled up from underneath me then I had to listen to the patrons from the bar screaming and at one point everyone was SCREAMING the happy birthday song; being that at 1:30 I was awake I joined in with them. After all that I was thankful I only booked one night and stayed elsewhere. I also forgot to mention they put my reservation under the wrong name TWICE. However, the gentleman at the lobby desk was quite capable and apologetic. He was great. I felt a little coolness from the female employee.

I was told there would be and they would allow us to move. I was happy about that. Then I went in the bath room. There was a lot of hair in it that wasn't mine. My husband walked around in the room for a few minutes in his socks and the once white socks were now black on the bottom! Eeewww! The light switches were FILTHY!

The next day we did get a new room on the second floor. I refused to walk without shoes in both rooms. My husband walked in socks. Although they didn't get as filthy as they did in the first room there was some dirt on them. The sink in the bath room was very worn. I saw a couple of hairs in the bath that weren't mine. The rooms and bath were both very small. I did like the balcony, although the very low walls between neighbors meant no privacy. Outside our room was a staircase. On our first day on the second level someone either spilled food or regurgitated on a step. For the next two days it just sat there. I watched hotel employees, some of them with the cleaning crew, just walk by it and do nothing! That's why I have to give the service a very poor rating!

Hoping not to bring them home. We should have known something was up. When we arrived 2 hours after check in the room was still not ready. They said there was a late check out and they had to switch things out. I guess they were trying to treat the room, but it didn't work. The room had missing ceiling tiles, broken phone, ants, and the king size bed had long black hair all in it. Asked for new sheets and were told there were no fitted sheets for king left. We made the bed with queen too sheets. I did look at the mattress edges when we got there and never saw anything. Noticed one bed had a zipped cover on it. Of course I never saw bedbugs but figured if there were any bugs I'd know. I didn't know to look for bug shell casings or black spots.

The air conditioner worked great, the room was clean enough, and the bed was very comfortable. There were six pillows on each bed, which was great. The pool area was clean and the pool itself was sparkling. They had a DJ playing, and a waitress getting drinks (try the Mango Margaritta). The restaurant was a bit pricey for breakfast ($10 for 2eggs, 2pancakes, and 2bacon), but the food was very good. But definately don't get the orange juice (tiny, overpriced and mediocre taste).

Balconies are not private in any direction, and even though the rooms on this floor were all non smoking, the people on the next balcony had at least 10 people there and three of them were smoking so we had to come back in and close our door.

Last year was the first year that we had ...well an uncooperative stay. We have always arrived earlier than the check in time and we never expect any special treatment. We arrive early so the kids can enjoy a whole day at the beach or the pool. Well, when we arrived we were told the room is not ready and won't be until check in time ok..... When I made the reservations (2 rooms) I had requested that we be put back in the same room we have had in all the years past. My mother needed a handicap room. When we arrived they were placing us not on the first floor like we have had (and I might add I placed these reservations in January for a June stay). They were not giving my mother a handicap room. We weren't pleased at all with the way the gentleman at the front desk handled this situation. We however were able to talk to the manager and he placed both rooms on the first floor, and my mothers room was not handicapped. So to start the vacation we had a bad taste. Finally, able to get to the rooms and not at all what I expected, (we have stayed for years). The rooms were starting to fall apart, they were somewhat dirty and the air cond. did not work correctly. Both rooms had this problem. The fridge in our room did not get cold, the replaced it, after hours of complaining!!! We had brought food that needed to be in the fridge. I have to say I was very glad when we were done with this vacation. After all the hard work we had to do to get to go on a family vacation with the economy the way it is. Now, another year another vacation to schedule. I vote not to go back in fact not even to go to Ocean City after the bad taste last vacation left. When I went online to look for a new vacation, Days Inn was offering a wonderful to good to be true special!!! 25% if booked by a certain date, of course I took advantage of this and booked our vacation again months before June, In fact it still isn't June. I told the girl I booked it with that she was the only reason I was even coming back, she however, is the best person in the whole place. I then continued looking on the computer for a great deal elsewhere, not truly convinvced that things were going to be any better this year. I FOUND A GREAT DEAL elsewhere, you just have to keep looking. I then called to cancel my reservation, You know you have to send your deposit for your reservation within 10 days and that I did!!! if you don't follow the rules you won't have a room. So when I cancelled the resv. I was told the refund checks are only written on Fridays, I should have my refund in a couple weeks. I said I am cancelling my reserv on a Wed. why wouldn't it be written that Friday, I was told that is just the way it is. So needless to say a couple weeks went by and still not check. I called again, was told the same thing, checks will be written on Friday, more time has passed NO REFUND!!! I called again, and I asked what the status of my refund was, they put me on hold and said they spoke with corporate and they said they write checks on Friday!!!! I then asked the person I was speaking with to let me speak with a manager or could they give me corporates number I was told NO on both accounts. I said to the girl that I needed to get this problem resolved. I asked if she could give my number to corporate and have them call me back, she said no they don't do that. I asked her what I was supposed to do, I am getting nowhere and I don't have my refund. She then got very nasty and I mean nasty with me. I told her there had to be someone who was in charge, if I had to I would contact Days Inn main office, she said go ahead, we're privately owned and there is nothing they can do about it. I told her that I would make sure that everyone, would hear about this uncooperative way of doing business. She said how would you do that, I told her I would Facebook, put it on Trip Adv. and tell as many people as I could. So I did contact Days Inn complaint dept. they did register a complaint and told me that I should hear by the end of the week. However, they're privately owned and that complaint may not get me anywhere. Wanted everyone to know if this is happening to me, it could happen to you!!!!

I called the front desk informing them that the bag was left on the bed and the manager Jimmy promised to look into it. After a number of calls back and forth he claimed housekeeping did not see it, and that he would check the laundry department, they also claimed they did not see it. giving them the benefit of the doubt I said to him this bag weighed about 8lbs if in fact housekeeping swooped up the sheets on the bed and it went down to the laundry then what happends after you take it out of the washer to the dryer would'nt it then feel the weight or even after drying and you fold dont you think it would have been there.

The room we finally got had gaps all the way around the room door. The air conditioner was mounted right about the door and set on 68 degrees in order to cool the room adequately - probably due to the gaps in the door! I found this ironic, as their information cards boasted \"green\" initative with reuse of the towels, energy efficient light bulbs, etc. The mini-fridge door rubbed on the carpet making it difficult to open, so the new carpet is not going to last long!

I was able to find an extremely reasonable price for the room-Oceanfront on the Boardwalk and wasnt sure what to expect. What i found was an older hotel that has recently tried to upgrade the rooms with new beds, a flat screen TV and (I think) new bath fixtures. The hotel is old, but overall, i was pleased with it for a weekend. Having a teenaged son, being directly on the boardwalk is definately an advantage. I dont know if i could take it for a week-the oceanfront room we had was quite small-but for 2 days, it was fine. i wanted to be on the boardwalk this time of year because once summer starts, the boardwalk can be noisey. The hotel is literally 15 ft from the actual boardwalk, and we were on the 2nd floor-so no privacy at all-if u wanted to keep the doors open. That, along with the general age of the hotel were the only real downfalls. The staff was just great...i asked for towels and coffee and within minutes they arrived. My AC did not work and again, within minutes, someone from maintenance was there to fix. The best feature is the heated pool-we were able to get in on both Friday and Saturday. The lounge chairs were comfortable and there is a pool bar on weekends. Again, I got a great deal online for this room and for the money, it worked out fine. The only thing i would not recommend is the restaurant on premises.

A pool for the kids (even next to the beach.

This summer, we tried to book late and could not get what we wanted from either of the above properties, so we tried the Days Inn instead. It was between the other two properties geographically, and in terms of cost and amenities. The Days Inn has apparently been updated recently, and the Ocean View Suite was excellent. it is only one big room but the furniture is arranged to create some privacy between the bedroom side (queen bed) and the living room side (convertible sofa). Each side has a television. The kitchennette has a full refigerator, dish washer, sink, toaster, micro and a hotplate. The bathroom looks like new and the room was very clean. The Days Inn has two pools with a pool side bar in between that serves bar food as well as drinks. There is a restaruant that we tried for breakfast and it was okay but there are better values elsewhere on the island. The location is 23rd Street. This is not quite as convenient as the Quality Inn on 17th Street but it is next to the only row of Boardwalk shops north of 18th Street so it is easy to get pizza, ice cream, and souvenirs. Inland from the Boardwalk, Phillips Crab House, a Wine shop, Candy Kitchen, and mini-golf are within a couple blocks. The staff were friendly and helpful. All-in-all, it exceeded our expectations.

There were no shelves in the bathroom, which caused me to place my items on the sink, and clothes on the toilet lid. The screen to the balcony door was ripped off the frame of the door.

When he got to the room he looked at the screen and then asked me if I even needed a screen for the door, which really upset me. I am paying $149.99 a night for a room, I would like the option to open the balcony glass door and close the screen so that I can get a breeze in the very small room.

Also the balcony was supposed to have dividers between the rooms, mine did not, in fact the whole third floor did not, which also upset me, but since they could only move me to the first floor I had to deal with it. When I took the virtual tour it showed the dividers. I was not expecting a 5 star hotel, however for the price I was paying a night I feel really ripped off.

The pull out sofa bed had a huge dip in the middle and our sons ended up sleeping on the edge of the mattress. We asked for a diiferent room, but was told they were booked solid, though the suite next door to ours was empty for 3/4 of our stay. There were unfinished repairs to a ceiling light in the corner of the kitchen, leaving on less light in an already dark room. The water pressure for the shower was awful. There should of been a schedule for when people were to shower. I attempted to take a shower one afternoon and there was absolutely no water coming from the shower, due to the pressure being so low. The housekeeping to the room became worse each day we were there. Each day, we had to ask to have the beds made and floor swept and vacumned. My husband would end up getting trash bags from the front desk, since the only trash can that was consistantly emptied was the one in the kitchen. This is a wounderful location..directly on the boardwalk and oceanfront, but there were no outdoor showers to spray off chairs and feet before returning to the rooms. This resulted in more sand that housekeeping did not clean up. There was a small buffet type place to eat at the hotel, but the food was not very good and the price was as bloated as the price of the room was. We will not stay at this hotel chain again, I feel I was taken advantage of.", "Date": "August 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "No. Illinois", "Title": "\u201cSo-So\u201d", "Author": "hlfch5", "ReviewID": "UR8226459", "Content": "After reading the reviews, I had no idea what to expect.

The people at the desk were very friendly & were not at all irritated when I came back down to ask a few questions. The only downside was that most parking was across the street. However, we were in walking distance of everything we wanted to do so this was no problem. We also had trouble ordering delivery from their pizza place.

The Studio Oceanfront Room was really beautiful and comfortable - just like the website. The standard Oceanfront room with two double beds was clean, but was smaller than your average hotel room, and was a little dated. The one thing I thought was strange was that the studio had a full size refrigerator and dishwasher, but had no stove. There was a two-burner hot plate in one of the cupboards. It wasn't a problem for me, but if you want to cook for a family, this could be a drawback. The Jacuzzi did not work. The hotel informed us that they don't advertise the Jacuzzi anymore, since there are so many maintenance problems with them. They offered to move us, but we didn't want to go through the trouble since we were only there for three days. They did, however, take 10% off our bill because of this. The view from the oceanfront balcony is absolutely gorgeous. The balconies on the 4th and 5th floors are large and very nice. The restaurant on-site had a marvelous all you can eat breakfast buffet. The grounds were nice. The staff was friendly. The maids didn't seem to knock themselves out cleaning, though. They gave you fresh towels and soap, cleaned the bathroom, and made your beds and that was about it. They didn't even vaccum daily. I was a little nervous about staying at this hotel because of all the bad reviews. It wasn't that bad. The major issue was the noise from the patrons. There was a college fraternity group staying there over the weekend and they were quite noisy. After they left on Sunday, things quieted down quite a bit. If you want a quiet, relaxing vacation - I don't think this is the place for you. I get the feeling that this is a popular hotel for college kids and party people. I'm sure it can be quite noisy in the summertime since it's right on the boardwalk. If you want quiet, I would suggest an off the boardwalk hotel, or only stay at this hotel through the week, off-season. If you like to party, go ahead and book your room now!", "Date": "May 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cNever again!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3907711", "Content": "Price for the family suite was good--that's about the best thing I can say about this hotel.

She pulled up the covers on the beds, dropped off towels, took trash, cleaned nothing, and left. The next day--same thing, including surly attitude. There was a plumbing problem we reported at 9:00AM. Maintenance finally arrived after 3:30PM. TV in the master bedroom didn't work. Three bedrooms, one alarm clock. Third day, housekeeping dropped off clean towels inside the door and did nothing else. Hotel is close to the beach which was nice, but lack of amenities and service put a real damper on our vacation.

When it wasn't, I trudges all teh way back to the front desk, lugging all of my stuff to ask where my room was. The man at the desk looked at me like I had 3 heads when I asked this, and did not understand why it dodn't make sense to me that the room was over by S103, tucked in a dingy corridor near the supply closet. Forget about a property map, that isn't going to happen. Oh- and there is one ice machine, go up to 3 to get to it. When I walked into the dingy, horrible, smelly room, I was appalled. I don't believe they sell lower wattage bulbs than what they were using in there and the AC was totally off, no fan or anything blowing. When I went ot unload my cooler into the refrigerator, I found it to be unplugged and covered with mold spots everywhere. Not to mention that it smelled like feet. I had no cleaning products with me, I do not travel with them as I should not have to when paying exhorbitant hotel rates. The carpet was dirty and stained and the bathroom was bad as well. The water pressure was practically non-existent and you could not get a comfortable water temperature. When the front desk was asked for more towels, I was very rudely informed that there was no one to bring them to me, I would have to go get them.

We made reservations three days ahead of time for this hotel. Our room was ready when we arrived, room #116 by the pool. This was not the room we were told about when we booked, but thought \"No big deal\". The room was very small and the bathroom was old and cruddy. Again, \"No big deal\", we wanted to get to the pool and the beach. We went out to dinner and returned around 11:00 pm to a rock concert in our room. The floor and walls were literally shaking from the loud obnoxious noise coming from below us. I immediately called the front desk to ask what was going on. It seems that the hotel rents the basement to a bar that hosts live heavy metal bands! I was told that the band would be playing until 2:00 am! We had just driven eight hours, getting up at 3:00 am so that we would arrive in OC by the afternoon and were completely exhausted. The desk clerk said there were no more rooms available that night to move us into, but that the next day there were openings. The music continued well after 2:00 am, so I called the desk again. The desk clerk had to call the OC police to get the bar to stop the music, which finally subsided around 3:00 am. There went the idea of going to bed early so that we could enjoy a full next day! Apparently this loud music can be heard in both room 115 and 116, and possibly other rooms in the vicinity, so beware! We were never told at check-in about the possible loud music. The desk clerk said the hotel usually saves those rooms for walk-ins, which we were not!. The hotel did lower the rate $50 for that night and moved us to another room the next day, but that did not make up for a night of lost sleep. Also, the manager was never available when we went to the front desk. Find another place to stay!

I had read many reviews of various hotels, so I was a bit nervous about the accommodations. In spite of this, I was pleased overall by our stay at the Day's Inn. The exterior of the hotel is being remodeled, and on the last two days of our stay, there were constructions workers hammering, sawing, and nailing throughout the day. This did not really bother us because we were out for most of the day anyway. However, if you have small children who need to nap in quiet, this could be a problem until the construction is completely finiished. However, the outside of the hotel is in dire need of repair, so I believe the work is essential. I am not sure why they decided to have the workers complete these jobs during the peak vacation season, but nevertheless, it is manageable. The room we picked had an oceanfront view, and when we stepped out onto our private balcony, I was very impressed. Being able to sit on the balcony and watch the waves and the people passing by was really relaxing. Plus, all we had to do was walk a few steps outside of the hotel and we were directly on the beach! In my opinion, this hotel has an ideal location because it is on the boardwalk, but not in the crowded section, and it has easy access to the beach as well. The room itself was fairly clean and neat, albeit small, and the cleaning woman we had did an OK job. I must admit one feature of the room that I really liked was the locking safe, which made me feel more confident when I left the room. My young daughter and I went in all three of the pools at the hotel, and we enjoyed all of them. None were extremely crowded, so we didn't have to rush. I would definitely consider staying in this hotel again next year when all of the construction is complete (hopefully!) or I would stay next door at the Grand Hotel.

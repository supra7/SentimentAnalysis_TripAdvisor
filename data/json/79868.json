My mother had a king-sized room, and we had 2 queens. Both rooms, but esp. the king, felt nice and spacious, and both had nice bay views with balconies. The staff were very gracious and friendly. I was worried because I couldn't find my booking/confirmation number prior to arrival, but no worries -- just by giving my last name, they quickly pulled up all the info. We ate breakfast at the more-than-adequate hot buffet on both mornings. Food was tasty, esp. the eggs, and I wasn't too concerned that there wasn't a lot of variety between the days...for a free buffet, this was a great value. Service in the buffet restaurant was also very good, with the waiter bringing frequent coffee/soda refills. Sorry that we didn't get to experience either the dining room for dinner, or the pool/jacuzzi, but it was a quick stay, and most of our time was spent out of the hotel. Speaking of which, the location was tucked away from the hubbub of greater San Diego, but was also super convenient and central for playing tourist.

The hotel where the conference was located had poor ratings on TripAdvisor, so I decided to stay at this higher rated hotel. The rooms are spacious and clean. The bed was very comfortable. The staff was friendly and accomodating. The parking was plentiful and easy to access. The buffet breakfast was delicious, hot, and maintained...all things that make a hotel stay wonderful. There were two issues, neither of which were under the control of the hotel, that had me wishing I had stayed elsewhere. The hotel is located on Shelter Island which is in the San Diego bay, directly across from North Island Naval Air Station. During my stay, there was a large amount of air traffic, mostly helicoptor traffic, that was extremely noisy. My balcony was open towards the source of the noise, thus funneling the noise into my room. Luckily, the majority of the noise was during daylight hours. Also in the noise category, this hotel's room layout is designed such that the TV set in one room is located along the same wall that the adjoining room's bed is located. Unfortunately, my neighbor was a late night television viewer with an obvious hearing problem...luckily by turning the wall mount AC unit on high, I was able to mask the majority of the TV noise. The second issue is regarding the WiFi capabilities at this hotel. They offer free WiFi. Upon arrival, you are told that the free WiFi is limited in speed (I found it to be slower than an old dial-up modem). They offer WiFi with increased speed for a premium (actually provided by a third party provider known as sandiegowirelessservices.com). Because I do a lot of my business via a VPN hookup with my corporate LAN, a decent WiFi speed is a necessity. So, I paid for the increased speed. The result was a negligable speed increase (slightly above the speed of an old dial-up modem). I have contacted the third party provider to let them know...it could be a simple equipment probelm. In summary, this is a wonderful hotel with great service. I just happened to be there during a very active Naval aviation period. It was fun to watch the air traffic and feel the noise, but it soon grew annoying (my opinion...obviously I'm getting old!!). Also, if you do business via the internet while travelling, this location may be a problem due to slow WiFi speeds.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queen Cr", "Title": "\u201cSan Diego trip to whale watch\u201d", "Author": "Marsha H", "ReviewID": "UR124798694", "Content": "Comfortable rooms, delicious buffet breakfast, great dinner selections, clean.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Napa", "Title": "\u201cBay Club on Shelter Island\u201d", "Author": "MikeinNapa", "ReviewID": "UR124771306", "Content": "We have family on Point Loma and we have stayed at the Bay Club a number of times.

I also read many reviews from travelers on Tripadvisor.com. The staff was friendly and very helpful, the room was large, clean, and faced the marina. We enjoyed the island decor. A little dated? Sure, but having granite bathroom countertops is not a high priority for us. As we checked in, we asked about restaurants in the area. They happily gave suggestions and also gave us a 20% discount to their restaurant. Since we had spent the day ay Balboa Park, Cabrillo Park, and wandering around tidepools, we decided to take them up on their suggestion. The food was excellent! My wife had the scallop and shrimp scampi. Fresh and perfectly prepared. I had the fish tacos. Yum! We're fish snobs :-) Lots of windows facing the marina. Since this was a special occasion, they had brought champagne to our room five minutes after we checked in. What a surprise! Breakfast was plentiful with potatoes, two types of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and pancakes (the next day was french toast). A few cups of coffee too. We are not muffin and orange juice people. Staff was there to refill coffee or juice and remove plates. Another traveler whose post I read talked about going for a walk by the water. We did too.

Having belonged to Yacht Clubs in my youth, I can report there is the very same 'feel' about this property - minus the Monthly Dues attatched! Wonderful Marina below, and the central Lobby is very cozy, featuring a Fireplace and small Lounge area. There is a formal Dining-room w/ great waterfront views, though I mostly take my meals in the Lounge area around fireplace. Waitstaff eager to please and VERY friendly - ask for 'Laurie', a regular w/ the Club of 8 years. There is a DAILY Brkfst. Buffet provided for Resort guests, also good. The rooms themselves are older, but still retain the same charm I fondly remember as a child. An added perk? Catch all the great music from next door @ 'Humphery's' Jazz series. Just head for the pool area, grab a cocktail and enjoy the concert(s) - NO cover involved!!! Catch all the San Diego bayfront action, right outside Lobby door - just across street! In a word...... 'paradise'.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay while in SD.\u201d", "Author": "Aschexn", "ReviewID": "UR123667350", "Content": "Not super fancy, but just right.

It was our first trip to San Diego. We decided on this hotel based on the numerous good reviews here. I have to say we were not dissapointed. The staff was wonderful and gracious! Yes, the hotel is a bit older but I already expected that. I even expected the great staff. However, I was incredibly pleased to find out that their food was also spectacular. We ended up eating there every night for dinner (happy hour from 4-7 = 1/2 price appetizers!) They were so good and the price was much less than I expected it to be, I expecially recommend the crab cakes and the coconut shrimp. Yes the breakfasts do get a bit boring after a couple of days but it is FREE and HOT, how can you ask for more in San Diego where most hotels charge an arm and a leg for food and parking. Another plus were the guests themselves. We met some wonderful people, it was a mix of those also on vacation and beleive it or not people who were actually living on their boats in the marina. Everyone was friendlly and I expect we will actually visit one of the other couples we met there on another vacation! Now for the room. We have a 7 yr old girl who loves boats and dolphins so we opted to take a risk and stay on the Bay side. If you have a child who likes boats I highly recommend it. Do get a 2nd floor room though, I have a feeling it would be harder to see the boats on the first floor. We saw several Navy ships sail by and at night you can walk on the Bay and hear the seals barking, we even saw them swimming in the water. It was one of our trip highlights - and we didn't even have to leave the area! Once you close the balcony door the noises dissapeared and it was plenty quiet to sleep. Humphries next door even had a concert going on one of the nights and we didn't hear a thing. Long story short - if you want a good hotel with great staff at an even better price, stay at the Bay. I won't even look for another hotel on our next visit - we're going straight to the Bay!", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cGreat 3 night stay\u201d", "Author": "DougPdx", "ReviewID": "UR123076005", "Content": "Nice 3 night stay in January '12.

Even suggested we return our rental the night before leaving and they transported us early the next morning. The included breakfast was a plus and got us off to a good start each day.

It was extremely quiet all of the times that we were outside. Aside from a few people walking to and from their boats, there wasn't much else noise-wise. The first night, we called the front desk to request some firm pillows (what my boyfriend prefers). We were told that they would look for some and asked how many we needed. About 5 minutes later, a knock at the door, and they are being delivered! This truely made our night and helped him sleep so much more comfortably. The breakfast was wonderful. We loved the variety available each morning. It is so nice to be able to have a hot breakfast instead of being limited to pastries, toast, and cereals in the mornings, such as at other hotels. We found the servers in the dining room to be very attentive, quickly offering us coffee as we were sitting down, clearing our plates as needed, and offering refills on OJ. On our second night, the wine, cheese plate, and chocolate covered strawberries I'd requested during the reservation, were in the room waiting for us when we returned from dinner.

It was easy to find and the position on Shelter Island was very nice indeed - with views over to Coronado from one side of the property and of the marina on the other. However for some reason our three night stay was something of a disappointment and didn't really live up to our expectations. Maybe it had something to do with the lack of attention to detail. The staff were friendly enough - but too often they seemed to simply be going through the motions. Both when we had dinner on our first night and at breakfast on all three mornings there was no real sign of them wanting to impress or going the extra mile. We noticed there was a lot of standing around and chatting - rather than being proactive and anticipating customer needs. We often had to ask for something - then they forgot about it and never sounded overly bothered when we had to ask for a second time. The food at dinner was good but we didn't particularly rate the included breakfast buffet - especially the hot items which didn't really look that appetising. Perhaps it was our fault for coming down to breakfast within the last hour of service - but that shouldn't make any difference. The food should be appetising whatever the service time and maybe it would have been better had it been cooked little and often. Sadly the majority looked like it had been lying around for quite some time - and the cold display was quite sparse and certainly nothing to get excited about. Our room had a marina view from the second floor and was large and quite well equipped. However it didn't smell overly fresh and both the decor and the fixtures and fittings could have done with a bit of TLC - as indeed could many of the public areas for that matter. We also felt that the $5 daily parking fee was rather unnecessary. Presumably this is simply a method of raising additional revenue rather than controlling parking spaces - since the hotel has both a large surface and underground car park and there is also ample free parking directly outside. There is a music venue next door which holds numerous live shows - but this didn't bother us at all and it was all quiet by 11pm. Sadly I don't think we would return to the Bay Club unless there was a general smartening up throughout and maybe a change in how it is run with much more attention to detail. We are also left wondering how it scores as highly as it does within the San Diego area which has so many hotels from which to choose.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manheim, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cJJ from P.A\u201d", "Author": "nyfd266", "ReviewID": "UR120548267", "Content": "This was a five star place in southern cal.If you are visiting family in the service the location is the best.We had a room that faced the Marina and the view was good.

We looked up the bugs and droppings on the internet and it very clearly appeared to be bed bugs. The markings on the bed in particular were clear, and seemed to be bed bug droppings. Went down and requested another room. After a while they put us in another room that stunk like RAID, like it had just been sprayed with bug killer. We didn't see any bugs so we spent the night. Woke up in the morning and there were a few bugs in the bed larger than the bugs the night before. Looked those up and they appeared to be the adult variety of beg bugs (the ones the night before appeared not to be adults yet). Obviously, got the hell out of that hotel. It isn't very nice either..run down, looks like it hasn't been redecorated since the 70s. Even a 5-star resort can get bed bugs...you can't control who comes into your hotel and what they bring. The most disappointing thing was how it was handled. The woman at the desk acted like she didn't believe us. She sent a security man up who verified it in the first room--he saw the bugs with his own eyes. But this time we didn't see the bugs in the second room--the room where we slept. When we got back downstairs, she was sarcastic and sort of suggesting we were lying and would say, \"Oh, that's strange that they are in the first room, and they just also happened to be in the 2nd room you say? What a strange coincidence that out of all the rooms, they're only in the 2 you stayed in, especially since the security guy didn't see any in the second room.\" I mean, they admitted there were bugs in the first room, but instead of an apology, we get treated like we're lying about the 2nd room. No discount, no apology, just treated like we're liars and don't let the door hit you on the way out. (In fairness, the rest of the workers there were nice, and I had to attend events there the rest of the weekend, and everyone was nice and professional. Just didn't like being treated that way by the woman on duty that night---she kept a sweater over her nametag so I didn't get her name). They knew we moved to a hotel next door (Half Moon--very nice), so we got a voicemail from the manager the next day at our new hotel explaining that they checked it out and it was just fleas. JUST fleas!!! First of all, they weren't fleas in my opinion-fleas jump and look different. In our opinion these were bed bugs. But it's strange to call up, \"Oh, by the way, no big deal, they're just fleas.\" In other words, we're a flea-bag hotel rather than a bed-bug hotel.

To be honest with the airport in the very centre of the city every hotel is going to be close to the airport, many could be right under the flight path but this is not. I can see a comment from another reviewer who said that the staff are not friendly. Yes we did have to make an effort to speak to them but as soon as you do they are very friendly and helpful. John in the bar was good fun. I think this is better than staff who are over friendly and in your face all the time. Breakfast was included, but was the same almost every day. A self service buffet comprised of a selection from 3 cereals, hot food was choice of scrambled egg, bacon, breakfast potatoes and some kind of waffle, toast, orange juice and tea or coffee. It was a good start to the day but a little boring. The dining room had good views over the marina and you could sit outside near the pool to have breakfast if you wished. With most hotels charging a fortune for breakfast we found this a good way to save a little money. Our room ( number 142) was on the ground floor. The hotel is only 2 or maybe 3 floors and I would recommend that you take a room on the upper floor, not only for the great views over the marina or sea front road (if you take that side of the hotel) but also we had a family above us for a couple of days who allowed their kids to stomp around the room and the noise was terrible for those two days. The room was spacious and well equipped, including a fridge to store your own drinks etc. There were loads of TV channels to choose from including sports channels, all on a giant LCD TV. The bathroom had a small bath with shower over. Only problems we had in the room were, the air con was old fashioned and although it worked it was very noisy so could not be left on overnight so the room did get very hot, also there were ants. We left a cake that we had bought from Town out, sealed in its box overnight on the top of the chest of drawers and in the morning it was covered with ants who were taking the cake apart and carrying it away down the legs of the chest and disappearing under the floor. There was a free to use computer for internet in the lobby, which was useful for checking flights etc or getting more details of the area. $5 a day for parking is a lot less than most other hotels in the area and when you take into account the cost of the staying at this hotel and that breakfast is included we thought it OK. Altogether we thought the hotel good value and would stay there again. Just a few notes on San Diego, you need to hire a car, do not visit Sea World especially if you have been to the one in Florida as its very poor and very expensive to get in.

Most of my guests came in from out of town so we had them all stay at the hotel. It was a great decision because they all enjoyed themselves and had wonderful things to say about the hotel. Everyone loved being so close to everything (downtown San Diego, the San Diego Zoo, Sea World) and they loved their rooms. They had incredible views from both sides of the hotel and received great service from the hotel staff. We had wonderful weather that weekend so many of them got a chance to relax by the beautiful pool and patio in the back of the hotel. They all raved about the food and the wonderful (complimentary) breakfast buffet each morning. As for my wedding and reception I worked with Tammy Garbini, Director of Sales and Marketing and she took care of everything right down to the last detail. We decided to have the ceremony outside on the back patio which was absolutely gorgeous against the incredible views of the marina. As luck would have it the weather was spectacular so we truly got married in paradise! After the wedding Tammy arranged for a nice cocktail hour so our guests could mingle and enjoy drinks and hor d'oeuvres. It was the perfect touch to lead into the reception. The food at our wedding reception was delicious and the service from the hotel staff was fantastic. They took great care of not just our bridal party but every single one of our guests. Absolutely everyone felt attended to and it gave such a warm and personal feeling to the entire affair. I didn't have to worry about a thing - Tammy and her incredible staff handled everything for me so I could enjoy my day and spend every minute with my guests. We absolutely loved it and had a wonderful time! The next time I have a big party to do I won't hestitate to have it at the Bay Club and Marina.

Check in was very smooth, Amanda was very nice and helpful with us at check in. We had a nice room on the second floor with a view of the Marina that is what I booked online since others said it was a nice view and I would have to agree it was so nice sitting out on the fairly large balcony and watching all the boats and sailboats coming and going. The rooms are large, we had a nice comfy king bed and loved the sheets soooo soft! Had a small frig and small coffee maker, a microwave would have been nice to have too. They had a really nice TV with a great picture. They have a comp. breakfast in the morning it was pretty good everyday it was the same eggs, bacon,sausage, either pancakes or french toast and some fried potatoes along with toast and cereals fresh fruit etc. I know some others who have stayed here have complained about the ticket they give you at breakfast for a tip. Well, they claim it's just so they know you are staying at the hotel you have to write down your room number. I have no problem with leaving a tip as a matter of fact I do at every place I stay at that has a comp. breakfast I just leave a few dollars I mean come on people these people run around trying to make you happy and bringing you coffee clearing your dirty plates and you can't leave them a few dollars for that? Tell me where you could feed a few of you for a few bucks and a full breakfast like they have?! This as you can see annoys me that some people are so darn cheap! So, anyway I liked the location to the hotel it was easy to get into downtown, gaslamp district, SeaWorld was close by and Old Town too. I knew the hotel was old as are most of the places in San Diego but it was fine I liked the Hawaiian decor and everything was fine not broken or torn everything worked just fine so I have no complaints at all.

We wanted to be closer to the airport, and also wanted to try out a new location in San Diego. I booked the Hawaiian package - I can't remember exactly what it was called, but it included two free drinks in the lounge, and a welcome platter of fruit and cookies, and parking was also included in the price. We didn't get the free drinks because the lounge closed early and we didn't make it in time. The platter was delivered just as we were heading to the room after check-in, by the same lady that checked us in. Check in service was excellent, the lady was very friendly and welcoming. The room was clean and bright, but smelled kind of old and musty. It was pretty old, old carpets, old carpets in the hallway, had the wood 70's look to it. There is a small bar area with a fridge and counter and sink, where the coffee maker is. The bathroom was clean and functional, but lighting was quite dim, the fan made a lot of noise, and again it was pretty old. We had a room with two queen beds. The view from the balcony was very nice, you can see the water (we had a bay view), the patio window was old and rickety, and the balcony was also old. We parked outside just below our balcony (we were on the second floor). It did look and feel like a Polynesian theme, it reminded me of the old apartment time share units in Waikiki, same era (only well kept compared to the ones in Waikiki). The lady at the front desk recommended a restaurant nearby, she said it was a 20 minute walk but it certainly was not, we walked 20 minutes and were in the middle of nowhere, then decided to go back and get the car - it was definitely a short drive, though. The surrounding area was very nice, we went for a walk along the path by the water, walked onto a pier where a few people were fishing, played in the playground nearby, watched some birds. It's a beautiful, relaxing area - not much around other than that, though. It's definitely a marina place, you drive through a lot of boat related businesses before you get to the hotels by the water. The walls are thin - there was a baby crying in the next room and it kept me up until late and then woke me up early in the morning. Luckily my kids and husband are heavy sleepers and manage to sleep right through it. I'm not a light sleeper, either, but it woke me up. We went down to the free breakfast, and yes, there are hot choices, and we did manage to eat something, but it wasn't very good. I had to ask for a coffee refill a few times before I got one. The servers looked rushed and harried even though it was a buffet and \"seat yourself\" style service. They still had to clear the tables and serve drinks. Overall I would say it was a pleasant stay, I wasn't expecting the Hilton or anything like that, so it met my expectations - I would suggest they upgrade the place a bit, though. It was fine for a one night stay, I probably wouldn't spend the week there, and I would probably not stay there again - now that we've tried the Shelter Island area, it's nice, but there's not much around, there are better locations to stay as a home base in San Diego. If I were to stay in that area again, I'd probably try the other, newer hotels nearby. It was okay value for what I paid, I think that I could have found a nicer place cheaper but it was probably more costly due to its proximity to the water.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cConvenient\u201d", "Author": "KimD2009", "ReviewID": "UR119056332", "Content": "We (My husband 2 teenage sons and I) recently stayed at the Bay Club for 3 nights while visiting San Diego.

The hotel has a nice restaurant area, an outdoor pool and hot tub, large HD television in the room, free wi-fi and complimentary buffet breakfast. Also there is a refrigerator in the room, but no microwave. The location is on Shelter Island and one side of the hotel faces the Marina and the other side faces a public boat launch and beach on San Diego Bay. It only has two floors and the rooms on the second floor have the best view. On the downside, our reservation was for a Bay View room with 2 double beds. We did not get our room request despite the fact that we made our reservation 3 months in advance. The room we got had one queen bed and was on the second floor with a Marina view. The view was nice, but we would have preferred to at least have the 2 double beds that we wanted. Also, on arriving, our room was really hot and the air conditioner was not working properly. We asked to be moved to another room and were told that the hotel was full. They said they would send someone up to look at it, and when we came back to the room later, someone had been there, but it still was not working. After several days, the outdoor temp had risen to 85 and the room was very uncomfortable, so I called again complaining about the air conditioner. They wanted to send someone up again and I said that it was not fixed the last time and insisted that they move us to another room. At this point they did let us move to a Bay View room. It still had the queen bed, but at least the air conditioner worked. Also we felt that the beds and pillows were not very comfortable compared to other hotels we have stayed in. On the plus side, they do have a buffet breakfast every day which consisted of eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, oatmeal, english muffins, fruit, toast and some cold cereals. The entire week was basically the same menu, except one day they added pancakes and one day waffles. I would suggest that they should include some low fat yogurt and more fruit choices. The breakfast is supposed to be self-serve, but they have waitresses that keep wanting to refill your coffee and juice and then they put a ticket on your table expecting a tip which was rather annoying. Also, they do charge $5 a day for parking, which I think should be free when you are paying a good price for a hotel room. But we figured that the complimentary breakfast everyday somewhat offset the parking charge. Overall, we were satisfied with our stay there, despite the air conditioner problem.

First, let me say that I am very picky when it comes to hotels! The Bay Club Hotel and Marina is a great choice hands down! The Bay Club was my choice after a few weeks spent researching hotels in San Diego. This was my third trip to the area and I wanted to try something new. When I first saw the photo's I thought that perhaps the hotel may be a little dated and some of the reviews made me think that might be the case. However, the overwhelming comments about how clean it was and how great the staff was (not to mention the ranking number) helped me make my decision. I couldn't have made a better choice. The staff is just great. The parking is only $5.00 per day; the rooms are clean, VERY quiet and the location is great. It is minutes from the airport, downtown and a short drive to La Jolla. They staff is great about giving you directions and recommendations for the area. I was amazed that a large bottle of water from the gift store was only $1.50. In any other hotel it would have cost much more. The breakfast in the morning was nice and again, the staff wonderful. I did tip the servers and they deserve it. I was surprised to see some comments about not leaving a tip; come on people, after all, for the great rate AND free breakfast why would anyone opt NOT to? If anyone would dare be able to afford a vacation and not leave at least a few dollars then shame on you! Read the book Nickeled and Dimed in America and then think twice about such decisions. I digress; take it from someone who takes her time making hotel selections and someone who searches for the best value and clean, nicely appointed rooms; this is a great choice.

The room was really large and the bed super comfortable. We had an issue with our shower that was completely resolved within 20+ minutes time from when we telephoned the front desk. I recommend parking in the below ground parking because the spaces up top are too narrow. Parking was an additional $5.00 per day. The hotel is located 5 minutes from the airport but you don't hear the noise. There is a fitness center that seemed to be a secret and there was a computer and printer in the lobby where you can print your airplane boarding passes. A real nice restaurant at the end of Shelter Island is Bali Hai. The view of San Diego fantastic and it's a beautiful setting with great food. Also, we went to see the Mets play the Padres at Petco Stadium. You can get really premium seats for really cheap (according to New York standards) or pay as little as $10 to sit and watch the game. It's a great stadium. All of this is 5-10 minutes from this wonderful hotel. We certainly will return on our next trip.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Springs, California", "Title": "\u201cI loved it and I will keep coming back\u201d", "Author": "esrose1", "ReviewID": "UR116907496", "Content": "I just returned from my annual (8 years or more) trip to Shelter Island, San Diego.

I felt like I finally was on vacation. The pool was big enough for our kids and actually felt heated! Breakfast was okay. Many selections, but I was expecting a bit better from the raves.

I was a bit irritated that the breakfast personnel bring you your drinks, but then leave a paper and pen for you to leave a tip. Sorry, but I didn't tip. If a breakfast is listed as COMPLIMENTARY, then don't pull this move and expect extra $! But, back to business . . . There is a small beach with bonfire rings right across the street from the hotel. I saw several large Navy ships pass by. COOL!!! We also walked three hotels down and the kids played at the bayside playground. The only negatives were: the water coming from the sink was a bit yucky when brushing our teeth and the A/C did not run continuously during the night and would wake us up when starting up (at least the first night of our 3 night stay.)

The sink/counter area is separated from the tub/toilet area by a door, which can be good or bad depending on your preferences. We had the harbor side and the view out the patio was very scenic. We only heard one very loud plane take off during the night from the military base across the bay. The room is worth the price. Added bonuses include the free breakfast every morning (eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, bread, cereal, coffee, juice). I only wished they had pancakes every morning as that is a kid's favorite. The location is very convenient to all of San Diego and its attractions. They seem to have concerts next door at Humphrey's, but honestly I didn't hear anything at night. Parking is excellent at the hotel. My only concern is the Wi-fi. You can only pick up the signal from the lobby. It does not reach the rooms, although the front desk said it is supposed to. I wasn't the only one with their laptop in the lobby trying to get the signal. That is why I do not give this hotel a 5 star rating. Invest in some more boosters and routers and your guests will be happy! Also, I would make it a policy for those having gigantic behemoths of cars be required to park in the underground parking. They do not fit properly in the hotel parking and stick out too much. It makes it very hard for the other guests to maneuver around those dinosaurs. I also rated sleep quality only a 4, because apparently Sasquatch lives above on the second floor. If you are bothered by Sasquatches having bowling tournaments on the floor above, ask for 2 second story room and not lower level.

Each room facing the marina has its own balcony so you can sit outside and enjoy the serene view of the boats before you. We've never stayed on the Bay side of the hotel, but it looks to offer another great view of the Bay and all the activities therein. You really can't go wrong staying on either side of the hotel, we just felt the marina side might be a little quieter. The room was very clean, had a Big Screen TV, plenty of channels on the Cable (which we appreciated for the Stanley Cup Playoffs - we're Canadian, eh?), and a small fridge. If there was one fault we could find, and it's minor, it would be that the bathroom could use a little updating, other than that we had absolutely no complaints about our room. The staff are beyond courteous. Each morning they have a delicious and substantial breakfast buffet and our waiter \"Raul\" was top-notch in his friendly and efficient service. You might be lucky enough to see \"Steven Seagull\" peering through the window as you're dining on breakfast.

We got our request immediately, and the bell hop helped us move everything! The 2nd floor room was gorgeous and had a panoramic view and walk out balcony (2 chairs and table). We had a KING bed and a rolling crib for our little one (13 months). The room was good size and felt spacious for us. Overall, we were very pleased with our room. The Hotel was very, very clean and well organized. The Staff was excellent and super friendly......they always offered to help you or say \"hi\". Any requests for towels, soaps, ice, etc......were handled very quickly (5min) and with a smile. The pool area is nice, clean and well maintained. Yes, the pool is on the small size, but the 3 days we were there NOBODY used it except for us! There is a rather large HOT TUB near the pool.......very nice. You have great views of the Marina while in the pool area. The morning breakfast buffet was simple with 4 stations of hot foods, breads, cereals, fruits, coffee/juice/soda/water and was clean, well organized, plenty of seating inside and outside, friendly servers. We liked it very much and never had any issues. Perfect way to start off the day!! Parking was plentiful (outside or under hotel in garage) and cost only $5.00/night!! Location of the Bay Club Hotel to area attractions: Excellent! We got to Gas Lamp Dist, The ZOO, Coronado Island, Mission Bay Beach and Mission Valley Mall quickly. Honestly, the location is ideal (in my opinion). You are \"off the beaten path\" but very quick drive or taxi to everything to do in San Diego. We walked for about 20 minutes and saw a lot of restaurants, shops, mini marts, liquor stores, donut shops, etc. So, there is stuff close to the hotel! Overall, we give the hotel \"2 thumbs up\" or an A+ grade. The location and staff make all the difference.......both were excellent! Yes, we will stay there again.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oceanside, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Get-away\u201d", "Author": "suzibrad", "ReviewID": "UR108716596", "Content": "We purchased this hotel through groupon, and our stay exceeded our expectations!

It wasn't excellent but it wasn't terrible. The staff treat you well there. They help serve you, set the tables for you, get your drinks.

There was a party in the next room and the music was very loud. When I called reception to complain they sent the security man to break the party up. This was at 11pm. Twenty minutes later the music started again and when I called reception they told me that everyone had vacated the room. I told them that they had to come up again as there sounded as if there were 40 people in the room. He did come up and there were that many people in the room. They also tried to come through the conecting door into our room which made us very frightened. When I opened my door to tell the security man that they tried to get through to us he yelled at me to get back into my room or I would be in trouble. I think he was embarressed that he had not dealt with the problem. Half an hour later it all stared again as they were sneaking in from other entrances and they still had the key. That was the last straw, I called reception and asked for the police to be called which they did and when they arrived to get the remainder out they asked why they had not been called before. It took till 3am to fix the problem. The reason I am writting this long review is that they have to fix their security as 40 people could gain access to a hotel room without the front desk aware of what was going on. I have to say that Timothy Brogan front desk manager was very good as he moved us to another room and gave us a dinner on the house and deducted the fee for that night. He said the general manager would be in touch to discuss what had happened but he did not. I hope the Bay club marina will learn from this and step up their security.

The Bay Club in on Shelter Island in San Diego, directly opposite the Naval Air station North Island (about 1 km away over the water). The Hotel fronts the harbour, and backs onto a huge marina filed with what is literally a forest of yacht masts. Logically, the views from the back are not stunning. From the front ( if you are a military plane buff as I am, or enjoy occasional military traffic) it can be quite fascinating. The good news is that the Military are GOOD neighbours, and the F18s usually don't start flying much before 9am. ( For this Australian, seeing 20 + parked F18s, a similar number of Sea Hawk helicopters - in both cases representing a large percentage of our whole air force- and the VERY regular naval patrols in the harbour was a real eye opener). The Bay Club is 2 storied, it has a good pool, and the restaurant & bar are quite adequate. The included breakfast was OK, lots of it, but a narrow selection, and the food was often only warm. Lunch off the menu was better, certainly well priced, tasty and with good service. We found a room service dinner the same. The rooms were of good size, fairly quiet, and the bed comfortable. Both the TV channel selection and the free WiFi were good. Personally, I hated the pillows (I have a long term dodgy neck, and it didn't respond well to the supplied unsupportive and lumpy pillows). The room was always hot and stuffy (unless you opened the verandah door which let the flies in), and the air conditioning proved a bit aggressive when we used it to combat the heat, making sleep a bit harder than it could have been. The room itself was a little tired, and the terylene curtaining by the verandah door was shredded in a couple of places.

As with most people who use this sight A and C played the most important role. We were very happy with the accommodations. Our room was large and clean; considerably larger in fact then the standard hotel room. Because the reviews are so positive it did catch us a little by surprise how old this hotel is. It had a bit of a musty odor when we first walked in but it wasn't serious and everything is maintained well. A big benefit for us was the full breakfast offered each day. During all our stay, the staff were friendly and helpful. We were specially impressed by the service during breakfast. The location as mentioned in many other reviews is excellent for walking along the harbor and watching all manor of boats including large military vessels and cruise ships. It should be noted however that the area around this hotel is relatively industrial.

I just checked out today after staying here 5 nights on business. The location is good - nice views. The hotel is old and tired and the pool was out of service for the week. I had a king room with a view of the marina. Old, dirty looking carpets in the room and hallways. Rooms and hallways are very dark. The bed was comfortable and water pressure was excellent. The room smelled very badly of mildew. I complained the next morning and they must have sprayed something in it because the smell was not as strong when I came back later in the day after work. There are no ice machines in the hotel. You have to take your ice bucket and have it filled at the bar all the time. Very inconvenient. The breakfast buffet is ok, not great, but they expect a tip and they leave a receipt at your table for you to sign and have it charged to your room. I can understand tipping at a buffet if the waiter/waitress brings you coffee/tea/juice and is very attentive. However, I was eating breakfast alone and ended up getting my own drinks all the time. Breakfast consists of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, cut up fruit, bagels which seemed stale, and other breads and a limited amount of cereal. My co-worker and I made the mistake of eating dinner at the hotel our first full day. We were both sick all night. Maybe we should have taken the hint since no one else was in the restaurant, only the bar area. There are many other very nice places to eat in the area, just not here. They also charge $5.00 per 1/2 hour to use the computer in the lobby that is only for guest use. They charge $5/day for parking. The parking lot is small and they also have an undergroup parking garage. There are many other nice hotels in this price range. Unless you really want this location, shop around.

The breakfast was acceptable but not wonderful - the breakfast room looks out to the marina which is very pleasant if your table is near a window. There were some very odd things about the room (Premium King View Room); the bathroom mirror has a thick deep frame which so interfered with the outlet as to make that, the only outlet in the bathroom, unusable. This may not be a problem in all rooms but who would expect it at all? The management seems quite stingy with amenities; not an extra towel, washcloth or glass to be found, for instance.

We ended up facing the harbor, which was absolutely beautiful. The balcony was very roomy. We enjoyed seeing boats in the harbor, and even saw a \"parade of lights,\" which involved several boats parading through the harbor decorated with Christmas lights. I think the view on this side of the building would have been less attractive from the first floor, as it also overlooks the parking lot.

The staff members all went out of there way to help him get what he needed and to also keep me out of the way, they helped to make the day very special. I would 100% recommend having a massage whilst your there it was out of this world. i had a full hour massage from head to toe and i felt so relaxed afterwards its the best i've had and compared to the prices in England i thought it was a great price. I've never been to a hotel were the staff are so friendly and helpfull and all the other guests were firendly and all loooked like they were having a great time we did not hear one complaint whilst we were there. I will recommend that if your planning at staying here the hotel offer a free shuttle that will collect you and return you to the airport just give them a call when your at the airport and the shuttle bus will collect you and it saves spending around $20 on a cab ride. What was also great about the hotel was that it was in the middle of San Diego Zoo and Sea world as we wasnt driving it made it easier to get a cab to each one and it wasnt too expensive. i would just like to take this opportunity to thank Laurie, Tammy, and everyone at the hotel for making us feel so welcome we will without a doubt be returning.", "Date": "September 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jersey Shore", "Title": "\u201cDelightful Surprise\u201d", "Author": "JhonB", "ReviewID": "UR20452978", "Content": "Looking of a place to stay for a few days at the end of a Cruise.

The front desk staff -- especially Alejandra, Allison, and Gatia -- were incredibly accomodating.

Great for an evening walk. On the other side is a beautiful marina with thousands of boats. Yes, thousands.. By car, you're downtown in about ten minutes, and it's a straight shot. 6. The hotel next door has outdoor concerts. While some previous reviewers complained, we couldn't have been happier. From our pool area, you could see into the concert shed and we had no trouble hearing the concert. In the week we were there, we enjoyed concerts by the Doobie Brothers, Frankie Valli, and Ringo Starr. 7. The pool and hot tub were very well maintained and relaxing. They were always clean and the right temperature. 8.

However, I'm beginning to think that some of the reviewers don't get out much. Reading the 5 star reviews should be taken with a grain of salt. So here's my take: 1. My overall rating is around 3.5 stars; 2. The location is excellent--easy access to airport and all touristie activities; 3. The location is quiet other than the Humphrey Hotel next door--don't plan on going to sleep until 11pm on some nights (loud music); 4. Even though the hotel is dated, that should not stop you from staying there; 5. We stayed on the 2nd floor with a marina view and balcony--you want this view (very relaxing); 6. Our room had two queens--the mattresses are very firm but the pillows have a lot to be desired; 7. The room itself is like your average hotel rooms; 8. They call their rooms air condition, I call them swamp cooler air conditon--if you're a light sleeper, they could be a bit noisy. 9. The hotel is smoke free, however, you do have your smokers on the balcony and down by the pool side; 10. There maid service is excellent--please tip them they do earn it; 11. The pool and spa is Ok; 12. There free morning breakfast is nothing to crow about--it's not your Embassy Suites breakfast meals though;13. The breakfast is premade for you to dish up--scrambled eggs, french toast or hot cakes, sausage and bacon, cold ceral, fruit, breads, muffins, and pastries--the coffee is OK; 14. Hotel staff was good; 15. Would I stay here again--yes but not during the summer--I think you can get better deals at nearby hotels for the same fees.

It appears to be much quieter at the back of the hotel then the front due to the road outside and the Naval base in the bay.

Depending on which end of the building you stay on, you can hear (and even see) the performers from your balcony - so don't expect quiet before 10PM. On the flip side - you can get a free concert!

We booked one room with a Bay view and the other with a Marina view. I wanted to make sure that the balconies for each room were able to accommodate all four of us so we could use either balcony. Tim actually went and looked at the balconies and locked in the rooms. Unfortunately, the morning of our departure, the other couple called to say her husband was sick. I called the hotel to see what options we had. I know the hotel has a 48 hour cancellation policy but when I explained the situation and that we would re-book two weeks later the lady on the phone (can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember her name) said no problem. Thank-you! They could have dinged us for the one night. Two weeks later the four of us arrive at the hotel at noon. We checked in at the front desk but only one room was ready. The other room would be ready around 3 pm. They took my cell number and said they would call when it was ready. We took all our bags to the room that was ready and had lunch at the hotel. The lunch was very good and no more expensive than your typical restaurant. Later we took a walk out to the grass area on the Bay side of the hotel. Excellent views. Just after 3 pm Tim called and said the other room was ready. We met Tim at the reservation desk and he said that the room we had taken our bags to wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one of the rooms he had reserved for us. Then he took us thru the Hotel and showed us about 6 different suites! Cool. Have never had that happen before.

Since we now planned on using this balcony for our cocktail hour(s) my wife and I chose a suite with a Bay view on the second floor without a balcony.

The hotel is right on shelter island which is a man-made island in San Diego. Every room has a view of either the marina or the bay. I paid for a premium harbor view room with two queen beds at $169 a night (note that this was the memorial day weekend). I was there with my wife and two little kids. The service at this place was par excellence, from the time we booked the hotel by phone. We checked in little late at 7:00 pm even though the check-in time was 3:30 pm but we called the hotel and they promised to keep our room and not to worry. Once we checked in, I was a bit disappointed by the view since my room was on the right half of the hotel and had less of the downtown view (but it still had a nice view of the bay). I asked the lady at the front desk if she could change our room to the other half of the building for a better view. She said she did not have anything right away but immediately told me that she could move us into another room the very next day. All we had to do was pack our bags and leave them in the room and they would take care of it. Sure enough, after we came back from the Zoo the next day, our bags were moved to another room with a better view of downtown and the bay. No problems whatsoever. The room itself was clean and well kept. Yes, it looked a bit worn out and linens were not very new. The tub in our second room did not drain very well but this was fixed the very next day without us complaining. There were also problems with the tap in the tub leaking a bit. But the decent size of the room and view made up for these shortcomings. The rooms come with complimentary breakfast which is in the restaurant right opposite the lobby with a nice view of the marina. The breakfast itself starts at 6:00 am and lasts till 10:00 am. We had breakfast for three morning there and no matter time what time we went, the food was always hot and no item was gone. And the waiters made sure that our coffee and juice cups were always full. Every single person behind the welcome desk was very courteous and friendly. When I wanted a suggestion for a nice family friendly place to go to for dinner on my birthday, the folks there suggested two or three different local places. We ended up at Pizza Nova which also had nice views of the marina. And you should try their Gorgonzola with Pear pizza. It was out of this world. There is access to the beach right across the street from this hotel. You can see early morning joggers strolling across this beach with their dogs. There were some benches that you could sit to watch sunrise of sunset or just enjoy the view. The place is also very close to downtown and there were many small restaurants around this hotel The only slight issue that I had at this place had nothing to do with the hotel itself. There is a naval training base of some sort right on the other side of this island. And there were some F-18's that took off in the middle of the night. I woke up with a shudder thinking that I was in the middle of the earthquake. However, this happened only one night. There were a lot more planes and helicopters flying around all morning. But my kids loved watching the planes and the helis. Overall, we enjoyed out stay in this hotel. It was a bit pricey but you dont get anything for less in San Diego.

This hotel was/is a fave of my mothers..she has been coming here for years with my dad. We treated each other to a 'memory-making' trip. Even tho dad wasn't with us, she was able to relive her special times here. We were pleasantly surprised as to its proximity to the Airport..only 2-3 miles away. We stayed on the second floor..(worth the upgrade) facing the harbour on the westside. We avoided the smoke from the beach fires that seemed to pop up on the beach across the street when the locals showed up...and the jet aircraft noice..and the street noise of traffic and the after hours crowd at Humphreys. We were close to all the points of interest..driving to Point Loma was very easy..going the other way..we drove to the Maritime Museum downtown...very easy to get to. Tickets $12 for adults and $9 for seniors. Our favourite excursion was the Whale Watching Tour with the Hornblower Boat Co. This was well worth the money! We took the 1:30 cruise and saw 4-5 whales breaching the surface and water 'geysering' out of their blowholes. Many dolphins and even saw large white jellyfish! Great for landlubbers like ourselves! The hotel's breakfast was PLENTY to get our day started each morning. We got to know our waiter \"Luis\" who has written a story about the three very special seagulls that arrive each morning to entertain the breakfast guests: \"Nancy\", \"Tilda,\" etc. they all have names! Luis has been feeding them for 15 years and now they are somewhat trained, much to the delight of the children. For those of us who are kids-at-heart..we enjoyed this extra-special touch of human and animal poignancy. Luis needs to have a write-up about him in the daily news..I hope you will enjoy meeting him too. Our room was just the perfect size for the three of us. The room could use an updating, but everything seemed okay. We didn't spend much time in the room. We used the balcony to watch the boats come in-and-out each day. The ship traffic is marvelous. The U.S.S. Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier came into port! What a thrill to see a nuclear powered carrier!!!! Kids will love this hotel and all that there is to do. Whether it is walking the harbour 'seawalk' across the street, or just watching boats from your own balcony/lanai. The Navy was out with a small craft training dolphins one day...right out in front of the hotel! If you don't know what you are seeing, ask a local--they are all out doing their daily walks on the harbour front walk there across the street from The Bay Club. The San Diego Zoo is a must!

The gentleman at the front desk was very nice when we arrived. He gave us three rooms to check out and we picked the one we wanted, which was the original we booked overlooking the marina, which was awesome! An advantage to overlooking the bay would be seeing the large naval ships that come in; while outside we saw a cruise ship sail past one night. Reviews are correct in that it is an older property. The carpet is stained in the hallways from what looks like a leaky sprinkler system. It was hard getting past that first impression. The restaurant was very nice. It's been remodeled due to a fire late last fall. The morning breakfast that comes with the rental of the room was excellent with a large variety. They have a 4:00-7:00 social hour with crackers and cheese ONLY with a purchase of a drink at the bar! The rooms are clean. The bathroom tile is a terra cotta brown and the grout was stained in all three rooms we checked. I thought it might be from the humidity in the shower, but even the grout around the tile near the sink area is stained. I noticed the grout in the bathroom near the lobby was also stained. Not a good first impression. Staying at the Bay Club is hard if you don't rent a car. It's surrounded only by other hotels and marinas. After being out and about all day, it would have been nice to come back to our room, clean up and go back out for the evening. There wasn't anywhere to go from the Bay Club within walking distance in the evening except another hotel restaurant. We did get to know the bus system which goes to Shelter Island, which was still a bit of a walk. We had to transfer several times, depending where we wanted to go. We did take advantage of the hotel shuttle, but we were told over and over they usually only do airport shuttles, and because this was their slow time, they would acommodate us. They only want to shuttle you to Seaport Village. We wanted to go the same distance in a different direction one day, and were told they couldn't do it. It also depended on who you talked to at the front desk. Some were more friendly and accomodating than others. We felt we were pestering the shuttle drivers to drop us places. If done again, we would have stayed somewhere close to downtown where we could make a stop at our hotel if we wanted. Staying somewhere near Seaport Village where there's a lot of shops and is close to the Gas Lamp District, which was FULL of restaurants and evening activity! We felt a little slighted that we were there in March and not their busy season in June- August. The tours you read about are geared for those months. Not everything is available during their off season. We had our Hollywood tour cancel the night before because they only had 6 people instead of the 10 or more they required for a 15 passanger vehicle. This was a $100 a person tour. Hard to believe that they're not making a profit on $600. Maybe if they'd run the tour, the word of mouth advertising would be enough to get more people to go. All-in-all, we had a wonderful time in San Diego. We appreciated how different each area was.", "Date": "March 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbia, MD", "Title": "\u201cMarina view was awesome!!!\u201d", "Author": "ColumbiaTrekkers", "ReviewID": "UR14082494", "Content": "We stayed at the Bay Club Hotel as part of a 2 1/2 week trip along the California coast, starting in San Diego. The hotel is conveniently close to San Diego's Lindbergh Field Airport, but far enough away to avoid jet noise. The hotel is very convenient to Old Town and also to Downtown, but it also seems far-removed from all the crowds. It is also conveniently located near Point Cabrillo and Cabrillo National Monument. We stayed in a Marina view room, upper level with king bed, and we got a very good AAA rate of $159 by contacting the hotel directly. It might be helpful to describe the hotel's setting. I didn't quite understand it before I checked in, but was fortunate to have followed the advice of others in selecting a marina view room. This hotel (and others along Shelter Island Drive like Humphrey's) occupies a relatively thin strip of land with the marina on one side and Shelter Island Drive on the other. The so-called bay view rooms have a distant view of San Diego, a closer view of San Diego Bay; but they have a VERY close view of the hotel's parking lot, Shelter Island Drive, and the municipal parking lot on the other side of Shelter Island Drive. So, while some travelers may like the \"bay view\" rooms, my advice is choose the marina view. You can look out from your balcony over a beautiful marina (Marina View)or over a parking lot and/or busy road (Bay View). The hotel's breakfast buffet was the best of any hotel on our trip. It included eggs, sausage, bacon, pancakes or french toast, pastries, bagels, fresh fruit, coffee, tea and juices. The great breakfast really spoiled us for the rest of the trip, as did the beautiful view from our balcony. Hotel management and staff were exceptional. They went out of their way several times to be genuinely helpful to us.

The hotel is a bit older, but they keep it nice. The bathtub/shower is what tipped me off to that. The bathroom is on the smaller side with the toilet and tiled tub in a room and the sink outside it. The breakfast was included and was very good. I'd call it a buffet. They had waitservers, and did present a $0 bill, basically to get a tip. I thought this was okay since it was a nicely laid out full breakfast in a restaurant setting with white tablecloths. We loved the view across to downtown San Diego and also of all the sailboats in the marina. There is a nice sidewalk, running path along the bay.

We reserved a harbor view room, but looking back, I wished I had requested a marina view as my husband loves boats. Plus a marina room is away from the street and a bit more quiet. However, the room we did have was nicely sized, and well appointed. The property has definitely seen better days. The condition of the public areas--particularly the corridor and restaurant carpets could use a good cleaning. Also, due to the humidity, the air from the ventilation system was a bit on the stale side. If you're planning to drive, be advised that the hotel has a parking lot, but it can be tight if you drive a larger SUV or pick-up. The hotel has a nominal parking fee ($5.00) compared to other hotels. However, there is ample on-street parking nearby as the hotel is directly across from a parking lot for boaters, and harbor visitors. In fact, we ended up parking on-street a few nights due to the hotel's lot being full. Overall, this is a charming place to stay, and we would visit again.

The balcony was huge, and wrapped around the whole unit. It had a table and 4 tables and was directly over the water.

The bathroom is 2 separate sections, with the sinks and mini fridge in one part and the bath/shower and toilet in the other. Both are in an area that can be closed off behind doors so an early riser can shower and get ready and not wake up a later sleeper. The room is very clean and comfortable and the staff was super helpful and friendly. The breakfast is free and while better then most free ones, the options are pretty limited.

But that was only on the balcony - you couldn't hear the concert once you closed the sliding doors. The breakfasts were nice and varied. They may not have been the gourmet buffets you will get at one of the hotels downtown, but they were much better than the simple fare you will get at many of the outlying hotels. I have stayed at a number of different San Diego locations over the years (my company has a conference out there every other year). This hotel is located in an area that's much less hectic than downtown, Mission Beach or Hotel Circle, but I didn't really notice an appreciable increase in the amount of time it took to get anywhere. As far as negatives for the hotel, the only one we experienced was the sofa bed, which was pretty bad.

Apparently, the people below us complained that my kids were being noisy and he showed up at the door like Rambo. We put the kiddies to bed and about 2 hours later, he called and woke us all up being obnoxious and threatening us that he has been up to our room once already and the noise better cease. My hubby explained that he is being misinformed as our entire family was sleeping. He continued on that this was his final warning. I immediately went down to the desk and demanded an explanation. He overheard me speaking to the guy at the front desk and came over and rudely interupted the young man behind the desk. He continued on that he did not mean to sound threatening but when other guests complain, etc. etc. I boldly pointed out that he was not threatening me in the least and the phone calls to my room had better stop as my family is sleeping and to take his wanna-be investigation elsewhere. He started babbling about his authority and I walked away. The next morning on our way to breakfast, the people in the room below us were leaving and my hubby approached them regarding their complaint. The man and woman said they could hear our TV and the kids runnning around the room. But they insisted they only called the desk once and the noise stopped. So Mr. Tough Guy Security Guard made the 2nd call up completely...which we knew anyway since we are all sleeping. My hubby also pointed out to the couple that it was not necessary to call the front desk at 8pm! But whatever.

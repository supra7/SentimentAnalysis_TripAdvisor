Pros....it is very close to all the parks; can save on meals by eating breakfast and packing lunches (the parks allowed us to bring them in), the water park area is great with good activities for the kids, fitness center nice, pleasant staff. Cons.....main negative is that not all the units have been upgraded and we got one that wasn't. It was clean, but very dated. The sofa bed is useful only for small children. The mattress was thin and had no support, so my husband and I had to put it on the floor each night and sleep there. We also had to ask for an extra pillow (the unit had 5 for 6 people) and there were only sheets for the sofa bed, so check early if you need an extra blanket or pillow. We had ants on one section of the kitchen counter, so had to move all the food up and out of the way and be sure that nothing was left out when we were gone. Would have thought that since this was a time share trade (place was not full) that they would have given us an upgraded unit.

We were visiting Disney and we felt that the free shuttle to attractions was poor. It only went to Epcot which meant changing buses to get to other resorts. The earliest departure time was 8:45 am which meant that for any park but Epcot, we missed park opening. It was also extremely late for pick up one day.

The place seemed tired on the outside. However, the staff that greeted us were very upbeat and were very efficient. The condo itself was very clean and a nice size especially for a family of four. The kitchen was spotless. However, there were some ants crawling over the kitchen bar. But being in a \"tropical\" location I wasn't that worried. There was a full size refrigerator, glass top stove, microwave and dishwasher. The pots and pans were all nicely cleaned. Some of the utensils needed some cleaning but that's what a dishwasher is for! The rooms upstairs included a master bedroom with a queen size bed. The other bedroom had two twin beds which my kids loved especially because they had their own TV. The upstairs also had a stacked washer and dryer, though a bit noisy it still did the job none the less. There were two bathrooms one upstairs and one downstairs. The only complaint about the condo we stayed in was there wasn't a closet on the main floor to hang up coats and whatever else we didn't want to drag upstairs. They provided transportation to Walt Disney World. The bus will pick you up at 8:45am and after stopping at other hotels drop you off at Epcot parking lot. The only problem is that they won't pick you up until after 6pm. So plan accordingly especially if it is a hot one with little ones in tow. The pool amenities were for the most part great. For some reason on our first day the water slides were shut down and there was no around that could give us a reason. On the second day everything was open and working fine. The lazy river was a nice way to relax and the zero entry pool was a huge hit with my kids. They also have an area which has an air hockey table, basketball shooting game as well as video games. However, to play them you have to \"buy\" a card which would be used to swipe a game so you could \"play\". At the time we went, a $1.00 would buy you 4 plays but some of the games would cost 3 plays per game, so unless you were a wiz at math you ended up with a card that had 1 or 2 plays left. A bit chintzy I thought. Unfortunately, we had to leave early because a family member back home was given 48 hours to live. The staff was tremendous in helping us with trying to get back home early. Would I stay there again?

It was spring break for my family and I was also hosting a baby shower for my sister. We chose this resort because of the great location and amenities for our shower guests and their families, who were coming from all over Florida. The condo was very clean and the kitchen was immaculate. We liked the tropical themed furnishings and d\u00e9cor in dark reds, golds, and greens\u2014all of which were in excellent condition. The full kitchen featured granite countertops and stainless steel oven, refrigerator, microwave, and dishwasher. There\u2019s even a garbage disposal. The small appliances include blender, toaster, and coffee maker. As an avid cook, I really appreciated the full set of knives, including steak knives. All the pots and pans were in good shape and there were other necessities, such as a glass measuring cup and measuring spoons and a cookie sheet, in case you get the urge to bake. There was also a bottle opener and corkscrew. Dish cloths, towels, dish soap and dishwasher detergent were provided. The condo had an efficient layout with a full bathroom with walk-in shower (with hand rail) downstairs, and a full bathroom with tub upstairs. The master bedroom had a very comfortable bed. The pillows were so fluffy that we slept on one each, instead of our usual 2 each. The closet had a very cool built in storage system that I will keep in mind for my own home. It has space for hanging clothes on each side, a dresser in the middle with plenty of drawers, and a flat screen TV on top. There\u2019s a safe inside the closet and shelving above. The second bedroom had 2 comfy twin beds. The double dresser is outside the closet. There is a flat screen TV. It was spacious and clean. Both bedrooms had ceiling fans, wooden blinds, sheer curtains, and blackout curtains that really work. As a light sleeper, I appreciated that it was quiet at night. There is a sunny screened porch with a chaise, and table and chairs. The pool towels are located inside the living room TV cabinet. You can clean them in the washer and dryer upstairs. The pool area is amazing. It was one of the big draws for us. It features a zero entry pool, lazy river, splash area for the small kids and 2 serious water slides. The kids were in heaven, and we had lots of fun too. There are cool activities all day long, such as tie-dying shirts, crafts, and games. We had lunch delivered at the pool one day (ordered at the bar). There\u2019s a good variety on the menu and everyone was pleased. They have cabanas for rent that are very reasonable and can include food, drink and a flat screened TV. Some of the dads and kids hung out in the cabana while the ladies had the baby shower. We held the baby shower in the meeting room of the resort, overlooking the pool. It was wonderful working with John Rowland, the food and beverage manager. He went out of his way to make our event a lovely success. He even prepared a delicious and beautiful peach sangria for the shower, which was a huge hit. We really appreciated his hard work, attention to detail, and desire to please. We did spend some time visiting area attractions, which were all very close. Our son especially enjoyed the Medieval Times dinner theatre. They regularly send a knight in full costume to the resort to give away coupons. He also \u201cknights\u201d the children. They love it! The resort provides shuttles to the theme parks and outlet malls, but we used our own car. There are restaurants within walking distance. A Publix grocery store, pharmacy and Sam\u2019s Club are very close. On our last day, we loaded the car and checked out of the room. Then we spent one more morning at the pool before heading home. The resort accommodates this by offering lockers and showers near the pool. I thought this was very clever. We all had a great time. It was a fun way for all the families to get together and enjoy each other in a relaxing atmosphere with all the comforts of home. We will definitely go back to this resort.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plymouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat place, beware hidden extra pool costs/surf machine costs.\u201d", "Author": "shineyy", "ReviewID": "UR126997377", "Content": "I looked hard for a place to stay on a 2 week trip from the UK as a single father with 3 daughters and this place seemed to match the requirements.

Our group consisted of 4 adults and my 2 1/2 year old grandson. Overall, we were quite pleased with the resort. We arrived late in the evening, so check-in was quick and easy. The young fellow at the front desk was friendly and helpful. The front desk and reception area could use some organization and straightening up, as it is your first impression of the facility, but it's no big deal. The pool/recreation area is fabulous. There are plenly of chairs, cabanas, etc. There is also a games room, business center, workout facility and simulated golf area. After having read some of the other reviews, I had requested an updated unit close to the pool so it would be easier for us with our young grandson. Our unit was located right accross from the pool area. The location was great! The unit intself was acceptable and clean. Although I was told that it had been updated, it was still somewhat dated. The quality of workmanship is average, at best. Overall, it worked out ok. Our unit had 2 bedrooms. One bedroom had a queen bed and the other had 2 singles - both are on the second floor. The mainfloor has a pullout couch/sofabed. The sofa bed was impossible for anyone to sleep on comfortably. Needless to say, this arrangement did not work perfectly for our group. We ended up having to move the mattress from the sofa bed to one of the upstairs bedrooms and place it on the floor so my grandson could sleep. The resort does not offer any portable beds/cots. The only other issue, albeit a minor one, was the screened in porch area. The screen were ripped in a few spots. The access is through the patio door, which did not open/close very easily. Also, the porch area had an old small table, 2 chairs and a lounger. We noticed that some of the other units had a larger patio table and 4 chairs. We called the front desk to inquire if we could have something similar and were told no. However, these were just a few minor inconveniences. We did call about a broken latch on the porch door and a couple of other minor things - towels, etc. and they responded quickly. The resort is quite conveniently located and the pool area made up for some of the other issues. There are plently of restaurants within close driving distance to the resort. Overall, we were quite satisfied with the experience and would seriously consider returning. If they upgraded their sofa bed and a few of the minor issues, this would have been an even nicer experience.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Watertown, SD", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and awesome pool area\u201d", "Author": "motherofthree", "ReviewID": "UR126407890", "Content": "I was pleasantly surprised with Fantasy World after reading mixed reviews prior to arriving.

Even though the villa we stayed in could use a little up dating, it was perfect for us. If there was any problems, they were on top of it and fixed it right away. The pool, lazy river, gym, arcade and tennis court was awesome!They offered activities throughout the day for all to enjoy. Enjoyed our lunches at the out door bar area, the bartender made us feel welcome and comfortable. Loved the fact that after spending a full day at the overly crowed amusement park, that it was the opposite back at Fantasy World Resort and we could relax at the pool soaking it all in. At the front desk, if there was anything you needed to know, there was a gentlemen that is super nice and made sure you were being taking care of. On Christmas eve I took the kids for a walk around the grounds getting some fabulous shots and especially loved that they offered a Christmas tree for pictures also. Almost any kind of shopping or restaurants are near by as well as the amusement parks. We would recommend this villa resort to our friends.

Also very close to plenty of restaurants and Publix to pick up groceries. However, once I woke up to cockroaches in the kitchen and living area and on the ceiling, I felt very uncomfortable and was constantly looking around to see where the next one was going to be. I called to report the problem and maintenace did come within a few minutes with some stray. It seem to help or at least put my mind at ease. Check in was a little annoying. We arrived at 4:00, and they said the room would be ready in 10 minutes. So we went out to get come groceries and came back around 5:00 and they were still cleaning our room. Towels were also a pain. Of course since there is no room service, you have to recycle using the towels, but the dryer in our unit never dried the towels, so we always had to use damp ones.

As some mentioned, the updates vary on the units. Ours, in the 31xx complex had a serious palmetto bug problem inside. We stayed 4 nights between Xmas and New Years, and killed 5 in the kitchen and living room. Called maintenance the 2nd night, and they came promptly and sprayed, but I kept killing palmettos until our last morning. Lifeguards during the holiday were lax in the AM hours; barely watched the lazy river complex. The lazy river is a nice idea, but there are several areas out of sight of adult observation or supervision, not to mention lifeguards. Strong current, as needed to move the tubes, but was clearly a handful for small kids. Entry point by main pool looks docile enough, but parents of youngsters really need to station themselves on the overpass bridge to keep an eye on the kids, because the lifeguards do not. Kids and adults complained about banging their heads repeatedly in the yellow waterslide, too. Maybe the water volume/speed is too high? Kids avoided using the slide after the first couple of times. Plenty of mosquitos despite dry weather raised plenty of welts as well. Terrible and erratic wi-fi too. Yes, it is free, and yes the signal is strong, BUT the bandwidth is horrible and most applications struggle or fail. (e.g., could't shop Amazon or search w/Google!) There appear to be long-term renters interspersed in the units, sporting Christmas trees, wreaths, wall decorations, bikes, etc. Right off 192, and only a block from restaurants and 3 blocks from a Publix, so it is a convenient location, but police sirens at all hours of the night were disruptive. All in all a mediocre stay. We've had better stays in all respects, including safety, at places like Liki Tiki (incl water park), Marriott Cypress, Grand Beach resort, and others: Minimal or no palmettos or mosquitoes, decent wi-fi, good lifeguarding, and units in better condition.

We chose this because it was a special on a travel site and seemed like a great value to us. Upon check-in we were given keys to the \"room\" / villa... one did not work at all. They have magnetic key cards instead of swipers which were sometimes touchy. We arrived after midnight from a long drive and basically just fell in bed. Overall our stay was \"fine\"... not anything that I would call outstanding or even great really. Our villa included two bedrooms, on with king bed and one with two twins. Our third child slept on the couch. The pull out couch was NOT nice looking so we folded it back up and made him sleep on the couch itself. There were NO linens in the villa for the pullout even if he had WANTED to sleep on it... We had only 4 towels for our family of 5 and had to go to the front desk and request more. The front desk \"informed\" me that they should be under the TV cabinet. They were not. Let alone if we wanted a set of dry towels for the pool! The TV's were antiquated. Not only were they OLDER model box tv's but they were all less than 19 inches! I know you don't come on vacation to watch to TV but still... even our kids (who are 9,7,5) were instantly like \"REALLY?\". The linens on all the beds were older and my back hurt almost every night sleeping in the master. The one thing that REALLY got to me though, was the \"washer / dryer\"... haha... they should not even advertise this as a feature. I believe the tag on ours said it was produced in the late 80's!!! It was SO loud that I was SURE our neighbors complained when I tried to do laundry one night and it literally took running the dryer 4X (4 hours) to dry 4 towels! (which is problematic considering how tight they are with the towels!) I asked someone TWICE at the front desk about getting our washer and dryer looked at and in the 6 days we were there we never saw anyone and the thing never stopped making the horrendous noise. The overall condition of the villa, I would call, run down. You could tell it has been \"half-way\" renovated.. But what god are granite countertops if the 1980's appliances and cabinets underneath them are crappy? If you are going to renovate... don't be cheap! I had no issue with not having a daily room service... we use a friend's condo in Alabama and we are used to \"condo\" life of \"clean your own mess\"... we are FINE with that but there was little, in the way of cleaners, to do so! I went to walmart and bought my own things. I refused to use the dishware provided because the dishwasher barely worked, let alone was able to SANITIZE anything! ACK. The POOL area was phenomenal but the lifeguards were ALWAYS late to open the slides and lazy river, which is an issue for a mom who had kids who get up at 7 am. The pool is supposed to open at 9 or 10 am... but either way it was usually almost 11 am before it really opened. The guards were ALWAYS found slouched in at a table near the base of the slides or smoking.. having been a guard myself in my younger days that would NEVER have been acceptable. There were many towel huts but no towels in them... so why there were there I don't know. The jacuzzi area was BEAUTIFUL!!! The back porch was fine... we didn't really use it but it did make me paranoid that they had TWO bars to lock your sliding doors. Made me wonder if we were in an ok part of town! Also, I wondered why there was no clothes line to hang wet suits from... having been on many a vacation I know those retractable ones exist. Would be a nice addition considering the dryer barely worked! Speaking of security... forget about using the \"safe\". I have a DSLR camera and it was not big enough to fit it in there... let alone our laptop... The wireless internet was VERY slow even at off hours... The wireless at the pool / main desk area was MUCH better though! Parking was fine for us... we always got the spot RIGHT in front of our villa and our villa was an EASY walk to the pool but they were re-surfacing black top the entire week and had half of the parking closed. I felt bad for those who had to walk 1/2 mile from parking to their villas... :( I could also tell, as we were leaving and the holiday rush was arriving that later in the weekend parking might have been a MAJOR issue. In our \"court\" people were parked all over the place, in the grass, median, in front of the dumpsters...Overall I was ok with this \"hotel\" because we spent nearly every waking hour at Disney or the beach ... if we had had to see more of the hotel I would have been upset honestly. It is very centrally located to the main \"strip\" in Orlando and close to Disney. We usually stay at Nick Hotel and likely will go back there next year. We stayed at a Comfort suites on the drive home and it was 10X nicer than this place... :(", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philad", "Title": "\u201cGreat Townhouse\u201d", "Author": "Keeblerelf928", "ReviewID": "UR121694617", "Content": "The two bedroom townhouse gave plenty of space for 4 adults to spread out and have separate sleeping quarters which is a must. We had an updated unit that save for a few issues was in perfect condition. In our townhouse we had 2 bedrooms upstairs with a full large bathroom. One bedroom had a \"king\" sized bed (two twins pushed together) and the other room had two twin beds. There was also a tiny washer and dryer. Downstairs there was another full bathroom that was a bit on the small side, a large kitchen, living and dining room and a nice screened in porch. It was located within a 10-15 minute drive of all the Disney Parks and within a 20 minute drive of Sea World and Universal Studios. Check in and check out was a breeze. We were able to check in 5 hours early since we had a morning flight in and we check out in less than 2 minutes. The front desk staff was hit and miss on helpfulness. Some of the people we spoke to were great, and others had no interest in helping. For example, we went to grill and the gas grill wasn't working so we called the front desk to ask for help. That person informed us that the directions were there and hung up. After another 10 minutes of trying we called again and the next person sent maintanance out. It turns out the gas was off and we were never going to get it lit without their help. The amenities on property included 3 pools (1 main pool and 2 smaller near other town homes) 2 main Spas and at least one Spa at the smaller pool by our townhome. It also had a water park that included a lazy river and 2 water slides. The tubes they use for the lazy river are too large for the size of the river and constantly got stuck. We had a lot more fun just swimming around without the tubes. The water slides are super fast and if you are the least bit claustrophobic you should not take the yellow slide. The main pool by the small waterpark is heated and the smaller pools did not appear to be heated. We had a blast hanging out at the main pool on our non park days. The only issue that knocked it down a mark was the screens in one of the rooms was completely busted to the point the window could not be opened without risking bugs getting in. When mentioned to maintenance they did nothing to help. The only other issue we had was they decided to repave the parking lot while we were there. They gave us only a few hours warning to move the car and the next parking lot over was nowhere near our townhouse and there was no walkway between that lot and the townhouse. With how few guests they had at the time there was no reason to pave the lot near occupied townhouse.

The full size kitchen is perfect when traveling with kids, as they like to snack and it's easy to just keep things in the fridge and use the microwave if needed. Plus, there's a Publix just down the road to pick up food items to make for those late night cravings when restaraunts are closed. The location is great! Close to shopping, restaurants, and less than 20 min from Disney and Universal. If you rent a car, don't prepay for fuel because everything is so close to the resort (unless they give you a Hummer and you're driving to Daytona Beach), it's cheaper to fill the tank on your own. I had very few encounters with the staff, but what little I did have, everyone was very helpful and upbeat. I didn't find anything wrong with not having maid service during out stay. The villa is clean and I've never had a problem with dirty linens or bugs coming into the apartment Or anything yucky at all. The free wi-fi is decent. The gym, pools, sauna, steam room, and arcade, gave all of us something to do if we were having downtime in between trips to the theme parks.

The bathrooms are adequate, the beds are comfy, a full size stack washer and dryer in each villa is a big plus. The water slide, lazy river, and main pool is new and a popular hang out for vacationers, but there are also two other pools and hot tubs that are rarely used in other locations on the property if you want to avoid the crowds. Gas and charcoal grills are located in various parts of the property. The location is decently located close enough to attractions and restaurants, but away from all the crowds and noise. Shopping is close by. SuperTarget and Wal-Mart are a few miles away, or a Publix grocery store is a quick ten minute walk from the property. Overall, this is a really good place to stay. I only found two annoyances: 1) There were never any towels at the pools. I have a feeling they only put out towels once during the day and when the supply is gone, it's gone until the next day. An inconvenience, but not the end of the world. We simply bought a few and brought our own. 2) As this is a timeshare property, you will be asked to \"meet with the manager\" or \"discuss opportunities\" a number of times.

The Pool area (recently refurbished) had a great pool, water slides, jacuzzis and a lazy river, perfect for our one relaxing day off from the Parks. The pool was open til 11pm too so it was great to have a swim after a long sticky day walking! It's no longer than 15 mins drive to all the parks (Disney, Seaworld and Universal) and ample parking.

The other reviewers who mentioned the univited visitors and rude and unattentive staff were spot on. My family and I stayed at the \"resort\" from July 30-August 6 and the accomodations were the lowlight of our otherwise amazing vacation! Check-in- We arrived right on time for check-in and were greeted by a line that nearly extended past the front entrance. About 7 people were in front of us and, although there were three representatives at the front desk, it took nearly an hour for us to get keys to the unit. When i finally approached the desk, I was appalled by the condition of the front desk (littered with paperwork including personal information of guests, like credit card numbers) and the unprofessional appearance of the staff (one particular lady had holes in her dirty polo that was branded with the resort's logo...yuck). Getting settled in- Upon entering our unit, we were greeted with a wonderfully toasty room. The temperature, according to the thermostat was a sweltering 78 degrees ( it felt warmer). I adjusted the thermostat to cool the room and continued unpacking the cars. There were four adults and three small children staying together so, needless to say, it was important that we get the room to cool. Speaking of the kids, before leaving for dinner, we called the front desk and asked if they had any cribs available. The maintenance crew brought over two play yards that appeared to have survived Chernobyl. These things were GROSS with all kinds on nasty stains all over. The wives began wiping down the play yards and they went through nearly an entire container of clorox wipes just getting out the major funk...I can't believe we let our kids sleep in those things. Nevertheless, we were thankful that they could accomodate our request and we left for dinner. We returned to the unit around 10pm and surprise surprise, the room was as hot as it was when we left. I placed a call to the front desk and was told that it was too late and there were no maintenance workers available (but wait, isn't this place a \"resort\"?). In all fairness, they did say that someone would be availabe at 6am and they actually did call at 6am (i was a bit hung over so told them I'd call back once we were all awake). I called the front desk at 9am and asked them to come, by this point, we realized that only one small burner on the stove was working and that, adjacent to the closet with the air conditioner, the bottom step was saturated with water. Making breakfast was interesting with one burner. I called again at 9:30am, and after holding for ten minutes was greeted by a rep who picked up the phone and said \"they aren't there yet?\". No they still had not come. Another call at 9:45 and yet another call at 10:30...still no maintenance. My final call at 10:50am was a rough call, needless to say, i was probably less than warm. The maintenance man showed up 2 hours and 12 minutes after our first call at 9:00am...UNACCEPTABLE BY ANY STANDARDS. The maintenance man apologized for the wait and informed us that he was the only maintenance man on staff...a \"resort\"??? The worker had to leave and get a shop vac to suck up all the water that had leaked in the closet from the faulty AC and promised that a technician would RETURN to charge the AC. He attempted to fix the burners and was successful with 2 of the 3. Visitors- our second evening was free of all the not-so-luxurious amenities of our first night but did include a visit from some very healthy and fast waterbugs. For those unfamiliar with the term, a waterbug is the equivalent of a cockroach on a steroids regimen, fully grown and fast as heck. My cousin and I hunted him down and smashed him. Towels- plan on bringing your own. We soiled the towels that were in the unit and requested a fresh supply. We were told that we would have to pay $10. Not great news but, at this point, whatever. We asked for the towels and had to wait, yes wait, another 2.5 hours for someone to show up with a bag of towels. And no, there weren't even enough towels for all that were in the unit. All in all, i would never stay here again. The luxury of a kitchen to work out of (especially when you travel with small children) is not worth the inconvenience of staying at a place that is obviously not managed adequately. The management and staff need to step up their game if they hope to compete with the countless options that available and superior. In closing, the only thing that resembled a resort was the word resort used in the name. This fantasy world was more of a nightmare than anything.

We paid $550 for 5 nights, for which we could have got a nice hotel room somewhere else in the area, but we liked the idea of a house where we could come and go. The member of staff who checked me in was very rude, looked at my reservation ticket (through AAA) and asked me if I had anything else, when I said no this was what it said to print and hand in and asked if it would be okay she grumbled 'we'll see' and then continued checking me in with no conversation, eye contact or (to be quite frank) manners. The villa itself was nice, we were able to cook, do laundry, park easily and lock our personal things in the safe but we had a number of small (baby?) cockroaches crawling around the bathroom floor and kitchen (floor and cupboards). I'd say we killed at least 4 of these each day we were there. One day there was rain and we came home to find two HUGE roaches crawling round the kitchen and bathroom (at least 2 inches long). We managed to catch them in glasses and dispose of them outside but it was too late to contact the front desk about this. We had an early start the following day so plugged up all the drains and blocked any holes in the tiling and thankfully came back to just a few small bugs. On checkout the following day I handed my keys to the representative on the desk and said to her that there were a number of cockroaches in the villa and it might need someone looking at it - I got no response, she continued typing on her computer. So I asked her 'did you hear me? about the roaches?' She glanced up and replied 'yes' and then continued typing. This irritated me and I left the complex fuming and determined to lodge a complaint about the customer service I received on my two dealings with the front desk. Overall I would say stay here but the minute you see a bug speak to them and have them come and sort it ... you really don't get any thanks for just getting on with it and not complaining.

First off all though, let me say that the facility itself was a positive. I had touched based about a week before our arrival and asked for an updated unit. Our request, although not guaranteed, was granted. Our villa for the most part was clean and comfortable. We had a nice quiet unit near the back of the property. A little ways from the pool, but nothing totally inconvenient. Our number one issue was with cockroaches. We had three of these visitors to our villa. I reported the issue to the front desk. They filled out a form and told me they would inform maintenance immediately (I thought this meant that maintenance would be there immediately). An hour and a half later I phoned the front desk and they informed me that maintenance does not tell them when they will deal with an issue but they told me that they would check on it again. TWO maintenance guys showed up with ONE can of spray 20 minutes later (still not sure what took two people, but there it is). Sprayed our bathroom, but did nothing to block the small hole where my husband saw one scurry off. We had no further issues, but I did not feel entirely comfortable knowing their point of access of still available. Another issue we had is that we checked in on the 13th and out of 23rd and there was no housekeeping services for the duration of our stay. The only time they showed up was early the day we were due to check out to see if we had left yet! One other minor complaint was the sketchy nature of the internet connection. Sometimes is was okay, other times it was downright useless. The best reception we got was outside the front door! We did not go on vacation to surf the net, however, so it was only a minor inconvenience, but an inconvenience nonetheless.

Most of all, however, we were impressed with the professional, friendly and helpful staff who ensured that we had a really enjoyable and memorable time during our stay.

The interiors are still really old and dated, and the front desk said that we must have gotten an old unit when we complained. Why weren't we given a choice? The biggest problem was the pool area. There is no control over the kids, and the pool is not kept clean and there is little chlorine. After just a few minutes in it, my wife ended up with a HUGE boil on her face! There is no WARNING to shower before entering the pool and NO ONE does it. Kids sit in the hot tub and laugh when they fart. I am sure they are peeing in it, and there are NO PARENTS around. As I write this, there is LOUD music in the pool area and a DJ yelling at the top of his lungs to reach an audience of 10 people. It is DEAFENING!

It is the loudest, most obnoxious thing ever, and the music might be appropriate for a ghetto bar, but not for what is supposed to be FAMILIES on VACATION!

If I wanted a timeshare, I would seek them out. The \"exercise\" room is at the front of the reception building with a HUGE glass window so that there is NO privacy. There were THREE pieces of equipment. Terrible \"amenity\". The \"security\" appears to consist of one old man who drives around late at night. I noticed several groups of kids and adults who were not guests, yet were using the basketball court and pool. This can't be good for security! The final comment is on the Internet.

The choice of the resort was intentional having researched carefully for the type of place I wanted. Going with reasonably high expectations is always dangerous, but I have to say I was not disappointed. Yes, the property is not the newest around. It was clearly built some time ago and the efforts being made by the owners to update the resort is evidence that they acknowledge this. But don't let that put you off as this place is fantastic value for money. The extra facilities, including lazy river feature will make this place even better. It comes very well equipped with everything you need for a family - including a kettle! The washer/dryer is great and we found really simple to use. Furniture was OK, nothing special but functional and clean. The layout of villa was perfect for us with 2 teenage daughters. A room to themselves and 2 bathrooms between us, which is an absolute necessity. Having visited Florida a few times already we were not desperate to run around and get frazzled so took advantage of the pool which was fine - we tended to go there in the morning and between 9.30am and 11am had it mainly to ourselves. It was clean and well maintained and most days there were maintenance staff out cleaning the place up really well. Our experience was that the staff were great. We checked in at 1am after a flight delay and were greeted courteously and professionally by the guy at reception. On another occasion got great help printing out some literature. Check out at 5.30am was equally good. Location is great - it is at the top end of Kissimmee so you are really close to I4 and I-Drive, and Disney is 10 minutes. Easy access as well for Seaworld and Universal. Plenty of restaurants and shops nearby - including Olive Garden which I recommend. If you want to make the most of your trip do get out from the theme parks and try the 'real' Florida for a bit. We visited Kelly Park in Apopka (entry $5) and rented tubes for $3 from a stall on the way into the state park. You can then spend 30 minutes drifting down the river with accompanying turtles, fish and otters swimming around you!

Our villa was conveniently located just across the street from the lobby and front desk and I can't praise it highly enough. The kitchen is fully equipped with everything you could possibly need including toaster, hobs, oven, microwave, coffee maker, kettle, fridge and dishwasher among other things. There is also a living room that is quite spacious with cable TV and sofas, along with a table for eating. A bathroom with shower can also be found on the ground floor. Upstairs is just as good, with 2 bedrooms - one with double bed and one with 2 single beds and both were extremely clean and had TVs and wardrobes. There was plenty of room for 2 adults and 2 teens aged 16 and 14. Also upstairs is a washing machine and another bathroom that has a bath tub. Free WiFi is available in the villas, but the connection can be rather slow at times. In terms of facilities, tennis courts and basketball courts are available for use aswell as 3 swimming pools that are open from early morning until mignight. I did not know a lot of the facilities existed until we met some lovely Americans who told us about the fitness centre, children's playground and the other 2 pools we had not discovered!! Also included are activity and arcade video game rooms, a pool bar selling drinks and snacks and a business centre with computers offering free internet access. A shuttle is available to Universal Resort, but there is only one per day which leaves at around 9am and returns around 7pm. There is also one for Disney World and Sea World, but I am unsure of timings for these as we didn't use them. The complex is located a couple of miles away from Interstate 4 which provides the easiest access to the theme parks (Universal, DIsney etc). We did manage to get lost a few times though, especially at night, so taking a Sat Nav may be a smart option to avoid this. For eating out, there is a very nice grill which is less than half a mile down the road called Smokey Bones, which I would definitely recommend. There are many more eating places though that are no more than 5 miles away including IHOP, TGI Fridays and Cracker Barrel. If you wish to order food to eat in your villa, there is a Domino's pizza, as well as several other take-away options including Chinese and Indian Also, Walmarts are in abundance in this part of town, so finding groceries for any meals isn't a problem. Overall, this is a wonderful complex of villas that offer clean and convenient accommodation for any ages.

Kitchens are fully stocked with all the equipment you could need (dishwaher, coffee maker, dishsoap). The dryer did take a little long to dry the clothes, but It was probably because the lint trap was hard to find, it's hidden on the back to the right.

We had just a couple of minor issues. First, they should've spent some of the money from the kitchen/bath remodel on new mattresses. They weren't horribly uncomfortable, but they were so loud when you sat on them or rolled over... Second, we did have a minor ant infestation in the first floor bathroom, but only on the last night we were there. Bugs are a fact of life in Florida and the staff was very responsive when we notified them of the issue. Finally, we mistakenly left a door unlocked in our car and our GPS was stolen on the second to last night. This was our fault, but it did put a damper on our experience. Crime is a fact of life, but I have to think that places like Orlando are going to be hit harder than most due to the recession as it is so tourist-driven and the less disposible income people have, the less they will travel to places like Orlando...hence, a higher crime rate.

We wanted to see both the East and West coast and go to Disney. The Orlando/Kissimmee area is the perfect location for a trip such as this. Upon arrival we were greeted in the lobby by a very efficient young lady. The property is pretty spread out so we were given a map. We got to our villa and we absolutely loved it. I read other reviews which advised that we ask in advance for one of the remodeled villas. I didn't do this but apparently we lucked out because our villa was beautiful. We didn't want to leave the resort. Of course we did because we had plans but we couldn't wait to get back each evening and would sometimes cut our excursions short just to be able to enjoy our villa and the facilities. We did end up planning a day to stay at the resort so that we could get the most out of what it had to offer and to enjoy our beautiful condo. Our villa had two bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a kitchen, dining area, living room and a screened in patio. It had two plasma tv's, one in the living room and one in the master bedroom. The second bedroom also had a tv. Not only did it include everything you would need for a week, the washer dryer and dishwasher were added luxuries. I came home not having to do laundry. The pool was great and the hot tub was hot and large and a great place to soothe your aching feet. If the main pool gets too crowded, you have the option of two other pools to choose from. We were quite happy with the main pool which had plenty of chairs and tables to choose from and the bar for sodas or cocktails. My sons spent some time almost every night at the bar located at the main pool. John, the bartender there was excellent, he had a pleasant personality and was informative about the area. Disney is only three miles straight down the road out front, in fact we got lost looking for the resort and ended up at Disney, that's how close it is. From this resort we visited Clearwater Beach, Daytona Beach, Smyrna Beach, Disney, and Busch Gardens. This is a great place to stay. We booked as a combination package deal and probably got a better deal than if we had booked separately so it's a good idea to check out the packages if you plan to limit your stay to just one resort.

But, compare that to a one room hotel and you're so much more pleased to be able to spread out after a long day on your feet. We had requested a villa that was updated and ended up to be a great location. Near to the main office and a pool outside our patio. They did replace fencing around the pool while we were there, but it was all done during the day while we were pretty much gone. The staff was great, a little hard to understand sometimes since we only speak english and one had a hard time understanding us. Supplies are provided for cooking, a little bit of laundry, dishes, broom and mop. They do offer housekeeping for a fee, we chose not to as we were not there a lot. Great location, not exactly to find according to the directions that we were given. But, we managed just fine. It's close to major highways and quick to get to anything. Having to go to the office to use the internet was a bit of an annoyance, but we were on vacation. So that's okay, a break from reality at Fantasy World was just fine. Highly recommend getting bottled water though, the tap water has a swampy smell to it. With the heat down there we had to have a lot of water.

Having two bathrooms was great, and they provided an abundance of towels, dishwashing detergent, clothes detergent (Tide) and even fabric sheets (Bounce).

No one, even the taxi drivers know where this place is. Room was musty, the bedding was from the 1970's. Grounds are nothing to brag about, it looks like a large apartment complex.

The location is great! The villa complex is situated about 15-20 mins (give or take) from the Disney theme parks. You have plenty of eating establishments nearby and to choose from. There is also a huge Walmart about 3 mins away if you choose to shop and cook in your villa instead of eating out, which we we did 3 times during our stay. This helps you save money and I totally reccommend it. Overall, our stay was pleasant and I have absolutely no complaints. I do, however, have one suggestion. I have never stayed in a villa before and I guess they have no cleaning service coming in daily to clean the room as regular hotels do? It would be helpful if management would provide a broom, mop and cleaning materials in each room so that guests can clean up at their convenience. There were a couple of times when spills and accidents occurred and I had to resort to cleaning up with paper towels. Not very practical. I totally recommend this establishment.

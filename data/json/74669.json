My husband and I were staying in the area to go to medical appts at Mayo Clinic. My husband needed the handicapped room and we were shown a large room with the proper amenities and size. We stayed here 4 nights and the only detraction I would give this place is the noise from the I-17 fwy that our window faced. The room was clean and fresh, as was the bathroom. Carpeting and bedding were new and in good condition. Front desk staff were always ready to help, for instance getting me a can opener so that we could open a can to cook in our room. We did not rent a fridge or microwave because of our limited budget. Our ice chest was always full of ice from the hotel though.

We arrived around 11pm on a Friday (we had called ahead to say that we would be late) and the front desk clerk had everything ready for check in and got us into our room quickly. The rooms was clean and comfortable although on the small side. As with most hotels, the airconditioner was noisy, but we slept anyway. the breakfast was continental (simple and healthy). The breakfast attendant was great, as soon as something was getting low she jumped right in and refilled it. Unfortunately, the breakfast eating area was on the small side and a little crowded. The pool was nice to have for the kids, although a little small for the number of guests. The staff was very nice, and got right in and cleaned our room; we came back early in the afternoon from our soccer tournament and they had already cleaned up the room. Parking was ok, but a little crowded (a bigger lot would be nice). Location is ok, right at the loop where all the freeways meet. We had a good stay, the price was ok (I would have liked it, a little smaller), and we would return. Not a bad hotel, although a little small if you like a lot of room, it was ok with me, but I am on the petite side.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cVery Clean and Comfortable\u201d", "Author": "Betty O", "ReviewID": "UR126092146", "Content": "Had a very pleasant stay at Sleep Inn.

The breakfast was not much to speak of, once past the hot waffles (make-them-yourself) but I didn't go there for food. The bed was comfortable, the room was clean and modern, the shower was large and the water was hot. There was a coffee maker in the room and an iron and hair dryer and room 104 (ask for it) was right off the main entrance, near the breakfast area, and the ice machine. There was little noise even though the room was close to the check-in desk, and there was a side entrance which made transfer of luggage convenient. I happened upon the hotel by chance--the address is a bit confusing. Exit the interstate at Bell Road and go west 1/2 block to 29th street. Go north on 29th 1/2 mile and the hotel will be on your right just beyond the school zone. Along the way you will see a Fry's grocery store (there was a fridge and microwave in my room), a movie theater, and a restaurant or two.

We had reservations at the Scottsdale Sleep Inn, but we had changed our vacation and decided to leave a day earlier. When I tried to get our room for another day in Scottsdale, I was told that they were booked. I called all around Phoenix and Scottsdale on the Sunday before our departure on Thursday, and almost every hotel was booked, many events going on, and found that the Sleep Inn in Phoenix North had rooms. They quoted me $114.00 plus a $15.00 pet fee. Not happy with the price I reluctantly took it, because we needed to have a room. How bad could it be, it was over a hundred dollars? How wrong that thought was! We got to the hotel with our dog and son after calling several times to get directions. Not an easy place to find. If you blink you'll miss the driveway. Finding a place to park was just as hard. They have a tiny parking lot and many of the vehicles were occupying two spaces, because the spaces are so narrow. We checked in with our son and dog and we had asked for a non-smoking room with two double beds. We were put on the second floor. As we were walking upstairs we couldn't get over the strong odor of cigarette smoke. We were walking in a cloud of it. We got to our room pulled back the bed spreads to find that both spreads were covered in urine stains, at least that is what it looked like. How gross is that? On the floor they went. The room was okay, the pillows and floor were also a bit stained and the door didn't lock all that well. I really didn't want my dog on the floor let alone my son. Definately not worth anything close to a $114.00. I went down to ask the manager if we were in a smoking room and he said no, but that half of the second floor is smoking. We checked out the next morning and I looked over my bill and saw that they charged me an extra dollar for use of the safety depoit box it the room. We never used it and he took it off. Make sure you check your bill, because it looks like it's just an automatic charge unless you say something. The next three nights were at the Sleep Inn in Scottsdale, $77.00 a night plus a $10.00 pet charge, and all I have to say is georgeous! I would have paid $114.00 easy in Scottsdale. Stay in Scottsdale! It's cheaper, much, much cleaner and a better value. It's also only 15 mins away from the one in North Phoenix.", "Date": "November 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Forest Grove, OR", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4014396", "Content": "This is a nice small hotel.

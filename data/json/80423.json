It is within walking distance to the Gaslamp district. They call this hotel Sheraton Suites but one would expect a kitchenette in a suite. There was a microwave but no fridge. We called the front desk and they sent a mini fridge up. The room was the size of a slightly larger than average hotel room but just separated by french doors. The pull out couch was atrocious if you actually needed to pull it out. I sat down on it and instantly sunk to the floor! No, I am not overweight. My child could not sleep on this. There were two beds in the bedroom so we managed. The bathroom door has a sliding door that is a pain. It makes a horrible banging noise when you close it, hence waking up everyone in the middle of the night if you have to use it. The parking sucks. You have to spiral up 7 floors (until you are green) and then wind up another 4 floors until you get to the Sheraton parking. After that you need to take an elevator up one floor. Then you are in the lobby. Then you can finally take an elevator up to your floor. A tad convoluted, don't you think? All for the price of $23 a day! With the bad out of the way I will get to the good. It is not a fine hotel. Good location. The rooms are clean. They even provide wine glasses which I find unusual for a Sheraton. The staff was wonderful. The bartenders in the lounge were very, very personable. I'm sorry I didn't get their names. In fact, all of the staff we encountered went out of their way to be very friendly. We really appreciate this. The pool was small but according to my children who are connoisseurs of hotel pools, \"fun\".

Valet at the street was helpful and courteous. Check in desk was very friendly and got us our club upgrade we wanted. We ended up at the top floor and on the end so I think we got lucky with a quiet room and a nice view. The room was suite setup which made it roomy for us staying the 2 days and we were able to chill in the room and spread out a little. You can definitely here your neighbors when they were in the hallway but we heard nobody from other rooms. We visited the workout room it had various cardio and one weight center, no free weights.

Several times a day I heard strange noises in the walls that sounded like a very large cow mooing (old pipes maybe).

Our expensive candy basket had open packages in it, the mini bar was out of order, the carpet was dirty, and the windows were dirty. We were on the 19th floor, so we cleaned our windows so we could look out. The bed was SUPREME as far as that goes, but the top comforter was dirty, with what looked to be chocolate smears. (very little, but noticeable on a white comforter). I sure hope it was chocolate. Then, went to jump on the internet on my lap top to explore options for things to do. $11 a day for that ? really ? Motel 6 offers free internet in each room. $23 for parking ? disappointing. Nothing great here.

I answered the phone and confirmed there was no valet at the stand so they paged him by radio and he finally appeared. -Used the decaf and was not left anymore the next day, wrote a note to ask for more from housekeeping, got 2 the next day -Used glasses were not replaced with clean ones the next day so from then on I left them in the sink and they got replaced -No shelves in the shower on which to place toiletries -Two light bulbs were out over the vanity and never got replaced during our stay -I can't swear that the heater was working, it seemed to only blow cold air, I could be wrong Overall it was disappointing and I would not stay there again given so many other choices.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Forest,CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at Sheraton Symphony Hall!\u201d", "Author": "horn2tr", "ReviewID": "UR121287638", "Content": "We have stayed at this hotel many times and were not disappointed this time either.

This high rise hotel is located above the San Diego Symphony Hall in the downtown area just a few minutes walk from the Gaslamp District. The lobby / front office is located on the 12th floor of the hotel. A restaurant and bar are located adjacent to the lobby along with several meeting rooms, a pool, and a gym that are located on the same floor. A friendly front office associate promptly checked me in and welcomed me to the hotel. He was kind enough to ask me if I needed any maps, recommendations on places to see, or dining recommendations for the area. I was assigned a room on the 25th floor overlooking Balboa Park and the airport. The room was spacious with a nice lounge area with flat screen TV and bar service area (with sink) that also included a microwave oven. Adjacent to the lounge was a work area with a desk and Internet connection. Internet service was offered at an extra charge. The bedroom was located behind a set of French doors adjacent to the lounge area. There was a standard tube TV in the bedroom. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was divided into two separate rooms. There was a sink and large closet in the first room. A toilet, bathtub and separate shower stall were in the second room. With the exception of some stains on the carpet in the bedroom and small patches of mildew on the caulking in the bathroom and some spotty, poorly applied, caulking around the shower stall, the entire room appeared clean and well maintained. The furniture in the room was standard hotel furniture, maybe even a little \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upscale\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for hotel furniture, with some pieces that were due for replacement due to having numerous scratches. Over my three day stay at the hotel I had breakfast in the hotel restaurant each morning. The restaurant offers a nice buffet with hot and cold selections but I decided to order from the menu as the buffet was simply too much food for breakfast. All of the staff I encountered in the restaurant were welcoming and provided prompt and courteous service. The food I ordered was tasty and of good quality and was served to me within a reasonable period of time. Overall, I found this hotel offers a quality hard and soft product with the soft product accentuated by the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quality staff. Unfortunately, I did not have my camera with me during this trip but the photos posted by others here on Trip Advisor accurately depict the room in which I stayed. GETTING THERE If you are arriving by plane and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind taking public transportation, metro bus #992 can take you to and from the airport directly into downtown for just $2.25 each way. There are bus stops just outside each of the terminals at the airport. Disembark at Broadway and 8th Streets which is about a 15-20 minute ride from the airport depending on the time of day and traffic conditions. Walk back to 7th Street, turn right, and walk north (up the slight hill) for three blocks to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Street then turn right. The entrance to the hotel is mid-block. If you arrive by train, the hotel is about a 15-20 minute walk, east on Broadway (turn left on Broadway after exiting the train station), then left on 7th Street to \"A\" Street. You can also catch the #992 airport bus on Broadway, either the Orange Line trolley towards Gillespie Field or the Blue Line trolley towards San Ysidro (disembark at 5th Street), or catch a taxi.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "usa", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "skydoc101", "ReviewID": "UR119355381", "Content": "The entrance to the hotel is kind of a hole the in wall with an elevator to the 12th floor lobby.

The tub faucet had a continuous leak...tink..tink..tink. The couch sagged a bit and being dark blue cloth, there were bits of lint on the surface. There was a piece of wrapper trash on the carpet.

Desk is basic, almost looks like they bought from a second hand repo company and the chair is comfortable but I could not figure out how to make the back recline (my fault probably versus the chair).

Located in the Downtown area, this hotel is close to a lot of restaurants and bars, as well as the mall.. however it is also rife with homeless. They are fairly non invasive compared to San Francisco, so that was a positive. Rooms were smallish and my room was not very clean (toenail clippings on floor, bathroom a bit dirty).. but it wasn't bad. Linens were fabulous, as was the water pressure in the bathroom. A lot of hotels have a noisy bathroom, this one does not! We were able to bathe and use the restroom at night without waking the others in the room. However --the bathroom does have the pull doors, so that can get clanky. You can decline housekeeping during your stay and receive a $5 voucher for the gift shop.. however be warned you have to put the placard about housekeeping on your door (small print). We declined housekeeping by leaving our do not disturb sign up 24/7 as we have done with other hotels and were denied our vouchers... when asked, the front desk staff were not able to verify if our room had been cleaned or not. Seemed like a gimmick to not pay out the vouchers. The front desk staff here are awful! We were booked for a club room floor, but were put on the 23rd floor instead. I had 3 people in my room, and was only given two keys and no breakfast vouchers... nor was I told about the Club Lounge or any other hotel amenities. I had to return to the front desk for my 3rd key and breakfast items. I inquired about checkout times and what time I had to have my car out of the parking garage on our last day, and could not get a straight answer. I would have appreciated being told about what elevators take you where in the hotel, as we had to figure out the elevator hopping by ourselves and it was very confusing for the first 2 days. I also was not given the shuttle information and maps provided by SDCC to the hotels to give to the guests... all the other hotels I visited in past years as well as stopped by in on this visit had their information prominently displayed. Breakfast (the buffet) was very respectable. Lots of cold and hot items, the orange juice and cottage cheese here are excellent (lots of places have yucky versions).. the wait staff was amazing. Very polite, helpful and quick to respond to your needs. The waitstaff was the best part of this hotel. Parking: It's not fun getting up to the 12th floor, but it's not the nightmarish corkscrew other reviews have said it to be. With that said, I never moved my car the 4 days we were here because it wasn't worth the hassle for me. In short... I wouldn't return unless the rate was $149/nt or less. The negative items outweighed the positives, and I've stayed in better hotels for less than the $300 we were charged.

We thought we would try a different Sheraton this time around since we've been to the Sheraton Mission Valley. This Sheraton is much closer to downtown area and Balboa Park which has a lot to do including the San Diego Zoo. We were impressed with the general layout of this all-suite hotel, since we have a toddler. The separation of rooms is nice even though it did feel a bit cramped. We were upgraded to the Club Level floor (26th) with a view of the San Diego bay and convention center. Directly across was a high rise business building. Although I'm not sure how much different the rooms are because when we went to the Club Lounge, it was a weird setup. First it wasn't in the same area as the Club Level rooms, which seems to make more sense. Second, the amenities in the Club lounge was somewhat lacking even in comparison to the Mission Valley location. At least there, you got to sit in a room that actually felt more like a lounge, they offered, a continental breakfast and also an afternoon wine and cheese. But not at this Sheraton Suites! It was actually quite awkward when I went into the lounge, you go past the restaurant then come around to your \"private\" entry. Once inside you see a sign that points to \"breakfast buffet\" thinking that this was part of the deal. Because we've been to Sheraton MIssion Valley where it is part of the deal at Club Level. I mean, what's the advantage of a club level room if there really isn't anything special about it? It does offer soda and coffee. But that's it. Very awkward conversation with the wait staff - who came down hard on me because I was getting a small carton of milk for my 2-year old son saying it wasn't part of the Club Lounge. Embarrassing and also confusing. Decent rooms- somewhat dated, quick check-in and checkout, courteous valet albeit the $30 charge. You pay for convenience. Location is easy access to the freeways. It is walking distance to gaslamp quarter and can find alternative dining experience nearby. Disappointed with club level lounge location and amenities.

If I was to brush my teeth at the sink, the hubby wouldn't be able to get his stuff out of the closet! Very annoying. My chief disappointment is the cleanliness of the room. The double door that closed off the bedroom from the living room had blood stain of fingerprints on one of the doors! Disgusting! I didn't noticed this until we checked out. OMG, I wanted to vomit! There were other little things that didn't make me happy like the phone wasn't working properly, but the bloody finger print stain was unacceptable. The only thing positive about this hotel that I can say is the service. We requested a fridge for the room and we got it within 15 minutes.

Special kudos to Craig Holbrook, the head of the Concierge team who was super-friendly, very professional and just outstanding! My only complaint with this hotel was the housekeeping. This was a MAJOR problem and a MAJOR disappointment for us. The room did not seem to have been vacuumed before we checked in, and I am sure it was not vauumed once during our whole stay. Many days the room was obviously not properly cleaned - our dirty coffee cups, glasses and crumbs on the carpets etc. awaiting us when we returned. More often than not, we had to ask for or leave notes requesting that the supplies be replenished (shampoo, soap, lotion, coffee, etc.) even when it should have been fairly obvious.

We normally prefer the Starwood hotels, so this was a good choice for our family given that it is a suites hotel. The bell hop/valets were always helpful with directions, the check-in process was speedy and she was very eager to please. A few things to know: We stayed on the 25th floor and the rooms are in need of updating.Wallpaper, popcorn ceilings, a bit dated....but, maybe they are waiting for a better economy. Can't fault 'em! We had a view of the airport and all the planes coming in, we loved it because our 4 year old son enjoyed watching them land. However, if you want a quiet room without the roar of airplanes, you may want a different side of the hotel or possibly a hotel located in a different area. Room service: Holy smokers...$34 for an order of pancakes, an order of bacon and an ice tea. I stayed at the Sheraton in Moorea, Tahiti where a breakfast for two was less expensive! Exorbitant. Parking: Yes, exorbitant too. $20 for self park, $30 for valet (per day). We scored and found street parking across the street for two of our three days--but that was because of the holidays. Oh, and a drunk guy was knocking at our door in the middle of the night and we called hotel security--they were Johnny on the spot--so that was good. We weren't concerned...just a young kid having a good time and lost his room in the sea of rooms, but it was nice that they were quick to act.

Fiance and I stayed here for business so it was covered by his company (probably wouldn't stay here otherwise since we were here 8 days).

For example...parking is NOT included and costs $23 a day (you have to head up to the 11th floor to park) which is added at the end of your stay. So factor that into your budget before looking for a hotel. Wireless internet is NOT included in your rooms. It's great in the lobby if you want to sit on a couch to get online.

I thought that was kind of cool myself. :) Walking from the L-12 elevator to the 12-26 elevator was not an inconvenience since they are located so close to one another.

After booking the hotel on Priceline I visited trip advisor because I had not previously stayed at the Sheraton Suites. While most of the reviews were positive there were a few things that concerned me. There were several mentions about the hotel's cleanliness not being up to standard. When I arrived I checked out the public areas and my room more carefully than normal and the hotel easily ranked 5 stars. Even the floor behind the TV stand and under the bed were spotless. Nice French doors separated the sleeping and living areas and the bath was large with separate bathtub and shower. The staff that I encountered were polite and very helpful. On Labor Day morning I needed towels. They were delivered promptly and the front desk even called to make sure they had arrived. The comforter did slip off the bed easily because of its fabrication. A previous poster had noted this. Another poster thought there was too much furniture in the living room. I agree, I would eliminate the chair and go just with the sleep sofa. The hill that the hotel is located on is steep but walkable unless you have restrictions. The hotel is an easy walk to the Trolley, Gaslamp district, 2 drugstores (CVS and Riteaid), 7Eleven, Starbucks, etc. I did not take advantage of the restaurant, exercise area, pool, etc. The biggest concern that I had after reading many of the postings was the garage. I can tell you that it is quite unique. If you take it slow and easy and pay attention it is not a big deal. You go up a tight concrete spiral for the first 7 or 8 floors seeing nothing but the concrete walls on each side. Then you go through five or so floors of parking ( most with a different traffic flow) to get to the hotel's parking on the 11th floor. Then you take an elevator to the hotel lobby on the 12th floor.

Now the downside....THE BED WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE!!!! I have stayed in many Sheratons and was thrilled a Sheraton was chosen for the out of town guests because they always have great beds...or so I thought. Sheraton touts the \"SWEET SLEEPER\" bed. It was so bad, I called the front desk to inquire about getting a room with the sweet sleeper. They informed me all of their rooms have them. I said this bed is nothing like any other Sheraton I have been in. I WAS TOLD THESE MATTRESSES ARE THE \"OLD STYLE SWEET SLEEPER\"! Well, there is nothing \"sweet\" about them, they are however quite \"OLD\". Everyone in our group agreed the beds were sadly lacking in comfort. I did strip the bed covers to look at the label on the mattress (which was very old) and could find nothing referring to \"sweet sleeper\". We did opt to stay the second night because everyone from our group was there. We bummed a couple of vicodin and then were able to sleep thru the night. Now for the car parking. The cost is $24. per day. You have to go up a very tight spiral drive to the 12th floor. The parking spaces are VERY TIGHT. You can park just across the street from the hotel for $10. per day. It is in the brick building across the street. The entrance is on 8th St. (it is an indoor parking lot). Also, just across from the entrance is another parking lot which is outdoors, I believe that one was $8. per day. I really strongly urge you to use the parking across the street as it is much more convenient. It is much easier than navigating the Hotels parking.

My entire stay was a nightmare and I will never stay here again. I am a starwood club member and when I stay at their family of hotels I always get to stay in their preferred floors with extra amenities. When we were checking in I was told that I will not be staying in the preferred floor which was fine as we were tired from a long flight and just wanted a clean space for my toddler to roam around in. Upon entering the room I immediately noticed that the mini-fridge wasn't working, it actually had a note apologizing for the inconvenience. I called the front desk and they immediately sent an engineer with another fridge. They clearly knew that the fridge wasn't working yet they were willing to put us in that suite as they even had the crib put in before we even arrived which made me question their serivice to their customers. We went to bed without even unpacking and when we woke up the next day, we were disgusted by what we saw. My toddler was running around holding a pack of cigarrettes (we're non smokers). We found several packs of cigarettes in bed side cabinets on both sides of the beds from previous guests. We later discovered beer bottle caps lodged on to the ceiling in the living room. We called the front desk and they apologized once again and promised they'll send someone up to clean those stuff. When we got back to the hotel later that evening, we were surprised to find the cigarretes still in one of hte cabinets. My toddler also found more cigarettes under the bed and I was more disgusted by the level of cleanliness in the hotel. I once again called the front desk, they never once offered to change our room but offered to send the cleaning lady. After waiting for several hours we asked them not to bother sending someone up as my toddler was asleep. The next day while my toddler was napping, they were knocking on the door and called our suite to see whether they can come into inspect the room(after 24 hours of placing the initial call). We usually have a very good experience in Sheraton hotels but we were disgusted at this location by their management and the cleaning staff. Breakfast in the hotel is $20/person for hot breakfast buffet, however, the little cafe on the 6th and B street is fantastic and reasonably priced with friendlier staff.

I typically earn platinum status each year and half of my stays are at this property. It used to be a Marriott many years ago and is an aging property however, it was recently renovated. All of the rooms are the same size so if you travel with non spg member guests, everyone gets the same experience. The people make this hotel work and they are the most hospitable and friendliest staff to meet. I highly recommend you look for Umit, Corneisha, or Linette when checking in. They are the finest star wood front desk persons I have ever met and this is after visiting 213 Starwood properties. The hotel has a club lounge however the guy whom manages it continues to disappoint me in how poorly it is ran. I stayed at the property twice this week and both times it was empty and water was scarce. I know California has water shortages and you will rediscover it applies to their club lounge. In the past six visits to the property, the club lounge was an embarrasment to the hotel name and chain. In all my visits, i have come to know all of the staff except for the guy whom manages the club partly since he is not that friendly. This is not the norm. I recommend you sit at the Skyy Bar during happy hour or in the evening and look for Zach or Jason. Both are very personable and will give you pointers on where to go. If you suffer from allergies, the hotel has Pure rooms that are allergen free and are available. I think you need to request it either when booking a room or when checking into the hotel. I tried it twice and it is good. If you eat at the restaurant you may find the buffet to be boring. I recommend the French toast cinnamon rolls named after Manny in the kitchen or the Renditions scramble. The Renditions scramble is awesome. It is scrambled egg whites with veggies and feta cheese. The chef is John and do not be afraid to aak for him. Unlike then guy whom manages the restaurant, he wants to talk to you and is passionate about food and his creations. He used to do eggs Benedict with crab meat in lieu of Canadian bacon. Five stars to Renditions and a negative five stars for it's manager. When eating there, ask for liberty as your server. She is awesome and I always enjoy it when she serves me. Yes, the plumbing is old. I have had rooms where sink water pressure was less Ghana desirable and believe the hotel is fixing this since I have not experienced it recently. The beds have been upgraded to the sweet sleeper and standard with the brand but the tv in the rooms are still older tube TVs and need to migrate to flat screens. Self parking is 23 dollars a day. I recommend valet for 30. In summary, save your money if upgrading to the club floor. The lounge is small and poorly ran and is more of an embarrassment.

We arrived after 3 pm and our room was not ready. We were assigned a different room that was not on the Starwood Preferred Floor. Upon our arrival to the room we notice that there was not a separate shower and bathtub, which we preferred because we were traveling with a baby. From a previous stay at this hotel we were aware that the king bedrooms did have a separate bathtub. We called down to the front desk to inquire about the possibility of getting a room with two double beds that has a separate shower. The front desk person did not know if the other two rooms, soon to be ready, had a separate bathtub or if these types of rooms have a separate bathtub all together. We then had to go downstairs, get two different keys to go investigate the rooms ourselves. To our disappointment the rooms did not have a separate bathtub, which we then assumed did not exist for a room with two double beds. It would have been nice if the staff knew the layouts of the rooms so that we did not have to be inconvenienced. So, we were content to stay in our current room until I realized how dirty it was. The room was poorly dusted and our toddler picked up candy off the floor and almost ate it. Needless to say the floor was not vacuumed properly. We then called down to the front desk and informed them of the situation and we were then moved to another room. We requested a bellman, but none was available at the time. There appeared to be only one bellman?? We moved our luggage to the new room. Once again my toddler found candy and chips on the floor. I had to thoroughly inspect the entire room for debris left on the floor. There were chips and candy behind the curtains and under the beds. It appears that your cleaning staff does not feel the need to vacuum behind the curtains. Upon my search for miscellaneous debris on the ground we noticed that the box spring of one of the beds was not properly positioned on the frame. We had to fix this ourselves to make sure the bed was properly secured. There were also stains on the comforters of the beds. We then proceeded to unpack and utilize the dresser drawers in the bedroom. One drawer was clearly not on the track and I had to fix it to be able to use it. By the way the drawers are very difficult to open and close. The bathroom was also less than sufficient. There appeared to be mold/mildew in the corner of the bathtub and hair in the bottom of the tub. The toilet seat was not securely fastened to the toilet and shifted when used. The entire toilet also shifted and banged against the wall when getting on and off. The garbage can under the vanity was also missing. Also, just to inform you when the neighboring room started their shower, our shower went cold, but then returned to warm water. The next day we attempted to watch TV and realized that one of the remote controls was missing. We had to request 3-4 times to get it replaced. After our room had been serviced one day we were not given new glasses or our complimentary waters. Also, while we walked to our room one day we noticed the cleaning staff using the floor vacuum to vacuum the couch. This seems to be a practice that is not very sanitary. This makes me believe that your couches are just as dirty as the floors. On the contrary to all of these issues, the valet service was excellent. The gentlemen that helped us were courteous and helpful. We never had to wait for our vehicle when we called down to let them know we were coming.

The beds are extremely comfortable with good mattresses and ample pillows (we usually have to ask for extra). Watch out for the expensive in-room snacks! If you want M&Ms or bottled water go to the 7/11 store just down the street! The breakfast buffet is sumptuous and plentiful in beautiful light, airy surroundings, with an excellent array of hot and cold including smoked salmon, ham, fresh fruit (strawberries for breakfast - wow!), the BEST french toast with maple syrup by the gallon, bacon, eggs, potatoes, cereals and dried fruits, yoghurts, breads and every kind of juice. The staff are all excellent, friendly and attentive and a request for a tray of coffee for visiting family was met from the breakfast bar with a smile and no charge. All in all we could not fault it and it is within easy walking distance of the shops and restaurants in the old Gaslamp Quarter, where the mexican food at Los Panchos will not disappoint! For a bit of culture you are right next door to Symphony Hall and if you want THE best Barbecue in town visit Phil's Barbecue on Sports Arena Boulevard.

By the time we reached the 11th floor we were already regretting it. The lobby is in the 12th floor then you take a different elevator to your room. We walked into our room which though roomy smelled musty (thank god i took scented candles), the carpet looked dirty and was stained. The bed was okay although I seemed to scratch all night after my husband's comments about bed bugs. Hair dryer was nasty and sticky, obviously they have overlooked that ammenity several times the room was freezing and though we adjusted the temperature to warm it never warmed up. My husband noticed the bottom of shower doors rusted and moldy. Needless to say, the following day we didn't wait until our check out time (12pm) we got out asap. I don't think this hotel should be considered a 31/2 star. It is more like a 2. Oh yeah, can't forget to mention the ridiculous parking fee of $22.00 per night for self parking or $28.00 for valet.

Also NO FREE WIFI, but Sheraton invites you to use their SLOW, VIRUS CRIPPLED Microsoft computers if you need internet access. Whats bad? Everything Else - Hotel looks pleasing at first glance, but it is the details which give this hotel, its lackluster feel. Cleanliness - From the elevators that need deodorizer to the missing cabinetry handles to the dirty, outdated hotel rooms, this hotel desperately needs a makeover. Convenience - Self Parking @ $22 and Valet @ $28. Word of advice, park on the street and expect to walk, there are private lots available for $10 a day. If staying @ this hotel, it will cost you as much as your room rental or more for parking on weekdays. Parking is a nightmare on weekends outside, your options might only be @ the hotel at that point. Cost - Marketed as a suite hotel, this place does not have the look and feel of a dignified hotel, although the staff tries really hard to pull it off. You have to go to one lobby, into one elevator, and travel to the 12 floor to check in to another lobby and into another elevator. Very annoying. Also, only one entrance and exit. Class - Certainly not a 4 star, maybe a 2 or 3 at the most. This is an aging property circa 1980s. The lobby and conference rooms are only whats going for it so far.

On its own merits, as a 3.5* hotel, this property did not match my expectations compared to other hotels of that class. At a deeply discounted Priceline rate, however, it was a good value. There were several questionable design choices in our king suite. The bed was a little too large for the bedroom, so that the bedroom doors would only close if pushed hard to squeeze past the bed. There were no easy-to-access power outlets near the desk. The kitchenette area had a stocked mini-bar but no refrigerator - just an empty, dirty cabinet space where one probably was in the past. Lots of little negatives that added up. The suite also had a mix of 1950's-style elements along with perhaps a partial renovation? For example, the dresser in the bedroom and the overall look of the bathroom were vintage, while the other furniture seemed more modern. In fact, the bathroom looked rather sterile and bland, while the rest of the suite was colorful. Overall, the suite looked sort of odd and disjointed. I was also unimpressed with most of the staff. At check-in, the clerk worked super fast, clearly giving the impression he wanted to get me out of his hair as quickly as possible. In fact, he kept making obvious attempts to end the conversation with me, even though I had several questions about the hotel. In addition, we had two separate one-night reservations and he did nothing to attempt to link them together or even verify the second reservation was in the system. Simply told me to come back to the desk the next day for new keys. We had a late night snack and drinks in the bar area. Food was delicious and service was fine but, again, felt rushed, as it was near closing time. There were several computers and a printer available for free use in the lobby, as well as wi-fi Internet access. While I appreciated the idea, the access was slow enough to be annoying. The location is about 10 blocks from the Gaslamp District. It's walkable on a nice day. On Friday night I found open metered parking on the side of the hotel but did not make it to the car early enough the next morning to avoid a ticket. (Though at $30, it wasn't much more than the parking at the hotel, anyway.) No problems on Saturday night, as metered parking is free all day Sunday. I don't think I'd choose to stay here again.

I like suite-type hotels when I travel for business so that there's a separation of office from bedroom. I've stayed at a variety of Sheraton hotels, but this was one of the dirtiest I have experienced. I stayed at this hotel for 6 days. This hotel was selected by my company and I didn't have the option to change hotels. I'll address the confusion first: the elevators. Check-in and bell staff were very accommodating regardless of whether or not they were tipped. This hotel has a two different banks of elevators--one that takes you to the guest rooms and a second bank that allows you to exit/enter the hotel from the parking or street levels. I didn't have a car and it was quite inconvenient. Just something to note if you would rather have the convenience of getting on one elevator that can either take you all the way to your floor or to the street level; a personal preference I suppose. The suite had enough space for one person. It contained a large flat screen TV that was actually too large for the size of the living room area; plus you had to point the remote at a specific spot on the TV to get it to respond to commands. The beds were roomy, but the sheets were not very soft (I guess I've been spoiled by Hilton sheets). Now for the dirty part: The major problem I had was with the lack of cleanliness; particularly in the bathroom! It looked like a gorilla cleaned my bathroom every day because there was hair leftover in the tub, around the toilet and on the floor AFTER the room was cleaned! Plus, the floor was not ever vacuumed because there was a bottle top and a few crumbs on the floor in the same place every day. When I finally called to ask them to clean the bathroom better and vacuum, they sent housekeeping staff to my room around 9PM at night just as I was preparing for bed. Then, someone left food in my room on top of the microwave the next day. I don't need sparkle, but clean is a necessity and I was really disappointed with their service. I was in town for a conference, so did not spend a great deal of time in the hotel during the day, so when I came back in the evening I was too tired to address the cleanliness issue until the 3rd day of my stay.

The room next door wasn't as full of hair but you could still tell they just didn't clean it well. You could see exactly where the tables had been wiped. It was just a shoddy job at best. The room itself needed help too. The drawer pulls were missing. Just strange things that showed the age on this place and the lack of maintenance. The shower was one of those \"every way but down\" types of showers. I've only posted the \"hairiest\" photos. I'll skip the finger nail, end of the plastic from a clothes tag, weird pieces of who knows what substance all of the the floors & counters. We had a nice view of downtown. The bed was comfy.

Overall, I would say our experience was positive. I think most people would find the accommodations more than satisfactory. If you lean toward the finicky side, you may find some minor discrepancies. Here is our assessment of the pros and cons: Pros: Price: We booked at priceline.com. We paid $100 a night, but feel like we may have still overbid somewhat - especially for the time of the year. The hotel did not appear to be full. Customer Service - We found the staff to be VERY friendly and helpful. We arrived at 10:00 a.m. and were allowed to check in early. They showed us two rooms (one with a corner view and one without) and let us choose. We chose the one without the corner view. The configuration of the rooms made the non-corner room appear larger, although it wasn't really.. Every evening as we came in, we would receive a \"welcome back\" greeting from the staff. Configuration - You basically get a bedroom, a living room, a kitchenette/bar area (although it is just a microwave and refrigerator), a bathroom (with separate shower/tub, and the toilet behind a privacy wall), and a sink and closet in a separate enclosed area. As you can see the suite is relatively large (think twice the size of a standard hotel room). We had a king bed, so there was plenty of room in the bedroom, although I could see where two full size beds would be a little cramped. I liked the frosted french doors between the living room and bedroom. Tow couples or a family could definitely use it - although storage space is a bit limited. View - The hotel is on the twelveth floor, so all of the rooms have views. We were on the 22nd floor. We had a view of the city that extended out to Balboa Park. You could also see the harbor if you turned your head just right. There were planes coming in for a landing, but as other reviewers have said, you couldn't hear them. I think the 24: and 25th floors were for Starwood Preferred Members and the 26th and 27th floors were for Club members, although there there isn't much difference in the rooms from what I understand. Location - Depending on your fitness level, you could pretty much walk to the zoo, Balboa Park (where the museums are) the Gaslamp District, and the docks. You can take a train to Tiajuana very easily. The trolley runs just two blocks from the hotel. Having a car is an added convenience though if you want to get out and explore. Computer Access - There are four computers in the lobby with free internet access. You have to pay for internet access in your room. It was fairly easy to get time on the computers. Sometimes you had to wait a few minutes, but never very long. Facilities ; There is a nice pool, with a fairly large deck area. The pool isn't very big, but what do you expect from a hotel. It is on the 12th floor and has large picture windows on one side, so you get a nice view. The exercise room appeared to be well equipped. Yes, you have to walk across the lobby to get to the pool, but there is also a locker room area and a bathroom for those who are a little more modest. Nothing to complain about. CONS (and all of these are pretty minor): Decor - My wife felt lke the decor was a bit dated. Bear in mind that it was not bad. It looked like the place has been fairly well maintained. The room furniture looked like it had absorbed a bit of wear and tear. They are in the process of updating. Our room even had a flatscreen TV in the LR with great reception. Cleanliness - I'd rate clanliness as 3.5 - 4 stars. It looked like the maid only emptied trash and made the bed. Overall, it was fairly clean, but it didn't seem like they vaccumed, or did a good job cleaning sinks, etc. during our stay. Parking - I have to mention this, since every one else has. In my opinion, \"it is what it is.\" The only thing I would say is to make sure you rent a small vehicle. We had a little subcompact and had no problem, but we did see some people with larger cars struggling to get their vehicles into the small spaces. They would do well to make the parking diagonal, rather than pull in. Yeah it cost $20 per night, but that's what it cost. There is virtually no parking downtown, so that's what it costs. It actually cost us more to park our rental car than it did for the rental fee, but we're glad we had it. My overall assessment is that it is not as bad as others are making it out to be, but we also had a small car. Refrigerator - Well, its not really a refrigerator. It is a drink cooler that doesn't keep things very cool. They will provide you a refrigerator, for an additional fee of $30 per night (no thanks). Yeah, we called them and asked them to come take a look - something I don't think they ever did, but so what? Area: The area around the hotel is commercial. It is about 2-3 blocks from the gaslamp district. So, at night, it can be a little dark and relatively deserted. My wife and I walked back and forth regularly at night and never feared for our safety. I wouldn't recommend a woman walk it alone. There are a fair number of \"street people throughout all of downtown San Diego, but I never saw a problem with any of them - not even panhandling. My personal pet peeve - It seems as though the more \"upscale\" the hotel the less amenities you provide. They had snacks in the room for astronomical prices. You had to pay for in room nternet. Someone said you're even charged for local phone calls. You can go to a Hampton Inn and get all of that for free, plus get a free breakfast too - all for a lower price. Go figure. As you can see, when I'm on vacation, I'm a \"no worries\" kind of guy. Was it perfect? No. But I have stayed in much worse. Life is too short to sweat the small stuff. I would definitely stay here again. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.", "Date": "July 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "El Cerrito, California", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "oaklay18", "ReviewID": "UR17593073", "Content": "Stayed here 2 nights for a work trip.

From the website, it looked perfect, and a suite for the family would be great. Got to the hotel and had a very friendly valet driver valet the car, so for it was starting out great. Now this is where everything just gets horrible. I go to the 12th floor which is the lobby and wait in line to check in. I booked a room with two double beds as i have 5 people in my party, 2 adults and 3 little children. The front desk clerk advises me that they only have rooms with a single king bed available. Now a little irritated i show them i reserved a room with two double beds. Now front desk clerk tells me that apparently on their website they have fine print stating that bed types are just a request and are not guaranteed. However he said he would put in a rollaway bed at no additional charge. So again let me be clear, he told me he has no rooms with 2 double beds available and will give us a rollaway bed at no additional charge. So now i begrudgingly accept the room as i need a place to stay. We get to the room and notice its pretty tightly packed. I have no idea where they will fit the rollaway. Housekeeping comes to the room to deliver the rollaway and then after about 15 minutues of trying to figure out where to keep the bed, tell us that our room is too small to put a rollaway in . So now we dont get a room with 2 double beds and housekeeping is telling us that they cannot fit a rollaway bed in the room. Now im pretty angry and go to the front desk and demand to speak to the manager. Believe it or not this is what he says to me. He understands my anger and b/c of that he will give me a room with 2 double beds. Why couldnt they just give me the room with 2 double beds to begin with ?? He had no answer and then i just couldnt stay at this hotel any longer, so i told him i will not be staying and will not be paying a penny for their horrible service. Another problem, he then informs me that i prepaid (which i did not) and i will get no refund. After getting angrier than i have in my life and 30 minutes later he realizes that we never prepaid, doesnt apologize and we walked out of the hotel and checked in to the embassy suites next to seaport village.

The odd thing is that this hotel doesn't seem to be located in that great of an area. We walked around a lot and it is a little seedy.

Our suite was very nice, if a bit snug for a family. Great set-up for a business traveler or a couple. We headed into the restaurant, which was slammed with all the other evacuees. We walked to grab a pizza, but went into the bar for a drink later. Turns out lots of the staff had stuck around to work, and our \"waitress\" was an assistant manager. We also talked to two other employees in the lobby, both of whom were staying in the hotel due to the fires. I just thought that was very nice, since obviously the hotel could have sold the rooms that they gave to those employees. Also, they had milk and cookies in the lobby for kids, and dog biscuits for the dogs:) It was interesting to watch the dog parade from the lobby. There were 4 computers in the lobby for free internet access, which was helpful for those of us trying to keep up with the situation near our homes. I think the hotel really stepped up and did the right thing for its neighbors in San Diego.

I went back and asked the same valet about my keys twice and he asked if I had my ticket. I told him that I already gave it to him and he said ok. He finally found them and handed them to me without looking up rom what he was doing. Not the type of valet service you would expect for $25 per day. The suite was clean but very small in my opinion for a suite. The room was remodeled but several old fuxtures remained (sprinklers, thermostat, wooden bedroom furniture). Two of the drawers on separate fixtures were missing handles. Some of the wood on other furniture thorought the suite had large pieces missing that had broken off. These obviously had not been replaced during the remodel. The \"sweet\" bed was comfortable but for some reason the comforter kept pullng toward the foot of the bed during the night and fall off completely if you were not laying on a portion of it. The indoor pool and workout room were nice and clean. We used both during our trip and were very satisfied. The restaurant was very nice but had a very limited/ expensive menu. There were no kid friendly menu items so we ventured out to find somewhere to eat in the gas lamp district.

No place to place a washcloth, shampoo, razor, etc. Not to mention, you are always at risk of hitting the shower door open. Cleaning was mediocre at best.

When you finally get to the garage you would figure the hell is over and you can finally park your car and go to your room, right? Wrong! The parking spaces are narrow as well and so are the lanes to drive past them! Anything bigger then a Geo Metro or Golf Cart is going to have a hell of a time parking! My husband managed to park our Lincoln Towncar after alot of stress (still don't know how he did it... I'm impressed!) and as soon as we got out of the car we heard several other people complaining (several of them with small cars). Anyway it was a Nightmare! Then we headed to the lobby to check in... (you have to get on two seperate elevators every time you go to your room!). When we got to the front desk they thought it was funny that we even managed to park and we immediately signed up for valet parking at $5 extra making parking $25 :-0.... Not Including tipping the valet $5 each time he gets our car! (If he is driving it up and down that spiral... he totally deserves more!!!) Then we finally get to our room and for about 30 minutes, we experience the ooooh and aaaah of look at that view and look at this living room and look at the seperate tub and shower, 2 tv's and french doors leading to the bedroom and microwave and mini bar and room service and so on. Then after being there for about an hour all the awefulness starts kicking in! Two elevators to get our luggage (should have had them bring it... I know that now!). Every time we walked past the front desk (which you will do ALOT since you have to walk past it to get to the second elevator!) the employees were screwing around like little kids! On one occassion I heard them making fun of a guest loudly... totally unprofessional! Then back to the room.... The big blue velvet couch was pretty to look at but when you sat on it, it was very uncomfortable and made a crunchy noise like it was full of newspaper! The desk was all beaten up like it came from a used store! They had food and beverage items in the room that you pay for, which I am ok with but the prices were nuts! $3.50 for a bottle of arrowhead, $3.50 for a kit kat, $3.50 for a little bag of peanuts, $7.00 for a can of beer. Thats all I remember but anyway... nutty prices! The wallpaper was falling off and had a big brown streak across it in the living room (not even curious to know what that was!). The toilet had either a drop of pee or blood on the seat and from there I noticed that the bathroom wasn't clean! When maid services came... was it clean after they came? NOPE! Still dirty in fact they didn't even vaccume (I know because something was still on the floor) and I later found a card that said if you want your sheets changed place this on the bed..... was it placed on the bed before I got there? Who Knows! The sheets were the cheapest most ichy sheets I have ever layed on ($1.99 value at most!), the rest of the bedding was cheap as well. Fancy shampoos and lotions provided? Nope.... Panteen Shampoo and Vasoline Lotion with the Sheraton logo on the other side (good thing I brought better with me! ). The shower had one of those old cloudy glass doors and pink tile and mold everywhere! The shower head leaked badly! The bathroom floor was always wet! When you took a shower in that pink, moldy, dark little closet ... you could here loud trucks driving by on the other side of the wall (I was on the 17 floor). I thought a fridge would be included.... only if you pay extra and request it! This hotel is all about charging you for everything they possibly can! I am surprised toilet paper and pantene were free! Although I wouldn't care to stay at this hotel again.... (I stayed for 2 days) the valet was extremely nice and helpful! The outside of this hotel will impress and so will the lobby if the employees aren't present >:( and this hotel is in a great location! Walking distance from Gaslamp Quarter (which has tons of dining options), Balboa Park, San Diego Zoo, the boat that takes you to Coronado Island and Seaport Village! And only about a 10 minute drive from Sea World. You could almost get away with coming here with no car (would also save you on parking, valet, etc) because there are trolleys and a train nearby.

The bathroom sink was cheap \"cultured marble,\" it definitely wasn't real marble, and there was a crack running through the middle of it. There is no excuse for that at any hotel.

Fantastic view of balboa park. Walking distance to Gaslamp area. We were told parking was 20 dollars a day, though others on the board mention 15. Since we stayed two nights, this meant 60 total dollars on our bill. We chose to park on the street instead and save the money. We had no problems doing this. You just have to read the signage closely to know which side of the street to overnight on. Our oldest son stayed with his basketball team at the Hilton near hotel circle during this same weekend. He gave our room at Sheraton Suites a huge thumbs up and said the Hilton was not as nice. This would be a 16 year old's opinion. Also, while the sofa bed is HORRIBLE, (poor 12 year old son), the king bed my husband I shared was very comfortable and probably one of the best we've slept in at a hotel.", "Date": "June 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "gloucester", "Title": "\u201cLuxury at the end of our trip, but bad Concierge\u201d", "Author": "divalibrarian", "ReviewID": "UR5230910", "Content": "We decided to treat ourselves at the end of a 2 week trip and the Sheraton Suites lived up to expectations!

Also a good location for the Zoo - we walked as the Concierge told us it was only a 15 min walk - it was definitely more like 30 min! Zoo was fantastic (but don't bother with the Deluxe ticket as you probably won't get your money's worth unless you go on the bus rides and skyfari several times) Also, I asked if it was possible to use public Transport to Seaworld and was told no - when in fact you can get the Trolley to Old Town and then the no. 9 bus all for $2.50 each way! (my fiance by that stage was tired of buses and we ended up paying $25 each way to Sea World in a taxi and then another $90 to get into Sea World! It wasn't worth it but if you do go remember to say you have an AA card as they give you a discount). Also a great local bar was the Bistro on 6th Ave corner - Jessie the Bar Manager was a great host and the Cheese Cake was a lovely way to end the holiday!

I'm glad I booked this hotel anyway (love getting my Starwood points). Also, the \"W\" was 2.5x the cost and not as convenient for getting on and off the freeway etc. I was on the 20th floor in a corner upgrade-junior suite type. Yes, it's older, the wallpaper is dated (and a small corner is peeling in the bathroom) and the pocket door to the bathroom has seen better days BUT the room was immaculate, well appointed, has high speed Internet access, an ample refrigerator, microwave and the bed was comfortable. I liked the separate bedrioom and the chairs and couch in the main area are comfortable. The service is friendly if not outstanding. Room service is very expensive as is with most hotels but there are several deli's and restaurants within walking distance in the historic Gas Lamp Quarter. Since parking is expensive everywhere in downtown San Diego I took the advice I read in other reviews and just ponied up the extra $4.00 to use the valet service. It was worth it and the ticket implicity states to call down 15-20 minutes ahead of time (I discovered it's because the valet lot is actually a couple of city blocks away).

This hotel is in a great downtown location within walking distance of restaurants, the mall, a grocery store, etc. We reserved two suites with two double beds in each bedroom and a sleeper sofa in each seating area. There was a TV in each area, so that was nice. There was a stocked bar available in the seating area with juice, beer and liquor (can't recall what else) but we brought our own goodies because we had little ones with us, and staff was fine with that. They said to put all of their stuff in the cabinet next to the refrigerator and then replace it at check-out time so that we wouldn't have extra charges added to our bill. The parking cost $25 for valet daily. Excellent service from the parking people and no digs in the van. They double charged us for a suit we had pressed, but quickly deducted the amount when he brought it to their attention. My only complaint is that we'd requested (a week prior to our visit) foam pads for the foldout couches, but only one pad was available when we arrived. Everyone treated us royally from the time we arrived. Immaculately clean rooms and all staff was ready and eager to serve. On the second night of our stay the AC unit wasn't cooling in one of the suites but it was instantly repaired once we reported it (we even received about $15 off of our bill for our inconvenience).

First they ran out of room block rooms so we ended up paying full rack rates. (I had to stay there or would have to taxi back and forth several times each day because I cannot walk a full block on unlevel ground without being in a wheelchair.) The conference rooms were extremely small and cramped. Since this was our first trip to San Diego, we also stayed for the weekend. We paid even more for those two days! Normally a conference rate continues after the conference is over for at least one night. Food at this hotel is outragiously expensive. The breakfast buffet for two, including tip, was over $40. A soft drink and sandwich at the Sky Bar (restaurant was not open on Sunday after breakfast) ran over $45 for two. I travel with a companion who has to help me physically. The handicapped suites ONLY come with one king bed and a sofa bed. The king bed was so high I could not get onto it from my wheelchair and had to be helped physically from a standing position to hike myself up onto the bed!!! The sofa bed was too low. Once down in it I would never get up again. The bed was not only high, but so full of pillows that they took up half the floor in the bedroom when we unloaded them at night. Not too good when you use aids to go from the bed to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The handicapped bathroom was fairly typical and very large. There were two doors one from the living room and one from the bedroom. Because of all the doors it was difficult to navigate once in there. There was no where to put my personal items in the bathroom....no shelves, no flat area around the sink, etc. So I have to carry them back and forth from the bedroom everytime that I went in there. And had to put them on the floor to use them. There was no comfortable seating in the so-called living room--even for regular people. There is only the sofa bed which is too low, the cushons are too soft, and frankly uncomfortable for two people. There was a desk chair. There were no other chairs. We really needed at least one upholstered chair with arms that would allow a handicapped person to get up and down with ease. Or allow a normal person to sit comfortably to watch tv etc. I wrote a lengthly letter to the hotel manager about the problems that I left with my card at the front desk on check out. To date I have received absolutely no response. I am a frequent Starwood guest. I have never ever in all my travels found a handicapped room that was more challenging than this one. Note: the desk staff were not well trained or knowledgeable. However twice we found very helpful informed staff handling the luggage. They gave us info on taxis, directions, recommended selection of restaurants at the Del Coronado hotel, etc. We had a bad experience with the shuttle from the airport. It turns out that this hotel is so close to the airport that taking a taxi is cheaper and much easier.

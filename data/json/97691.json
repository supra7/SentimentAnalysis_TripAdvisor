Our favorite bartender is Tom. He looks out for us on our trips. We usually stay 3 or 4 nights, before or after timesharing in Vegas. Our favorite dinner restaurant is Twin Creeks, I personally like the twin lobster tails. The coffee shop is great for breakfast as well as something light at night. I like the size of the casino for getting around. The ambiance is southwestern, which is to our liking. The machines are pretty loose. My husband likes craps. Sometime, in the early part of the week, the tables are not very busy, he likes more of a crowd. Weekends are better for craps. A great local casino. We have been to a lot of the casino/hotels on the strip or just off the strip, but I like it at Silverton. As we get older, some of the larger strip casinos are a bit too large for us to move around.

The bus driver took the wrong bus and we had to park in the wrong lot at the track. This resulted in a mile long walk around the track to our seats and back again after the race. Then we were stuck at the track after to wait for 2 people to show up. Instead of sending us on our way and getting a cab for those people we had to wait until we had enough and forced them to take us back to the hotel. As a result of this delay we missed the shuttle to the strip where we had dinner plans. The hotel informed us that they could get us a cab but we would have to pay for it ourselves.

They do have 3 and 5 dollar tables. Food selection during the day was a little limited...a full service restaurant called sundance open 24/7, a burger place, a fast food italian place....at 4 all the other restaurants and bars started serving food an appetizers...would have been nice to have more selections earlier. The aquarium is awesome. Im not a \"buffet\" person so probably not the best person to review it but i thought it was just \"OK\". Nothing special.

The average meal for 2 came out to $25. They serve Starbucks coffee at the Sundance Grill - which is the equivelant to a diner and the variety was astounding. Johnny Rockets was a fun spot for burgers and shakes. We ate at the buffet on Friday night where they serve surf & turf with unlimited snow crab legs and prime rib. The outdoor pool area is a pleasant place to sit & enjoy some fresh air even if you don't feel like using the pool. Another added bonus is the huge Pro Bass shop attached to the resort, especially for any outdoor enthusiasts. They had a waterfall with a fishpond & ducks. There were also some gun & archery ranges. Next door to the Pro Bass store is a beautiful giant aquarium & if you go there at the right time you can watch a scuba diver feed the sharks. For those of you who enjoy Las Vegas, but can do without stayng on the strip, this is a nice choice. We were only ten minutes from the strip when we wanted to drive there.

On the positive side, the rooms were clean, roomy and very quiet. In fact, the insulation was fantastic and with a room fan on, we never heard noise from adjoining rooms or people in the hallways. The beds were soft and very comfortable, and they give you plenty of pillows. The bathroom was a little cramped for two people, but had plenty of counter space, and they supply you with an abundance of towels and wash cloths. Water pressure was great and the temperature was hot and consistent. The only major drawback was the ceiling fan did not work, so things got very steamy and no way to clear the mirrors efficiently. We did have one scare when some terrible gurgling noises occurred in the bathroom and we went in to find water backing up in the sink. We called the front desk and they sent a maintenance crew up, but the water went down on its own and they seemed to think they had a larger problem affecting the entire wing, not just our room. No harm, no foul, but we kept things up off the floor just in case. We did notice repaired water damage on our ceiling and wall where they've apparently had plumbing issues in the past, but again, there was no real inconvenience to us. This is a typical casino/resort set up, so you have to maneuver through a myriad of gambling just to get to the front desk and of course you must drag your luggage throught the same maze in order to get to your room. I understand the design philosophy of casinos, but that doesn't make it less annoying when you are road-weary and just want to quietly get to a bed. However, the most irritating part of our visit was twofold: 1) Hidden \"resort fees\" that they tack on to your billing. About $5/day, which ostensibly gives you access to the pool, the workout room, local calls, etc. These are all things which \"normal\" hotels simply provide in the room base price, so why not adjust the room rates accordingly rather than hitting guests with hidden fees? That is poor business practice in my opinion. 2) They provide WiFi capability, but only for an additional fee of $10.99/day. Simple internet service, which is pretty much a free standard for decent hotels across the planet, is a premium-priced luxury at the Silverton. I have to admit, that irritated me a lot. But not to worry--the Starbucks in the downstairs casino is true to that company's form--they offer free WiFi, so we used Starbucks instead. Still very aggravating to be unable to handle emails/etc from the comfort of your room without paying an extortion price. Overall, nice facilities, and friendly staff, but they just can't seem to let go of Vegas' gangster image by sticking it to you for something.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "staunton va", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "bmahaffey", "ReviewID": "UR123780787", "Content": "My friend and I stayed here while in Vegas.

If a cab is desired to return to the Silverton then its a $20 bill. Considering the cost difference between staying at a strip hotel or the silverton, the $20 cab ride is excellent. We found the strip can be on the stressful side, particularly on this trip, and the Silverton provided an excellent sanctuary to retreat to in the evenings. The rooms were clean, spacious, and very comfortable. House keeping was perfect and quite friendly. The pool was perfect. It's small but has great ambiance to relax with a drink, listen to really great rock music which was piped in through garden speakers, and chat up other guests. The attached Bass Pro Shop is an fantastic destination to spend some time. Outdoors-men or not... This place will amaze everyone, so be sure to check it out! As far as gaming, although we were non winners this trip, the Silverton allowed us to play long periods of time on our dollars as opposed to the cash Black Holes of the giant strip hotel casinos. Getting a cocktail while playing was also a breeze which is important to me since I believe that if I cant catch a royal flush... I can at least catch a buzz! HA HA! My wife and I would certainly recommend a stay at Silverton to anyone and everyone.

Their casino is very nice for a smaller venue. For me, a major attraction is that their location is real close to the strip without the stiffling hordes of pedestrians and traffic jams of the strip.

We walked right up (instead of waiting in a long line as we do at the hotels on the strip) and were concerned that we may not get a non smoking room because when we called we were told they don't book the room until you get there. No problem though, we were told they had rooms available on three different floors. We asked for the nicest room and had a great pool view from the 4th floor. Our room had two queen beds that were very comfortable. The room also had a fully stocked fridge with Beer, Wine and Energy Drinks. The front desk saw that we brought water and said we can remove some of the drinks from the fridge to put our waters in because they aren't magnetized and we won't be charged unless we drink their drinks. Also, the desk in the room had a basket with a good selection of candy, chips, etc. and prices on the drinks and snacks were very reasonable. The room was very clean. The room and floor we were on does look a little old and is definitely not flashy but everything was in good repair and clean. We didn't go to any of the bigger restaurants but did go to Johnny Rockets and Starbucks and the service at both places was great. This is definitely a place for the older crowd and my husband and I are both 49 and really liked it.

Our room was on the first floor was just around the corner from the pool which we loved. The room and amenities seemed fairly new and were very comfortable. We had a view of the pool. Since we stayed during the week the hotel and casino were fairly quiet. The pool was so relaxing after the thumping music of the strip pools. Most of the strip pools are designed for 20 somethings with a cold beer in their hands with trunks half off. This pool was sooo relaxing with a nice hot tub too. A couple of nice girls (with major tatoos) to bring you drinks if you want. There were only 4-6 people at the pool at any one time and soft rock music. All of the 10 or so cabanas were unoccupied, and the price was reasonable if you want one for the day. We love Silverton. We had been to their casino a few times before buy never stayed there, and had a free room offer due to our play. I am happy we stayed there. We ate at the cafe twice because the buffet line was very long with locals. The breakfast and dinner we had were second to none. We paid with our points, and the steak and shrimp special with dessert was only like $14.99. One day while my wife shuttled her parents over to M Resort, I played all morning and ate at Johnny Rockets and devoured a huge burger and chocolate malt--pure heaven. I did win at the casino, getting a $1,600 W-2 on Cave Man Keno and hitting many smaller jackpots on four card Keno. Very nice atmosphere with continuous drink service. My wife won big on a penny machine called \"Tarzan.\" She bought me shirts at the on site Bass Pro shop, which is very nice. I loved their big tanks equipped with Mermaids also. Silverton is a feel good, no nonsense property. Check in and out is a breeze, and they make you feel like a person and not a number. I can't wait to get back there. In my 55 trips to Vegas I have moved from mid-strip (Stardust & Westward Ho) to downtown to Orleans to all over the strip, but now will go out to my wan to stay at Silverton & the M Resort in Henderson, with Bellagio being my first stop.

It had been a few years since the last time we had been to Vegas. We wanted to avoid the crush of tourists on the strip, so we booked 2 rooms at the Silverton Hotel & Casino, just outside of the strip. We were greeted warmly and were checked in quickly. Since my parents have some mobility issues they were able to accomodate them by making sure their rooms were closest to the elevator. Once there the rooms were very clean and the bedding was very comfortable, there was also a safe in the room which is always appreciated. The rooms have mini-bars and a snack tray with all sorts of goodies and CDs, but I'm sure it cost a pretty penny, so we didn't touch any of the items. The rooms were cleaned daily and the hotel staff always greeted us when they saw us. The hotel does have free WIFI, but it is only in their lobby area. The lobby area has very comfy leather chairs and there are electrical outlets behind the couches on the wall. Don't feel odd searching for outlets, there are other guests doing the same thing. The gym was smaller than I expected, it is not inside the hotel itself, you have to exit the hotel by a back door, walk down between the buildings and at the end of the building is the entrance to the gym. You have to have your room card with you. Towels are provided in the gym and there is a water cooler with paper cups. They have treadmills, ellipticals, and free wieghts. I noticed they also had mats and a couple of TVs. The restaurants at the hotel were nice. The buffet was plentiful and at the time they had a drink special, buy a souvenir beer glass for $5 get unlimited refills. Being the holidays, the staff was on top of bussing the tables, refilling drinks and keeping the line moving quickly. We also ate at the mexican restaurant at the hotel--there is only so much buffet you can handle in a week. The entrees seemed a bit pricey, but we wanted something different. The food was typical mexican/american fare, nothing spectacular. Afterwards we walked over to the gelato stand and had yummy gelatos. There's also a diner next to the gelato stand, which we also ate at, we were there for a whole week so yes we sampled a lot of what the Silverton had to offer. The diner was really nice, most importantly, our drinks and meals arrived promptly, refills were plentiful, and our server was very courteous. We also did a bit of shopping at the Bass Pro Shop, it was a nice distraction while waiting for the mermaid show to start in the huge tank, by the Mermaid Lounge.

It's okay, you can admit it. You don't have to say you go there for the shows or clubs. I love the Silverton casino as it has an abundance of the type of machines and tables that my husband and I enjoy. There are plenty of triple multi-denomination Game King machines where you can sit and play various games at your leisure. If you like Mexican food, there's a nice restaurant right inside the casino. The cocktail waitress comes by often and returns quickly with your beverage. There's a Starbucks, and Italian food eatery, Johnny Rockets (which you can order a big, delicious hamburger, take it to your room and watch TV for a break in the action). The parking log/garage is free and is close to the hotel unlike the strip hotels where one must walk quite a distance to even reach the door. So, what are the \"needs improvement\" areas? Well, they do charge a \"resort fee\" (this time $8.50 a night). I highly resent these fees. I'm not sure what services they provide---none in my case, as I leave housekeeping a personal tip anyway. Secondly, there is no in-room coffee. So, you have to get dressed, go down to Starbucks, pay $$2.00 for a coffee and go back to your room. Thirdly (and this is only in some cases), don't stay on any floor except the fourth. That way, you won't have anyone stomping around at night and early in the morning. This is the first time, I have had this problem, but I won't let it happen again. When asked if \"everything was all right,\" when we left, we informed them that, no, it wasn't. We were given a little sympathy and some advice to request the top floor, but no monetary refund. I wish there were the perfect hotel in Vegas, but there just isn't.

The rooms were spacious and mostly nicely maintained. The hair dryer was broken in our room but when we informed the front desk they brought another one right up. The bathrooms were a little small and they unfortunatly had wall paper in them so it was peeling. The new trend for hotels is no coffee pots, refrigerators or microwaves unless you pay extra for them. I feel that if they call them luxury rooms these things should be included. They have wonderful pillow top beds with thick duvets and great pillows. I have a hard time sleeping in most hotels but these beds are fantastic. I slept like I was in my own bed. There is a Starbucks in the casino if you want coffee or a variety of restaurants. We tried the Mexican Cantina and I was very disappointed in my meal (pork chimi - tasted rancid) and could not eat it. They were very nice about removing the cost from our bill. The chips and salsa were great and the hubby's fajita's were good. The Italian fast food was ok but not great. The food had been sitting for awhile and was tough, the marinara tasted ok but was watery. Their menu also displayed a green garden salad but it was not available to order. They\" didn't serve that there\". Then why was it on the menu? We loved Johnny Rockets the 50's style hamburger joint. The food was great, fresh and hot! The manager was friendly and the service was fast. We didn't get to all their restaurants or bars. There is a large variety to choose from depending on your style and tastes. I would recommed that management kick the food up a notch in the Mexican Cantina and the Italian fast food. There is a large aqarium in the lobby that has live Mermaids several times a day. This seems to be a huge hit with all the children(and all the men) and a lot of locals come to see them. If you are an outdoor enthusiast this hotel is really for you. There is a Pro Bass retail store of humongous proportions connected to the hotel. We are not outdoorsy people but we found ourselves shopping in the store several times during our stay. Clothes, guns and equipment, you name it they have it. An indoor gun range, archery room, waterfalls stuffed animals galore all inside a beautiful lodge style store. This lodge style hotel goes perfectly with the store. There is ample parking and it's very easy to get to off exit 33 on I15. We have stayed on the strip before and hated the constant parking hassel. Parking here was a breeze. I love to work out and was extremely pleased with their fitness room. It was large and clean with a nice selection of machines and weights. Towels and water were provided. There were several televion sets for viewing while working out. It was a pleasant surprise. They have a nice pool with cabanas and tables. Unfortunatly it was too cool to swim during our stay. We truly enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a nice place to stay without all the super trendy clubs and headaches.

I'd say that if you make limited trips to Las Vegas or this is a first stay--I'd recommend someplace on the strip--if not, and you're looking for a great place with good value, great restaurants and some of the best and most friendly service in town--you can't go wrong with the Silverton! Why? Let me tell you-- #1--Shuttle service to airport and strip. They have a shuttle that will pick you up and return you to the airport. (No strip hotel will do this unless you're a high roller!) Just wait at the entrance by the aquarium at the scheduled time and the friendly bus driver will pick you. If you're arriving--let the reservations person know that you want to be picked up and s/he will schedule it for you! #2--Great restaurants and you can use your points that you earn on your slot card towards your food! From Mexician to buffet to gourmet--Silverton has it covered. AND they're all good and all resonably priced too! #3--Nice rooms, VERY clean and not a long walk! The rooms at the Silverton are nice--I'd say a bit up from a Holiday Inn. The bathrooms are smallish but everything is clean, clean, clean! They also stock Bath and Body products in the bathrooms! But the best part is that the rooms aren't \"miles\" and \"miles\" away from the casino, parking or restaurants like some of the big strip hotels where you walk down the hallway to your room and you think you're almost there and well-- you know what I mean. Also, the rooms are very reasonably priced and if you play in the casino on your Player's card even a little bit they'll send you offers for very reduced rates or even free! #4--Great service. Some of the best drink girls, slot personnel bartenders and waitress/waiters I've ever had the pleasure of being served by! #5--Bass Pro Shops--A Bass Pro shop is attached to the Silverton and points earned on Player's card can be redeemed for gift certificates here. #6--Promotions and Specials -- The Silverton is always running dining, food, buffet slots and other promotions. Check them out on their web page -- http://www.silvertoncasino.com/ The above are just some of the reasons that we enjoy the Silverton but you'll have to try it for yourself.

We were at Flare Bar and I felt sorry for the bartender and waitress\u2019s who were moving about the floor with napkins and hands to their noses. It was so bad I dry heaved several times before dashing to the restroom to throw up. Needlesss to say my night was over. Staff was walking through floor trying to spray freshener but the stench was to strong. People were holding their noses and we were all complaining to each other. I went directly to front desk to talk to the hotel manager only to find that there is none on duty. I was told \u201c\u2026there were major staff cuts and we have no manager\u201d. I was directed to a pit-boss who apparently is in charge of the whole hotel at night\u2026.this is at 10:30pm. Pit boss knew the stench and was very understanding. He was receiving all the complaints, doing the best he can with staff and people. He knew how bad it was. He said \u201c\u2026I have already called my manager and alerted them of the problem\u201d. I ask for the manager to call me about my complaint so I gave the pit boss my card and room number. He diligent took all the information down and said he would pass it on to the manager to contact me in the morning. 12:noon-no one called me. I had to go down to the lobby to follow-up myself. Again at the front desk, apparently there is still no hotel manager on duty in the house. Talked with that supervisor, but she had no authority to follow up on my complaint, or give me answers. She went in back to call the hotel manager?? Call where, where is this person? Where is anyone in charge?? She came back and said I could speak with Mike Smith, Supervisor. Mr. Smith was cordial and listened to my complaint. He explained again the \u201cManager\u201d is off on certain days. Explained the stench was in fact sewer stench. I asked about complaints, and his comment was that mine was \u201c\u2026the only complaint about the incident that we received\u201d. I said that was a lie because the pit boss took complaints, the desk took complaints, and the staff was all suffering. It is illogical that mine would be the ONLY complaint. Bottom line I complained I lost a night of entertainment..and he gave me a complaint form to fill out saying there is nothing more he could do.

I like to eat at the Silverton owned places like the cafe I just use points. I will say the employees I interacted with are friendly.

Pros: Beautiful huge lobby, stunning massive aquarium, Pro Bass Shop is incredible, casino is large but not large enough to get lost, casino had lots of game choices, beds were very comfortable with nice linens, toiletries products were very nice, rooms bigger than average and room decor was nice. While playing slots, cocktail waitress were around constantly taking free drink orders....that was nice. The \"Twin Creeks\" Steakhouse is exceptional, one of the nicest dinners we have ever had out, excellent staff, food was amazing....but be aware it is closed Sundays and Mondays. Check in was friendly as was the little souvenir shop's clerk. A large convenient Starbuck's is located in the hotel, as well as a pizza/hamburger place that was impeccably clean and had inviting, friendly staff. Casino ventilation was quite good so it never got too smokey. Cons: Complained to housekeeping 1 minute upon entering room because bathrooms were actually DIRTY....toilets were dirty, garbage in garbage can, etc. All three bathrooms were not in good shape, needed recaulking around toilet, new grout on floor tile work, shower/tubs were dingy and the floor of the showers were very slimy....ICK! Floors are uneven in areas which is quite strange. The \"Sundance Grill\" restaurant was so bad it was ridiculous; from unfriendly boring staff to terrible food quality! Seasons Buffet for the Sunday Bellini Brunch was nice, but for regular during the week buffet breakfast it was pathetic (no eggs, bacon, sausage, french toast, or other traditional breakfast foods, but instead egg rolls, salad, pizza, perhaps not what you want before 10am?)....buffet was VERY grubby, food subpar. Alcoholic drinks throughout the entire hotel and casino were outrageously priced ($45 U.S for a margarita and 2 rye and cokes!!) Rooms for the most part were quiet...but be advised that if you have a room with an adjoining door to another room, you can hear WORD FOR WORD what the people in the other room are saying (not so fun if they are super early birds like we had next to us). Front doors of all hotel rooms are needing to be replaced, as they are ALL damaged in one way or another. Bartenders in Mermaids Lounge could have used a class in friendliness. Location is very poor if you want to be where the nightlife and strip are.....but a great location if you want to be away from the strip and want it quieter yet still fun. Don't expect a great shuttle service.....they offer 3 shuttles a day to the Ceasar's Palace (11am, 5pm and 10pm). You have to figure out how to get back to the Silverton yourself. We never used the shuttle because we thought the times were inconvenient. Cab to the strip costs between $22 to $25 one way. There is NO shuttle to and from the airport....cab from the airport is about $20. ATM machine in hotel charges a $22 fee per transaction....yes you read that right...so make sure you get cash somewhere else. NOTE: This is important!! If staying here, go and get your Discovery Club card from within the casino....usually I don't bother with these things because they are just a gimmick, but there was zero hitch with this....it gives you amazing drink and food discounts and buffet was half price with the card. ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: Only 3 minutes away is the new \"SouthPoint\" hotel and casino....its gorgeous, its massive, and the Silverado Steakhouse there served us the nicest meal we have EVER had in a restaurant.....12 oz. lobster tails broiled to perfection, amazing prime rib, roasted asparagus with decadent white wine hollandaise sauce, delicious salads prepared table side, and an excellent/professional/friendly waiter and staff. SO, pros and cons to this hotel......but to be honest we will stay at the Paris or another we are familiar with on the strip again. The Paris is lovely to stay at, and so is the Monte Carlo.

Self Park was very convient if you decided to go that route. A super target and all the other stores that follow are just across the street. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. We were able to check in at 900am with no problem. At check in we were given some very good coupons from booking through expedia. You will need a rental car at this location. The decor was rustic and had a disney wilderness lodge theme which was very cool. The pool was one that you would find at a community center. It is very plain, but peaceful. The room was very nice, the beds were the most comfortable bed that we have ever slept on in vegas, The ac worked great. The bathroom is the problem, it is very very small. There is no room for two peolple. It is nice just small. The bed bath and beyond soaps and lotions were a nice touch. Mi Casa is a mexican rest. at the resort, it is great, ask what the special for the day is. We saved 50% by ordering this way. The buffet was excellent, our expedia coupons allowed both of us to eat crab legs for $9.00 total. They were great and even better at $9.00. Our las night we ate at Twin Creeks Steak house. This place was EXCELLENT, it will cost you around 120.00 four a couple, but it was worth it. The Bass Pro Shop is attached to this resort so you can go price your favarite rifle and then play Blackjack to earn the money to buy it. I will never stay anywhere but Silverton Casino. The following are negatives that we encountered from other locations this trip. NYNY has massive construction going on inside, jack hammers were so loud you could not here delaers talking to you. Tony Romas Steak and Lobster at Fitzgeralds was a joke, the lobster was good but the steak was like eatting shoe leather. Traffic on the strip was very heavy, use I15 to skip it. $$$$$$This is am must$$$$$$$$$$$$ Go see Jersey Boys, buy the cheap tickets and they will move you closer up front. It is a great story line, and songs were excellent. The \"F\" word and \"GD\" was used alot during this show. This show would of been perfect had they just not used the language. The silverton allows you to dip into the \"strip confusion\" and then retreat to your private resort in peace.

I haven been very impressed overall. Rooms: the rooms are nice and comfortable. They are not fancy, but they are clean. The t.v. is a 27\", and also is nothing fancy but it gets the job done. The rooms are clean, and the beds are pretty comfortable. Not as comfortable as at home, but they get the job done. Although I couldn't get the wireless internet to work, they had a network cable plug in, and the network connection was very fast. Casino: The casino like the rooms, is nothing fabulous, but it gets the job done. It is nicely laid out and has a lot of different options. Table games are plentiful, though it is very possible you will be the only person playing. I was playing double deck $5 blackjack and it was just me! The poker room is pretty bad. I was only actually able to play 1 time as there was never enough people to play. There is a lot of choices and the casino was not overly smoky in my opinion unlike some other posters said. Hotel Services: The valet was a tad lacking. They were never very busy, but it took quite a bit of time (15 minutes) on average to get the car. It also took some time to drop off your car because sometimes there were no valet employees around. Still much quicker to get your car than at a mega resort because there aren't 100 people in front of you, and the workers worked hard, just seemed to be a little understaffed. Room service was average, nothing great, but the price was good. It was very iffy at night whether or not you would be able to get food. One night when I called at 1:00 a.m., nobody answered so I called the front desk. They said \"Oh they must not be at their post call them back in 5 minutes\". So 5 minutes, then 10 minutes, then 15 minutes later i called, and was never able to gety anything. Business services were non existent, and if you want a boarding pass printed you have to have the front desk do it since they don't have a business center. Dining: We only ate at the buffet and room service. Buffet was very good, especially the sunday brunch. We were very impressed, and for $16.99 you got a very good buffet with unlimited champagne drinks like mimosa's. The dinner buffer was $19.99 and with it you got unlimited house wine. As I said earlier room service was good, if unspectacular. Good value for the money. Location: I really liked the location. It's very convenient to I-15. If you are not going to rent a car though, DO NOT STAY HERE. I always get a rental in Vegas, and have no idea why you wouldn't get one. If you don't I would not stay here. Would probably be at least a $15 cab ride to the MGM one way, if you could get one. I never saw one out front. They have a shuttle, but it only goes every 5 hours??? I don't know why they bother, every 5 hours? They're only 10 or 15 minutes from the MGM, so why they couldn't go every 1 or 2 hours, I don't know. I think it boils down to the running theme of the hotel, which is that they are a tad understaffed. Overall: I really like this hotel. I know I mentioned a lot of negative things about this hotel, but I would definitely stay here again. I paid $40 a night including tax, and for that price I wouldn't stay anywhere else. It has a few problems, but the rooms are clean, the employees friendly and the food is good. I also really like the location, but make sure you get a rental car. I stayed at the Venetian and Signature MGM Grand my las two times to Vegas. This place obviously isn't as nice. But for the money, it definitely is great.

( i would really like to purchase the brand that they stock at their hotel for our house) we didn't have time to hang around as we were busy going to our show and such, but we did see the aquarium which is really nice and i think they also have a \"mermaid\" show daily. the only drawback of the silverton would be shower flow---it needed more pressure. that room cost us $78.00 and change---$1.00 under what the motel 6 was charging---i would stay here anytime. both people we dealt with at check-in were very pleasant and treated us with friendliness and respect. next time we come to vegas i would definately stay at silverton--they have proved themselves to be a very nice place.", "Date": "April 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, or", "Title": "\u201cWould not recommend\u201d", "Author": "donz2", "ReviewID": "UR15222107", "Content": "We had a first floor, non-smoking room but due to the quantity of smoke from the casino, everything in the room smelled smoky and you were hit with the smoke as soon as leaving the room.

We have stayed at this property several times in the past and have always enjoyed our stays. We had two beds in our room and they were fairly firm, while my sister had two much softer beds. The room was non-smoking and it didn't smell like smoke until you walked out into the hallway. This is probably due to our room being on the ground level a few halls away from the casino. You probably won't have that problem if you're on a higher floor if smoke is an issue. The rooms are very spacious, as well as the bathrooms. They were refurbished a couple of years ago, so the fixtures and decorations are updated. While we were there, we showed everyone the aquarium which is pretty neat and spent a little time in the casino using the coupons from the American Casino Guide. The Bass Pro Shop, which is connected, was closed since we arrived late, so we didn't go there on this trip. We have been there several times and it is a fairly large store with everything you would find in the Bass Pro's at home (we are from Missouri). They do have souvenier Bass Pro t-shirts and you can find a 20% off of any one item discount coupon in the free What's On Magazine around town. There may be one in your room upon arrival, so make sure you check it before heading to the store. There are lots of other coupons in that magazine as well. My sister and her family left early for the Grand Canyon, while we stayed in Vegas since we had been to the GC a few times. They grabbed breakfast at a IHOP, which is fairly close. We ate lunch at the Silverton buffet, which is much better (and more expensive) than the buffet of the past. We had a buy-one, get-one free coupon from the American Casino Guide, so the price was reasonable. Check-in and out of the hotel was very easy. We gave the front desk a $100 cash deposit instead of having them put a hold on our credit card for incidentals since we were on an extended trip. The pool looked very nice, and there is a workout room, but we didn't have time to use either. We will definitely stay at this property again.", "Date": "September 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "LA", "Title": "\u201cWell ,Okay for one night\u201d", "Author": "pimmy80", "ReviewID": "UR8504939", "Content": "I stayed with my husband in this hotel durring the way back to Utah .

Its located off of the Interstate I 15, its about 7-10 miles from the Strip,. but if you have a car, its TOTALLY worth the trip! The gaming is very good, from what I experienced... you get a long play time for your money. I like the penny machines, and if you can get long play time with the pennies, well- you know thats good news. My family and I especially enjoy the fish tank there. Its thousands and thousands of gallons, with tropical fish, some sharks... its very, very nice and of course, the best part is that its FREE. They also have a store called the Great Oudoors, I believe and it is IMPRESSIVE. They have all kinds of taxidermied (is that a word) Animials, Moose, Lion, Giraffee, ducks, fish... you get the idea. Its just amazing. You can get ANYTHING there if you love the outdoors, hunting, fishing, camping, boating, swimming... all the good stuff. The store is enourmous and it even has a kind of shooting range... with electronic squirrls that fall down when you hit them, sound effects, the whole works. Its fun! Dont miss the Buffet there, its beautiful- look up when you are in there and see the HUGE trees they sliced to use as decoration... really pretty. The food is wonderful and as buffet's go, first class, totally. The staff is excellent. My Son wanted a hamburger and that was not something they had in eye-sight, so I inquired as to if that was something that we could get and the Chef went to one of the resturaunts and got one and made it especially for him! (We tipped him $6 bucks, hey, he coulda said No) I havent explored the whole of the place, not that its that big, but the atmosphere of the Silverton is very, very nice. Extremely clean and I like it very much. When my parents come to Las Vegas this August to visit, we will be taking them there. Cheers!

I wanted to play at a real craps table so I tried to get a cab to MGM, I waited for an hour and finally got one.

I am a fan. I have read through some of the negative comments posted by others and can only offer that as a frequent LV visitor, I have had good and bad experiences at most all places I have stayed. It's the nature of this extremely high guest-traffic city. Silverton rooms are spacious, well appointed, and feature several small touches I really appreciate, such as a CD player, dimmers on all lamps, a curved shower rod, and a nice cushion top mattress. The only negative I can offer is that the A/C is a built-in wall unit, rather than a central-type. Although it has an adjustable temperature control, it is not digital and there are only 2 settings on the fan. The fan is sort of loud and annoying. That being said, I usually sleep well through it. There is a mini-bar in the room. The aquarium is the best I have ever seen in my life. It's awesome. The nearby mermaid lounge has a tank of jellyfish behind the bar. There is a Bass Pro Shops for outdoorsmen (and ladies). The Sundance Cafe is a very good coffee shop. Again, service is spotty all over vegas. Usually its good here. I actually like sitting at the large granite counter when I am alone. Note to breakfast fans: Opt for the traditional hash browns over the other potatoe choice. I like \"Joe's Shuffle\" which is scrambled eggs with spinach, onions and turkey sausage (plus potatoes and toast) for $5.25. I have not tried the Buffet or Steak House. The Shady Grove has excellent Happy Hour specials (4-7 M-F), like $2 Grey Goose shots, while the new Mexican restaurant has $1 Patron shots and $2 appetizers. The staff have always been friendly to me. Good Bloody Mary's while I was playing on Sunday. The pool is large (unheated) and usually quiet with few kids screaming and splashing. I have used the hot tub at all hours. They do have concerts at the pool area in summer. You can relax in the water and see the band. Please note that it's a drive to the strip (approx. 5 miles) but if you want to stay off-strip or just want a really good value, this is it. Join the club and use your card. I get extremely low rates as a result and I am by no means a heavy player.", "Date": "July 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "california", "Title": "\u201cTerrible terrible experience!\u201d", "Author": "kp5981", "ReviewID": "UR8026362", "Content": "First we booked a suite and they didn't have any left and they still charged us for a suite.

I chose this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews. We were looking for just one night's good sleep outside of Vegas for our family, and boy, was the sleep great.! The beds were very comfortable and the room was oversized. The hotel was easy to find from the airport using mapquest directions although at the time (September 2006) there is construction going on in the area, so watch the signs and the traffic. It's a little tricky. The parking lot was a little confusing going just one-way in spots and finding the front desk was a challenge. I know it's a casino and you have to travel that maze to get to anything, but it's still a pain--especially with two little kids in tow. We did not come to gamble and cannot comment on anything like that except to say that I hated dragging them through the smokey casino. But I knew this when I booked the room. I would not stay here on a long term basis for this reason alone, but for one night after a 7 hour flight, the spacious rooms and comfy beds were worth the quick entrance and exit. The hotel is attached to a Bass Pro Shop and the area between the store and the casino has a huge fish tank that periodically features a live \"mermaid\" which was the highlight of our 4 year old little girl's stay. She got to see \"Ariel\" who was tastefully clothed in a mermaid suit that had a flesh colored suit underneath--so you weren't really seeing what you thought you were seeing. A plus for us prudes. She swam with stingrays, small sharks and other fish and even came to the glass to interact with our daughter. Our room was ready when we arrived around 1pm local time. It was oversized with two queen beds with heavenly pillow-top matresses and very comfortable pillows. We were on the 4th floor which was supposed to be non-smoking, but there was always a faint odor of smoke, possibly rising up from the casino or other floors. Our room did not smell as if it had been smoked in. The room was clean, spacious and cool in the 90 degree heat. The air conditioner worked great, but was a bit loud. We did not mind and did not need to use our white-noise machine. But if you like quiet, it was loud. The drapes darkened the room well when we went to bed early because we had come from a different time zone. Our room overlooked the pool which was lit up beautifully in the dark, but we did not swim. Did I say that the beds were fabulous? Better than any $40 hotel I've ever stayed at. Come to think of it, I don't think I ever did stay at a $40 hotel before! But book through Vegas.com to get a better price than you can get through their regular website. Rooms at this price are limited so book early if you can. The bathroom was average and included a hairdryer, but the bonus was the Bath & Body Works toiletries. It was a nice touch. No cheap hotel soap here. I would definitely stay here again if I was coming through town, there is a lot of room for the children to move around in, a table to have dinner at (only two chairs) and a Bass Pro Shops next door. I believe they have an RV Park too and several restaurants which we did not visit. Just a short drive away is the very bottom of Las Vegas Blvd. and several places to eat and a grocery store. We also purchased a double CD containing about 16-18 songs that was in the room for $12.99 which seemed reasonable. It was a nice variety of music from Aretha Franklin to Sonny & Cher, Captain & Tenille to Bonnie Tyler. It did not seem overpriced as many hotel items are. Speaking of which, there were $6 bottles of Evian and a mini bar available, but we didn't even open them up. I would not stay here long term simply because of the faint smell of smoke (we are asthmatics) and because the children had to walk through the casino to get anywhere, but it is a VERY comfortable place to stay after a long flight, passing through or for adults only.", "Date": "October 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cNice Stay\u201d", "Author": "jwjones", "ReviewID": "UR5925826", "Content": "Stayed in rm4032 on 9/13/06.Quiet,comfortable and clean room.Shuttle to strip.Located in safe area for a good price and value.", "Date": "October 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "california", "Title": "\u201coff the strip cheap rates without comprising quality\u201d", "Author": "lasvegaschick", "ReviewID": "UR5700897", "Content": "My husband and I are a fairly young crowd for this hotel (28 and 31).

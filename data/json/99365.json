NYC is hard because all the hotels are just so expensive! I booked this one because it was reasonably priced for NYC, had decent reviews on Trip Advisor and was in a good location close to the park and was close to stations on three or four different coloured subway lines. Well, I was certainly not disappointed by the location. It was the PERFECT spot to stay in NYC. About a 2min walk to the southern end of Central Park, and there are two subway stations within 2min walk, even more within 5mins. Broadway is just around the corner, and a 3-5min walk puts you right in the middle of the theatre district and Times Square. We had no trouble catching the subway right downtown to visit Wall St, Ground Zero and the Statue of Liberty. We caught the train to midtown to see a jazz show and Harlem to go to church. All from stops within 2min walk from the hotel. The room was really quite decent. A little bit of an older style, but clean and comfortable with two queen size beds, and just enough room for our luggage. The bathroom was smallish, but clean and had everything we needed, including a nice hot shower. Just what one would expect from a hotel in this price range! The breakfast is very basic (muffins with juice and coffee), which I understand is pretty normal for NYC, but it was prefectly fine to start off the day, considering it was included in the price. The only drama we had was that, being winter, the boiler system in the building made a VERY loud banging noise which lasted about 1min each time. And the problem was that this happened about every hour or two. I wore ear plugs, but the noise was still loud enough to wake me up each time. I did complain to the front desk, but was told there were no other available rooms with two beds.

My wife and I were out walking around exploring the area on our recent trip to NYC, looking at various restaurant menus, when a guy standing on the steps (the owner ?) started chatting to us and inviting us in: the menu seemed ok and he seemed friendly enough so we told him we'd be back later that night. We returned and went down the steps into the restaurant to find it practically empty but decided to stay and give it a go anyway. Our waiter arrived with our water and started the usual conversation - where are you from/been to NYC before/how long staying etc - but then things started turning slightly strange. As part of the normal run of things we asked him where he was from, to which he got us playing a guessing game (?!?) and then started giving us clues eg \"Your country has had problems with my country.\" Eventually he told us he was from Guatemala. As the meal progressed he seemed less friendly and kept telling us at various points in the evening about different problems between the UK and Guatemala, and how the UK has \"double crossed\" his country. Unfortunately both my wife and I had to admit our ignorance of these problems but his comments and behaviour were making us feel very uncomfortable. As we finished our main course we decided that we'd leave without enjoying any deserts or coffee, due to the waiter, however when we declined to see the desert menu he \"accidentally\" knocked an almost full glass of red wine all over my wife whilst taking her plate away. Obviously this made a mess of her dress, as well as being the final straw in THE most surreal and uncomfortable dining experience we have ever had anywhere in the world. We demanded our bill immediately and left (obviously without leaving a tip) - the guy we'd seen earlier (the owner ?) was sitting in a corner seat on his mobile but if he was the owner/manager as we suspected he didn't even break his call (ok he could have been a customer who'd been there for about 4 hours). The food itself was very average and relatively overpriced but the confrontational, unprofessional and weird waiter was disgraceful (and if it was the owner/manager he clearly didn't care about what was going on). All in all it was probably the scariest dining experience we have ever had and it completely spoilt our evening out - not to mention spoiling my wife's dress as well !!!", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCentrally located budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "fab56_11", "ReviewID": "UR96620545", "Content": "Excellent location, but disappointing view .... central service pipe for surrounding buildings, so only view walls and pipes, very little natural light.

Lovely to hear the sounds of pigeons cooing first thing in the morning. Walls were a little thin for noise, but nothing horrid. Basic room layout. Not a big room, but suitable for 1 or 2 travelers. TV on basic channels only, but you can find better things to do in NYC other than TV. Bathroom had average space, w/ complimentary shampoo/conditioner. One downside was that the tub leaked (emergency run-upstairs from the lobby to inform us it was leaking while filling). Offered another room but declined. No rust / wear / bed bugs / major complaints about the room, better than many others I've been in. Unlike other reviewers, bed was VERY soft and no problems sleeping.

I had checked some reviews and thought it was okay. I was soo wrong.The only thing I gave a good rate to is the location. Your very close to Central Park, Time Square, and near by subways. I do have to give a poor rating to the rest. Here is my reason why. We got there and the front desk came off a bit rude. When I walked in she just asked if we were checking in, no hello or how are you. As we were checking in, we found out that our room was not cleaned when we arrived way after check out. We were patient and asked if we can leave our luggages while we get a bite to eat. Her reply was you can leave it in the lobby. Are you serious? We decided that one should stay in the lobby while the other runs to McDonalds next door to get food. After an hour our room was ready. When we got in we were upset because we had the front rooms and they said that rooms are usually bigger in that end and it was small. We looked around to make sure it was clean, and ended up finding a roach. We went back downstairs and the front desk agent just shrugged and said thats New york. We asked if we can go to another room and she said she was able to do that. She said the manager was the only who could reassign rooms. We asked to speak to a manger and she said that the manager would be in at 11pm. We asked if there was any other time he'll be in and she said \"No, he does night audit\". So we asked for maintenance and she said fine. We waited when maintenace came up he had a cook outfit on. We were a little confused, but we remembered that they had a restaurant below the hotel (same owner). We decided to skip the restaurant downstairs, even with a 10% discount, I dont want to even know. What he did do was sprayed some bug spray (thanks). That night we saw the manager and complained. His response was a shrug. The followng day we woke up and noticed bite marks on our body. We finally had it and asked to speak with someone else. Another girl at the front desk asked for the owner and the owner himself didn't have a response. It seemed as if he didn't know much either or how to manage a hotel. We complained to him about the service and the room. We asked that we get our money back and he said no, but he'll gve us a free meal and we said hell no. We also told him why. We decided we weren't going to stay. We used the computers up front to reserve a room at a different hotel by Orbitz. Much better.

Overall an average of $289 per night. Their cancellation policy states one night penalty and yes you have guessed it, instead of the average or even the lowest we were charged $329 cancellation fee. Their policy states that any change or cancellation within 7 days of arrival has a one night penalty and I called them 4 days ahead of arrival to cancel.

We are from the Philly area and really only ever do day trips to NYC so we decided to stay overnight as an early bday celebration for my husband. The hotel's location can not be beat. Check-in was quick, friendly and efficient and check-out was also the same. Times Sq is in walking distance and about one block over are a million places to eat breakfast (Fluffy's, Carnegie, Park). Easy access to shopping and also Central Park and Columbus Circle are two blocks north. There are several subway stops within two blocks of the hotel. If you are coming in from Penn Station, you can take the blue line C train 3 stops up to Columbus circle($2 one way) Now for the hotel itself. Do not expect luxury at this hotel. This is strictly what I would call a tourist 2 star hotel. NYC is expensive so to get a hotel for under $200/night in this location you can't expect much. The room is small, big enough for a queen size bed and a small (very small) desk. They did manage to put a small wardrobe with a frig which I thought is convenient to keep drinks cold and there is space to hang-up shirts. The bathroom decor was nice w/small shower stall, toilet and pedestal sink just as you see in the pictures on this site. The room was clean and the bathroom was spotless. However, I must mention one mishap when we were getting ready to leave our room to check out. There was a cockroach in the bathroom on the floor at the base of the pedastal sink. We were on the 3rd fl and roaches usually make their way up from the ground so it had to make us wonder what was going on in the basement. The restaurant is in the basement and we did not eat there so I cannot comment on that. We only saw one but usually where there is one there is a hundred.

The rooms are just big enough, and the bathroom was pretty spacious. There's a full length mirror which is rare in such hotels, and refrigerator which is nice to have. Don''t expect any marble in the bathroom, and we did have some cold water sometimes in the middle of the shower which was annoying, but really for this price..what can you expect?! Downside was window faced into a smelly alley, and we could not leave the window open. There was an A/C which could not be set to any temperature but the original FREEZING one. We complained about this and immediately they came to turn it down, later making our room too hot...luckily, the weather was good so it was ok for us. I thought it was nice they had at least responded to our requests. The staff was nice also, and breakfast was small but yummy. We did have to leave our stuff in the lobby, because they don't have a storage room, but it was fine and felt safe to me (very small hotel).

Our room was exactly what we needed-a comfortable, clean place to sleep, a safe place to keep our things, affordable and close to everything. The rooms are pretty small but the bathroom was huge and ornate-beautiful! One weird thing was that they cleaned our room in the afternoon which happened to be when we took our siesta so they missed us once. We just asked the desk and they had someone fix it later. The two ladies at the desk are very kind and hospitable. There is a fridge in the room which is an unusual luxury in a lower price hotel.

Then, I found the DaVinci Hotel! I thought it was too good to be true - a reasonably-priced hotel in Manhattan with good reviews - but the place was great! We were a bit wary before we arrived, but as soon as we met the friendly ladies in the lobby and saw our clean, cozy rooms, we were sold. The rooms are small but have everything you need in NYC (who wants to hang around the hotel, anyway?) - one of our rooms even had a flat-screen TV mounted on the wall. The rooms were cleaned every day (although a bit later in the day on Saturday), and the place was so quiet we could hardly tell we had neighbors in the rooms next to ours (although the loud AC might have helped drown out any noise). Some older reviews mention that the lobby staff ask for your room keys each time you leave the building, but that was not the case for us - we used electronic credit card-sized keys like any normal hotel, so perhaps this practice has been updated.

It looks a little scruffy on the outside, but once inside, it is a nice little place. As you enter the lobby, you have the stairs leading up to the floors. Also, you have a narrow hallway, with a glass door leading to the first level elevator. The doors are always open to the elevator, so you just go in. When I got to my 2nd floor room, I noticed the hallway was quite narrow. You use a plastic room card to access your room. I was surprised to have gotten two full size beds. There was just enough from from the door, outside in, to move my two main pieces of luggage. Inside was a clean and functional room with: two print pieces on the wall, an old desk with a fold down mirror, facing the main mirror, a television set with a two drawer cabinet and a larger one below that. There is a small closet, which had just enough capacity for my two medium sized luggage pieces. Inside the closet, was a top shelf with two blankets and one pillow. The beds had their own pillows. Luckily, I didn't have room facing street traffic. My frosted window faced the wall of the building next door, so you could hear bits of conversation downstairs and could definitely detect food smells nearby. There is a step down connecting the room to the bathroom, so watch out for that. The bathroom was lovely, with antique looking hot and cold water levers (?) by the sink. You did have a row of toiletries (those samples of shampoo and conditioner) on the glass shelf above the sink. The bathroom also has a combination tub / shower. The shower sliding door was located above the tub, sliding from left to right. It seemed functional enough. The only thing I didn't like was the AC unit. I was unable to use it, since the knobs didn't have their coverings and I forgot to pack my pliers to turn on the unit. I was disappointed in that, since during that week, the temps in the afternoon were in the high 80's and I was sweating a bit. Also, try to work the clock radio and adjust the alarm if you don't want to be awakened at a certain time in the morning. The staff at the Da Vinci were lovely. I had to borrow the iron and board from downstairs. Since those things have been used quite a bit, the dial info on the appliances have faded, so I recommend that you don't put water in the iron. You do get one of those small , not too long ironing boards, but I managed to press some of my clothes. You request the iron and board. It makes sense to return it as soon as you are done, so someone else can use them. Surroundings: You have a McDonalds next door and an Italian restaurant below the hotel itself. The 59th St. Columbus Circle subway is about 3 blocks away to the north, right by Central Park South. The 50th St. 8th Avenue stop is about 6 blocks to the south of the hotel. I recommend the Cosmic Diner on W. 52nd and 8th Avenue, located at the SE corner of that intersection. It's a 24 hour place. Suggestions: Keep an eagle eye ( a very close eye) on the traffic as you cross the lights. Cabs and other cars use the streets of Manhattan as a personal highway, so be warned. Also, even though the crosswalk light may be red, if the traffic is clear enough , people will cross. Pedestrian traffic is heavy, so you have to learn how to walk at a brisk pace... in other words... learn to walk fast. There is a continental breakfast that starts around 6:30 a.m. or 7:00 a.m. I made the mistake of having a donut and coffee before my Super Shuttle arrived a couple of hours later. Bad choice. I don't know if it was the donut or the milk carton (at room temperature and not sitting in ice) that caused problems iwth my head and tummy. I didn't experience that during my first trip and had eaten a full breakfast. It didn't help that the Super Shuttle was making stops here and there before it got to JFK. It could have been.. just me.. but I have my suspicions about that donut and the coffee. My stay at the Da Vinci was generally okay. I wouldn't recommend the donuts and coffee tho. I actually took a bunch of pics as I arrived in my room, on the first day.

In the first hour, we found that the bedside lamp was broken, the fridge didn't work and the TV reception was terrible even the basic cable. The TV and lamp were met with no assistance, the fridge we fixed ourselves. I noted that many people found the reception staff good. On weekdays she seemed pleasant enough, not overly friendly but not rude. The weekend staff were terrible. We asked where the nearest laundromat was, only to be told \"I don't know\". Therefore we searched along 8th Avenue for a internet cafe to look one up. Shame the girl on the desk didn't feel able to do this for us. The cleaning staff were nice, but 2 days out of 5 it wasn't done as we were in the room at 4pm (jetlag). Many reviews are correct in that it was relatively clean and cheap for Manhattan.

I would actually recommend visiting here before you hit the other shops in the City because I did see the same watch I bought from the outlets in a Macy's and it was the full price, so it's not even like they are selling old stock.

I also think that I would stay there again, the location and the price are great and is definitely decent enough to spend a holiday.", "Date": "January 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, ON", "Title": "\u201cNot Great But You Get What You Pay For\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4221157", "Content": "Not a great hotel but you have to accept it for being so much cheaper than the rest. pros: 1) nice lobby 2) cheaper 3) near subway 4) location cons: 1) no secure luggage storage. 2) noise from the street and floor above. hint, turn on the fan to drown it out with a constant buzz 3) not enough electrical outlets. 4) no counter or cabinet in the bathroom 5) envelope on the nightstand looking for tips from housekeeping (I've never seen this before) 6) my request for two double beds was accepted but not filled. bed was slightly smaller than a queen. 7) too much furniture for such a small room. 8) free high speed internet didn't work 9) 4pm check-in and 11am check-out 10) inconsistent water pressure/temperature But after all the rough edges I'd still go back.", "Date": "December 8, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Da Vinci Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d99365-Reviews-Da_Vinci_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$161 - $253*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">244 West 56th Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10019</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "99365", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d3/d5/d3d59914baa0b82ac25a59cb73ec74891large.jpg"}}

Staff were couteous and helpful. We were able to purchase tickets for the zoo and trolley tour at the hotel. A very good breakfast was provided free with a variety of choices including eggs and waffles. This hotel is within walking distown of Litttle Italy, Embarcadaro and Downtown San Diego. It is also close to airport and cruise terminal and provides a free shuttle to these locations. Make sure you pre-book shuttle to cruise terminal. The morning we left it seemed as though the entire hotel were heading to their cruises. It appeared somewhat chaotic and a number of people were rude and complaining. The staff handles this well and added a second shuttle. We had booked the shuttle for 1300 and were delayed only by 20 minutes. Considering the number of people waiting for the shuttle I felt this was very good service.

Comfy bed, good working shower, tv with variety of channels, free wifi and working safe. My only issue with the room was at night, the trains were very loud. But you'd have this problem at any hotel in this area. Free breakfast was included, but it wasn't anything fantastic. Good if you are a budget traveller though. Upon checking out of the hotel, we used the free shuttle to take us and our suitcases to the Santa Fe Depot. The driver was very friendly and helpful.

I did not stay next to a smoking room and I did not smell any smoke in my room. Also on my floor there seemed to be a very loud AC or similar which I actually could here from my room 3 rooms away from the noise.

It is located just a few steps from the bay promenade, along which one could walk either to the convention center wihtin 20mins or so, and also into the city (the shorter way to the city and shopping areas such as Horton Plaza is straight through the city and does not even take 10mins). Check-Inn upon arrival was fast and friendly. Not over-friendly as some might know from 4- or 5-star hotels...but on the other hand, I did not want to become friends with the receptionists ;-) and they were nice enough to make us feel fine. The room (and we \"only\" had a standard room) was spacious with two huge queen beds and a lovely view to the Star of India sailship. Very clean, nice bathtub with shower included, which had a good water pressure. We also appreciated the coffee machine in the room, which helped especially during the first two days when we were still in a jet-lag. ;-) The wireless internet was sometimes a bit slow and my colleague was kicked out the net a few times, but on the other hand, it is free (try to get free internet throughout european hotels...good luck!) and overall worked good enough to check e-mails and do things such as skype. Some people mentioned the trains blowing their horns all night...well, yes, you can hear them once in a while, but we thought that the sound-proof windows did a good job and both had a decent sleep all week. What might be more of a problem if you have a light sleep or get disturbed easily is a room on one of the lower floors facing the pool. Another colleague was on the 3rd floor and said he could hear the pool generator (or whatever it was) quite clearly. To have breakfast, you have to walk out the hotel a few metres to the left and step into the adjoining restaurant. Not a big problem in sunny and warm April. Breakfast itself was ok...as always in the USA, way too sweet. ;-) But with choices of bread and scrumbled eggs, butter, jelly and several kinds of cereals, two or three kinds of juice, coffee (even decaf) and some (for our taste rather disgusting) kinds of oatmeal or porridge. Oh and of course pancakes and maple syrup. So overall and since it was included in the price, that was fine and enough to have a good start into the day.

We equally enjoyed the experience on the 2 hr tour overview of city. Not enough time to do Balboa Park but we saw enough that we know we want to come back to this city.

AAA) place to stay in Downtown San Diego on a summer weekend--high season. It's located at the border between the financial district of downtown and the lively residential/restaurant area of Little Italy. As previous reviewers have pointed out, the hotel is within blocks of the Amtrak/Coaster station and the Trolley, as well as the main bus spine on Broadway. Since I was staying without a car access to all this transit--as well as the many places I could walk to--was important. Some previous reviewers commented that there were a lot of homeless people around. Maybe I'm just habituated to it, but it didn't seem like a lot to me--maybe a couple on each walk near the hotel. There were areas of the Downtown, particularly around City College, that seemed to me to have a much stronger presence of street people. I disliked the fact that in the downtown direction there weren't many people of any kind around on the weekend, and that there were an awful lot of parking lots to walk by (hopefully a few more highrise condos will get built and get rid of some parking lots!). I was initially put into a low floor (4th) smoking room despite asking for a high floor non-smoking room. The desk folks said they were completely booked Friday night, but at my request on Saturday moved me to a non-smoking room on the 11th floor. Well done. The breakfast seemed pretty hopeless, like so many hotel breakfasts are. There are a lot of more interesting places to eat in San Diego. You get either a city view or a bayside view from any room, since the hotel is built with two lines of rooms on either side of a double loaded corridor. It makes for an ugly building outside but good views, though on the west side you've got to get over the parking structure. There were a lot of young people staying there--as well as foreign tourists--but they seeemed to quiet down late at night. I closed the door to my balcony--the room's \"window\"-- to cut down noise late at night. Contrary to what's been said, there is a pause in train service in the middle of the night, but only from about 1 a.m. to 6 a.m. The room's decor was fine, but not particularly notable.

The second option is to come in a car that has a disabled person's placard or license plate. This entitles the driver to park on the structure's ground level, where the designated spaces actually allow for a large pick-up or SUV.

It certainly isn't a luxurious large scale hotel like the ones near the convention center, but it suffices for downtown convenience. The decor is somewhat outdated as the building appears to be from the early 80s, and the rooms tend to be somewhat shaded and dark as there is a neighboring bank building attached and blocking sunlight. There is still a nice bayview on one side, although as another review mentioned, there is a condo site that will eventually block the view. (So far there is no construction going up as yet.) They were nice enough to give us a bayview room even though we had not requested it. The rooms are a standard size, clean, and the queen size beds were above average IMO for comfiness thanks to a nice mattress pad. The microwave and fridge are convenient, and the clean if non luxurious bathroom has a hairdryer and coffeemaker. Water pressure was weak though for the shower. The location is very good, only a block from the nicest Rite Aid I have ever seen on Kettner and India St, and only a block and a half from the trolley stop that goes to the Gaslamp District (which is also walkable, but a long walk.) The area is safe and clean and right near good eats in Little Italy, and very close to the airport. The train line/trolley line passes next to the bay a couple blocks away and is somewhat noisy, but not enough to wake me from sleep. It might bother very light sleepers though. (It seems the noise is not as bad as with other similar budget hotels like Hampton Inn that are right next to the train line.) The parking is convenient and only $7 a night in a small unattended garage attached to the hotel, so you can come and go as you please. I found plenty of spaces available when I was there, so I didn't have the issues that others have noted finding a space. I didn't find the garage scary or weird either, it was open air and you could just walk down the ramps directly and roll bags along it because it was small.(there is no elevator) A compact car is easier to park given the size of the spaces. The included breakfast coupon is for a continental breakfast at an attached restaurant with sit down service, so you still have to pay tip. There is also a full menu so you can have a more substantial breakfast if you want, and the food was okay. Overall, this is a good value, full service hotel with a convenient downtown location. Staff were all pleasant and cordial. They made a small error with my hotel bill, but had already corrected it themselves by the time I called about it.

Be sure to book through the San Diego Convention and Visitor's website as their rate is far less than the advertised Best Western rate. The convention and visitor's website allows you to select if you want bayview or cityview. Although the site doesn't point this out, be aware that a bayview will cost you an extra $10 a night which you will have to pay on arrival. I was aware of this ahead of time and didn't mind paying the extra $10 when I got there. The bayview is nice, but if you are planning on staying here by mid-summer 2007 the view is likely to be blocked by a new high rise condo development they are building a few blocks away.

Use the trolley if you are heading to Old Town, Seaport village, the convention center, or Petco Park. If you want to, you could walk to most downtown attractions. San Diego's downtown is not overly large and easily walkable. The hotel pool is small and can be chilly late in the afternoon when it is shaded from the sun. But the hot tub was very relaxing.

Overall, the Best Western Bayside is a quiet and comfortable hotel, a great value for the price in downtown San Diego. I would likely stay here again on my next visit to San Diego.", "Date": "May 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location!!\u201d", "Author": "IllinoisLovesthesun", "ReviewID": "UR7374391", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed at the Best Western Bayside March 25-30 for Spring Break. The hotel was in a great location, perfect for people who didn't have a car there, like us. They have a free \"shuttle\" to and from the airport- more like a minivan with a crazy driver!! All you have to do is call the hotel once you have picked up your bags at the airport and they come in 10 minutes or so. The hotel is pretty standard issue hotel chain quality, although the furniture was fairly new. The room itself was HUGE- we had a king size bed, a couch, coffee table, table w/ 2 chairs, a desk, and a chair w/ ottoman. Plus the room has a mini-fridge and microwave that came in handy for leftovers! We requested an upper floor, per other tripadvisor suggestions, and ended up on the 12th floor so we were all most at the top (14 floors total- expect 14 is really the 13th- stupid superstitions!) We did not pay for the bay view, but our view of the city was great. The balcony is super small, but we liked being able to leave our door open and get fresh air. There is construction surrounding the hotel, and within a short period of time, there will no longer be any bay view rooms. The price of the hotel is reasonable, especially compared to other downtown hotels. We were only 3 blocks from the bay, walking distance to the USS Midway Museum, Seaport Village, and the Gaslamp Quarter. We did not use the hotel pool- it was kind of chilly, but I can tell you that it is not the kind of pool you relax by all day. This is definitely a city hotel! There is a \"free\" breakfast, but you have to go to the Bayside Cafe, which is attached to the hotel, and be seated. You can either get cereal (hot or cold) w/ toast & coffee/tea, or a bakery item (bagel, danish) with juice or coffee/tea. For a small fee you can add on eggs and fruit- we did it one day & it's a lot of food!! Only complaint is that you have to wait for food, and we were eager to get out of there and start the day. The hotel is just blocks from the Cruise Ship Terminal, and the ferry to Coronado Island. We also took advantage of the public Trolley system, which is just a few blocks from the hotel. If you go, visit Karl Strauss Brewery- a block from the hotel, and home of a well-known and enjoyed beer in the San Diego area- good food too!! Not far from the hotel is the Kansas City Barbeque- famous for it's part in Top Gun- Stop by and eat there! The food is great, and it hasn't changed since Tom Cruise was there in 1985!! We also took advice from fellow tripadvisor's and went to Rite Aide to stock up on drinks & that we kept in the room. Overall San Diego is a wonderful city, and this is a great place to stay and see all the sights. We went to the USS Midway Museum, the Zoo, Sea World, Sea Port Village, Old Town San Diego, Coronado Island, etc. It's a great city to see, and the weather is PERFECT!!!", "Date": "April 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Helpful Staff\u201d", "Author": "Livitup46", "ReviewID": "UR7301073", "Content": "My daughter & I spent four nights at the BW Bayside Inn last week. The location is ideal for walking the city. Our room was clean and comfortable & we had a lovely harbor view (9th floor, bay view) from our balcony. The front desk staff were very helpful and accomodating. The shuttle to & from the airport was an added bonus (note the shuttle doesn't operate until 7 a.m.). The jets in the hot tub weren't operating properly & the elevators were a bit slow (unsure if both were working all of the time) but all in all, we were most pleased & would return. The free breakfast is beverage & muffin, but you can add eggs & fruit for $3.50. An easy walk to Little Italy, the harbor, trolley stop & Santa Fe Depot. A bit further (but definitely manageable) to Seaport Village & the Gaslamp. If you're looking for a day trip, we recommend a coaster train to Carlsbad Village ($11 rt). It was nice to get out of town & the trip was very scenic. Carlsbad was great for shopping & the beach was uncrowded. Many nice restaurants as well. All in all, it was an excellent trip & for the money, the Bayside Inn was great.", "Date": "April 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "illinois", "Title": "\u201cclean and ok for the price, but VERY NOISY!\u201d", "Author": "bianca66", "ReviewID": "UR7282383", "Content": "We stayed here last night, actually, April 3, 2007, a Tuesday night. I had booked thru AAA and failed to specifically request a non-smoking room. That was my fault. The reservation was actually for a city view, but we got a harbor view instead (not complaining) and that kinda made up for being on the smoking floor. We were also just staying for one night before we went to the airport, so smelling the smoke from room next door was tolerable. Pros - 1. The harbor view really is very nice, and the Star of India (about three blocks away, I think) is not blocked at all by other buildings. We arrived just before sunset and it was beautiful setting over the harbor. 2. It is less than a 5 minute drive to the airport. 3. It is walking distance to the harbor area and Little Italy. 4. The parking was 7.00/night. From what I've read, this is fairly reasonable for downtown. And it's right next door. 5. I thought the breakfast at the Bayside Grill next door was just fine, with the vouchers. Coffee was only listed with our option of cereal/milk and toast, but when we asked for juice for our daughter, he brought us all a juice at no charge (in addition to our coffee.) Also - the coffee was very good, and my husband and I are really picky about our coffee. We always bring our won for the room coffeemaker. 6. AAA rate for our room was 129/night. Not bad for a harbor view and breakfast. HOWEVER - Cons- 1. NOISY!!! OMG, even with the windows closed, it was sooo noisy. My 9 yr. old, who normally doesn't even notice urban noise, complained about it. The trolley runs by CONSTANTLY. The Amtrak ran by twice within the first 2 hrs we were there in the evening. A plane flew overhead - really close. The pool was right below our room at ground level - and although we were on the 9th floor, we still heard kids in the pool at 8pm. In the morning, we heard the cruise ships blowing their horns. This was with the windows closed. 2. The TV reception on the 9th floor was awful. ALL OF THE CHANNELS were fuzzy. Not one station was clear. Not one, out of thirty-something channels. 3. Our room was cramped and small, and our bed was uncomfortable - sagged in the middle. The first two, for me, far outweighed the pros, and I don't think I'd be happy staying at this place for a week, or even a few days. Maybe if I was really on a budget, but I would not want to be in the room for long, even if it was non-smoking. I would assume that a lot of hotels downtown and by the harbor would be noisy, but I haven't stayed at those, just this one, and, even with the view, I wasn't that impressed.", "Date": "April 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "La Jolla, California", "Title": "\u201cOkay\u201d", "Author": "vanny420", "ReviewID": "UR7260517", "Content": "I stayed two nights mid-week in March. I didn't pay extra$$ for the bay view but got it because just as we got in there was a large group of German tourists who just came in, which probably booked other rooms. The two queen beds were comfortable. and the pillows were nice and fluffy. In fact we saw many being replaced the day we checked in. (They were taking out old mattresses and bringing in new ones.) The amenities are good. A TV with cable, a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker made the fact that there's no continental breakfast easy, since there's a rite-aid down the street we bought hot-pockets and ate those in the morning. The view of the bay is amazing although it's true there is a concstruction sight to the right it's not very noticeable when you have the sun setting and the \"Star of India\" right in front of you. The pool isn't special and the jets on the hottub didn't work very well but the hottub was hot so that was nice after hours of walking. There are towels in the pool area which I also thought was nice. The constuction was not as noisy as people have said, although to be honest my friends and I left our room about 10:30 everyday and returned in the evening 6pm- midnight. Noise is a problem though as there is a railroad crossing a few blocks away, which you can hear clearly even with the balcony window shut. At night, cruise ships dock at the harbor which is also a few blocks away but the boats horn woke me and my friends up. This happened both nights we stayed and the second night two cruise ships came in so we were awakened twice that night!!! I can't imagine any of the other hotels in the area being any better though. There are hotels right across the street from the harbor which I think have to hear the same noise. I believe it's just a consequence of staying in a city. The area of the hotel isn't particularly nice, but it isn't particulary ghetto either. If you walk up India Street like 2 blocks there are a lot of nice little shops and places to eat and drink. (It's Little Italy) You can pretty much walk everywhere you want to go or take a cab - Horton Plaza to the hotel was $4. The parking lot is strangely full. I assumed many construction workers park thier cars there because once they were gone the parking lot cleared up a bit. The lack of an elevator in the parking lot is annoying because the stairs look gross. My friend drove down to the lobby, we took out the luggage and then she drove back up to find parking somewhere. $7 a night for parking is not bad at all, I'm surprised this is even a complaint. We didn't even use the car while in San Diego. We walked to the Harbor and took the Old Town Trolley hop on hop off tour that takes you pretty much everywhere you want to go in the city as a tourist.", "Date": "March 31, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BEST WESTERN PLUS Bayside Inn", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d79902-Reviews-BEST_WESTERN_PLUS_Bayside_Inn-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$134 - $189*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">555 West Ash Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92101</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "79902", "ImgURL": "http://img.travel.rakuten.co.jp/share/HOTEL/130211/130211.jpg"}}

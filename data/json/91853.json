It is Best Western PLUS. Booked on BW\u2019s early for approx. $57/nite rate. We arrived very early and the hotel was full. We were told to come back closer to the 3pm check-in. We left and went exploring on the west side. Much to our surprise there is plenty to see at a very relaxing pace. We traveled a short distance to Red Canyon and the surrounding ranches. This should be on everyone\u2019s to-do list while staying in Las Vegas and if you have your own transportation. We did not actually go into the canyon itself but we will do so on another visit. We also checked out the gardens at Ethel M. Chocolate Factory. This provided a peaceful and relaxing stroll which is highly recommended. After driving most of the day and tired, we returned to the hotel earlier than the 3pm hour. You enter the hotel on the second floor. The registrar checked to see if our room was available and it was. Our room was reserved for physically challenged individuals as I am going through mobility issues at the current time. The room was well-suited for the needs of such, it was on the second floor. Please note that there are floors above and below accessible by stairs only. The room had a king bed with microwave and small refrigerator. The bathroom was well equipped. It took a try or two to get used to the shower which is sloped down and in but after the first morning one can get accustomed to how it works without getting much water on the floor! The room has a unique temperature control feature. You place your room key into the slot at the door and that give you the authorization to change the temperature in the room. This way when you leave the air con or the heat shuts off. It will come on again when you return and insert your key. Of course, if you have two keys, you could leave the one in the slot and go with just your one key, if you wanted to make sure the temperature in your room was comfortable upon your return. Complimentary breakfast each morning would either be bacon and eggs, hash browns or sausage and eggs biscuits and gravy, pastry, muffins, bread, waffles, fruit, 3 choices cold and 1 hot cereal, yogurt, tea, cocoa, and juices. You can watch TV in the breakfast room. It was never too crowded, we were always able to find a seat. The location is superb. If you didn\u2019t know you were at BW you would not enter this location. It sits far behind Outback Steakhouse and Burger King sharing a parking lot with a upscale business complex. It also sits across the street from an upscale gated community. It is relatively quiet inside and out. This was my first introduction to the Summerlin area of Las Vegas. For the first time, I felt truly relaxed in a bustling city. It was very refreshing to go in and come out into a place like this. Another plus \u2013 the back of your key card has discounts at different shops and restaurants. Each key is not the same so check before dining out. You may be in the same destination as your discount card! Our next visit to Las Vegas will definitely be here!", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Culver City, California, United States", "Title": "\u201cYay!\u201d", "Author": "Jennifer A", "ReviewID": "UR121038963", "Content": "This place was great.

Nice decor and staff and the room appeared clean. Breakfast was very decent for a \"continental,\" including limited fresh fruit, waffles, eggs, bacon, cereal.... hot coffee was always made early (a must for a traveler from the east coast time zone) but was very weak. The problem was the carpet. I laid my child down on his back to change his diaper. I noticed his feet were black! I looked at my bare feet, and they were black. I went through all manner of exclusion, but the carpet was SO FILTHY that it was leaching off simply by walking on it! Yech! The AC unit was quite loud. I remain pleased with the value we received, but disappointed in the cleanliness. The crib they gave us was very sturdy, safe and clean. It even came with a little hotel baby blanket. Very quiet, safe area of town. About 20 minutes to the strip depending on traffic. Good restaurants and grocery stores nearby Microwave and fridge were great! Fitness center is HOT, MUGGY, reeks of rubber floor smell.

Nice to be away from the hussle bussle of the strip and feel like I was in normal suburbia / shopping. (Do not consider staying here if you want to go to the strip ... too far via too much traffic... lots of other options closer to the strip if you want a non-casino hotel/motel.) Spacious room - mine larger than many - and on the top floor, the ceilings slope to 12 or 14' high at one end, adding to the feeling of spaciousness. Bed and bedding were really comfortable - slept like a log. Hallways never seemed to get vacuumed in the week I was there - little bits of stuff everywhere and carpets just looked like they needed a shampoo. My room was tidied nicely daily, but my white gym socks were black on the bottom after walking in the room stocking footed! Yuck. Internet worked well - high speed wireless G. Limited cable selection. Heard every sound coming from the adjacent room via the connecting door - even though both doors were closed and locked. Pretty basic continental breakfast. Have been at other HIExpresses that have some hot items - like toaster waffles, scrambled eggs and saussage or bacon. Pure continental here - carbos and liquids plus yoghurt (I can't eat dairy) and hardboiled eggs (pre-shelled ... like how fresh are these?). Small, but useful gym (with bottled water) and small but OK indoor pool, but didn't use the spa since it didn't feel hot enough to bother. Grocery store and a couple of restaurants in walking distance. Better restaurants (Iincluding a Roy's) and Whole Foods Market about a mile away on Charleston. Movie theaters about a mile away. At $100/night, it was a good deal, but I'm going to try the La Quinta 1 mile further west next time to see if its cleaner and has a better breakfast.", "Date": "May 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice Way Off Strip Property\u201d", "Author": "tonyraisins", "ReviewID": "UR4470561", "Content": "Holiday Inn Express - The Lakes - Las Vegas.

I live in Las Vegas and escaped here one evening while my wife was hosting a \"Girls night out\" baby shower in our home! The rates on the Strip and downtown were cost prohibitive that evening, so I opted for the tried and true Holiday Inn Express chain. Easy access to the bus on Sahara Avenue- which can take you directly to the Strip, and deposit you adjacent to the Sahara Hotel on Las Vegas Boulevard. I would say it's a 20 - 30 minute ride. Nice Restaurants nearby the hotel- walk across the street to Teddy's Greek Bistro for a great time including music, dancing and plate tossing-OPA! Free parking and all that.

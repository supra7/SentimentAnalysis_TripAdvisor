We thought it was hives (as he has itchy welts all over him) but after antihistamines proving to be ineffective he looked for other causes. It wasn't until our last night that we suspected bed bugs. We couldn't initially see anything in the bed / mattress, but when we looked the next morning we saw them!! We informed staff, Arthur was very apologetic but didn't know what to do/say except sorry. We were initially sent away without any offer for a refund / compensation. I went back (after other guests had left the reception area) to again express how angry we were, and that we potentially have to throw out all our possessions / luggage and / or pay for laundry for our entire bag's contents (we live in Australia) and won't be home for another 3 weeks.. Arthur by this time had called his manager to get approval to reimburse us our final nights stay. 5 nights for the price of 4 in a bed bug infested room..

It's nice that this location is only about a couple blocks away from Little Italy. It's also a very short walk to the trolley station. We like that there is free parking here. The rooms have a microwave, refrigerator, coffee maker and an in room safe (large enough to put a laptop in). Also there is a hairdryer and an ironing board and iron in the room. There's a 32\" LCD TV now in the room. (used to be one of those big analog tv's). Room is clean with a lot of drawer space and a desk. The only thing we don't like was how noisy the a/c heater unit was in the room. If you leave the a/c on all night, it was very noisy. It was very hard to sleep with the a/c on. The other thing you have to deal with is the noise for the nearby train tracks. It was noisy for us. It can get very hard to take a nap in the afternoon with the horns blowing from the train. The only good thing was that the first train went by about 6 am in the morning and the last train at night was around midnight. We got a non-smoking room but a lot of smokers would smoke just outside your door. So what happens when you open your door, the smoke just comes in. I wish the hotel would have designated smoking areas outside. All the doors are on the outside (exterior). Every night we would get 3 - 4 flyers for pizza. But we were warned about these business as they are unlicensed. Continental breakfast is just toast, pastries, cereal, instant oatmeal plus orange juice, milk and coffee. If you want a hot meal, there a Denny's and a Jack in the Box close by. What brings us back is the hotel's room rate is very affordable.

About 2 blocks from a trolley stop and a few more blocks to downtown San Diego. If you take the train to San Diego (which I love), Amtrak is 5-10 minutes away (1 trolley stop). If your travels involve only downtown San Diego, the Convention Center area, or the harbor, then you really don't need a car at all. Perfect for Comic-Con!! The downside: train tracks run behind the hotel, so if you're a light sleeper I would look elsewhere. The pool scene is OK, but nothing special. The WiFi is free but spotty (although the Comic-Con crowd probably didn't help bandwidth). And the complimentary breakfast sure isn't much to brag about, but hey it's free!

The property is in good condition. It's not a luxury hotel but the rooms are decent and I've never had any problems. The price is reasonable and I'm not expecting a 5-star property. On the downside, if you're staying on the weekend it can get a little noisy in the parking lot late at night (I'm not sure why - duh - but it just does). Also, the free breakfast is nothing to brag about, it's VERY basic. If you can't handle that, a Dennys is a 5 minute walk. There's also a steak house next to Dennys called Fat City that I've spent many an evening in, it's not cheap but they have good drinks and food.

I ended up staying four nights at about $100 each night (apparently a bargain.) Be aware (or beware!) of the TRAIN that runs DIRECTLY behind the hotel several times each day...and early in the morning. If you are a light sleeper this may bother you. I am a light sleeper but used earplugs and was fine. There is a Denny's just up the street north from the hotel, which was convenient. There is also a Jack-in-the-box fast food restaurant just a block or so south of the hotel. \"Little Italy\" is close by, and so is the \"Gaslamp Quarter\" as is Seaport Village...a nice marina area to walk around in, though I'd say none are really a short walk, and all are in opposite directions from the hotel, which is kind of in the middle of them. Overall however, this hotel/motel is in a prime spot, and cheaper than many others nearby such as the Holiday Inn, Hampton Inn, Embassy Suites etc. Also PARKING IS FREE, which is nearly unHEARD of in downtown San Diego!

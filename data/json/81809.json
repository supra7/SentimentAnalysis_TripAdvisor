We picked the Grosvenor because of the reasonable pricing for a larger unit with a kitchenette. The room had a lovely view over downtown and we were able to put the kitchen to good use for a quiet family dinner one night; that alone made the short trip well worth it. The Grosvenor is located near Powell, and the adjacent cable car line. It\u2019s close to both Chinatown and the Union Square areas, I would say it\u2019s walking distance to plenty of great sights, but the San Francisco hills redefine walking distance in my humble opinion. All of those things were great, but what really prompted us to write a review of the hotel was their outstanding staff. We had arranged for Tony, a Grosvenor staff supervisor, to pick us up from the airport. He was friendly, professional and on time despite our flight being delayed. Everyone else at the hotel was just as thoughtful and professional going out of their way to accommodate minor requests like extra towels or a blanket, to major inconveniences like helping us track down my missing wallet (left it in a cab). Truthfully, I ended up feeling worse about the level of concern and effort they put into tracking down the wallet on my behalf, than I did for having lost the thing in the first place. After what seemed like a few hundred phone calls the wallet was located, thank you Ryan! I eventually got it back, cash and all, so we give Yellow Cab a thumbs up too. By the time we left I really did feel like I had stayed with friends, as cliche as that sounds. My mom and I do a fair amount of traveling individually and between the two of us we can honestly say we\u2019ve never encountered a nicer group of people. My very sincere thanks again to Ryan, Victoria, Tony, Housekeeping and the rest of the Grosvenor staff, we hope to see you again soon.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cNice Spacious Pad near the top of Nobs Hill\u201d", "Author": "ReginaldSLin", "ReviewID": "UR127222205", "Content": "Stayed here 30 mar to 01 Apr 2012.

The price was good, much cheaper than the places we'd been staying on previous visits to San Francisco, but the place was a bit worn around the edges, though clean. Since it's a suite, there's plenty of room, but the bedroom area is a bit small for a king size bed; there was only a foot or two to get around it, which was difficult at night. The carpet in the living room had small holes in places. We didn't use the kitchen, but it was nice to have. The bathroom was tiny but had good lighting. The towels and bed linens were very tacky, poor quality. The pillows were like big rocks which I found almost impossible to use comfortably. There was no temperature control in the room, other than the window. We had a room on the same floor as the breakfast room, so it was a good thing we were getting up early anyway. The continental breakfast was decent, especially since it's rare in the city to have one included in the price of the room. Free internet and a nice flat screen TV in the living room were also a plus (though we didn't watch TV). We were shocked that there were quite a few steep stairs to get to the tiny lobby and then some more stairs to get to the level where the elevator was (and where our room was). When we mentioned the Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, they said there was an elevator up from street level. I guess it was around the corner on the ramp to the parking lot, but you really had to know about it in advance. That still wouldn't have gotten you to the lobby without stairs. We just took the stairs, but it was annoying when we had luggage. If you plan to use public transportation, which we did, be aware that this hotel is on Nob Hill. We walked from the Powell Street muni station. The hotel is way uphill from there (probably 8 blocks or so); the last 2 blocks are almost vertical. For old legs like ours, going downhill toward the station may even have been harder than uphill. We didn't see a bus that we could transfer to that came anywhere near it, but I suppose there might have been. Of course, the cable car does go straight up Powell (about a block from the hotel), but that's $5 a ride which seems excessive. (The cable car is something you should do once, just to say you have, but otherwise it's way overpriced.) In summary, I wasn't offended by the place, but not in love with it either.

One reason I chose this hotel was that it was one of the few in San Francisco that offered 2 queen beds (who knew!), in a good location for a reasonable price. As many other reviewers have stated, we weren't sure what to expect based on previous reviewers experiences. We arrived very late at night and found the young man at the front desk to be very pleasant and accommodating, even offering to help us carry our luggage and providing extra towels upon request. We were pleasantly surprised to find that our 12th floor room, while rather dated looking, was very clean and spacious, with ample room for our considerable luggage. The room had a dining table, a small sitting area and a kitchenette with a stove and fridge. We had a decent view of the city skyline, which was nice when it was not shrouded in fog. Beds are a bit uncomfortable, but not a huge deal. My only real complaint was that the walls are a bit on the thin side and we could hear the kids in the neighbouring room screaming and running around. Those guests who are not light sleepers should not find this a problem. The complimentary breakfast, while not deluxe, was fine. Bagels, toast, cereal and pastries, as well as bananas and apples were available. Coffee, tea and a variety of juices were also on hand. The room that the breakfast is served in is VERY tiny, with about 8 small tables, so it was very crowded each morning. Most people seemed to take their food and go back to their rooms. Again, this worked for our purposes and kept us going until noon. The ladies who served breakfast were quite friendly, although seemed a bit overwhelmed by the volume of guests bombarding them each morning. I would probably be as well! The Nob Hill location made an excellent base for exploring San Francisco. We loved being able to walk everywhere or hop on the Powell Street trolley (1/2 block away). One tip to future guests-unless you take the trolley early in the morning, you may not be able to get on it due to heavy volumes of people. However, it is only a 10-15 minute walk to Union Square, and a 25-30 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf. Walking to the Wharf takes you through Chinatown, which offers scenic views of the Bay Bridge. We found the area to be very safe at all times of the day, and were happy to find several convenience stores and a Walgreen's only blocks away for any last minute items needed.

As there was a conference in town, all hotels in SF had inflated prices so I booked this hotel purely with my budget in mind. The 20% tripadvisor discount was accepted without fuss at check-in and my bill reflected the revised room rate. As others have stated, the hotel is on top of Nob Hill and despite considering myself of a reasonable fitness the walk up from Union Square after a night of eating and drinking can be a challenge. That said, the walk does at least help burn a few calories..... The hotel itself was fine. Previous stops on our trip had included Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas and a Hyatt so we knew this would be a step down in luxury. We were not too disappointed however as the size of the room and the views made up for the older (in some places a little shabby) appearance. Everything was very clean though. No air con, but there was a fan in one of the cupboards as well as a safe and an ironing board. The self service launderette in the basement was handy for us, and cheap at approx $1.50 per wash. We checked out the breakfast room on the first morning but nothing looked too appetising to us so we got a coffee to go and never went back. It always looked pretty busy when we passed on subsequent days though so perhaps we were just a little picky. The Hotel parking was convenient with direct access from Pine Street. It is a little pricey at $35 a day but that seems to be the norm for SF. It was easy to get in and out and although the car park is small I never had difficulty getting a space. Driving around SF is a unique experience with the hills, fog, cable cars and one way systems but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad I had a car to do some exploring outside of the city. We hired bikes from Blazing Saddles just a few blocks away (down the hill) on Mason and cycled across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito, and then on to Tiburon which I would recommend. The hotel had a 'Bay Area Guide' magazine with a $5 discount for this. I would consider this hotel if going back to SF, but only if the higher class hotels are out of my price range.", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frederikssund, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, rusty place\u201d", "Author": "marloth2000", "ReviewID": "UR78886018", "Content": "Very rusty place with an extremely friendly staff 24/7.

This is a relatively inexpensive, good-value hotel that is NOT unclean but is not new in these features. We were fortunate enough to get a 1 bedroom suite on the 17th floor.

We just didn't want to eat out for 7 whole days. The front staff was always incredibly responsive and attentive. The rooms were spacious; there was a hall way, a smallish but sufficient bathroom, a full king bedroom, and a large livingroom with a couch that turned into a bed, an eat-in dining area, and a one-wall kitchen with a shoulder-high refrigerator, microwave, sink and small stove. Great value and, at 3 blocks from Chinatown, Union Square and all kinds of public transportation - a great location! Need to be a bit of a hill-climber! The other thing I want to mention is about the city of San Francisco itself. It has come upon hard times and it shows. The cable car conductors were randomly surly and the bartender at the Buena Vista Cafe was barely civil - both unheard of in times past - and the local Walgreens put $ 6.99 cans of coffee behind glass because of the frequent robberies (the grab-and-run kind). Bring a money belt (no purses for women) and be prepared for a bit of an edge. One of our best experiences was at the Cigar Bar & Grill on Montgomery; open, airy courtyard; great food; my husband enjoyed a wonderful cigar in the deep leather chairs. And not too expensive.

It is on the Powell cable car line. The rooms are older but kept clean. I think it used to be an apartment building that they turned into a hotel. Parking is tight, they do have a garage but you have to get there early to get a spot. I think our room came with parking so I don't remember what their fee was. You need a code to get into the garage, so checking in is tough since you have to find street parking for your car first, then check in, then move your car. We had to circle the block to get back around to the garage gate. But we didn't take the car out again, we walked everywhere. The room is older furnishings but they are in decent condition.

You step through a large window and you have a private balcony. We had an amazing view of the financial district, union square, and the bay. My only issue was that the bed is not that comfortable.

The room was huge but its well worn. The other problem was the windows were single pane so there was tonnes of noise from the traffic early every morning. We could never sleep in as a result. We moved here after a one night stay at the Courtyard Marriott (on 2nd Street) and it was a huge downgrade! Staff - Unattentive, Rude, unhelpful. The staff at front desk changed often and the service faltered as a result. One got the impression that most of them were part-timers just doing this on the side and not thrilled about it either. Smells - this is a hotel that mainly does long-term rentals so people actually do cook in their units and there are some very strong and unpleasant odors as a result. If you're sensitive to smells then be forewarned. Breakfast - they have a lady serving you the pastries and jams from behind a counter. Unless you tip her a few bucks be prepared for surly service. I asked for some extra jam and she refused saying I had enough!!! I complained to the front desk (Antonio) and he actually laughed and basically told me tough luck. I was so flabbergasted I didn't know what to do. So its not a complimentary breakfast .... its a breakfast where they tell you what and how much you can eat. I didn't realise one bagel, one muffin and 3 small packets of jam was considered over-eating! I've never experienced this in over 27 years of travelling! Including to eastern bloc countries! Ridiculous really. The other thing I found particularly unprofessional was the manager and other staff members walking in during breakfast and helping themselves to the food at will. Bottomline: Its cheap but theres a good reason why its cheap (decor, service, street noise). If they could charge more they would ... but for what they offer they cannot. I would not stay here again. If you are well-travelled and discerning (i.e. do not consider a HoJo or Days Inn quality accomodation) you would do well to heed my advice and stay away.

It wasn't the best neighborhood if you're a tourist, but we were right by a cable car line, so we just got 3-day public transportation passes and hopped on and off freely. There was a computer in the lobby and we were able to print out some of our trip info. The kitchen cabinets even had 4 wine glasses so we were able to sit on the balcony and enjoy our Sonoma wines.

It was also freeeezing out and the room was always nice,warm and toasty. Good tv reception. We also had a nice big balcony but I would def think twice about letting kids out there..we were pretty high up (level 14) and it didn't feel all that well enclosed. Also probably got hit about 10 times by the curtain pulling rod thingy on the way back in... The beds were super comfy too. Location wise it just can't be beat. grocery store for basics on the corner of powell and we ate at uncle vito's pizza a couple of times which was really awesome pizza and only a block away...you can get delivery to the hotel too.Breakfast was provided downstairs free of charge...pretty standard but hey,it's free. The cable car's to fishermans wharf tend to be packed especially on weekends so sometimes it's worth walking down to get on at the union square turnaround just to make sure you get on.Saw alot of people trying to get on to no avail. My only one word of warning would be it's called Nob Hill for a reason. If hills are tricky for you look elsewhere cause it is a pretty decent almost vertical at some points hike back from Union Square...tonga room at the fairmont is only a block away too (a very steep one block!)...def don't think twice about booking the grosvenor.

We all stayed in a corner, one bedroom suite (separate room with 2 queen beds and living room with a sleeper couch). You can tell that the building is older, so there is wear and tear (e.g., a small rip in the couch cushion and trim along bedroom floor coming off the wall). However, the structure itself is very sturdy. I believe that the place was originally a condo (there are currently some residents who still reside there), so the walls are thick and we never heard our neighbors (although I could hear from the hallway that they had a young and loud child). Given the bedroom, the dining area and the living room, we had plenty of space for the 5 of us. The rooms also have a small kitchen with full size refrigerator, small stove, sink, toaster, and other necessary kitchenware. We were in a corner suite in the 13th floor and our views were fabulous (we had windows on both sides). It was great to see the fog rolling in and out of the city. Overall, the service was pretty good. Front desk staff was extremely polite and helpful, on the phone and in person. They were very helpful regarding sites and places to visit, making sure we had extra towels/pillows, and allowed us to check out late (2pm rather than noon). They were very accommodating: I had a phone meeting at a time when everyone else in my party was napping so they opened the breakfast room for me to use. Housekeeping staff was o.k.; I definitely didn't get the same friendly vibe and they were not as responsive. The location was great. Very safe (Nob Hill is considered one of the high ends of town). One block from both the Powell and California cable lines, about 3 blocks from Chinatown, and two blocks from the Grace Cathedral and a great little park. The park has a playground and is the place where local Nob Hill residents take their dogs to play. We took our 5yo to this park a lot to burn off energy and watch the antics of the dogs playing with each other. As other reviewers have noted, it is on Nob 'Hill', so you get a great view, but even if you take the trolley, you will have at least one block of an uphill hike. Given how much we ate during the vacation, this wasn't a bad thing for us. Speaking of places to eat, other than Chinatown, we didn't find too many places really close by (although you can easy access them by cable car). The exception is the Nob Hill Cafe which is about 3-4 blocks and has great Italian food. The hotel offers a continental breakfast, with juices, cereals, bagels, and fresh pastries every morning. The pastry person will load up your tray with goodies for you to take back to you room if you don't want to sit in the breakfast room. There is also a laundry room in the basement with 5-6 washers and dryers. There is a gated parking area behind the hotel isolated from the street. It wasn't cheap to park, but you can enter and leave as much as you want. In addition to a computer terminal in the very small info room by the front desk, there is free wireless in the rooms. Compared to other places that we have stayed at in SF and given all the amenities, we got a pretty good deal. I did make reservations way in advance and I did it directly from their website (they offered an online rebate for multiple nights so we saved $20-25/per night). For reservations not made in advance, I heard a front desk person telling another potential customer to check the online travel websites for just-in-time deals that would be better than booking with the hotel directly. What I liked most about the hotel is how attentive they were to our needs as a family (given the location, kitchen/refrigerator, breakfast, and laundry). It was a very comfortable and convenient place to stay. The thing that they could improve on is fixing up and updating the interior a bit, but for us, this wasn't a big deal at all.", "Date": "May 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cCouldn't have asked for more\u201d", "Author": "xGrendelx", "ReviewID": "UR29732600", "Content": "This hotel is seriously awesome.

The cable cars run one block from the hotel and they take you either directly into Fisherman's Wharf or the other way into Union Square, the Tenderloin/Civic Center, and Market St. Chinatown, North Beach, and the Financial District are all within walking distance. If you want a further trek, Russian Hill is about 15-20 blocks north. It's a nice walk though (I did it many times). And many cabs circulate this area, so it's easy to flag one down and be driven to other parts of the city. If location is your main thing, like mine was, this hotel is perfect.

The cable car line was nearby which was what swayed our decision to rent here, but to get to the tourist attractions by the warf (Alcatraz, Pier 39, double decker bus tour, bike rentals, etc) we had to take the cable cars every day. This was fine going TO the wharf, but coming home meant we had to wait in long lines for the cable car. We chose Nob Hill to be centrally located, but most of our transportation ended up being on the streetcars and busses which run along the Embarcadero so we had the daily trek to the wharf by cable car to catch them. Grosvenor is on Nob Hill, and it is a BIG HILL! If you have baby strollers or moblility issues, this is not the place for you. After a long day of touring, it was not pleasant to have to wait 30 minutes for a cable car then hike uphill a couple blocks from the cable car to the hotel.

The apartment was absolutely huge! We had much more space than we could have possibly needed, but that was a good thing. We were on the 5th floor which didn't have much by way of views but aparently the 19th floor has fantastic sweeping views of the city. LOCATION The hotel is located on Pine Street atop Nob Hill. It is about 2 blocks downhill to union square. Getting back up the hill is a bit of an effort. We are quite young and fit and occasionally we would be puffed getting up the hill. So if you are unfit or handicapped, the location may not be the best for you. We walked to fisherman's wharf one day which took us about 40 mins at a brisk pace. We also walked to Coit Tower - that took about 40 minutes also. ROOMS As I said above, we stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment. It had plenty of closet space to hand clothes and store other items. The bedroom was a separate room which was quite large. The bed was king size, however the matress was not firm at all and was quite uncomfortable. The linen was clean, but worn. The sheets were very thin as was the blanket. The quilt also was very worn. I must emphasise however that all linen was clean. There is also a TV in the bedroom. There is a large living room with TV, TV cabinet, 3 seat sofa which folded out to a sofa bed, an arm chair, coffee table, phone table/desk, round glass table with four chairs, an additional 2 decorative chairs. The kitchenette was useful. Only issue we had was with the oven which did not get very hot. After two hours of it being on, it was still not hot enough to cook our christmas roast. To give an example, I had boiled potatoes and then put them in the oven to roast - after 2 hours in the oven they still had not roasted. We ended up having an awful christmas lunch because of that oven! The microwave did a better job of the roast veggies. Also, there were no oven trays - so the oven was practically useless! We had to buy disposable foil oven trays so that we could use the oven. The bathroom is very clean and has everything you need. Toiletries were filled up every day by housekeeping. The bathroom also has a large storage cupboard. It is a little bit pokey and small, but other than that, nothing wrong with it. HEATING/COOLING The room tended to get quite cold and there was no heater. There was an internal themostat thingo, but you couldnt turn it up. It got quite cold in the room. There was no airconditioner too, so this may also be a problem in summer. OTHER The room had an electronic safe which was very useful. Breakfast is complementary and is served daily in a room on the first floor. There is a coffee machine, juice dispenser (orange and guava were served), cereal, pastries and bagels. There were three sets of tables and chairs in the room, however you were able to take a tray up to your room if you didn't want to eat it in the room. There is a computer and printer just off from the reception. This was quite reliable and quick. There are several washing machines and dryers on the ground floor. These are coin operated. We used these twice and found them very new and reliable. There is also a vending machine on this level. Overall, the hotel is very good value for money and one of the only hotels in the city with kitchen facilities. This is the primary reason we picked the hotel since we were staying over christmas. If i went back to san fran i would probably stay closer to union square, but i would consider staying at Grosvenor Suites again. Great value for money and ideal if you have a family since you are able to keep costs down by cooking your own food. There is a small deli on the corner of the block to get groceries from, but it doesnt have a big range. We went to a safeway near Japan town, but we had to catch a taxi back (about 5 minute drive) to the hotel. I would not recommend this hotel if you are handicapped or cannot walk very far.

A complimentary continental breakfast is available each morning and provides a good selection of cereals, breads, pastries, coffee and teas. The hotel is located at the corner of Pine and Mason Streets just below the top of Nob Hill. This is an excellent location for getting down to Union Square and Market Street and there is a cable car stop less than a block away at the corner of Pine and Powell Streets. You can also catch the cable car from here to the Fisherman's Wharf area. There are also plenty of cafes and good restaurants within a short walk of the hotel.

Kitchens have a full size fridge. The kitchen was very poorly equipped with only one very large saucepan and fry pan - and only a few utensils so any serious meal preparation was not practical. The weather was mild during my stay which was fortunate as there was NO airconditioning and the baseboard heating looked as though it probably didnt function. There was a pedestal fan in the hall cupboard. Staff were very helpful and friendly. I didnt partake of the continental breakfast so cant comment. The basement has a row of new & clean commercial washing and drying machines. Very reasonable rates for using these machines. There are also snack vending machines down there The other advantage is that it has plenty of off street PARKING. $35,00 per day but worth it in this city where parking is very difficult in most areas.

I stayed at the Grosvenor Suites downtown. It is centrally located near Union Square, Chinatown, and the Cable Cars. I recommend taking a taxi or cable car (if you don't have luggage) to get to the hotel since the walk up Powell is steep. Other than that, check-in went smooth. The guy who checked me in was very nice and made sure to book me a room with a view. I got a corner room on the eighth floor with a fantastic view. The room itself was very spacious. There is no air conditioning or heat in the room. It was hot when I arrived, so I opened the sliding glass door. They also have a tall fan in the closet that I used to cool things down. The bed was quite comfortable since I slept very well. It was not very noisy outside unless you open your sliding glass door. But once it was shut, it kept out most of the noise. I mostly heard a few car horns, some sirens, and the ding of the cable car, but it did not wake me up in the middle of the night. The furniture was a bit dated, but decent. The kitchen and bathroom had granite countertops. A few dishes, silverware, and pots and pans were provided, but I only used a plate and knife, which I made sure to wash. The stove/oven was outdated, but I made good use of the oven and it worked well. The bathroom was small, but it served its purpose. I did not like that there was not much counter space in the bathroom and the shower head is pretty low if you are tall. But it worked. The tv was another complaint. Some channels did not show up in the lineup and I had to manually punch those channels into the remote. A few channels were not very clear. The remote itself did not have an on button, only an off button, which I found odd. I had to get up to turn on the tv. Continental breakfast was decent. Nothing fancy. Just juices, coffee, bagels, cereal, etc. A computer is provided for your use, as well as an ATM machine, a laundry room, and snack/drink/ice machines. I did not like going down to the level where the snack machines were. Seemed a bit dark, like in a basement and I felt a little uncomfortable down there. The laundry room is also located on that level. Other than a few minor issues, I would stay here again.

Our primary concerns for this trip was that the hotel be cheap and spacious with a safe location close to the action and that is exactly what we got. The bonus was that the views from the 14th floor suite were brilliant , our son didnt close the curtains so he could fall asleep looking at beautiful S F twinkling below and listening to the Cable cars bells.... a truly unique experience we couldnt have had in lots of other nicer , pricey hotels. Given that bonus, and that it full filled our needs I feel bad about saying anything negative about the place , but we have to be honest on these reviews so that others can benefit from the comments and make an informed decision... so here goes. I found the place a bit seedy to be honest with some worrying safety issues. I expected dated and that was not a problem for me, older worn furniture was what I expected , but the level of maintaninence was what let the place down badly. The paintwork was chipped , walls marked, stained carpets, and a general sad air of disrepair prevailed about the place, some of it went beyond cosmetic being serious safety issues. The windows are single glazed with aluminium frames that actually opened which is needed as the place got really hot and no air con. Our smaller opening windows on the 14th floor were broken and just about hanging in there, god help anyone below when they eventually do break and the large shards fall 14 floors down. The smell in the corridors was not good, mainly from cooking odours I think, however our corner suite got the sun more or less all day and this warmed up the vinyl coating on the curtain linings and gave off a horrible toxic plastic smell that made me feel ill. The breakfast was a grab and go affair really as there was not enough seating to stay , so I just took the mugs from the room down and loaded upa a tray with coffee, juice and muffins. You have to stand and tell the lady behind the pastry counter what you want, she was very surly, never smiled and you felt like she begrudged you every item you took, not good. Staff on the front desk were Ok , some better than others.but at least it was always manned and they helped with taxis and directions with efficiency. Location not good if you have mobility issues , but then San Francisco is very hilly so I think you have to accept that and the walk down to Union Sq was easy as it was all downhill ad took about 6 mins. Just one thing I wish I had known , you can buy an all day pass on the Cable cars for $11 dollars. We bought $5 single tickets not realising , and I think this would be a fun thing to do staying at the Grosvenor as you could have a pretty good sighseeing tour of the city just using the CC's from this location. Best experience , Alcatraz night tour and wondering aroound the Hyde pier and along the beach at Aqua Park on a sunny afternoon, then over to the Chocolate place at Ghiradelli Square for an Ice cream sundae.

We had the windows open every night. When we told the front desk, he just shrugged at me. I left a note for housekeeping and it was off when we got back in the late afternoon, but back on after we got back from dinner. The location is great...downhill to Union Square, but you can jump on a cable car to get back. We took several cabs, which were way cheaper than the 5 of us going by cable car. ($5 each one way) We did get a couple of complimentary rides on the CC's. I booked online and got a total of $70 off for an online rebate for the room.

It costs about $8+ for a taxi from the Wharf and about $40-45 to the airport. You are 5 minutes away from Sears (for breakfast, even during lunch) and the shopping at Union Sq. and about the same from Chinatown. The wharf is better reached via Cable Car, trolley (from Powell/Market), taxi or bus. It is very doable (no hills) by walking to Chinatown, then through little Italy, but can be long.

And then there are some things that are strictly 1 star: chipped paint on window sills that have been repaired with mismatched paint; a crack in the window; tears in the linings of drapes; grimy door and window jambs; piled on grease on the exhaust fan in the kitchenette (so much that I wouldn't use the rangetop); a really suspect bedspread; broken heating covers.

The coffee was standard-issue, but there was a nice selection of juice. The server who oversees the breakfast didn't even mind that we loaded up on goodies and took it to our room.

As a woman, I didn't feel quite safe going into some strange room, especially after observing the front staff just handing out keys to anyone who asked. I understand that there are times when things will need repair. However, I feel the hotel management did a horrible job handling the problem. They could have moved people to a different hotel the night of the repairs. I felt they were dishonest in not disclosing the possibility of having no water for over 14 hours. In addition, the front staff seemed absolutely overwhelmed and uninformed about what was happening. Giving people a gallon of water and telling them to use the bathroom in the lobby area is ridiculous.", "Date": "November 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value during convention season\u201d", "Author": "PhineasHiggenbottom", "ReviewID": "UR10553709", "Content": "Remind me to never again visit San Francisco during convention season. Booked three months in advance at hotel website. They have a \"rebate\" program for such reservations ($20 first night, $25 each additional night), and it was applied without hassle (I didn't have to even mention it) at check in. We were given a huge two queen, one sofabed room on the sixth floor facing the back of the Mark Hopkins. We asked for a higher room, but none were available (again, the perils of visiting during convention season). The room was worn, though very clean (no signs of bed bugs). The room was noisy. Aside from traffic (windows are single-paned), there was this strange, low-frequency moan/rumble from time to time whose source we were unable to determine. There was so much closet space that it made no sense (not a complaint). Bathroom was small, but manageable. The in-room safe was large enough to hold my 14.1\" 4:3 aspect laptop with plenty of depth to hold other things. I'm not sure a 15\" would fit, and anything larger than 15\" most certainly will not fit. The hotel offers no other secure storage. The first night we noticed the shower head was broken. We reported it to the front desk the next morning and was told it would fixed while we were out. When we returned it that afternoon had not been fixed, and at that point the front desk had maintenance fix it ASAP. Housekeeping was a bit of a mystery. Our room was able to hold at least five adults, but they only gave us two sets of towels per day. We were able to get more as needed, but that should not have been necessary. The breakfast was fine. The bagels, donuts and pastries appeared to have been delivered fresh each morning by a local bakery. Apples were available every morning, but that was it if you're not partial to an entire starch and sugar breakfast. Don't be intimidated by the server. She gave us anything we asked for and never scoffed at additional requests. The coffee was OK. The location was better than I expected. It is one block steep downhill on Mason from the California cable car line, and one block slightly uphill from the Powell lines. We were able to quickly get wherever we wanted using public transportation taking the Powell lines down to Union Square. We had no issues with panhandlers (aggressive or otherwise) near the hotel. The one downside to the location was it largely prevents you from using public transportation to get to or from the airport. The cable car lines don't allow luggage (you may be able to get away with a carry-on on a lightly-loaded car), and the steep uphill climb is murderous (though that didn't stop the five-member Australian family I ran into waiting for a downhill Powell car, so it is possible). We took a cab from San Francisco International Airport and the total was about $39 not including tip. The hotel can also schedule a door-to-door shuttle (not cost effective in our situation). Parking at the hotel was a very tight squeeze. We parked a rental car there for one night and ended up double parking as the car was wider than all outside. There was at least one other parking level with what looked like larger spaces, but I didn't see how I could get our colossal rental in there without damaging it. Street parking was available, but after seeing many touching bumpers and otherwise sandwiched cars I decided against it. There is very cheap weekend parking from Saturday evening through Sunday night at the Sutter Stockton garage (about a four-block walk). The staff, especially Tony (mornings) and Cena (evenings), were always professional and pleasant and were never at a loss for restaurant recommendations.

As others have commented, though the property bills itself as \"luxury accomodations\" it really is a value-priced apartment/hotel. The hotel's website photos do an accurate job of depicting the decor/style of the hotel. We would definitely recommend this hotel and offer the following comments: What we liked: - Huge corner suite on the 18th floor with panoramic views of the city . . . unlike other major cities, tall buildings did not seem to be as abundant in San Francisco so the views from (higher floors) at this hotel are unique and, unobstructed - Windows that opened. When booking, my major concern was around the lack of air conditioning. This was not an issue as all the windows opened and we were able to get wonderful cross breezes that quickly cooled down the room. - Clean, quiet, suite with separate bedroom, spacious walk-in closets, full living & dining room and small, spotlessly clean functional kitchenette. - very comfortable bed - good size bathroom with adequate counter/storage space - friendly, helpful staff - laundry facilities on-site A few comments about this location in San Francisco: - at the top of a very steep hill as others have mentioned. Though it is \"do-able\", it is definitely a challenge after a long day of sight-seeing! - cable cars were often very, very full (even at 7:30am!) so be prepared to let a few pass before you are able to jump aboard. - taxis in the city seemed few and far between, more so than any other major city we've visited. Not sure if this is typical but it was definitely our experience. On average, we had to wait approx 20mins to get taxis (outside hotel and other areas such as Union Square, North Beach) Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and, wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to others.

Our stay started with finding roaches in the kitchenette of our one-bedroom suite. Staff was very accomodating and moved us immediately, however only a junior suite was available. It was not much smaller and we actually liked the layout better! And no roaches! The room was clean, and had most everything we needed with three small kids. The bathroom was in good enough shape for me to feel comfortable letting the kids use the tub for baths. There was an ironing board & iron in the closet, which came in handy when we got ready for the wedding we were attending. The kitchenette had a sink, stove, refrigerator, and some dishes. I'd recommend bringing a roll of paper towels, and some plastic utensils and paper plates. We found the free breakfast to be hit & miss. Saturday morning my husband went down around 8:30 am and it was slim pickings! But on Sunday I went down at 7:30 and loaded up a tray for the family with muffins, donuts, a toasted bagel & cream cheese, apples, and fruit loops. I also got hot coffee, and apple juice for the kids. BIG WARNING FOR PARENTS: **The rooms have windows that swing open and do not have screens or locks**. We were on the 19th (top) floor and were scared to death that our 2- and 4-year old kids (who love to climb!) would pop open a window and fall out. SCARY!!! We called the front desk to ask about a lock and were told that all the windows in the hotel were like that, and they didn't have locks. One time my 4-year-old disappeared for a moment and my husband and I found him lying on the window sill behind the curtain. We couldn't relax at all and were constantly watching the kids to keep them away from the windows (of course they were super interested in looking out the windows at the tall buildings and ocean!!) and off the window sills.

The Grosvenor Suites came out of a Craig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s List search and was booked without inspection. It turned out to be a great choice! The studio apartment we booked was roomy and comfortable, with plenty of space for two people to lounge, read and watch cable TV without crowding each other. We had a good view of the Union Square area, the Sir Francis Drake Hotel with its revolving star, and the bay in the distance. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was Oriental with Chinese-style furniture, brocaded bedspreads and Japanese screens on the wall. While not upscale, the furnishings were comfortable and stylish. The kitchenette fit a full apartment size refrigerator, stove with oven, plenty of cabinets fully stocked with dishes, pots and pans, coffee maker, toaster and flatware into a space the size of an average closet. We cooked about three times a week and had plenty of utensils. The rest of the suite contained a small bathroom and two large walk-in closets. One of the features provided by the hotel is a daily complimentary continental breakfast, served from 5:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. weekdays and to 11:00 a.m. on weekends. The staff served the bagels, Danish pastries, scones, donuts and muffins with butter, cream cheese and jelly, as requested. The guests helped themselves to juice, coffee and tea to eat either in the breakfast room or take to your own room. The Breakfast was good and very convenient but we did miss fresh fruit and would like to see it added to the menu.

We were so relieved to come here! It was lovely, the front desk staff were wonderful, the bell staff came to our taxi and took our luggage to our room. The room was huge and very clean, with wonderful views. My one complaint would be that it was just one room - with 3 small children we were hoping for two rooms (ie bedroom and separate living area), which we expected from a \"suite\". I would called this a studio rather than a suite. It was enormous though with a full kitchen cleverly hidden by folding doors. There were two huge walk-in closets (which could be knocked through and made into a bedroom IMO) and a very nice bathroom. There were two double beds in the room and a nice sofa, TV unit and dining table. Even so there was lots of space left. The breakfast was fine though not brilliant. It was mostly pastries etc given out by a member of staff one at a time - you had to ask. We discovered the nicer items were hidden behind the counter and those \"in the know\" asked for them! Very odd. Don't know why it couldn't be self-service - I guess people feel guilty having to ask so eat less! The drinks were self-service though, and there were TVs in the breakfast room, which was an ordinary room basically - but they are so big that the size was adequate. There is a computer next to front desk which guests can use - though it was monopolised by teenagers on instant messenger! Plus there is a guest laundry, though I wouldn't recommend going there alone late at night as it was rather scary - its in a garage-type area. The location of the hotel is great - half a block from a cable car stop (if you can get on one - they were always full when we were there so we had to walk into town and get a streetcar), but its not far and downhill. Later in the day its easier to get a cable car and avoid the hills. We spent most of our time in Fisherman's Wharf, which we much preferred to downtown San Francisco. If we'd have known we'd have found a hotel there!

The management was unable to control the situation, but they did give us a 50% refund for that night. The other 3 nights were nice and quiet. 2) Room keys were prematurely deactivated the last morning of our stay, before we checked out. 3) Continental breakfast was very lightweight. The small sweet rolls were dispensed by an attendant one at a time. Some of the favorites like cheese danishes were hidden behind the counter and had to be asked for specifically. We just happened to notice that when the person after us asked for one. 4) Short on washcloths. We paid for 4 people in our room but only had 2 fresh washcloths every day. 5) No restaurant onsite.

Good points - Size - the corner suite gives you a very ample living area (TV, couch, table/chairs), kitchen area (oven, microwave, fridge/freezer, sink, cupboards, uctlery, cooking utensils, etc); nice size bedroom (another TV, large wardrobes/drawers), large walk-in closet in the hallway area, and a bathroom. Views - we had excellent views over the city Price - the price was well worth it - in fact much cheaper than many regular hotels and a lot more space. Kitchen - as a vegan I prefer having the option to cook my own food. The kitchen and equipment were clean and adequate, and Wholefoods Market is easily accessible (walk up a block to California, get the cable car to the last stop) Bad points - (most of these have already been mentioned in reviews here) Steep walk from Powell/Union Sqaure area, however plenty of other hotels have this problem, and if you're not keen on hotels then San Francsico isn't really the city for you anyway! You can always get the cable car up from Powell and get off near Pine. Bathroom size - This isn't really a bad point in my opinion - yes, the bathroom is certainly small, but who cares with all that living space? It has a bath/shower/sink/toilet which is all you need.. ----- Other than that I thought this was great value for money. Granted, it's not luxury hotel and it lacks the attention to detail that, say, the Orchard Hotel would give you, but then you're not paying that kind of price anyway.

Anyway, no matter, we figured since the last time we were in town (a week prior) the night had been fairly cool and there was no need for A/C.

Also, the fridge and microwave come in very handy for a baby still on formula. There are also dishes and a small stove with oven which is great for an extended stay or families. The reason I titled this review hit or miss is because if we had have been there in cooler weather and not needed A/C or a screen on the patio door or if we were in a room without the bathroom problems we would've rated this place Excellent, but given the circumstances we weren't pleased at all!", "Date": "September 6, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Syracuse, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat value\u201d", "Author": "SenexSyracuse_NY", "ReviewID": "UR2512433", "Content": "Spent five nights at theGrosvenor in May, 04.

The staff were very helpful and they went out of their way to make our visit comfortable. I was traveling with my entire family including my 9 month old infant. The room was great because it had a kitchen and a separate bedroom which made it so much easier with my daughter. The room was comfortable and clean at an excellent price. You can't beat the location of the hotel. It was very centrally located to everything. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone especially those who are traveling with children.", "Date": "September 1, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Grosvenor Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d81809-Reviews-Grosvenor_Suites-San_Francisco_California.html", "Price": "$128 - $467*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">899 Pine Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Francisco</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94108</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "81809", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/ee/61/e3/grosvenor-suites.jpg"}}

When the tide was up, you could see surfers riding waves right by your room as you sat in the living room. The sound and feel of the waves crashing beneath you are just the coolest most relaxing thing ever. When I do return, I will want that same cottage. A&B are the 2 on the end, but you get more privacy from the public pier on the end. Another great feature is your car is parked right alongside your cottage (easy for loading/unloading!)

This week, we stayed in cottage # 8 having taken advance of an off-season rate of $175.00 per night. There is no place like it \u2013 the cottages sit over the ocean, you hear the sound of the surf (what a pleasant way to go to sleep) and have a nice outside space with a table, four chairs, umbrella and two lounge chairs, overlooking the beach. The bed is comfortable, but I did not like the pillows so if you are driving in, you may want to bring a pillow you like. The views from your cottage or motel room are fantastic, but if you stay in one of the motel rooms, consider bringing ear plugs to cope with the noise level from the boardwalk, especially on summer weekends. Each cottage has a basic kitchen (refrigerator, oven with stove top and microwave \u2013 it didn\u2019t have a revolving tray) and is stocked with Ikea glasses, plates, flatware, cooking utensils, pots and pans, off-brand toaster and coffee maker (my wife doesn\u2019t like the coffee it makes). You have a parking space too (no extra charge). Kono\u2019s (great breakfast place) is just outside the gate to the Crystal Pier and there is a CVS and Ralph\u2019s grocery store within walking distance. You are just steps away from the beach and Mission bay. If you want modern appliances, flat-screen TVs or fancy bathrooms with rain showers or tubs, this is not the place for you. The cottages are showing their age \u2013 the plumbing fixtures were basic to begin with and now need to be replaced. For example, the shower head in # 8 could not be adjusted because of accumulated hard-water deposits and it was very difficult to adjust the temperature of the water. Also, it is apparent that the wrong shower stall was installed in # 8 (it should have been reversed to place the molded seat at the end opposite the shower head). There are no drawers in the bathroom vanity, but fortunately there is a dresser in the bedroom where you can put your cosmetics, etc. The TV in # 8 is a TV/DVD player combo unit that is no more than 19 inches and definitely not HD. While free wifi is offered, reception is problematic \u2013 neither of our iPad2\u2019s could connect, but my laptop could. Still a wonderful place to stay, but don\u2019t except luxurious appointments even though in-season rates are premium prices, just basic beach appointments and be sure to pet the pier dog.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cQuaint with an ocean lullaby everynight!\u201d", "Author": "MiscMel", "ReviewID": "UR125458420", "Content": "I will definitely stay here again!

Next time, I'd reserve a cottage further west\u201d", "Author": "SanDiegoPhil", "ReviewID": "UR122729965", "Content": "Very nice cottages, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in early December. You hear the waves crashing both from your private deck as well as from the interior of the cottage. The cottage had a wall furnace that quickly heated the place at night, plenty of windows, a private parking space right in front of the cottage. The LARGE semi-private deck came with a table with seating for 4, plus 2 chaise lounges (cushions for the outdoor seating are kept inside the cabin in the closet); by semi-private I mean this --> it is a very large deck that is solely for your own personal use, and it has a low fence around it, but you can see the deck of the guest next to you (very much like having a balcony in a hotel --- it is private, but you can see your neighbors if they are on their balcony). How to turn a 4star experience into a 5star experience: If I had to do it over again, I would reserve a room as far west on the pier as possible (i.e. as far away from the boardwalk as possible). We were in room 11, and although we loved the room, it had two downsides with not being very far west: a) late at night we would occasionally hear loud/drunk people walking along the boardwalk; Being further west would have alleviated this problem by not only being further from the boardwalk, but also the wave crashes would have been louder further west, thus muffling boardwalk noise even more. b) the cottage would shimmy, like a mild earthquake, whenever guests would drive their car past our cottage when driving to/fro their cottages. Some checked out at 6am, while others drove back from a late night out at 2:30am .... being a light sleeper caused me to wake up several times from the shimmying of the cottage; Had we been in a cabin further west, less cars would have passed by our cottage, and thus we gather we would have experienced less shimmying. Reserve many months in advance (they book up quickly) Their WiFi is spotty and slow at best. It was so bad that we ended up turning off our WiFi and instead relied on our 4G carrier's connection. Each cottage has a single parking space in front of it (you get a permit for 1 specific vehicle -- you are NOT allowed to change out vehicles there during your stay).

There were some aesthetics that needed attention on the roof of our patio and in the bathroom and of course, rust is just part of being on the ocean, so you will see fixtures and appliances suffering from the elements. The unit was very clean and it was great to have a fridge, microwave and stove. Dishes, pots and pans, utensils, and wine glasses were even provided. We were there on a rainy night and the there were a few drops of rain coming in here and there, but nothing troubling. It would have been nice to have some rugs in the unit at the front door and slider as we came in and out with wet shoes and clothing. The last day we stayed the clouds cleared and the weather was beautiful and sitting out on the patio was quite peaceful. The area is full of bars and younger people - it would be great if you plan to go out and party withing walking distance. I am glad we went, but if I had not purchased a groupon for this property, I woud have been disappointed paying the 250-300 a night. I was not impressed with the area - it reminded me of newport beach or santa monica - I much prefer the central coast. Front desk staff were cordial, but not exactly warm and inviting. Don't expect much privacy in the numbered units as the patios all open on to eachother and you can see your neighbors...and so many people walking on the pier asking about the units and peering in can be obstrusive.

At check out, they asked if we wanted to reserve for the following year. We tried to get something earlier to avoid the overcast weather. No chance. It was all booked. So, we'll be back the same time next year. To be critical, don't expect luxury. It's not that kind of hotel.

We returned after 8PM, when the office closes. By 10PM our unit was rocking and rolling...as there was apparently an extreme high surf event, that we had no idea was going on. It was frightening as every wave that crashed, rattled everything in the cottage, the mirror on the wall bouncing, clothes in the closets swinging back and forth, more or less a non stop earthquake....we had stayed here before, twice, and lived in SD 30 years....we knew this was NOT normal! A search for an emergency number yielded a number to call only if \"mechanical emergency\" (not our case) or 911 but not a manager ....we were up all night and at 5PM the SD NEWS reported that \"all piers\" in SD were close due to structural concerns..we meanwhile were paying $300 to stay 20 ft from the blocked off area. We gathered our things and left to Denny's where we waited till 8AM for the manager, When we reported that we had left due to fear and reports on the TV that all piers in SD had been officially closed by the city...and were considered unstable. The manager scoffed that they had been hit by 25 foot waves and the pier had not gone down, and these were only 16...we were refunded the next night's stay but they would not refund for the sleepless night and having to leave for our own safety, when no one could be reached. We were told it was our responsibility to know what the surf hieght was going to be, not their's, they after all did not control the weather ...so now you know...the weather (outside of the high surf) was perfect, we had no way of knowing of this problem.....shame on the Crystal Pier.! If they are closed by the city, they should have had the courtesy to warn the customers & refund the money to those who are not brave enough to stay out on the pier in defiance of the city order.

A few negatives; we were given cottage 22 which appears to be the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153runt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the cottages. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a futon as the other cottages have but it did have two twin size roll out beds. We had our own patio but it was so small that it only contained one lounge chair and a small round table with two (not four) patio chairs and no umbrella. The kitchen was so small that we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reach the microwave unless we moved the dining chairs away from the table. Another issue was that none of the outlets in the kitchen worked except the one the toaster and coffee pot were already plugged into. From what I could see of the other cottages, ours appeared quite a bit smaller. We were disappointed that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a French door as the other cottages did and we had to park a good distance from our front door and not in front of the cottage as other guests could. The parking was a nightmare too. You are only allowed one assigned parking spot per cottage and you get locked in by all the other cars lined up bumper to bumper. The front desk clerk was grumpy about us driving through the gate before we got a key but no one was outside to tell us not to. She was less than friendly at check in. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d think the front desk staff would be a little nicer and more professional for the amount of money you pay to stay there. The bathroom was fine and the shower had great water pressure. We brought lots of food with us and even made a big dinner one night. The kitchen did have all the basic necessities (pots, pans, dishes & utensils). You can also get a barbeque grill from the front desk (you provide the charcoal). All in all, it was a fabulous stay. I will definitely return but won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay in Cottage 22 again. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it warrants the same rate as the other larger 1 bedroom units. There are also tons of shops and restaurants very close. I recommend visiting Pangaea for a cool shopping experience but make sure you have enough time to see everything in this large and very diverse store. Also, try Bustamante\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Garnet Ave. We had a fantastic breakfast/lunch. Good selection on the menu; Mexican cuisine, plus omelets, pancakes, Belgium waffles, you name it. All very good food made from scratch. Good sized servings and each meal came with a fruit cup to start. Also, Edgar is the best waiter/host you can ask for. He went out of his way to make sure we had a great time and everyone at the table was happy. Be careful not to park on Garnet Street overnight though.

When you first arrive you are immediately greeted with the ocean breeze and the crash of waves against the shore. This alone made me a realize I was in for some good old down time. After we checked in we were given the keys to our rooms and upon entering were greeted with a great view of the ocean just outside the sliding class doors to out patio. The cottage has a full kitchen. Pots, pans silverware, plates the whole nine yards. This was great.

If this is along your speed, you are able to stock up on groceries at the local supermarket which is within walking distance of the Hotel. The sunsets from the pier are some of the most beautiful I've seen. The boardwalk is open to the public during the day, but is gated in the evening 7 or 8 p.m I believe, giving guests full run of the boardwalk. If you should venture out in the evening, you have your own key to the gate for after hours. When you finally do return from your evening you can rest assured that you are going to have the best nights sleep...EVER!! The sound of the tide beneath you and the gentle rocking of the pier rocks you right to sleep. There are a host of restaurants and lounges in the area. All of which accommodate different tastes in cuisine and nightlife as well. A list of family entertainment options can be found by just clicking around the the internet, brochures at the hotel, locals etc. Of course there is the San Diego Zoo, Sea World.

We went in 2005 for our 25th wedding anniversary, just returned from celebrating our 27th there, plan to return, and constantly recommend it to our friends. We're in our mid-50's to give you an idea of our demographic, and we always look for places that are out of the ordinary when planning our trips. First some responses to previous reviewer comments: * Yes, this is a simply appointed property. If you want a lavishly decorated typical hotel room, with a pool, gym, room service, free newspaper, continental breakfast, etc., don't go here. By the way, don't believe the previous reviewer comments about shabby or less than adequate rooms. The hotel has upgraded the cottages and they are all nicely, if simply, furnished in a beach cottage theme that is carried out in the living, dining, and bedrooms. Even the plates, silverware, etc., continue the casual theme (think IKEA) and are something you would be happy to have in your home. * Parking is not that much of a strain. We have a Jeep Grand Cherokee and were able to maneuver on the pier and park in front of our cottage with little effort. So, unless you are driving a Hummer or something equally monstrous in size, don't worry. * Yes, it is sometimes a bit noisy nearby. Pacific Beach is a (surprise!) beach town, with all the noise that you should expect, including occasional people on the beach late at night/early a.m. (after the bars close, and there is now a nearby bar/club that wasn't there our first trip - not to worry: no real noise from the club itself or their customers). The noise factor on the beach at night isn't that big a deal and we managed to get back to sleep (the revelers left after about 30 minutes). Our cottage was not very far from the beginning of the pier and nearby street/businesses. I imagine cottages further out on the pier aren't as susceptible to this problem but there you do get more ocean noise, so it's a trade-off. So, if you want an absolutely (dead) quiet, perfectly furnished, e.g., some type of fussy Victorian or ultra-modern or cookie-cutter/Hilton/Hyatt/Radisson-type of hotel, go somewhere else. IF, on the other hand, you want to go to a marvelously charming, small hotel consisting of individual cottages located on a pier with to-die-for views of the Pacific Ocean and a nice, wide beach almost at your doorstep, go here. IF you want to listen to the ocean and watch it from your deck, living room, or while you are eating at your dining area table, all of which we did, then go here. IF you want to escape the normal boring, humdrum hotel scene and have some room to spread out in your living room, cook some light meals in the nicely equipped kitchen (or just warm up something in the microwave, go here. IF you want to be able to take a walk, roller blade, or ride your bikes (bring your own or rent them) along a nice stretch of paved \"boardwalk\" stretching for several miles along the beach, or walk along a very nice and family friendly beach, then go here. There are many nearby stores (Trader Joes, Ralph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Von\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Henry's, Long\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Drugs, to name a few) and some decent restaurants (don't expect a 5-star dining experience - beach town, not NYC or San Francisco, remember?). Kona's is next to the pier/hotel and has a great breakfast and lunch menu. The Green Flash, Joe's Crab Shack, and World Famous restaurants are a short walk from the pier and offer decent sit-down food, and there are lots of other smaller eating places nearby, plus the usual suspects (Denny's, McDonald's, Taco Bell, etc.). Be adventurous - try some of the local spots! Or, just cook in your cottage as we occasionally did. Nothing beats eating breakfast while looking at the Pacific Ocean! The main drag in Pacific Beach, Garnet Street, starts/ends at the pier and is a bit rowdy (lots of bars, tattoo places, etc.), but not enough that you don't feel safe at night. The presence of these establishments doesn't mean PB is a dump: the city of SD keeps it clean and well maintained. To the contrary, we enjoy the atmosphere of the area. Lots of college kids from SDSU, UCSD, and USD live and hang out in PB, but they seem fairly well-behaved and the SDPD seems to be present in adequate numbers and manages to keep a lid on things without an overwhelming presence. Downtown SD is about a 10-15 minute drive from PB with all the usual touristy stuff that you might want to enjoy (we highly recommend a trip to Little Italy in SD), but we like just hanging out in town, walking on the beach, riding bikes, grabbing a coffee in downtown PB, stopping in some of the shops, reading on the deck at our cottage, listening to music while eating breakfast, and enjoying the view and each other.

He frequently goes to the pier to fish & wanted to be a guest so he could go night fishing.

I was amazed that they had one 2 bedroom unit over the water available for that night. (Usually a 2 night minimum, unless you call on the day before or day of arrival.) I was skepticle because it was pricy, but went ahead & took it. When we arrived, I was 'wowed'. The service was impecable. Quick check in just before driving onto the pier & the unit (#1) was ready & waiting for us. As we had a large unit, we were allowed 2 vehicles on the pier - which was a plus since I had friends coming to enjoy dinner with us. The unit seemed newly remodeled. Nice blue & white tile in the bathrooms & kitchen. A nautical theme throughout. The living area & kitchen were small - but the bedrooms were decent size. The master bedroom also had a sliding glass door out to the deck. We had a HUGE deck (probably the largest of all the units) right over the water complete with a bbq, 4 chaise lounges, 2 tables & about 8 chairs! For those with small children, the deck railings have been upgraded to 'code' so I didn't have to worry too much about my 2 year old lunging into the water, although he was never allowed outside without my oldest son or an adult anyway. There was a TV in the living area with DVD & VCR, as well as a small TV in the master bedroom. The kitchen is complete with a microwave, refrigerator, stove & oven, plates, utencils, pots & pans etc...

If I remember correctly, this is one of five beach communities north of the center city. It seems that locals refer to all five by their initials, so PB it is. I am from the East Coast, and to me PB looks like any other family oriented, especially teen-centric, beach town -- lots of sun and fun apparel shops, temporary tattoo parlors, fast food (including a Denny's), and loud music. My husband and I became Empty Nesters' earlier this month, and took off on a two week trip to the West Coast. I discovered The Crystal Pier Hotel on TripAdvisor.com -- though at the time it was rated as the #1 B&B, not as a hotel. I booked it for two nights (the minimum at this time of year) and we drove over from Palm Springs, where we spent a wonderful week at The Chase Hotel. I don't know if it was because we were coming from such a down-to-earth, non-touristy place like The Chase, or whatever... but I knew at first sight that I had made a mistake. The Crystal Pier is for the tourist that knows no better. I am embarrassed to admit that I am one of these. Though, perhaps, there are people that are willing to pay top dollar to stay in economy accommodations in a miniature \"cottage\" on an ocean pier where one can watch the local surfers brave the smallish waves? We were in Cottage #8, maybe a third of the way out on the pier. Each cottage has one parking space parallel to their cottage, and the cottage is not much wider than the car you will park there. Bring a small vehicle, because turning around to head out requires tight turning. Our cottage was a one-bedroom. You enter the cottage into the kitchen/common room. The bedroom was off to the right, the size of its queen size bed with barely walking distance around the bed. There was a sliding door from this bedroom into the bathroom (shower only, no tub), and from the bathroom a door back into the kitchen/common room -- a small, rather well equipped kitchen, half/round table with chairs, TV (only TV) and futon (I could not figure out how to flatten it). The kitchen/common room opened onto a small deck that had a table and chairs, and chaises -- and was butt-to-butt with decks on either side, and may have shared a common walkway from one pier end to the other. But you can sit and sip and enjoy the view of the beach and surfers below. The general condition of the cottage was \"worn\" -- outdated in all respects. However, it looked like the Crystal Pier was fully booked, so I was not the only sucker? Or, maybe I am not the typical tourist, and others will find The Crystal Pier more appealing. Highlights: Maria was our attentive housekeeper, and Randy at the front desk called me minutes after we left to tell me I had left behind a jacket. While I was at the front desk checking out, I think it was the owner (or manager?) that came in with his elderly dog in a walking-sling, very touching. (Though at The Chase Hotel, I spent some time every morning at breakfast with Chase, the owner's dog he adopted as a stray.) FYI: The Crystal Pier Hotel is a \"gated\" community. You are given a key that opens the gate to bring through a car, or to open the walk-in gate after 8:pm. Bottom line: Just like all others, I fell in love with SD, but next trip I will not stay at the CP - in fact, I will not stay in PB or any other of the beaches.

Unfortunately, it's not just a problem of the owners not knowing-- one of the rudest people you'll talk to is one of the owners. They know they have a unique property, with many people coming year after year (despite the attitude) so they don't have to improve their customer service.

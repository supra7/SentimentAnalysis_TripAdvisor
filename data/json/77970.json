The hotel is siutated perfectly a block away from LAX, and right next door to a Denny's and a gas station. The room was very clean, and everything well stocked and equipped, including extra pillows and blankets in the closet. The beds were comfortable, though I did find the pillows to be a bit on the hard side. The bathroom was spacious, although it was only stocked with shampoo and soap. No lotion, no conditioner. The staff at check-in was extremely polite and helpful with our request for a downstairs room. Fellow travelers: this is a comfortable property for ONE night, maybe two. Do NOT expect luxury, only functionality. They have an airport shuttle that runs every half hour to LAX around the clock, and parking is free. They also have free wi-fi and in-room coffee makers. Now, the rooms do have wallpaper like you stepped into the 80's, but if you're looking for a clean, safe place to stay right before or right after a long day of travel without breaking the bank, I would definitely recommend this place. They offer a free continental breakfast in the mornings, 6-9am, enough to hold you over until lunch. Again, everyone was very courteous in the dining room. The service all around was personable and exceeded my expectations. One warning, if you are a light sleeper, noise could be an issue. We had room 132 and could hear parking lot commotion throughout the night, as well as the arrival and departure of the airport shuttle, on top of expected airplane noise. We managed to sleep despite the noise, but maybe others should request a room farther from the main entrance/parking lot.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delray Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cLAX convenience - clean - good value\u201d", "Author": "AngloTom", "ReviewID": "UR126935756", "Content": "Having arrived late evening LAX our group of four were tired after cross country flight.

Only stayed the one night, but would stay there again under the same circumstances of somewhere very local to LAX at an inexpensive rate.

Computer in the cozy lobby. A Denny's adjoins the property, and a Shell station with a larger convenience store is only yards away. Bargain online rates are common, and it's convenient to LAX. Shuttles run outbound on the half-hour; just call the hotel (phone at bag claim) to get a pickup.

When I did check in I asked about the frig and they said not in notes they would get one, I decided after looking at room not to get one after all and just use ice for my drinks. They were actually pretty quick about putting one in there as by the time I told them and went back to my room with my luggage the guy was in there putting one in, but took it out then. The frig is extra $10, microwave $10, and internet $10, unless you stay in a sleepy bear room which is two double beds.

It is because of you here at TripAdvisor that I decided to book this room. Okay, so getting into the review...it doesn't look like much from the front...kind of looks like an old motel with a Denny's in the parking lot, lol. The outside appearance suggests it has been around since the 1950's if not longer... But, once you open the door to your room, I bet you would be as surprised as I was to see how large it is! The second thing you will notice is that the decor is completely outdated. It's stuck somewhere between the 1960's and the 1980's. But, you know what? I found it to be like a time-travel experience, so I kind of enjoyed the quirkiness of the decor. Best part? CLEAN! Everything was clean! The shower, the floor throughout, the toilet (they even wrap it with a paper ribbon to show you it was cleaned before your arrival), the sheets, the furniture's surfaces. They ask you to rate your room before you leave (via comment cards in the room) and seem to genuinely care that you find it clean and comfortable. The room I stayed in had a large king-sized bed, a desk, an old tube tv (lol), and a large balcony (with walls on the sides for some privacy). Free wireless internet too! Please note that you CAN hear jet engines taking off at LAX. The hotel is very close to the runways. It didn't really bother us, but it might bother you if you are a light sleeper. Check out is noon, but you can request to stay until 2pm. We called at 11am and requested the 2pm check out and they easily obliged. Awesome. :) They have a continental breakfast but I missed it both mornings I was there, so I can't rate that for you. The lobby has a computer where you can print your flight's boarding pass free of charge.

It was renamed from Airport Century Inn to Travelodge. The staff has not changed in the important areas as management, front desk and room service supervising since I can remind. When you like to have a more quiet room, ask for the rear side, all of them are clean. The premise maintenance is good and the hobby of the ground manager is the garden. Unfortunately the labeling of plants has changed. In former days the premises looked like a botanic garden with explanations and names. Perfect for the children. May be..... I do not know, where the other tripadvisor writers like to go swimming, I usually go into the pool and enjoy. The pool area and the pool itself is cleaned every day by the ground staff. A kids section is provided in the pool. The comment with bed bugs is for me not understandable. The beds are clean and the matress is renewed frequent. The rooms are clean and remodelled frequent on demand.. Towels and amenities are OK and you can obtain anything, you have forgotten, from the ffront desk. In addition there is a small shop at the entrance providing medicals, picture postcards, cold beverages and other things as souvenirs. On the area of the hotel there is a Denny\u00c2\u00b4s restaurant. Unfortunately the bar has changed the opening days. Only friday and saturday you can have the \"real bar feeling2 however, during the other evenings the Denny\u00c3\u0178s staff is proud to serve you the \"toxic drinks\" when you are arrive middle in the night from Europe. Lots of free parking is available on the premises. You need a parking permit from the front desk (free!). Newspaper every day is free. Wifi is free, you need the code for that from the front desk (free). Breakfast is free for hotel guests and the remodelled breakfast area is OK. Just show the room key. When the hotel is fully booked, the space in the breakfast area is very limited. (...and it is often fully booked...) Only the time 09:00 of closing the door should be extended. Visitors from other countries have to battle with the time shift and jet lag. For shure you can go to Denny\u00c2\u00b4s for breakfast, if you are really late in the morning. When you are there and have problems with anything, go to the front desk and they will check it. We will come back. For sure. Not to forget: they provide fridgerators and microwave in the room for a small charge. All in one: The hotel is a clean place, having the airport in the vicinity. Free shuttle service from and to the gates is available. No plane is landing direct over the hotel. Departure is anyhow to the sea side direction. Car rentals are in walking distance. Lots of shops in the vicinity and the standard touristic areas as Santa Monica (with big mall, Apple store and Abercrombie shop), Venice Beach, Redondo Beach, Fry\u00c2\u00b4s electronic store (hughe!), Ralph\u00c2\u00b4s and others are in short driving distance.", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu", "Title": "\u201cVery good deal for the money\u201d", "Author": "mir773", "ReviewID": "UR88355460", "Content": "Aloha, This is my second stay at Travelodge at LAX and it was great.

However, the economy rate, my being away for most of the day on business, plus the location to the airport resulted in my making the booking for three days. I arrived at the airport and followed the directions I had been given regarding calling the hotel for the shuttle service. Called made; directions provided to pick-up site; shuttled arrived in 15 minutes; and cordial shuttle driver. Short drive to hotel (5 minutes)...greeted by personable desk clerk. Yes, the hotel is in the style of the fifties/sixties motor inn...but from first appearance appeared to have weathered the fifty or sixty years well. Previously, I had intended to obtain my rental car at the airport; however, when I had emailed the hotel regarding my reservation confirmation I had told them that I would not need a shuttle as I was renting a car. I was told that perhaps I would prefer to come to the hotel, check-in, put my luggage in my room then have the hotel shuttle take me to the car rental agency. I was unaware that I could not get a car at the airport and would have had to taken the car rental agency's shuttle to their rental log...much easier taking the hotel shuttle and then going to the car agency. My initial impression of a \"classic style\" property was enhanced by the grounds...lovely and well maintained. I had not read in other comments about the grounds--vintage vegetation. The pool and pool deck must have recently been refurbished. Nice open feeling without the sense of being walled in with concrete. I had a room in the second wing of the hotel. Although most of the rooms in this section have corridor entries, my room faced an outside corridor that enabled me to view an inter court plant area--nicely maintained as were the plants in the hallways (live!) and along the walkways. You can tell I am a plant buff as I learned that all rooms had live plants. My room was very clean--I am not a great TV fan so I found the number of channels totally adequate. The TV is not flat screen. Bed bugs...well I do enough business travelling to know that through out the US hotels are being challenge by the insect. No bugs; no noise from the airport; no problems...yet I was still wating for \"the other shoe to fall\". Although I believe the maid spoke very little English, on the two occasions I say her she smile and said good morning...even though it was afternoon. Also I engaged the gardner in conversation...and he like to lalk about HIS gardens. Well, I guess he was entitled as there were very pleasant and he had been employed by the hotel for 27 years. My decision to stay at the hotel had been \"influenced\" by my not wanting to pay $18 or $22 a night to park my rental car -- overnight parking is pricey! Parking is free at the hotel. I wanted to have Chinese food my first night and inquired at the front desk for a restaurant recommendation. I was given a Thia one (which I did not want) and then a Chinese restaurant. When I asked for directions, the desk clerk (pleasant young lady) suggested that if I wanted to go there that the shuttle take me -- perhaps not the best area of town. I agreed (I could have done it -- not that bad!) -- plain restaurant but the food was gourmet and reasonably price! When I finished, the waitress called the hotel (obviously other guests come to the restaurant as she did not have to ask for the number) -- and in 10 minutes I was back at the hotel. I found the front desk staff most helpful in providing me with answers to questions. On my third day, I had a break in my schdule so inquired about LA tours. How many times have you asked about tour information and are given a pamphlet. Well, the desk clerk definitely was familiar with the tour -- she is either a long time resident (well cannot be that long as she was not over 30 years of age) of the area or took the time to inform herself about the available tours. I was not able to go on it as the return hour conflicted with a dinner business meeting. Area -- I am not sure what previous reviewers meant by a \"questionable\" area -- there are several large hotels near the Travelodge -- one is a Hilton. Airport Noise -- I guess if you are a light sleeper -- I did not have a problem with sleep; I asked my favorite front desk staff person about guest's complaints regarding noise. She did say that when stormy weather conditions exists that the planes are required to take off inland -- and yes, there can be noise. However, she concluded by saying that is definitely does not shake you out of your bed -- the runway is a mile away. What amazed me was that when you choose to stay at an airport does not the potential of noise seem a reality -- how surprising, \"I heard airplance noise\". You are at the airport. In summary...I had a delightful stay. Maybe because I was apprehensive when I arrived and learned that my experience was totally different than the last couple of reviews on the property had indicated. My thought was that I did not intend to see a brand spanking new property...a room rate with tax included in the sixty dollar range does impact what the hotel can provide. The continental breakfast was more than adequate for me. The Denny's Restaurant which adjoins the hotel was okay but was over priced.

The little convenience store on site is a total rip-off at $1.75 for a small bottle of water that should cost 59c, but it is convenient. This property would benefit from somewhat better maintenance, but it's limited to very chipped paint around doorways etc; in my room everything was clean and functional. If you're searching by price this is worth a bit more than El Segundo which is futher away than you think and you should know that Inglewood is also much further from LAX and can be a rather dodgy neighbourhood at night (do NOT take your children or your Gran to Inglewood), so this location is relatively safe and MUCH more convenient. The hotel runs a shuttle bus around the airport terminals regularly - make sure you stand in the right place outside your terminal, look for the kerb markings for \"Hotel Shuttles\", they can't pick you up elsewhere. If you can call the front desk when you arrive they'll send the bus out for you - make sure they know WHICH TERMINAL you've arrived at - there are a LOT! If you're not renting a car you can ride the shuttle back to the Airport and get the free Lot C bus to the Airport Bus Station, where buses leave regularly for all parts of the city, or take the express bus direct to the Amtrak station downtown for onward travel. If you want to use the hotel as a base to explore the LA area you'll want to request a better room - the ones on the 2nd floor (US)/ 1st floor(UK) overlooking the pool have balconies and would do nicely.

We just needed somewhere clean/cheap to store our stuff and sleep as we were going to be out most of our 3 day stay anyway, so didn't want to waste money on a more upmarket hotel that we weren't going to be in much of the time. This Travelodge, does look a bit dated and could probably do with a re-fresh but it was still very clean and well looked after. We stayed in 2 rooms, on the first night we had a 2nd floor room 214, that faced the pool but was blocked out with a large tree so we had no actual view of the pool, and on the other side backed out on to a very busy road. This turned out to be very very noisy, not from the aircraft (which as the hotel is in between the runways at LAX, you can hardly hear, unless you are outside), but the traffic passing. They have installed the a/c unit into the wall, so effectively it is just a huge hole with no sound proofing, so as well as bringing air into the room, also brings in the traffic noise. We were lucky we still had our ear plugs from the flight, as we needed to use them to drown out the noise to get some sleep. It would have been just about ok for a 1 night stay, but as we had 2 more nights, we requested to change rooms to somewhere a little quieter. This was handled extremely well, and from the time of the call, to being in our new room was with-in an hour. We ended up in room 233 which is right above the hotel shop and offices and was very quiet, with no traffic noise at all. The rooms are very large for the price, but sparsely equipped, but they do have the basic's with a TV, hair dryer and a coffee maker. The bed was extremely comfortable too. The only downside was a lack of a safe in the room to store your valuables, but I guess most people are only staying for 1 night so it probably isn't much of an issue then. The free wi-fi was also a welcome bonus too, compared to the $15/day our 5* hotel in Vegas wanted, and we had no issues with it - although you do have to get the access code from the reception desk, which we didn't realise until trying to log on as there was no info about it anywhere. Parking at the hotel fills up pretty quickly, and can be hard to find a space if you arrive late, although you can park outside the adjoining Denny's restaurant too, however this is unsecured unlike other parts of the car park, but we had no issues - but then we're not in the habit of leaving valuables on display in our car. There are plenty of fast food outlets with-in a few minutes walk of the hotel, although not sure how nice it would be to walk there at night (we had a car so walking wasn't an issue) but during the day when we were going out and about, it looked ok, with no noticeable undesirables hanging around, but the attached Denny's is open 24hrs. The pool area looked well maintained and it was nice to take a dip in at the end of the day, with plenty of sun lounger's and a few tables and chairs to sit at., At the end of the day, it is a Travelodge, so you get what you pay for, but this one is well maintained and very clean with friendly helpful staff, and it was in a good location too, with most places around LA easily accessible by car and if like me, you would rather spend your money on other things, rather than a hotel room you are hardly going to be in, then this is a great place to stay with lot's of extra's other hotels charge for, included in the price.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cmy purse was stolen in breakfast room and non one can help me!\u201d", "Author": "mom_fpny", "ReviewID": "UR74238943", "Content": "This is the first time I have stayed at a hotel and left in tears.

I was a single woman traveling alone, and my room was so far at the back of the hotel, I had to walk very far to get there from the lobby or parking lot, the rest of the hotel was eerily empty, and there were a lot of homeless people hanging around the area near the parking lot.

The shower was AWFUL. It fluctuated from ice cold to almost warm, and then as soon as I could get it to the warmest setting possible (probably about room temperature), it would quickly go cold again. I just wanted to relax after a long day and I ended up fighting with the shower for quite some time, before giving up and taking a lukewarm/ice cold shower. The next morning I was woken up by a small dog barking really loudly and constantly. The room looked clean, but nothing really felt clean though I couldn't put my finger on why. Maybe my situation could have been remedied if I asked for my room to be switched, but I was only there less than twelve hours so I didn't want to waste my time, especially because it was likely a new room would have problems as well.

There were 6 of us: my mom and I were in room 207 and my brother, his wife and 2 kids (8 & 11) were in room 206. We only stayed for one night, Saturday Feb. 6 through Sunday Feb. 7, 2010. We only stayed one night because we were headed to Carnival Splendor's Mexican Riviera cruise; and we like to fly in a day early because, coming from the northeast, we never know what the weather will be like! lol The hotel is on a main road but you don't hear the traffic while in your room. However, you do hear the planes coming in and out of LAX; but the noise isn't as bad as you would think. Now, I'm not a light sleeper, nor am I a heavy sleeper, but if it helps you, let me say that I wasn't woken, not once, by the noise from any incoming or outgoing planes at LAX. The biggest positives about this hotel are its location, the variety of food available in the continental breakfast, the service, and THE BED'S! I've stayed in MANY hotels; from crappy motels in MA, to 3 and 4 star hotels all over the country, and 5 star Hotels in Spain & Portugal. NO HOTEL HAS HAD A MORE COMFORTABLE BED THAN THIS TRAVELODGE...NONE! I'm not over exaggerating, this bed was soft but firm at the same time..I can't even explain it. If I could've taken home the mattress I would've! lol However, I didn't like the pillows; they were too soft for my taste...but hey in my opinion it was a fair trade. My back didn't hurt in the morning and I woke up very well rested. Even my mom, who \"can't live without\" her bed (a pricey Serta because of her back probs), had nothing but high remarks for the mattress! The hotel offers free Shuttle service to and from the airport which was a plus for us. Also, both front desk employees (overnight and in the morning), were extremely helpful and very nice. The morning manager helped us find a taxi that took us to Long Beach Cruise Terminal for $70! Yes..all 6 of us with all of our bags...which were plentiful lol. The continental breakfast offered more than I anticipated: a variety of muffins, danishes, cinnamon rolls, toast (white and wheat), waffles, fresh fruit, coffee (good coffee too...which is saying something since I can't live without Dunkin' Donuts!), and two different juices (apple and orange). Even though we were on a main street, the area seemed pretty safe. We even walked to a restaurant close by called Stick N' Steins (recommended by the night desk clerk..it was excellent) at 9 pm, and we felt perfectly safe. And in the morning, the kids used the outdoor heated pool, which they loved. Now comes the bad. The room was typical of what you would expect in a 2 star hotel. The carpets could use a GOOD deep cleaning. There were even staples near the bed which my mom stepped on..she wasn't happy. Also, when we first entered the room my mom needed to use the restroom and found a hair on the toilet seat and toilet paper in the toilet. It's not like there was pee in the toilet bowl or anything, it just looked like maybe the hair came from the cleaning crew and they used toilet paper to wipe something and just chucked it into the toilet. We complained about that but there was no cleaning crew on duty at the time so we just used our own Lysol wipes (which we never travel w/out) and wiped it ourselves. The room had a coffeemaker w/ coffee, a microwave, and a fridge...which were all spotless. But, the problems continued in the bathroom. The grout on the floor, and the grout around the tub and inside the tub were full of mildew. The whole bathroom needs a good cleaning with some Soft Scrub and good ol' fashioned elbow grease...EW. The last thing I was disappointed with was the TV. It was big enough, but the color and picture on it were horrible. I know, you don't stay in a hotel to watch TV, but it's a little annoying when you're trying to watch the news and the anchor looks like an Oompah Loompa due to bad color and fuzzy picture! Other than those few issues, the Travelodge LAX South was perfect for one night and offered everything that we needed. A Ralph's, IHOP, other various restaurants, convenience store, and a strip mall are all within waking distance.

Didnt catch the shuttle at LAX (went straight to Dollar to get the car) so can't comment on that. Staff seemed friendly enough but we found there were no elevators and had to carry all our luggage up stairs to the second floor! The hotel grounds are nice with a great pool and nice gardens and the whole complex is surrounded by a huge security fence ( you'll discover why when you go out! ) however finding space to park can be difficult as the main car park is shared with the adjacent Dennys. The first room was terrible. Nice view but the balcony doors didnt look secure. The whole room looked in severe need of renovation. Bathroom was badly lit and the shower only trickled out. No noise from the airport in this room but the fact that there was a door to the room next door and there seemed to be a gang war going on in there kept us up until it sounded like the police turned up to turf them out. Did not feel at all safe! Second room was much better. Looked to have been recently refurbished and was light and airy with double glazed balcony doors. Sadly this was spoiled by a half inch gap all the way round the entry door which we discovered when we thought there was an aircraft landing in the corridor outside! (Backs onto the airport side) Couldnt have the aircon on high as it was so noisy but didnt make any difference as the aircraft and street noise through the badly fitted door kept us awake all night! Breakfast was not bad but is served in a room the size of a large closet and there are only a few tables outside to sit at which was poor considering the size of the hotel. The Denny's next door did a much better breakfast though obviously you have to pay. Imagine most people staying here will bring or rent a car, which you WILL NEED to get around. The area is very run down and is surrounded by strip clubs and sex shops! Also seems to be a large population of local vagrants that try to con money out of you as I was stupid enough to fall for the first day, I felt a lot happier the second stay when we were told we could park in th back lot (which is inside the security fence and accessed with the room key) as i often wondered if the car would still be outisde in the morning when parked in the main car park. Walking back to the hotel from Dollar was nervewracking even for 2 young men. Area not appropriate or safe for families, lone travellers or anyone of anyone fo a nervous disposition should beware. In summary, hotel grounds and pool were nice.

Another good thing about the hotel is the free shuttle. Finally, the rooms, as far as I could tell, were free of cockroaches or bedbugs. The good things just about end there. We took the shuttle from the airport (be sure to call the hotel- the shuttle does not run continuously). Check in took a while since our room was not yet ready (even though we'd called to let them know when we would be arriving and they had informed us that there wouldn't be a problem). The front desk guy was a little slow, a minor inconvenience. We inquired about reserving a tour of the city through the hotel since the people I was with had never been to L.A. Instead of referring us to reputable tour companies, he stepped outside and pulled in what appeared to be a random guy hanging out in the hotel's parking lot. The man informed us that he could drive us around Hollywood Boulevard for 60$/person. Uh, thanks for the great offer but if I want to go to Hollywood Boulevard, I'll rent a car for 30$ and drive there myself, park and walk around like any normal tourist would do. Needless to say, we passed on his offer. FYI- it costs about 60$ one way for a taxi to Hollywood from the hotel. If you're planning on visiting during your stay at this hotel, I would suggest renting a car. Besides, the best way to get around in L.A. is with your own car (L.A. is too spread-out for using public transportation). We finally got our room. Finding your room at this hotel is a bit like going on scavenger hunt. The layout of the hotel is very odd and it felt like we were maneuvering through a maze. We finally get to our room and open the door. Wow. It smelled like the cleaning lady had dropped a gallon of bleach on the carpet. Not very pleasant. All in all, the room was clean enough for us. After a night-long flight, we found the beds comfortable and slept most of the day away. We did sit by the pool for a bit. The pool looked cleaned (the water felt cold). We didn't stay long because a half dozen frat boys decided to take over the area, cannonballing in the pool, spraying everyone in the vicinity. FYI- I'm in my mid-20s so it's not like I'm an old fart who can't stand anyone having any fun, but these guys were loud and annoying and made the \"pool scene\" at the hotel not so interesting. Not the hotel's fault, but I did notice a number of strange and loud characters hanging out on the hotel grounds. There is a Denny's on site. We had dinner there. Not bad, the waitress was very nice. I would rather eat there than any restaurant at LAX. LAX, for the size of it, has very few restaurants and stores. We took the shuttle back to the airport to catch a red-eye. The shuttle service is quick and easy. All in all, this is an OK place to stay. It's cheap and convenient and mostly clean. I wouldn't stay there for longer than a stopover. For our purposes, the hotel served us well.", "Date": "June 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morgan Hill, CA", "Title": "\u201cThey do not give true info\u201d", "Author": "openzin", "ReviewID": "UR7683362", "Content": "I booked the hotel for one night before an afternoon flight and wanted to have some work done.

The clerk was very rude and said that it would cost an extra $10. In the past, we have often stayed up front by the pool and have never requested that! We decided to decline the extra charge so she assigned us to a room about as far back as you can go....No. 168. Well, guess what, that room was already occupied. We opened the door and there was luggage, clothing and obvious signs that people were staying there. After another long trek to the desk, we were given room #170.

It's little extras that count such as the big TV, loads of movies on demand, comfortable lounge chair, mirror, etc. The key thing here is that it's dirt cheap at $90 US inc tax, right next to the airport, and there's a 24-hour Dennys restaurant as part of the complex - so food all time of the day without needing to venture far. If all you want to do is chill out one day at the airport to get your next flight, this has got to be it.

FACILITIES Two (2) Queen Sized Bed Two (2) TVs Hair Dryer Fridge Coffee Maker (which can be used to boil water) Microwave & Cooking area with pots & pans No bedroom slippers No in-room safe TV Standard TV channels. AIR COND / HEATER One air cond / heater was provided with an outlet for the bedroom. Therefore the person sleeping outside the bedroom had control over the temperature. BATHROOM Only one bathroom \u2013 not attached to the smaller room. Soap, shampoo. If required you can request for a tooth brush, shaver, shaving cream, comb, etc which is provided free of charge. Clean bathroom. Good water pressure with hot and cold water. OTHER COMMENTS There was no additional hidden charges such as \u201cresort fees\u201d which is charged by most hotels. I paid about $120 for a one-night stay on Sunday during spring break which I think was affordable when sharing among 4 people. Free Parking. Breakfast was not provided. But since they provided pots & pans, you could make your own breakfast. There was free Wifi. Some people had told me that the hotel was old, but I didn't feel it. Of course it didn't feel brand new also, but it didn't feel run-down. SURPRISES The coin-operate laundry was provided free of charge. You could use the washer and dryer which was available on all the floors. You only have to pay for the detergent $1 (or use your own). LOCATION Located away from the \u201cStrip\u201d i.e. the main part of Las Vegas, you had to drive everywhere you went. There is no casino within Candlewood Suite but across the road there was a casino offering cheap meals to entice you to go over. OVERALL I paid US$120 per night and stayed on the 11th Mar 2012 booked through the hotel website. A satisfactory experience as this is a family hotel and nothing too fancy.

Candlewood Suites, a block or two over from the Strip, just off Flamingo on Paradise, is one of a chain of suite hotels under the InterContinental Hotels group - InterContinental, Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn etc. It operates as a suites hotel rather than a full-service hotel, which means you don't get hassled by housekeeping every day; that suits me - so I have to make my own bed? No big deal. Rooms are very big, well equipped, very comfortable. It comes with free wi-fi (important!), a coin-operated launderette, has a swimming pool, gym, a scrupulously clean and well-equipped kitchenette in each room, located close to 20 restaurants, you can park your car outside the door, and you don't have to walk half a mile through thousands of slot machines (there aren't any).

My description and verdict for Candlewood Suites in Las Vegas: Having spent 15 nights in one of their studios, I had sufficient time to evaluate this hotel aiming at the traveler staying longer for business or leisure. Starting with the first encounter as I checked in, I was given a warm welcome with consideration to the fact that I was heavily jetlagged and therefore was given a quiet room so I wouldn't be disturbed by any noise whatsoever. The studio as such was well equipped regarding the kitchenette with appliances such a refrigerator, high-end microwave oven, a stove and even a dishwasher. Bedding quality was OK, and I particularly liked their pillow-related variety \"foam or feather\". Thus, they realized that there are also guests that are not allergic and prefer a pillow adjusting to your neck and not the other way around. Blanketwise, I would have liked a real duvet as is usual throughout modern Europe, but the three-sheets-technique is already big progress in that direction. As for entertainment, there is a TV set providing HBO and other polular channels. In addition to that, you also have a DVD-Player and various movies to be hired overnight at the front desk. To me it was important to also be able to listen to the radio which I could, for there was a radio-alarm clock on my night stand. When it comes to communication, local calls are free as well as wireless internet. Plus, there is a PC with a printer in the lobby. Eventually, I'd like to point out that I enjoyed the fact that the integrated launderette is free of charge, so I could fly home with freshly washed clothes sparing me some of the chores afterwards. As for the location within Las Vegas, the hotel is nicely located within walking distance to \"the strip\" (Las Vegas Blvd), where all the tourist attractions are to be found. The surrounding infrastructure is satisfactory insofar that you can easily reach most of the places including McCarran International Airport (LAS) even by public transit. All in all, I can definitely recommend Candlewood Suites to a broad spectrum of travelers, giving you a secure feeling to have a \"home away from home\".", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fayetteville", "Title": "\u201cRoom Keys Kept Deactivating\u201d", "Author": "Beth M", "ReviewID": "UR119075371", "Content": "This was our first trip to beautiful Las Vegas, we came to see Celine Dion in concert and we were very excited.

Staying here is different that staying at a hotel on the Strip or Downtown. It's an extended stay property which means that it is designed for those who will be there for the longer term. The room we had was clean and functional - we booked the suite, meaning that we had a seperate bedroom, and living area. Having a kitchen area made things very easy in terms of catering for ourselves, and the in-house convenience store was useful on occasion, although you could get items cheaper by venturing out to nearby grocery stores. Internet access was free, and of reasonable speed though it could be improved. For coffee loving folks, there is a Starbucks across the street, but the in-house store has free coffee if you don't want to go that far. Facilities like the (free) on-site laundry were also appreciated, meaning that you could have fresh clothes any time. There is a computer in the lobby if you need quick net access and/or to print boarding passes etc which is a nice touch. Staff were always friendly and willing to assist at any hour with obtaining room supplies from fresh linens to detergent for the dishwasher. Being an extended stay property, housekeeping only comes once a week, so you will have to \"maintain\" your room yourself for the most part - but that suited us just fine as we tended to sleep/be out at odd hours and didn't wish to be disturbed by housekeeping knocking at the door each morning. The location is good - not too far from the Strip, with downtown accessible via transit lines and McCarran airport quite close. There are malls close by if you want to shop (from clothing to groceries) and Terrible's is just across the street if you feel the urge to gamble! It's not glamourous, it's not glitzy - it's not very Vegas at all. And that's not a criticism. I've stayed on the Strip and stayed Downtown before when in Vegas, but I didn't need that on this visit.

Initially, the room key would not open the door from outside the hotel and some other guests let us into the building. After we straightened that out, we settled in. The furniture and decor were pretty beat. There was a big wet spot on the carpeting in the kitchen, a few feet from the sink.

We checked in around 4pm. The check-in was fast, and the clerk was very nice. Went to the room, the room temperature was at 96 degrees, and the AC was not running. When we approached the AC, it started to run, and we checked the wallunit which sets the room temperature at 75 degrees. As we settled, and took a rest, the AC would stop, but when we move around, it would kick in again. That prompted us to think that there was a motion sensing device. The problem is it stops running when everything is quiet in the room, NOT when the room temperature reaches the set 75 degrees. Also, when it stops running, it makes annoying clicking noise. We reported the problem immediately, the front desk (Larry) promised to call the maintenance and get back to us. And that never occured unfortunately. We went out, and came back around midnight to a steaming 96 degree room again. The AC kicked in immediately when we entered the room. When we went to sleep, the AC would stop running after 5 minutes of quietness and completely disregard the thermostat setting. I complained to the front desk, and the lady clerk appologized, and said the whole hotel is all booked, and there is no room to switched to. We wrestled with the AC for about 2 hours, and finally, my wife cannot stand it, and went downstairs and confronted the frontdesk lady. The clerk sent an elder security man to our room to check on the AC unit. The gentleman was baffled as we were about the AC unit. Upon my wife and the gentleman's return to the front desk, miraculously two rooms are available to us to move to. The clerk said it was cancellation, and that probably would not pass the dumbest lie-detector. Cancellation at 3am, and the two vacant rooms being across the hall and next door make it hard to believe it is a coincidence. So at 3am, we moved to the room across the hall way. This room does not have a thermostat on the wall to set the temprature, and the AC was either on or off. The AC was rather noisy when it was on constantly, but at least we were able to go to sleep. When the front desk lady told me there was nothing she could do, I took her words for it, and that was the part that hurt the most.

However, at the last minute we made a block booking at the Candlewood and those two nights became five. There was a little bit of kerfuffle about moving me from my initial single booking to the block booking - but the guys at the front desk handled this efficiently with the minimum of fuss. Despite the booking not being in my name (rather, it was in the name of my boss), the staff at the front desk made sure everything was okay. They explained the honour system for the \"cupboard\" and where all the facilities were. I was most impressed to see a free DVD library in operation - something that other hotels would charge an arm a leg for. The room was big and roomy (certainly enough to set-up a fair amount of computer equipment) and the kitchen was invaluable for the occasional snack, and for breakfasting. The bed was comfortable, and the recliner was a welcome break from working away for hours on end. Internet access is provided via ethernet - but is still free. They do not provide (to the best of my knowledge - I had a ton of cables due to my business trip) cables - but there's plenty of places in Las Vegas where you can get one. They filter most network protocols which makes anything other than web access extremely slow - a pain in the backside at times. The bathroom was clean, the towels fresh and clean (unlike some people have reported). I like the fact that the maid service only comes once a week - which forces you to re-use towels (although they can be exchanged for clean ones at reception) and keep things tidy yourself. The TV was big, had access to all the important channels, and there is a dual VHS and DVD player to boot. The free microwavable popcorn was a good touch. The \"food cupboard\" which is based on an honour system (i.e. you either pay in dollars there and then by dropping the notes/coins through a slot - or you fill in a little piece of paper which has the prices of the items plus the quantity you've taken of that price range, plus your room number, and drop it through the slot). The cupboard is extremely reasonably priced indeed. Location wise, it's a nice 20 minute walk to the Strip itself. Or if you're driving, everything is very accessible by the roads. It's a wonderful location for the Las Vegas Convention Centre - which is again, around a 15-20 minute walk. Over the road you have the wonderful Bahama Breeze restaurant serving a variety of Caribbean food and drink (I'd highly recommend the Aruba Red beer and the Jerk Chicken dish), as well as a Starbucks and other dinning facilities.

So, they are going to hold my credit card hostage and at the end of 3 days, I would pay them cash. Total outlay of $632.80 for 10 days with a refund of $316.40 in 7 more days. No thanks. I came back later that night, a little calmer and just wanted the room. I was then told that my reservation had been cancelled and that they would not rent a room without a credit card WITH $316.40 in funds.

The Candlewood Suites, are basic, clean, friendly accommodations. Most importantly they are safe, and quiet and off the strip. It is nice to have downtime, away from the strip.

In some cities it is important to invest in a great luxurious, expensive hotel, Vegas is not one of those cities.

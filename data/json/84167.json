I'm quite picky about my requirements, however, I E mailed Tim Gilmour and he was able to answer all my questions and was extremely helpful. I visited the hotel at the start of a family holiday and it was a great after a long flight to catch the free shuttle bus to the hotel and not have to drive when tired. We were literally in our hotel room within an hour of landing. The hotel is very plush in the lobby and there was no queue to check in. We were checked in by a very helpful and friendly spanish lad (I'm not sure of his name), however he set the scene for all the staff being helpful and friendly. We were assigned room 8030 which was a newly decorated corner double bedded room. I have to say it really exceeded my expectations. The views were excellent and had a twin aspect, they were a plane spotters dream as they looked directly over the runway (I'm not a plane spotter but I appreciated the view!). The room had a 50 inch Panasonic flat screen, coffee maker and bottled water provided. The decor was immaculately clean. The beds were extremely comfortable. We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights and found it a good base for travelling to Universal Studios. Whilst at the hotel hotel we ate predominantly in the Towers Executive Lounge on the 16th Floor. The breakfast consisted mainly of cereals/pastries/yoghurt/muffins/toast/juice/hot drinks and was perfect for our needs as a family. In the evening from 5-7pm the lounge serves hot snacks such as pizza/cheese and biscuits and drinks, be aware you pay for any alcoholic drinks but all the rest are free, from 7-9pm there are sweet snacks provided such as cookies etc. We also purchased food at the bistro which we took back to our room. The portion sizes were large and the food was good. As you would expect at an airport hotel there is some noise from the planes taking off, however this didn't bother us at all, and if it did I am sure that the staff would have accomodated a room request the opposite end to the hotel away from the airport. All in all I can genuinely say our stay was faultless and was a great start to our holiday.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, BC", "Title": "\u201cA good value airport hotel\u201d", "Author": "TravelRichard", "ReviewID": "UR127045164", "Content": "We got a great deal on Hotwire for 1 night.

We wanted to be close to the airport to catch our ongoing flight the next day and looked at a number of options before deciding on the Hilton. When we booked, the hotel website stated that the swimming pool was being refurbished but was due to re-open a couple of days before we arrived. Unfortunately when we checked in it turned out that the works were still ongoing which was annoying as we had counted on using the pool and had brought our swimsuits etc. The Hilton had arranged for guests to use the pool at a nearby hotel but this was a hassle for us with an 18 month-old in tow. We had lunch in the little cafe, which was fine, if lacking in atmosphere. Breakfast in the main restaurant the next day was a little better, the range of food wasn't great but our waiter was smiley and helpful. I used the fitness center, which was excellent, and my sister and her daughter walked around the outdoor garden (useful for entertaining small children!). Our suite was very spacious and quiet, the beds were super-comfortable - like clouds, and we liked the toiletries provided by the hotel. Be warned that there is very little to see and do in this area and Santa Monica etc. is some distance away, so you are pretty much hotel-bound, but then that is what you'd expect from an airport hotel. An extra plus was the executive lounge provided for guests on our floor which also served breakfast and evening cocktails and desserts. Unfortunately we always seemed to arrive just after it had closed (it's open at specific times during the day), but thought it a great idea nonetheless.

They also have a frwequent shuttle bus to the airport, which is only around 10 mins away. Secondly, the service was excellent. There was a wedding, some sort of meeting on and you would never know. No waiting in line for receptionists to become available, freindly staff, quick service, really excellent. Lastly, the place was comfortable, spacious and exceptionally clean. The rooms were obviously very newly renovated and wow, I felt so relaxed here. Only down side was breakfast.

I've been staying here over two years and every single time the heater in my room is broken and I have to call for an engineer. A man arrives every time with a ladder, opens the vent grate, does something in there, and, it used to eventually work after it blew lukewarm heat for about an hour; a hassle every time that took from an hour and a half up to three hours, which causes great difficulty if you have plans because the first two hours of your stay will be occupied trying to do all this.But, the last two months, the heat never works even after I go through all that hassle! I have to get a space heater every time. Tonight, the same thing happened, of course, but this time, it took two hours for the engineer to show up, he said he even remembered me from before having to fix my heater. He told me the same thing as he always does, that the heat is controlled by water in common pipes that run throughout the building and they may need to be turned up to a higher temperature and that he'll go look at it and try to find me a space heater. I then waited a half hour and my hunger was too great, I left to go buy some food-to-go at their deli downstairs and asked the front desk person to please ask the engineer to just put the heater in my room if I'm not back yet. So, I got back and no heater. Then I called the guest service line and a gal told me the engineer was still trying to find two space heaters, one for me and one for someone else. Five minutes later a man from the front desk calls and asks me what I wanted. I said, just a space heater, I'm still waiting. He said the engineer told him he fixed my heater and the heat in my room is perfectly fine (he said that in a harsh and accusatory manner). I said, no, the engineer told me he admitted he could not fix it and will try to turn up the heat in the pipes and try to find me a space heater.The man again said he was told my heat was fixed, in an even more harsh and rude voice. I repeated to the contrary again and he said he'd call me back. Finally, the engineer returns, says he turned up the heat in the water pipes and it should be better now. I asked him if he told the front desk guy my heat had been fixed and he said no, and I believe him, he's always a super nice man, always polite, his name is Jesus, and he says it will get better, he can feel the heat blowing, give it 20 more minutes. Oh yeah, last time I stayed here they put in a room above the ballroom on a saturday night with a wedding going on. At 1AM I finally called the front desk and asked when the music would stop because I've been trying to sleep for two hours and the loud music is thumping through my bed and walls, they said 3AM! Seriously? Why put someone in a room right above the ballroom knowing full well the music would go on until 3AM without telling them as a disclaimer in case they might actually prefer otherwise? SO, after I'm all unpacked, showered, in bed, and after I toss and turn for two hours trying to sleep, they tell me they have another room for me and send up a key to a room on the other side of the hotel, quieter. They say I don't have to move my stuff, I can have both rooms, the new one just to sleep in, so why not put me here in the first place? So, at 1:30AM, after getting out of bed, throwing my coat on, I take the elevator to a different floor and crawl in bed again, for four hours, because I have to get up to go to work at 6AM! Then, I get up at 6AM and take the elevator back to my original room, embarrassed as heck because the people in the elevator see me in my pajamas, messy hair, half asleep, looking exhausted and I wonder what they're thinking about me. Somewhat humiliating. Now, I'm tired, embarrassed, stressed out and have to fly in an airplane across the country, yes, I'm a flight attendant; and now I'm supposed to act all happy and nice to the few hundred passengers I'll fly with today for three legs and 10 hours, serve food and drinks with a smile, and protect them in case there's an emergency, and try to look as glamorous as I can, or at least try to hide the dark circles under my eyes, with 3 1/2 hours sleep and stressed out! Great, thanks Hilton hotel! This is the worst hotel we stay in, sure, it's pretty in the lobby, has some nice employees, good drinks and service in the bar, and is a good location to the airport, but none of that is worth anything if you can't do what most people usually come to a hotel for, to BE COMFORTABLE and SLEEP! Oh, one more thing, another time I stayed here I left my Iphone charger in the room, called a few hours later & they said they never found it. Hmmm, every fellow employee in my crew who's ever left something accidentally in their room in this hotel says they never got it back either. Meanwhile, all the other hotels we stay at have no problem finding our things and holding them for us until we return. Wonder why in this hotel, left behind things somehow seem to never be found? My advice, unless you like cold rooms, not getting lost items returned to you, dealing with rude front desk employees who take out their frustrations with their company's maintenence problems on you; until they fix their \"issues\" I'd advise you to stay somewhere else! And you can bet that if any passengers ask me for hotel recommendations, I will not suggest this hotel, that's for sure!

I truly needed a room for just 4-5 hours. When i arrived at 12:30 in the morning, I felt like an imposition rather than a guest. The front desk clerk could care less about my needs. He quoted me a room at $219.99 plus tax. When I bristled at the price, he walked away. I said \"excuse me\" and he simply said \"oh, I thought you didn't want it.\". I was too tired and i didn't have time to go elsewhere so I took the room. When I asked for a receipt, he said he couldn't give me one because they print them at 3 am. Really? It was in an area under construction which meant carpet had been pulled up in places. Normally this wouldn't have been a problem. But with limited hours to sleep the last thing I needed to hear was other late night inconvenienced guests dragging their luggage down the hallway. The room itself was clean and fairly basic. Four hours later, I returned to the lobby at the early side of the shuttle bus pick up time (4:15-4:30am). I mean really, you can't get more precise than that at that hour? So, in the end, I paid $254.44 for 4 hours of stressful sleep and terrible service. The low end properties can provide a better stay and save one a lot of money.

I was placed on the most recently renovated floor. The room was OK, but the bathroom was approximately 6' x 7' and circa 1950. Additionally, the bathroom was filthy with poor water pressure. The shower and toilet were obviously not touched with the renovation and helped to make the bathroom a complete disconnect from the room . The Hilton should have reduced the room size and increased the bathroom size to create a more modern and updated bathroom. Service was horrible from the front desk to the restaurant. I had communicated with a Front Desk Manager named Tim early the day of my arrival to pre-assign a room which was given away to another guest when we arrived. The front desk clerk lied and said the room was not ready only to be told a few minutes later by a Manager that the room was actually assigned to another guest. Why did it matter? It mattered because I was with my wife and 2 children and needed a room with 2 double beds and was given one with a king instead. In the morning when it was time to catch a shuttle to the airport I encountered a long line that I waited in for 30 minutes before deciding to take a cab to the airport. I barely made my flight. Anyway, the Hilton LAX simply does not need to care about service as they area very busy airport and convention hotel that gets booked solid and sold out frequently regardless of the rooms/service. It amazes me within the major chains that wear the names such as \"Hilton\" that the chains allow such discrepancies from hotel to hotel within the brand that are simply inconsistent. There are certain chains such as the Ritz Carlton or even the Hilton Garden Inn's where consistency amongst properties seems to be much more predictable. For people needed to spend a night at LAX who want a reasonably nice room that is updated and modern I suggest the Westin LAX. If you can afford to spend a bit more the Ritz Carlton Marina Del Rey is about 10 minutes from LAX, but a really terrific property.

Really sick. Ready to cry, wanting mommy sick. So by the time I retrieved my luggage and boarded the Hilton's shuttle (which arrived within moments and featured a very helpful and kind driver), all I wanted to do was crawl into bed and sleep. But check-in wasn't for a few hours and I worried that there might not be a room available for me. No need for the worry. While the hotel was bustling with people and activity, check-in was swift and a room was ready. The hotel clerk was very sweet and made the process painless. Within minutes, I was in my room on the renovated 9th floor and enjoying much needed slumber in a wonderfully comfy bed. And the room was quiet! I didn't hear a thing until my alarm went off hours later. Truly, the HIlton was a godsend to me. When I finally did arise and look around, I noted that the room was modern, very clean and extremely comfortable. There isn't free WiFi, but that wasn't important to me on this trip. My view was of the pool, which was closed for renovation but, I wasn't in need of a pool, so that didn't bother me. I could see the airport, which was kind of cool. If I really listened for it, I could hear planes landing and taking off, but it was faint noise and nothing that bothered me. There were complimentary ear plugs in the room. I never used them. Two days later, I was feeling much better and treated myself to the breakfast buffet. The options were many overall but I'm gluten free and, therefore, basically had fruit, scambled eggs and some bacon. It was quite a pricey breakfast and the quality was just average, but that's pretty typical of hotel food. I wasn't expecting more. The service was attentive and it was pleasant to sit, sip coffee and read the paper. There was a big conference going on the weekend I stayed here but, again, I wasn't bothered by any noise and got a kick out of seeing the unique attendees for this less-than-mainstream event. And even though the lobby was crowded, I never waited for service, got cabs quickly and felt well taken care of (many thanks to wonderful Tim in customer service). I took a trolley car into Manhattan Beach for $5 -- a cab would have cost me $30-- and that worked out well. The trolley stop is just outside the entrance of the hotel -- buy your ticket at the valet desk. The free shuttle to the airport was an excellent perk and eliminated any need to rent a car. I'd stay at the LAX Hilton again, happily. By the time I boarded the plane to return home I was feeling so much better.

We arrived at the Hilton a little after midnight, as we had a late flight in. Upon arriving at the hotel, we had to wait over 5 minutes for the Valet to greet us. There were three of them standing at the podium talking. After my husband waved them over they finally came and greeted us. Not the usual Valet service we get from the Hilton. The lobby was very nice and inviting, but that is pretty much where it ended for us. We were greeted by the front desk person, but she seemed as if she was tired or did not want to be there. We were given a room on the third floor. After stepping off the elevator, we got a very strong \"whiff\" of smoke, but thought maybe it was just the hall. As we walked further into the hotel towards our room the smoke odor got to the point it was unbearable. During this walk we also noticed the halls were dark and dingy and the carpets were stained and dirty. Upon arriving to our room the room was indeed a smoking room. Neither my husband nor I smoke and the smell was unbearable, so we asked for another room. We were moved to the 12th floor. The halls were still dark and dingy with stained carpet, but at least it did not stink of smoke. The condition of this hotel is nothing like you would expect from the Hilton. The room was dated; older furniture and a tube TV. The Bathroom baseboards had a lot of dust on them and the corners lacked cleaning. When we checked out the following morning we were told all was good, we had no balance since we pre-paid when we booked out hotel online. We asked about the Valet and the gentleman said it was not on our account so he was not going to charge us. When we tried to access our car, their automated system told us to check with the cashier. After going back and forth with the front desk we paid the $30 Valet fee (Plus tax) and they told us we had to go to the valet. The Valet desk said we had not paid, even though we had the receipt from the front desk. What a hassle! This took us over 30 minutes. All the while I was waiting outside, while my husband dealt with the above situation, and the gentleman there told me and my daughter that we could not wait there, I needed to go inside.

The Diamond lounge on the 16th floor had a nice continental breakfast with a fantastic view of the runways so could watch the planes land.

The wi-fi in the lounge was very weak so it was difficult to work. The bed, room, toiletries, coffee in the room was all first class. Check-in/check-out was very prompt.

They were building a large facility for the Air Force. They put thermostats throughout the building and even connected wires to them, but the wires from the thermostats dead-ended above the ceiling. The thermostats were merely there to entertain the occupants, not to actually control the temperature. The Hilton Los Angeles Airport seems to have employed this same construction company\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. While the fan control in the room does indeed control the fan speed, the thermostat seems to have no effect on the temperature of the air coming out of the vent. The air is cold, regardless of whether you turn the knob all the way to left to 60 degrees or turn the knob all the way to the right to 80 degrees. I mentioned the problem to the front desk the morning of the second day and was assured that the problem would be fixed. However, the second night was just as cold as the first night. Be sure to bring your thermal underwear because they only provide a very thin foam blanket for the bed. Other than that, this is a pretty functional and well maintained Hilton property that is convenient to the airport and reasonably priced. Here are some tips: 1. Parking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you are going to drive a rental car, you can pay for your parking in advance on their website and get a slight discount. After that, your credit card functions as your entry and exit card. I found this feature very nice. (See https://www.airportparkinglax.net/ for details) 2. Breakfast on 16th floor - If you are a Hilton HHonors Gold and above member, you can have a complimentary breakfast in the 16th floor lounge. Breakfast was a simple continental type (toast, pastries, fruit, cereal, hard boiled eggs) but it was adequate and the view of airplanes taking off was really pretty. It does get a bit crowded, but if you are patient, you can get a table when someone gets up to leave. I ate at the lounge both mornings. 3. Nice CuisineArt single/double coffee maker in room with Lavazza coffee. 4. Free internet for Hilton HHonors Gold and above. 5. Local Area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you are planning to drive around and look for local shops and restaurants, the areas to the east and south of the airport are scruffy and uncomfortable. However, the area just a few blocks north on Sepulveda Blvd is very nice with extensive, shiny new retail and nice, well maintained neighborhoods. 6. Dinner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I had a very entertaining dinner at the Buggy Whip Restaurant, about 10 minutes north of the airport on surface streets. The address is 7420 La Tijera Blvd and it is next to Interstate 405. This restaurant is an old establishment and is sort of a time-warp back to the 1960s. The hostess was delightful and served me personally in the bar. I had two excellent martinis and a very nice steak dinner including a salad with Green Goddess salad dressing (their specialty) and a bowl of home-made split-pea soup. The atmosphere was very nice. As I walked out, I noticed that they had a display of several posters of movies that had been filmed there.

I had a pleasant (and unplanned) stay at the Hilton LAX a while ago and based on that experience and wanting to give my mother a chance for a decent rest, decided to try their day rate option, $92 (with taxes) for a twin room (double beds) guaranteed available between 9am and 6pm. This turned out to be an act of genius on my part. I have colleagues who recommend other airport hotels but for us, the facilities at the LAX Hilton were fine. What do you want on a layover like this? A reasonably sized and clean room, comfortable beds, hot shower, early check in, and easy to navigate base for a bit of stopover shopping. Most importantly, no hassles. And the Hilton LAX delivered for us on all these elements. Since my last visit there have been some upgrades, the TV in our room was flatscreen with full cable options, and the bathroom amenities seemed better quality. Staff were very helpful and friendly, we were able to check in at 730am which was greatly appreciated, room was large and clean and the shuttle service was again excellent - very professional. The hotel is always well-staffed and the lobby areas are very well appointed. It was great to be able to have a shower and sleep for a couple of hours in comfort, do some shopping then get ourselves organised for the LAX to Sydney flight. We even had time for a cocktail in the bar. For the price it was a sensible investment that kept Mum and me happy after one long flight and before another. Minor downside was the pool closed for renovations but we wouldn't have used it anyway. Our floor (level 3) smelt quite strongly of cigarette smoke but the room did not. There are no in-room safes or mini-bars, and wifi is charged by the day ($12.95) or hour ($5.95). With a couple more upgrades to the rooms the hotel would be improved but overall I was pleased with the rate, service and facilities. I would recommend this option for a day room for anyone in a similar situation, and will be booking this for myself in the future if I have a long break between flights.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin-TX", "Title": "\u201cAverage rooms, dated furniture and old carpeting\u201d", "Author": "traveler5125", "ReviewID": "UR120800672", "Content": "1) Italian style casual restaurant in addition to hotel restaurant - great for getting a bite to eat at semi-reasonable prices (vs. room service or eating at the hotel restaurant).

We encountered a strange interaction on the 17th floor between a man and a woman which concerned us. We also noticed a uniformed Hilton security guard standing near the front desk. The room was shabby, with outdated furnishings and a toilet that didn't work. Thank heavens we had access to the exec lounge as we used the toilet there rather than wait for ours to be repaired. An electric outlet we tried to use in our room also did not work. The TV was not flat screened - I can't even remember when I last stayed at ANY hotel that did not have a flat screen TV. Yes, I am aware that the hotel is renovating its rooms, but for me it was too late. The exec lounge was OK - nothing exciting about it and the food offerings were average at best. Now for the good points: The bed was comfy and the view of the airport was great. Would I stay here again??? Definitely not. I'm a Hilton Diamond member and stay at a lot of Hiltons and would not stay here again.

The vehicle's highest point is 6'0\" off the ground. I'm 6'3\". Are you telling me that I would have to crouch down to walk in the parking garage? That the ceiling in the structure is less than 6 feet high? I call bulls%&t. The representative at check-in was exceptional, very engaging and seemed genuinely happy to be working. I've read below that people have labeled this place modern. I have stayed at many a $69-$120 hotels that at least have a modern flat screen TV. Our room on the 9th floor was equipped with an old-school cathode ray tube 27\" TV with a curved screen. The bathroom was so tiny, that if you are sitting on the toilet, the door cannot be opened. The temperature control consists of this ancient rotary knob labeled 40, 60, 80, 100. The fan control is a completely separate type of toggle switch. This place is stuck in 1981. This hardly seems like a good representation of the Hilton brand minutes away from the airport in the 2nd largest city in the US. The final nail in the coffin was coffee on the way out while we were waiting on the valet. The coffee shop touts that they sell Starbucks. We got two iced coffees to go. They tasted days old and completely watered down. Neither one of us could drink them, and we're not coffee snobs. Starbucks needs to be aware that the LAX Hilton is selling swill with their name on it.

I stay at this hotel often when I'm in Los Angeles for work, as my meetings are always in the building adjacent to this hotel, so it's very conveniently located. However, the hotel is only about half a mile outside of the entrance of the LAX airport, so it's also ideally situated for anyone who has an early or late flight out of LAX and wants to be nearby the airport. The hotel has a complimentary airport shuttle, which is very convenient. The rooms are large and comfortable, with many amenities that travelers value, such as wired internet (for a fee), power outlets, coffee/tea maker in room, hairdryer, and name brand toiletries in the bathroom. The bathroom towels were soft, the bed linens were soft and high quality, the pillows were cushy, and the bed was amazingly comfortable (all very typical of Hilton linens/beds). The room I was in had an old tube-style TV rather than a flat screen, and wired internet instead of wireless -- so a few updates to the amenities in the rooms might be nice. This hotel also has many other amenities that guests may value -- multiple onsite restaurants, a business center, fitness center, convention center, gift shop, room service, concierge desk, swimming pool and more. The only downside to this hotel is the noise from the airplanes taking off and landing, as the hotel is literally across the street from the LAX runway. As LAX never really shuts down (the cargo planes and flights departing for Asia/Australia depart late at night/very early morning), the noise from the planes can be bothersome when trying to sleep. Although this is something that the traveler would just have to expect when staying at a hotel located across from a major airport, you might want to bring ear plugs to help you sleep.

That being said, do they really need to charge around $30 for one egg, an order of toast and a cup of coffee? Can we not get a chicken or tuna sandwich in the bistro?

Of the airport hotels in the area I find this property to be as good as or better than the others. The Sheraton nearby wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t nearly as nice a few months ago. The Radisson (the old Hyatt for those of us in our 40s) looks terrible from the outside, but has been redone inside. The Westin , while nice on my last visit, has received mixed reviews and it is the newest one on the strip of the major hotel brands. The Marriott, as old as the other properties was nice when I had an unexpected missed flight several months ago. All in all, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m happy at the Hilton. The executive lounge on the 16th floor is open for breakfast and then again in the evening. I'm not sure why they close and do not allow access to the lounge during the day, but I found this to be a downside. It can be nice to go to the lounge during the day for a beverage and regroup before moving on to other activities. The lounge does have a nice view of the airport and it can be fun watching the airplanes land and take off from the venue. When we made our reservation we opted to upgrade to a larger suite upon check in. We ended up having one of the suites with two adjoining rooms. Since we were traveling with our children the extra space always comes in handy. The large dining room or boardroom table in the middle suite area worked out well for a morning breakfast. The hotel is older and that means small bathrooms. I don't know that the property can overcome the small bathrooms by remodeling. For now, and probably the future, the hotel will have to suffer with the bathroom that is barely large enough for one person. The furniture feels dated, but the room was clean and acceptable. The bed was comfortable. While I seldom use a TV when staying at a hotel, I was surprised that the TV was so dated. The hotel works great when you are getting into LA late at night and you are on a different time zone and need a place to sleep. It also works great if you are visiting LA and want a hotel that is convenient to places both north and south. Yes, traffic can get bad in LA, but I have often found this hotel a good place to base when visiting the city. I used the Parking Spot garage next door and the parking was only about $18. I didn't park at the Hilton because I had a large SUV and it wouldn't fit into the garage area.

I rented a car and parked it in their garage; it's not cheap - something around $20. Luckily, my employer was paying the expenses on this trip. The hotel is large, maybe too large, which means as an airport property, a lot of people are arriving an leaving at all hours. Check in was smooth. As a Hilton Honors Gold member, I got a room near the top floors facing south towards the south runways of LAX. I found very little noise creeping into the room. Overall, the room was 3.5 stars, definitely not a 4 star, due to its very basic room, amenties, decor, and bathroom. The desk area was not the best lit for work but not so dark that I couldn't see my paperwork. The bed was comfortable, with good lighting on the nightstand. The carpets were clean and the furniture not all beat up like what one often sees at airport properties. The bathroom, which can often make or break my star rating with a hotel after the bed and the room cleanliness, was quite basic, nothing to brag about or a place where you want to leisurly take care of your bathroom and vanity responsibilities, but was efficient nonethless. Due to my status with Hilton, the room had upscale bathroom products (Peter Thomas Roth), which are very nice and I'd say a step above the standard C&E products at most Hilton properties. The following morning around 7:30 am I went down to the lobby area to partake of the complimentary breakfast buffet that was included in my rate presumably due to my status. It seemed to be chaos with no one at the front podium to handle the greeting, and a lot of people surrounding the buffet tables piling on the food like most buffet lines. I immediately left, went up to the Executive Club, and partook of the Continental breakfast offering up there with a nice view of the airport runways to boot. It was the best decision I made that day. Another drawback: The elevators in this hotel are clearly inadequate in capacity and number, which can lead to long waits for an elevator car, especially during the peak morning hour when everyone seems to be heading to the restaurant. I waited close to 5 minutes for an elevator on my way down to the restaurant. Several hotel staff were waiting for an elevator car to transport their service carts to another floor and when I left the downstairs restaurant and went up to the Executive Club, those hotel staff were still waiting to get themselves on an elevator (not sure why they weren't using a service elevator, if they are available). Check out was quick and painless. It's a good airport hotel but not much else. Best part was the Executive Club where it was quiet and peaceful with a satisfactory Continental breakfast spread. Worst part was the long elevator wait. Would I stay here again? Yes, if I did not have a car with me (and have to pay parking) and surely for not more than 24 hours.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "MIAMI, FLORIDA, USA", "Title": "\u201cOK Hotel but in needs updating!\u201d", "Author": "VIAJONOW", "ReviewID": "UR117539341", "Content": "This is a nice hotel but it really needs some updating!

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found $99 rooms here many times, which is great, considering it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a full-service Hilton property and the aforementioned hotels go for between $120-150. I guess Hilton is very proactive about keeping the rooms full every night, because it seems very crowded whenever I check in here. Rooms are all nice, clean, and up to Hilton standards, though the bathrooms are usually a bit old-fashioned (always clean though). There is a fitness center on site, a full service restaurant and bar area, as well as an executive lounge for HHonors elites. Both are nice but not exceptionally good.

The front did not seem to be very concerned about this when we inquired. Probably, this is not uncommon. Another (minor?) complaint is that the outdoor pool is apparently a smoking area. Yes, not just outside, but inside as well. There were a few smokers around the pool area, who even looked like employees of Hilton because they all were wearing the same white shirts. However, there are four whirlpools at every corner of the pool, so that was a good side. To be fair, the room was okay except that our room had a priceline view, which I don't mind.

Can be quite time consuming if you have locked yourself out of your room :) The hotel has pretty much everything you might need such as a pool, gym and three restaurants depending what you are in the mood for. My only small annoyance about the gym was that the treadmills squeaked a lot while you run. After 5 miles I was really missing my IPod! Other than that, everything was clean and I enjoyed my workout. The hotel's food was really good, I especially enjoyed their Italiano Pizza, really a different bit of a twist to an old favourite. Breakfast was in the form of a buffet and everything was well prepared and tasty. There are no fridges in the rooms so be sure to not take too much take aways! My only real complaint about this hotel is the noise. I cannot fathom why the hallway noise permeates into the rooms so much. If someone opens their door across the hall, it sounds like your door opening. I did a little test and I could hear my wife approaching on her flip flops while lying on the bed almost as soon as she steps out of the elevator.

I have to mention that if you do decide to park yourself, the parking lot goes down to six levels underground and even then, it's still hard to find parking, especially in the weekends when there are events in the hotel ballroom. 4. Excellent restaurant and cafe. 5. There is a Hertz counter in the parking lot, which could make your trip that much more convenient. Remember when booking on Hertz website to indicate your pick up and drop off as LAX Hilton, not LAX itself. The only bad thing I could say about this hotel is that sometimes the noise from the hallway is really audible in the room and vice versa. If you are a light sleeper, this might become an issue. Also, the internet here is NOT free. I forget exactly how much it is, but I remember that it was quite expensive, which is why I did not use it.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cVery conveinant to the airport, comfortable bed\u201d", "Author": "FlyingMan11", "ReviewID": "UR112987316", "Content": "This hotel was very convenient to LAX literally 5 minutes from the airport.

Not a problem. When we came back, the guy working at the front desk honored our request of two beds on a high floor. He gave us a room on the 9th floor, and said that was the highest floor that has two beds. When we went up to it, it was the most atrocious inner-corner room I've ever seen!! This had to have been one of the Priceline rooms (If you used Priceline, BEWARE!!). The window was so small, and the view so obstructed that it really could give someone a claustrophobic feeling. I took one look at it and went back down to the Front Desk. Fortunately, a sympathetic agent gave us a normal room on the 10th floor that had two beds. So, obviously the first Front Desk clerk lied to us about not having rooms with 2 beds higher than the 9th floor. I know this is a really small point to lie about, but the principle of being lied to made me feel incredibly unwelcome during my entire stay. *Rooms*: Our room was really outdated and worn. From the old tube TV to the peeling wallpaper by the window, our room had seen better days. The bathroom was nice, though. *Location*: There were no solid places to eat within walking distance, unless you consider Carl Jr's solid. The hotel has several restaurants, but unless you're on an expense account...yeah. Oh, and I totally agree with the previous reviewer about the elevator drama. Seriously, there was nothing like going to the elevator bank and seeing an out-of-service elevator resting a foot above floor-level. Overall: The bed was very comfortable, and I slept well.

It had that motel style TV with 20 or so channels, and the movie menu. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. A big problem was that I needed the internet for work, and it didn't function. But I have no complaints about that I suppose because the hotel generously refunded the internet fee. The parking price is slightly absorbant but I do recomend using it, as opposed to the cheaper surrounding parking complexes, because 1. It's convienient to take an elevator to your car (even if the car is in a maze 6 floors underground) and 2. The area around the hotel didn't seem like the safest place to be walking around at night. The front desk people were pretty friendly. An important fact might be that you can hear each time an airplane takes off. While this didn't bother me (I might even consider it soothing), the noise has the potential to keep some insomniacs up all night. The bathrooms were pretty small and had a \"motel feel\". I personally had a nice view of the airport and got to see all the planes take off in room 1147. All in all, It's a decent place to stay if you need somewhere to stay for a connecting flight, or short trip of that type of nature. I however would not recoment spending your whole Los Angeles vacation there.

If you are a Hilton HHonors member, there are other, likely better Hilton-brand options to consider (like the Embassy Suites North or the Hilton Garden Inn - I've stayed at both hotels and they are good options). If you are not tied to the Hilton family of hotels, there are probably much better options located close to the hotel. Getting to the hotel from LAX is via shuttle bus. The hotel no longer operates its own shuttle, but uses a contractor. Shuttles serve more than one hotel. The buses are old, loud, and uncomfortable. The shuttle makes its first stop at the Hilton; on the way to the airport, you will make at least one stop at another hotel. Keep this in mind when planning out how long it will take you to get back to the airport. When the shuttle arrives at the hotel, it's a race to the checkin counter at the back of the hotel. If you're slow, you will wait to check in. My checkin took about 10 minutes and was handled in a competent if not particularly welcoming manner. This Hilton is tired. When was the last time you had a room with an old-style television with a picture tube? The hotel hasn't upgraded to flat panel televisions. Common areas are worn down. My room was dark and small, with what felt like a very low ceiling. The walls were scuffed, wall paper was peeling away, and the bathroom was cramped and not particularly clean. The room's HVAC system was anemic and the construction of the building allowed noise (jets taking off) into the room, making sleep difficult. My bottom line is that this hotel is only acceptable when transiting LAX (which I was doing) and solely on the basis of its location so close to LAX.

As for housekeeping--we had 3 in the room and it should have been obvious that we were in desperate need of shampoo, conditioner, and lotion in the midst of our stay. But we did not receive replacement bottles during her cleaning. Thankfully I had a bit of shampoo left over from my previous trip. The front desk staff was actually quite friendly and accommodating. The entire first floor was a rat race because of a conference held there, so it wasn't exactly easy to get around. Getting an elevator was crazy at times. The most disappointing aspect of our stay: Towers Level Concierge breakfast. We did pay more for a concierge level room. With that, guests should have had fully stocked breads, pastry, fruit, and juice choices. Upon our arrival, the platters were wiped out. We could have selected some wheat bread for toast and I saw 5-6 slices of cantaloupe. The orange juice pitcher had enough juice to fill 1/2 glass. We looked for a table or lounge area to wait for more food to come out, but every empty table was stacked with used dishes, etc. After about 10 minutes, the croissant platter was refilled and the orange juice was refilled, but the other platters remained empty. We moved dirty dishes and wiped the table clean ourselves so that we could sit down. This sort of experience is easily found at a budget motel, not at a concierge level service where guests have paid to be there. I found it inexcusable. If in the LAX hotel area again, I will definitely look for a different place to stay.

The cherry on top was when they failed to put my bill under my door, causing me to have to wait in another long line to check out. When I finally got a copy of my bill, they had charged someone's $18 lunch to my room. When I told the desk clerk it wasn't mine as I was at work all day, she pointedly said \"Well, I will have to get a manager to approve taking off the charge and that's going to take a while\".

That's how I felt about my recent stay at the the Hilton LAX. I still recognised the vibrant hotel I once knew, but could see its age, the years having taken their toll. I must say that the spirit was still there. The staff were fantastic; friendly, helpful and considerate. But the signs of age were hard to miss. The rooms felt tired. Old fixtures, large boxy CRT televisions, no mini bar and an \"oldish\" phone. Some of the floors (the pool level) had a lingering cigarette smoke odour. As with many hotels, like the Hilton, it seems the more you pay for a room, the more you'll be asked to pay for extras. Internet? $13.00 a day (even if you get 7 days as a package). A warm soft drink from the machine in the hall? $3.00. Park your car? $20.00 a day. Print a colour page from the computer? About $5.00. Of course, all these things don't make the hotel bad. I'd stay again. It's location is great. Service is top notch and the rooms are comfortable. The weight room is modern and large. And the outdoor pool and spas are heated. The water pressure in the bathroom showers was surprising refreshing! If there is a water shortage anywhere in the Western USA, I'd look to the Hilton as a possible cause. The hotel is relatively well soundproofed, although you will know when planes are taking off if your room is located on the East-facing side.

Had just come from another conference where I stayed at for $70/nite at a LaQuinta about 2 blocks away and frankly I preferred the La Quinta for service and value. Not quite sure what it is about the \"brand name hotels\" that requires you to pay more for the room and then pay again for everything on top of that. Want to dial a local call or a 1-800 $2 to start and then another charge per minute. Want the internet - pay $12 something per day. Want one stamp from the convience store on site for a letter - no problem but you can only buy in packs of 2 and for almost double stamp face value. No fridge. No microwave. The shower was worse then the one at La Quinta... the bed however was definately better as was the view. Hint for you all though, be sure you are not given a room ending in the 01-02-03 range on any floor here or you will be beside the nexus center of all wings of the hotel for laundry chute, garbage and housekeeping which means lots of doors, clanging, noise and social chatting early morning - late afternoon. Night was okay... I did mention the bed was nice though right ? The thing that really pissed me off though this stay is I got an email after my initial reservation asking me if I was willing to accept an upgrade at time of arrival if available. Sure. Nicer room, view and free executive lounge access. So I arrive, its my lucky day, I get the upgrade but then Im told that the executive lounge is closed for renovation on my floor and a temporary one is on floor 2. I ask if I can pull out from the deal as that isnt what I signed up for. Nope - its too late. Whatever. The \"special room\" seems just like everyone elses room - nicer headboard but not sure what else ? The view was definitely stunning. Full marks for that but Im at a conference - I get to look out of it for 1 min in the morning and 1 min in the evening before bed.. so the real upgrade, was for me all about the executive lounge access. But the temporary \"executive lounge\" turns out to be a small meeting room with zero ambience and far too small for the number of people using it. Routinely people are standing up to eat or just leaving and eating somewhere outside of the room as there is no available table space. Breakfast is fine - bread, pastry, cereal, fruit and hard boiled eggs (LaQuinta's was far better!!!). But the evening snacks were a problem. Although advertising as available 5- 7pm they routinely were emptied out early on and there was little to no interest by staff to request refills so night after night I arrived to bare cupboards with nothing left to eat at all .... Frankly, I just dont get it. Although many were in the lounge for free as part of their points reward system... I PAID FOR THIS and I simply didnt get what I paid for.. in fairness though - at 7 they would bring out desserts and they were usually to die for and extremely yummie... but... I usually dont eat desserts ... I wanted food ! So at the end of the day what the \"upgrade\" turned out to be (after taxes) was $17.10/day for a hardboiled egg, toast and fruit for breakfast... not a particularly good deal... one would hope things are better than this when the lounge renovations are completed....but in the mean time.. not worth the upgrade... The conference facilities were nice and the lobby area of the hotel is very homey with lots of places to sit and mingle. The rooms are okay. Nothing bad but nothing to die for.

It was only open until 10 a.m. and at night so there is no place for things like bottled water, diet coke, etc during the day (again no big deal since I left at 11 a.m.). there was an employee checking room key holders to make sure only authorized guests went in and this guy was very friendly. The breakfast /exec lounge was my complaint I had with this hotel. It was a conference room and every table top had stained table clothes on it.

Not so. From arrogant, unfriendly and wanna-be unhelpful front desk staff to rude bell hops to housekeeping staff who did not know sufficient English to understand my requests, the stay was just one unpleasant experience after another. (The security staff were, without exception, friendly and helpful though.) My initial impression of the rooms I was in was of dark, and a faint smell that I finally identified as smoky. The bathrooms were tiny and uncomfortable, given the star rating of the hotel, and I certainly expected better space in the room itself. Although the nightly rate is good, once you're at the hotel, everything costs. Local phone calls, refrigerators, laundry etc. all cost far more than other hotels of similar class. And they don't even necessarily work properly: the fridge in the first room that I had froze everything that I put in it. Although the website does state that there is a smoking floor in the hotel, it does not indicate that non-smokers on other floors will still be required to share the smoking experience in the form of smelly bed linen. The towels in the bathroom stank of old kitchen oil. Having asked for a room in a quiet part of the hotel, I was given a room on the floor that serves the airline trade. Apparently the staff were doing me a favour by giving me a room 2 hours ahead of the usual check-in time (I had been travelling all night and was tired of falling asleep in the lobby). But until midnight, I had to listen to knocking on doors and 'Housekeeping', 'Housekeeping' calls. I eventually asked for a different room and was given one on a quieter floor. My booking was for a room with a king-size bed at a specific rate. At check in, I was told that this was my preference only, and that it was subject to availability. First I've heard of this. Most insulting of all, however, are the constant reminders around the hotel to please rate them a 10 out of 10. This extends as far as separate boxes at the check in desk to drop your room keys in: one if you rate the hotel above an 8, and the other for less than 8. The final bill that is slipped in under the door also has a long discourse about rating the hotel favourably. No surprises which box my keys went into.

We arrived in Los Angeles a day prior to boarding the cruise ship and spent the evening at the Hilton Los Angeles. Everything was going wonderfully. We checked in, hung a few clothes in the closet, called our niece who lives in the LA area to join us for dinner, had a night cap, and then bedded down for the night. The next morning we packed up, checked out, got all our luggage loaded up and headed out to the cruise terminal at Long Beach. So far, so good, right? Well, after checking in for the cruise, once in our stateroom, we started to unpack and put everything away for a wonderful week at sea. Upon opening our suitcases, I start wondering where my suit was? Where were my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dresses which were hanging up? All my dress shirts, and dress slacks? After the panic subsides, I start retracing our steps in an attempt to figure out when I last saw them. I realized I hung them up in our room back at the Hilton so they would stay pressed and fresh. I now realize, I had forgotten all about them and left them hanging in the closet in our room at the hotel. After some prior bad experiences with my wife leaving some clothes at the Hilton in Pensacola, FL, which we never received back, I was certain these would be gone by the time we returned from our week long cruise. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much time from when we disembarked off the cruise ship to make our return flight back to DFW, so we did not get the opportunity to call, let alone stop back by the LAX Hilton. Again, more reason to believe the clothes were gone for sure. But I want to tell you, I was very pleasantly surprised when we got back home and I called about the missing clothes. From the front desk personnel who said Security would be the place to check, to the Security personnel who had them and once I gave my room number and date of stay, he knew right where they were. I would like to give the Housekeeping person doing up the room to everybody else involved right down to the Security person who mailed the clothes back to us, the biggest thank-you. If there were some way for you to track down the individuals involved and provide them with some form of recognition, you should really do that. It is employees like these that provide the right kind of customer experience. We too frequently focus on individuals only when they do something wrong. If we focused on their positive practices, the positive experiences would continue to multiply. I know that I will be choosing to stay at a Hilton hotel when provided the opportunity.

Well, that wasn't quite correct, and we were faced with having to try and carry all our bags through the garage and take an elevator four floors up to the lobby from the parking garage. We decided to leave our bags in the car and check in first... and the front desk was very apologetic when we asked for a bell cart. They sent a bellman all the way down into the parking garage with us to help with the rest of our bags we'd left in the car. They recovered very well from this oversight. We felt completely safe and very taken care of here. A few things to note: the garage ceilings are VERY low.... our Ford Explorer barely made it to the regular parking spaces. There is a sign that states if you have a high profile car, you will have to use the valet parking. Food in the restaurant and cafe is a bit pricey, but there are plenty of choices to be had. They offer complimentary printing of boarding passes in the lobby, which was great! We had no problems catching their free shuttle to the airport at 8AM, but when we returned to the hotel, it seemed the outbound airport shuttle had at least a 30-40 minute wait.

There is an outdoor pool on one of the upper levels, but it's quite small and of course there's lots of airliner noise to contend with.

The shuttle is shared with the Four Points LAX that is very close by. The path seems to be LAX Arrivals>LAX Hilton>Four Points>LAX Departures. The schedule is posted as every 15 minutes from the hotel. Check In: Hilton Honors line was short and the agent was friendly enough. Since my rate included breakfast I slected internet as my Hilton Honors Gold property ammenity. This created confusion as the check in lady said I would not get breakfast as my rate was too low and she upgraded me to the towers floor. I told her to check again as my rate did include breakfast and I didnt care about the towers level. She did find the info and gave me the breakfast certs. She did not downgrade me to a regular room though but it did not matter as I consider US lounges useless. Room: Nothing special here...same old room I remember from before only with a little newer carpet and a much more comfortable bed. Dining: We arrived late and the bar is open late but has a limited menu after 10PM but enough for us. The service has always been good at the lounge and the prices pretty reasonable for a hotel. There is fast food within walking distance but not much else unless you want to walk over to the Four Points. Breakfast was standard Hilton buffet fare and again nothing exciting but they will make eggs to order for you if you ask and the service is generally pretty good in the cafe. They also have a 24 hour cafe that is basically pizza, sandwiches and coffee which is also convenient. Car rental: I used the Hertz that is located in the lobby on this trip and have used it in the past as well. I got a rate of about $25 all in for the day and always had pretty good luck with the person running the rental desk as Hertz Gold member he basically tells me what he has and lets me pick.

If you have an early flight the next day then it is probably perfect for you. We weren't. We got the room on Priceline and were excited that it was only going to cost us $50 a night. Well after the fees it was $65 a night. When we checked in we were told our truck was too big for self park so we were required to use valet. So now it is $85 a night. (We also factored in that there was no included breakfast which basically brought our rate to about $115 because we had to buy something to eat). We paid the $20 self park rate instead of the $30 valet rate, which sounded like a great thing. Until we needed our truck. We were in and out of the hotel all day each day and the wait for valet was not terrible, but very inconvenient for what we needed. Factor in the fact that this hotel is big so it took us longer to get to lobby from our room. Getting into our car took us about 10-15 minutes. Which may not seem like very much time, but if you think about how long it takes you to get from your house to your car it is an eternity. Not to mention we were lugging hockey equipment along with us. The hotel was very busy both nights we stayed. They were having some kind of convention and when we walked into the lobby around 9:30pm it was like walking through a nightclub. Crowded and loud. Food in the cafe was pricey and line moves very slowly. We won't stay there again simply because it was too inconvenient for us. However, the staff seemed nice enough. We decided that for us, staying on the other side of LAX in El Segundo is more our style, there the hotel may be $90-$115 a night, but no valet, no conventions and breakfast included. And for 5 of us that sounds easier. All in all, I would recommend this hotel if you have a flight to catch, or if you are sightseeing and have no time table. It's not a bad hotel.

I got this property for $47 a night on priceline for a 3-night stay in LA. Wanted a somewhat central location to venture out to various areas.

The location is ok but would have preferred something closer to the 405 and without a horrendous parking garage with spaces so small you could literally park and not be able to open your doors.

They almost completely black out the room! Best hotel curtains ever.... I woke up at 10:30am and thought it was the middle of the night...excellent if you want to sleep in!

Checking in, I have always been welcomed back. The Executive Lounge is a nice perk here, and it hasn't been overly crowded. The pu puus are pretty good too. One thing to be wary of, however, is the fact that the Hilton LAX is the hotel of choice for distressed travelers. I have seen two occasions where Trans Atlantic/TransPac flights (747s) were cancelled, and the airlines sent their customers to the Hilton. This creates chaos where the lines have extended out the door. I don't know if there is any planning around this, but generally the hotel gets very busy, every day during the early-to-late evenings (5:30--8:00pm). I've never had any issues checking in mid-afternoon or late in the evening (after 9:00pm). Thus, if at all possible, I would recommend trying to avoid the rush hour or prepare for a bit of a wait.

What destroyed the experience was the check in process. I arrived at 9:30 PM on a Friday night and the line to check in went from the front desk almost out the front door in the lobby. If you have been to this Hilton, you know the length of the lobby is a good distance. The line was 1 hour long to check in. The automated check in kiosks kept bombing out and would not let me check in. The front desk was simply way understaffed and overworked. For the weary traveler, this just made the entire experience all the more unmemorable and left an incredibly bad impression. Due to the fact that the vast majority of the reservations are made in advanced and the hotel is aware of how many people need to check in on a given day, the Hilton LAX management should have been on top of this issue. While we are on the complaint wagon - a general warning. You do not want a room anywhere near the eleveators. I was the second room over and I heard the elevator cars running all night long. If you work in a mine shaft and enjoy the background noise, you may be ok. Otherwise insist on being in a room away from the eleveators. One other thing to note on this property - this is not a deal killer, but if you experience the aforementioned hassle, parking is not cheap. The parking garage is extremely tight and is $20 for self park and the garage clearance is only 5' 8\". You may not use the airport parking rates as they impose a minimum stay and of course if you move your car, it voids the rate. Hilton and its private equity owner, Blackstone, need to realize the branding and service is all they have to win over the business and casual traveler.

I also independently googled this hotel to get a more detailed description of room accommodations. On Hilton's website, they list every room as having WiFi access. There's no mention of any additional costs. So, I completed by booking on hotels.com. The next day, I happen to read a review online indicating that there's a $13 charge for 24hr internet access. While I was willing to pay the $20 per day parking fee, I was not about to pay $13 for 1 - 2 hours of internet connection that I would need each day. Thus, I called Hilton's front desk and guest services. I informed them of the fact that their web site does not indicate that WiFi access in each room would cost an arm and a leg.

We were very pleased with our decision. The hotel itself is modern and is nicely decorated with a variety of paintings and art. Also, it has a full service gift shop, restaurants, a full gym with treadmills, elliptical machines, weights, etc. Most importantly, our room was very quiet, did not let outside light in, and the bed was comfortable. Also, it had a nice flat screen TV. The bathroom was clean and had the basic amenities one would expect. The only downside to the room is that it seemed slightly smaller than others I've stayed in. For instance, since there was not an abundance of open floor space, there was little room to spread out a suitcase. This might be an issue for people traveling with kids (i.e. that need a place for a crib) or those with lots of luggage. So, it might be a good idea to verify with the hotel for those situations. We had to pay for parking ($20/nt) and that is a bit of a negative! It would be nice to be offered a more discounted rate. But, if you don't have a car, this hotel does offer an airport shuttle. We were offered the option of pre-paying for their breakfast buffet at $15 (inclusive of tax). Apparently, by pre-paying we saved over the regular price. Overall, we liked the breakfast. The servers, however, were not attentive and I'd rate their overall restaurant customer service as poor. My wife and I used the gym (located on the lower level).

It's also located close to most of the car rental spots, so renting and returning a car was easy (hotel self-parking is $18/day). All the staff I encountered were friendly and attentive, and a couple service requests were taken care of seemlessly. There is a fitness center and it's free, although I didn't use it. Also, I didn't eat at any of the restaurants. The rooms (at about $110/nt) were clean and of good enough size, even if a tad bit dated. For my purposes it was perfect. I wasn't in LA to hang out in the hotel, and the city is not for walking so to me, since I was driving, it didn't matter where I was staying. The 405 freeway is right down the street, so getting around was pretty easy (notwithstanding the LA traffic). The only potential downside to me is that if your room is facing the airport (and mine was) you will hear some noise from airplanes taking off, but it didn't wake me up so I didn't consider it a big deal but I am a fairly heavy sleeper. On the whole, LA is a monster, so the ease of access to LAX made the airport location really ideal. And the value for the money was really good.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed here many, many times in the past as this is my airlines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 designated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crew\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel at LAX for short stays- and this stay was yet another one-night LAX layover. I really like this hotel. For starters the lobby is large and expansive and inviting... Not a typical hotel-lobby... Even the driveway leading to the front doors are grand-- and very large and quite busy... The main lobby is tastefully done in light taupe colors; very relaxing and cool in feeling; a nice change from the heat and humidity of the LA basin... Check-in was swift as always\u00e2\u20ac\u201das an airline employee our rooms are pre-paid and pre-assigned, and check-in is always hassle-free. My room was fitted with a standard sized king bed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcomplete with down-filled comforter, cover sheets and bolster pillows. The color palette is similar to that of the lobby\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnatural light woods, light taupe and shades brown.. Most all rooms are also fitted for those who need to do a little business as well.. There is a full sized business desk, complete with multiple electrical outlets and good lighting. The TV was a remote flat screen with full range of domestic and selected foreign language programming. A small sitting chair and coffee table, as well as a personal sized coffee maker with complimentary supplies were a nice touch... The half-sized closet allowed me to hang some clothes and there was mini ironing board and iron inside. The bathroom was equipped with a standard tub/shower combination. Water runs hot with excellent water pressure. They stock a good range of complimentary pre and post-bath toiletries, along with a full sized anti-fog make-up mirror with an attached wall mounted hair dryer. My specific room was one floor above, and facing the outdoor swimming pool... Despite this location, you could not hear *anything*\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpool noise OR overhead low-flying aircraft, thru the double-thick glazed and tinted glass... One nice feature that I really liked was the floor length \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blackout\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd drapes, that when closed render the room near pitch dark regardless of outside light conditions\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnice for people like me who have to catch a nap during the daytime. The hotel has three restaurants on property; a 24/7 bistro that serves small snack\u00e2\u20ac\u201dboth hot and cold-- as well as a range of beverages.. There is also a traditional coffee shop-like venue and a more formal sit-down restaurant that serves primarily Italian fare. The hotel has a mini-exercise room, filled with workout machines, all in one windowless room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Good for a workout? Yes, but makes me a bit claustrophobic without a view outside\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I do like the large outdoor pool which has several small 2-person tables where you can enjoy a poolside meal, snack or beverage.. Even the rooms just adjacent to the pool get very little, if any, discernible pool noise.. The sound insulation *is* that good! Since I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have access to a car while here, I normally walk along West Century Blvd. to one of the local restaurants along this busy street. For a wider selection I can also very easily take a short taxi ride to any of the close-by shopping centers if I want something different or specific. LA really is a heaven for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153foodies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.. Overall, I really like this hotel.. Everyone on their staff treats their guests well and knows what a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153road warrior\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd needs and expects from an airport hotel... You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a reliably clean room with a good bed and furnishings- everything functioning properly; nice in-house amenities and guest services.. While I would like to see a better selection of on-property dining options, the hotels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 location makes walking (or a short taxi ride) to many area restaurants quite easy... I give this hotel very favorable rating and would recommend them without hesitation. ** PROS: This location knows what it takes to be an airport hotel and is constructed with that in mind. Excellent sound and light insulation make getting some decent rest very possible. Staff are always polite, willing to help and generally cheerful. ** CONS: Since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to the airport, there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as many options for casual dining or shopping that are within true walking distance.

They were nickel-and-diming me all the way. 1. The carpet in the corridor is not very clean and it smelled weird there. The pool area was no better - actually, much worse. I wouldn't recommend going barefoot anywhere in that area. It's just dirty. 2. The coffee maker in the room was broken - it made 1/8 cup of coffee and then turned off. So if you want a full cup, you have to ask it 8 times. Of course, by then the cup is almost all cold. Good luck making tea with it, if you don't like ice tea. 3. Once we have used the provided tea packs, room service didn't bother to replace them. Probably saved them a cent or so. 4. There's no free internet access in the business center and no free printing. I am staying in various hotels a lot and wasn't used before to being charged dollar-a-minute for printing a simple page of driving directions. I was used to getting it for free, as it was in most hotels of this class I visited. Hilton, however, decided to save yet another 1/10 of a cent. 5. Most hotels provide some sort of paper for the guests to write on. Hilton has post-it notes. Literally - tiny squares of paper, and that's it. If you want to write down something that's not 3 words - good luck, Hilton is not going to help, go find an Office Depot and buy it yourself. Here, another cent saved for Hilton. 6. Parking pricing is outrageous - I've parked cheaper in San-Francisco downtown, no discounts or anything for hotel guests - but don't expect that to mean easy and convenient parking. Parking lot is crammed, and spending 10 minutes looking for a random place somebody didn't notice, or trying to fit your car into the space that nobody dared to use because it's too small - is routine. All while a bunch of spaces stay empty - but general public is not allowed there, probably so that they can charge you 150% for valet parking in the same spot, in addition to the outrageous price paid for the parking - which a lot of hotels of this class provide for free. In Hilton, I not only got charged for it - I got charged twice in one of the days. They can't even make their system work properly. Summarily, the personnel of the hotel was very nice, welcoming and pleasant. They did what they could. However, the hotel itself fell below the expectations - I paid more than I expected to pay for less than I expected to get from Hilton. I understand the economy is tough and everybody has to save, but saving on a couple of sheets of paper and a couple of tea bags is too much for me. When I go to a brand-name hotel like Hilton I don't expect that. After this stay I would think twice - no, a dozen times - before ever staying at a Hilton establishment again.

I travel a lot all over the world, and this hotel cleary capitalizes on it's shear size (it's huge) to lower average cost/rates while providing a suprisingly elegant, modern, clean place to stay. I studied previous reviews carefully and noted many comments about this place being run down. They've cleary just done a recent renovation per the advertisement, as my suite was modernized and clean. The orginal floor plan for the rooms means smaller bathrooms...like the average American guest bath. No big deal...sill very clean with newer tile, granite countertops, etc. The rest of the suite had newer, comfortable, pleasant, yet plain furniture in Hilton beige and green colors. LCD TVs, clean carpet, great water pressure, wonderful bed...I mean GREAT BED. You have the nice high threadcount bedding...no stinky, suspicious comfortors shared with previous guests. Real glasses wrapped in post-sterilizaton wrappers for peace of mind. Room service is expensive but not more than other places. If you order a nice meail expect in your room, expect it to be $35. A few restaurants. The main one has a great breakfast buffet and I also did the dinner buffet one day. Great quality, but each costs about $25 with tip, unless Breakfast is included in your room. I didn't have a good opinion of the free shuttle. I called the hotel when I landed and was told the shuttle was blue and gray and marked with \"Hotel Express\", and they said it would be very 15-30 minutes. I was in the hotel shuttle area and watched it drive by without stopping 20 minutes after waiting. So I took a cab--a minimum $18 charge rather than wait and be left behind again 30 minutes later. So I showed up and those on the shuttle bus were ahead of me in a long, very slow moving line to check in. Luckily, I had a suite reserved for $168 per night including the breakfast and was told I could check in on 16th floor or special line. So I did, and got my room probably 45 minutes to an hour earlier than I otherwise would have. The suite overlooked airport runways as requested, had my refereshments waiting as I requested, along with extra towels requested ahead of time. Inshort, the suite was perfectly set up--and na ice surprise was I also overlooked the pool (suite 164). I heard the jet noise but faintly...never kept me awake and always gave me something to look out at. And dealings with front desk, hotel operator, and restaurant staff were all great. I was very impressed with the wait staff in the restaurant. They kept refilling my coffee, water, bread, etc without me needing or wanting it. Bottome line: I am a very picky frequnet traveler used to 5 star hotels. And this 4 star hotel was superb. I do recommend you book through the hotel website itself, not a discounter, include your special requests in the space provided, call them day of arrival to reiterate your requests and update your arrival time, and if you have a few bucks extra, get the executive suite. I had the twice the space, access to the lounge for snacks and drinks, breakfast buffet included, for $168 per night. This is very inexpensive for this level of quality and automatically negated all over complaints I read by going with this option.

When you turned on the shower, half the water came out the tub spout, they only give you two bath towels (nice sized); and two calls to housekeeping never resulted in any more being delivered.

We were given breakfast vouchers for the restaurant and no apology for missing any of the amenities we had paid for. Then we were given the keys to a small cramped room (I have stayed at this property over 10 times in the past and I have never received a room this small). We called back down and insited they open the Hhonors floor rooms and give us the room we paid for. They relented and gave us a standard room on the Honors floor which was deserted so at least it was quiet. The next day we had to go wait for a breakfast table and of course tip our waitress (I won't cheat employees working hard despite the hotels bait and switch). This was nothing short of fraud and we should have been given an apology from the management and our room should only have been charged at the standard rate (not the concierge rate at $40.00 more!)

The good: -Right next to the airport -Free shuttle service 24 hours a day -Beautiful lobby -Clean -Nice restaurants -24 hour bistro located in lobby for hot food, snacks, drinks, coffee -24 hour room service (menu is limited between 11PM and 6AM) -USA Today newspaper delivered to your door -Room service breakfast was very good, and delivered to my room 15 minutes after the call on a busy Monday morning The bad: -Right next to the airport (bring earplugs) -Look at my photos.....This was a very weird room with the smallest window in a hotel I've ever seen. How do you like the view? -The free shuttle service runs at random intervals. When you call the Hilton and ask about the shuttle service, you will be told that it runs \"every 20 to 25 minutes after the half hour\". This is absolutely false--do not rely on this. The shuttle service is not a Hilton shuttle. It is an LAX shuttle, and many of these mini blue buses serve most of the hotels and motels around the airport. When you catch your bus curbside outside of baggage claim, many of these buses will drive by---you need to look for the bus with the bright orange digital display that says, \"HILTON LAX FOUR POINTS LAX\". This bus stops at both the Hilton and the Four Points by Sheraton around the corner. -When the bus drops you off at the hotel, be prepared to stand in line to check in. Everyone on the bus is doing the same thing you are---checking in. If there are 25 people on the bus, then there will be 25 people in line. (My advice if you don't mind spending a few extra bucks is to skip the free shuttle and instead pay a taxi 10 bucks to take you to the hotel. Same thing for returning to LAX because the shuttle bus shows up \"when it gets there\"---there is no set schedule). -If you are flying on Virgin America Airlines, you can not print your boarding pass from the kiosk in the hotel lobby. For some reason, they do not have this airline in the system yet even though VA has been in service for over a year. -In order to understand my strange room, you need to picture how the hotel is built. Imagine a big \"plus\" sign, and this is the hotel. On each floor, there are four rooms (on at each corner) in the middle where the \"plus\" sign meets. All four of these rooms (on each floor) will be small and have the weird window as shown in my picture. My room number was 1042, so make sure you ask when you check-in if they are putting you in one of these rooms. I asked the clerk at check-in for an \"airport view\" so that I could watch the planes takeoff and land. He said \"no problem\"---and look where he put me! What a joke. I might try this hotel again, because it was clean and the service was good. The downstairs coffee shop was good also, and they have both a breakfast buffet and a dinner buffet. The steakhouse is only open Monday through Friday (to my disappointment). Housekeeping also did a great job. Besides the strange window and the horrible view, my last gripe would be the bathroom. Take a look at the picture and you will see that not only is it small, but the wallpaper is peeling and there are black mold spots throughout.

It seemed that this room was almost an \"afterthought.\" I went down to the front desk and very politely asked for a different room. The woman who helped me was very nice. Due to the hotel being very full, she offerred and I accepted a slightly smaller room on the 4th floor. This room had another very limited view but this time it was of what appeared to be a courtyard between the towers. It was again very close to the elevators which I don't like and they were doing construction on the tower I was in. The floor was covered in plastic and they'd laid plywood over it. Everytime someone walked by it was noisy. I didn't hear any construction noise but this set-up was \"low-rent.\" The room looked ok on the surface but after being in it for awhile I noticed some deficiencies......it was very humid and the room never did cool down to my preferred comfortable sleeping temperature. The TV needed to be repaired or replaced - - the sound was awful. The shower in both the original room and my second and final room needed to be cleaned or have the caulk replaced. One suggestion I have for the hotel if their representatives read this is to reconsider the placement of the small table they have which holds the coffee pot and ice bucket. The placement of it is in the direct line you make from the bed or desk to the bathroom. I ran into at least twice. Finally, despite my displeasure with the room situation, the staff at that hotel is wonderful. The bartenders are great! One of them very kindly gave me a book he'd finished reading.

First, when I went to shower the night I checked in a large, nasty clump of hair floated up from the drain. I took it down to the front desk the next morning and they handled the situation, but it wasn't an auspicious start to my stay. The second thing that happened is that I got food poisoning four days into my stay and spent a day vomiting (among other things). Since I had only eaten one meal anywhere other than the hotel (and that three days before), my belief is that the illness was caused by the hotel's food. Again, the hotel staff tried to make things right, and if my stay hadn't ended so badly, I'd actually be writing a positive review. The worst problem I had was that they got my rate wrong (to the tune of $350). I had originally booked at a rate of $209, but called the hotel a month and a half before my stay to change it to a rate of $139 that was available because of the purpose of my trip. When I explained this at check-out, I received the worst customer service experience I've ever had at a hotel. The front desk manager on duty was surly and unresponsive, despite my opening the conversation with a smile and cheerful \"good morning\", she never cracked a smile. Well, when I angrily asked her \"Is this how you want a guest to leave your hotel?\", she did shrug and smirk a bit. Ultimately, she refused to adjust the rate and I had to catch a plane. I faxed a complaint to the hotel the next week and spoke to someone who actually seemed responsive. He asked me \"What can we do to make it up to you?\" and I thought he'd correct the issue, but, ultimately, he too refused to adjust the rate, despite it being the hotel's screw-up to begin with. The \"explanations\" I received had to do with policies and the computer \"not letting\" the rate be changed. If this is truly the case, I question why Hilton employs human beings at all, since they're either unable or unwilling to exercise judgement and discretion. Their actions are, frankly, nonsensical, since I estimate they'll lose over $7000 in business from me and my colleagues over the next year. This is neither good customer service nor good business.

The next time I need to fly out of LAX I will for sure be staying at the Hilton.", "Date": "October 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel - Even more impressive given its at LAX!\u201d", "Author": "pcsanity", "ReviewID": "UR10288211", "Content": "Quick Summary: A+ Hilton - Thanks for a great stay, I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel. I spent one night at the Hilton LAX Airport. In comparison to most airport hotels, this Hilton is a real Gem. Walking into the lobby is the first sign that this is a well maintained Hilton with lots of Marble and a roomy inviting lobby. Check in was smooth and easy for both myself as a Hilton Diamond member as well as my coworker and customers who did not hold any status. I would recommend this hotel, it rivals any Hilton on the US I have stayed at. (This was a welcome change after a few nights at a very unacceptable Doubletree in Torrance) I stay at many hotels during work travel, and not many hotels get glowing reviews from me like this. The elevators were quick and plentiful. My room was of adequate size and given I was on the top floor, I was very pleased that there was no disturbing noise from overhead aircraft, nor from any rooms around me. The room was very clean and appeared to have been updated rather recently. The room had both feather and standard pillows, a comfortable bed, small sitting area, and a nice sized work desk. The bathroom was not huge, but had plenty of room for toiletries and other necessities. Of course the view was nothing to speak of, but it is near the airport. The hotel has a rather nice gym that rivals any that I have stayed at (other than resort / spas of course). There are about 5 treadmills, 5 elliptical, and 3 bicycles, all with individual TV screens. There is also a nice area with weight machines, free weights, etc. The only negative of the gym is that there most cell phones will not work there. The hotel also has an acceptable outdoor pool and 4 hot tubs. Though I did not partake, I understand that the hotel has an affiliation with a bus that provides free transportation to Manhattan beach if you are looking to get away from the hotel for short while. They also have a Hertz rental car location on site, if you want to rent or return your car to save a few dollars on parking or an extra days rental. The business center is rather small, and the charges are high, but copiers, faxes, internet access, printers, and computers are available for a fee. I did not try to use the high speed internet access, as I have my own broadband card. The hotel has 24 hour room service, and a nice selection of dining options. They have a more upscale Italian dining room, a bar / casual dining, and a 24 hour bistro / coffee shop. Airport shuttle service runs about every 15 minutes 24 hours per day. Though I did not take the shuttle from the airport, the shuttle to the airport was prompt and efficient. If you stay on the executive floors or are a Hilton Gold or Diamond member, the hotel has a very nice hospitality lounge, and it is in a controlled access room so that it is not overrun by guests who should not be there. The lounge has a nice breakfast in the morning with standard continental and one hot item, evening hospitality with two hot items, cheeses, fruits, etc. They also have a two hour window with very nice desserts available. They also have non alcoholic beverages as well as bar service. All items are complimentary with the exception of alcohol. The hospitality suite has a nice view of the runway if you are interested in watching the planes take off.", "Date": "October 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hove, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood quality airport hotel\u201d", "Author": "SussexUKTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR8723742", "Content": "We stayed in the Hilton LAX on August 26th.

It's true, in general, and fits the Hilton LAX to a degree. This is a big hotel. Maybe a bit too big. I parked at the hotel and while others have said the parking signs are confusing, I found clearly marked signs to the Self Park area ... but you have to go down 5-6 levels before reaching the self park area. When you take the elevator to the lobby, you feel oddly out of place if you aren't wearing a uniform from an international airline or if you aren't carrying bags from lands afar (and bags under your eyes from long overseas flights). I checked in about 10:45pm and was attended to within 3-5 minutes. I was given a room on the 4th floor and found that it was as far away from the elevator as one could get. It isn't what I expected for being Hilton HHonors Gold, but it was late and I figured they ran out of rooms. My first room (foreshadowing!) was cavernous. With one teeny-weeny window, the rest of the room looked like a basement ... low ceilings and lots of wall. Oddly, at the very end of the bowling alley ... err, room ... was an itsy-bitsy bathroom. But, after having kicked off my shoes and heading to said loo, I found the carpet to be absolutely soaked. \"Yikes!\" I thought ... and pushed out any thoughts of potential liquid substances that could be on the floor. I called to explain and was transferred three (1, 2, 3!) times, explaining my story each time. Finally, the third gentleman apologized and said he would move me to the club floor if I would go back to the front desk and get my new key. I did that, but upon reaching the front desk was told that a bellman had just been sent up to my 4th floor room with my new key to take me and my bags to the 12th floor. That's impressive ... but I wish I had been told that in the first place. So, they issued me new keys there and off I went to push button \"12\" in the elevator. Upon exiting the elevator on floor 12, I met a bellman. He looked at me, I looked at him. This knowing exchange could mean only one thing: he was the one sent to move me in the first place. We exchanged info and, indeed, it was he. But he had been sent to another room on floor 4, which he told me was occupied by a China Airlines flight crew who knew nothing of moving to floor 12. \"A\" for effort ... but the devil is always in the details, Hilton. The room itself, like that of the fourth floor room, was fine. It's a 3-star airport hotel, so my expectations were not overly raised to begin with. The furniture is d-a-t-e-d! The bed is quite comfy looking and modern-ish in a hotel bed-esque sort of way. It was a mismatch to the otherwise plain and cheap other furniture in the room. The bath, too, was dated. Plastic countertops and a cheesy showerhead didn't make, or ruin, my day. It should be noted that this hotel's lobby is drippy elegant for an airport hotel. Lots o' marble here. Hmmm ... I think they should have put some of that marble in the guest room bathrooms. Overall, it is what it is.

There happen to be a wedding there that night but there was no problem up on the 17th floor just a little crazy down where the wedding was taking place with all the people and kids running around. The 16th floor Lounge was nice, good bartender and great view of the airport. They have heavy o'douevrs from 4:30 to 7pm and then are open till 10PM.

I needed a hotel near LAX for a Sat night for easy get together with friends traveling elsewhere at same time as me as we all passed through LAX. and being joined by locals. Booked through Hilton site (after comparing rates at obitz, etc.) $140. One king bed, non-smoke. Hotel was nearly full, most others nearby were sold-out. Didn't do priceline/hotwire as I wanted location right by airport and those sites' close-by hotels are in 1-5 mile radius so includes Manhattan Beach 15 minute+ drive further which would have made schedules too tight with friends. positives: Desk said in phone call that shuttle from airport only comes by every 20-25min. But it came as promised, my wait was only 10min. Check-in was quick, very friendly and helfpul. It was a crowded time, but there were four or more working desk, so went quickly. I needed to 4pm check-out and had been warned by phone reservations that would likely be a $99 charge for anything after 1pm check out. (Standard check-out is noon.) However, at check-in I was able to get 4pm check out for $25 charge. Biggest positive: Room was cleaner, more attractive, more comfortable, more plush than I'd expected. Linens and mattress, in particular, were excellent , visually and pleasing to the touch -- really wonderful. Comfortable furniture, including a great high-back swivel leather desk chair. Robes in closet. Better compimentary toiletries than usual for this price room. nice view of runways. 15th floor. I think because I had Hilton Honors membership (their frequent traveler program I barely remember signing up for, but desk staff found my membership), I was given room on one of a few floors served by a guest lounge on the 16th. Lounge nicely appointed, complimentary continental breakfast was typical but sufficient, fresh fruit was good. I didn't get back there again, but apparently snacks and tourist tips offered there all day, warm cookies provided at night before 11pm closing. Good exercise room on lower floor, below ground level registration level. Lots of machines, a number of treadmills w tvs, etc. 24-hour snack/pizza/deli shop on registration level. Room service expensive but not overly, just like every other nice hotel. Appealing lobby area, comfortable furniture, marble and fine art, la bit of a luxury hotel feeling. mixed: pool had bonus of four hot tubs seating four each , one at each corner of pool. Pool was clean and lots of chairs, towels provided. Pool was on 3rd floor sheltered from wind. However sheltered from wind also meant no sun on pool until sun is just about directly overhead. So I'd guess pool in sun only from 11:30am to about 2:30pm. (For some that could be a plus.) To get some sun for a few minutes at 11am I sat in an outdoor chair in another patio on same floor as pool,. That area was kind of empty and was not that inviting. Negatives: Online access, hard-wire or wireless, costs $10/day. Maybe that kind of charge made sense a few years ago, but with every cheap hotel offering free wireless now, Hilton should offer this free as well. No refrigerator/mini-bar in room. (But used ice bucket provided and ice-machine at elevators to chill water. Also, two free waters provided.) Not much in the neighborhood. Not a resort, just a travelers lay-over hotel. Next door/walking distance: Carl's Jr fast-food, open late. Next to that: Nude female dancers/sextoys and porn shop. parking is additional cost, underground-covered self-park: $14/day for hotel guests. more for valet. Friends visiting: $5 first hour, $10 second hour. after 2 hours: $14/day. More for valet. interestingly: In the block past Carl'sJr/Nude dancing is Parking Spot business charging $17/day for covered self-park for LAX travelers.

What irritated us most was: 1. There was no one in management, or any other guest service representative communicating with these guests. 2. The fact that our reservation was not honored. Hilton books out more rooms then they have as many international travellers come in and check out at all hours. 3. Once issued a room (after the long wait- 1:30 AM at this point) we straggled up the elevators and found ourselves in super unclean room. We beseeched the housekeeping staff and helping them we turned our room over. 4. The walls were very thin and our room was happily situated next to a very squeaky elevator. For the price, the value and service at this Hilton was very poor. Be very cautioned. I understand computer issues every minute a person has to wait without at least some explanation just makes that person more angry. I understand trying to maintain overhead, but there is no excuse for not having enough clean rooms for the amount of travellers who had booked their stay.", "Date": "March 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cypress, california, usa", "Title": "\u201cAlright airport hotel\u201d", "Author": "patrickf88", "ReviewID": "UR6935445", "Content": "Checked in on Friday for early Saturday flight.

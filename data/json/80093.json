It was my first trip to NY and the hubby had only been once before. All we really wanted was somewhere to crash after our days of sight seeing and this was perfect. En suite was fine. Room was cleaned and tidied daily if we wanted it. This also included our beer which was on the table, being put in front of the air con unit to keep it cool! The hotel was within walking distance of many attractions, and there is a fantastic Mexican restaurant across the road from the hotel which dis fantastic margaritas. There were plenty of local shops to grab coffee from in the morning. The only downside is that there is not tea and coffee making facilities in the room, however, this seems to be a very British thing as have often found this to be the case inAmerican hotels.

The location was probably the best part about the hotel, along with the friendliness of the staff. Although the rooms were fairly clean they were teeny tiny (even for NYC standards) and the bedhead fell off the wall several times. The bathroom was shared and was next to our room, which was both good as we didn't have to walk very far, but a pain too as I woke up everytime someone used the bathroom. Also there was no lifts, so for 2 girls with lots of luggage that was a bit of a pain. Thankfully we were only on the 2nd floor.

We didn't pay especially much for this stay and I/we were very pleased with the hotel. We stayed here for 5 nights and ended up in a quite small room. Ok, we had HUGE luggage and couldn't open both bags at the same time. The bed was about 120 cm but we worked it out. And then the bathroom was clean and nice. I have actually stayed at hotels at Times Square which have been 3+ stars but they have been AWFUL. So I will absolutely consider staying at Murray Hill Inn again. Cleanliness is really good and the location is even better. About 15 min walk from Herald Square and maybe 25 to Times Square. We walked all the time to the main attractions and so on. And if you \"had\" to take a taxi it cost us about 15 dollars (for example to Ground Zero). Although we lived at the fifth floor it were totally OK with us (there is no elevator). The staff was very helfpul and asked us if they could help us with our luggage. We also arranged airport transfer through them. It costed us a little bit more but we got a nice car on time which was important because our plane was leaving early. Note that the internet is free of charge which I didn't expect. So ask for a code down in the lobby if you are bringing a laptop! If you are only planning to sleep at the hotel I really recommend it.

There was many places to eat and get things if needed close by. You are right in the downtown area so it is short walks to any tourist thing you may want to see. We took a cab once in a week and walked everywhere the rest of the time. It is not a fancy frilly hotel, but the staff was super helpful and nice, they even helped us plan a trip to the outlets in Jersey.

I had booked a small room with private bath, and was a bit worried that the room would be a closet. We got a room on the 4th floor and was happy to find that it was small but not claustrophobic. The room had a nice double bed, a closet, a TV and a small bedside table with a lamp. The bathroom was great - the shower had good pressure and temperature. The bathroom came with a little basket of lotions and shampoos, which was a nice surprise. The room had a lovely fresh scent, which was a bit strong at first but we got used to it pretty quick. You can purchase wi-fi in the room through a service provider. The place has room service of a sort - there is a company that works with them to deliver food to your room. The place doesn't have a restaurant on the premises, but this being Manhattan, that really isn't an issue. There are many restaurants, cafes and convenience stores around the area and the subway is not far away. The place is basic but comfortable and clean. It's a great place to lay down your head after a long day walking around NY. Because it's basic, there are some things that may turn people off - the sheets while clean, had some noticeable stains. The radiator didn't seem to be turned on enough (or turned on at all). There was an extra blanket we ended up using because I got a bit cold one night. The room has no safe, and the place doesn't have one at the front desk either. There is no elevator or porter, so it might be difficult for some visitors to get to their rooms with their luggage. Our particular room was smallish, and a large suitcase would have been difficult to store in it. That being said, for the price we paid, we were extremely happy with our stay. Our room was a small room, but I glimpsed some of the larger rooms and I have to say, for New York, they seemed generous. The reception staff were friendly and courteous, and they let us leave our luggage at the front after we checked out.

The shower had excellent pressure and stayed at a constant temperature; it was by far one of the best showers we've ever encountered in our hotel travels. The towels were white and fluffy, if a little small. The noise from outside was no problem. We were expecting it to be very loud but it wasn't at all.

The reception staff were very helpful and friendly - we arrived at the hotel very late on the first night (at about midnight) but it was no problem. They also helped us on the last day when there was an error with our airport transfer - thanks again for that! Finally, another of the hotel's advantages is the location. It's just around the corner from the Empire State Building and Macy's and the 28th street subway is only 2 blocks down for when you want to go elsewhere.

Location was great, staff were mostly friendly, rooms and bathrooms clean (strangeley enough, the best smelling linen of all the places we stayed at on the trip!) and relatively quiet. But, the beds are the hardest I have ever slept on (someone mentioned this in a review and I thought..how bad could it be...pretty bad!).

Needless to say, we were privy to EVERYTHING that happened in there. Thankfully, the bathroom wasn't too busy so we weren't in on too much action. And lastly, although there were \"no smoking\" signs...there were guests that really didn't care and the bathroom and halls stunk of smoke. We arrived after 10pm and the night reception person (who was lovely) directed us to the little cafe/restaurant across the street called Penelope's...we just loved it, was a real highlight of New York for us and we went a few times over our stay!

We needed a relatively inexpensive room for two nights to attend a wedding in NYC. So we booked a queen bedroom w/private bath and the room was on the 4th floor facing the street. Here's the bad news: The hotel has NO elevator so be prepared to walk up and down a lot of steps if you're on an upper level. Some small things: The blinds on both windows in our room were broken, and the windows didn't stay open on their own. The alarm clock was broken and the time was wrong. We tried to reset it but to no avail. And some of the buttons on the remote control for the TV were broken and the remote itself had a different room number on it. And I didn't see an A/C although it being April, we thankfully didn't need one. Check with the hotel to see if they do have A/C if you're staying in the warmer months. The good news: The front desk staff were very nice and let us check into the room early and they held our bags after check out before we went back to the airport. The hotel is in an excellent and convenient location on a semi-quiet tree-lined block in Murray Hill. The rooms were clean and our bathroom was very nice. Basics included a closet with hangers and an ironing board w/iron and a hair dryer and toiletries. You can pay for wireless internet service. I think it was $7.00 per 24 hour usage. I wouldn't recommend this place for people who don't do stairs very well or who want luxury or extreme quiet.

(And we're both very thin people so normally this isn't a problem!). Despite the small bed there wasn't any space to move in the room. We couldn't even open our door while the suitcase was lying down on the floor! Two people's luggage had us packed in so tightly we were sidling past each other the whole time. The bathroom was a little more spacious, however my pleasure at that was quickly disposed of when I could only have a luke warm shower. October in New York is cold so that wasn't fun. The window looked out onto an alleyway which meant we got no natural light in the room so it was dark day and night. The room we had also didn't seem to be very well soundproofed as we could hear a lot of traffic noise - we ended up sleeping with earplugs in. They didn't offer breakfast, which turned out to be a good thing in the end as there's a few nice diners in the area. On the up side this hotel is cheap and fairly clean. There's someone on the front desk all the time and they were always friendly and helpful. I've read other reviews on this hotel saying it was nice so I'm guessing there's probably some much nicer rooms in the place.

Murray Hill Inn was a good choice for us given what we were looking for. Our room was on the front of the building so we had windows. And it was on the 5th floor. Being a mid-block, brownstone-type building, not all rooms can have windows. The room seemed to be fairly recently remodeled with Pergo-type floors and a newly tiled bathroom. Because of the windows there was a little street noise. But we were so tired from all of the walking in NYC that it didn't keep us from sleeping at all. The staff were very business-like. But when we asked them questions they were friendly and helpful. Pros: (1) Very good location: only a few blocks from a subway stop and also from where the bus dropped us off. It's enough off of the beaten path that it is fairly quiet, but not so far off that it is out of the way. There are many nice restaurants, coffee shops ,etc nearby. We like Penelope's very much for breakfast and the Brasil Coffee Shop. (2) Very clean. (3) Reasonable rates compared with most other Manhatten hotels. (4) Our room, while not huge, had a small refridgerator and a sofa and was very ample for our needs. Cons: (1) No elevator. We had to go up and down 4 LONG flights of stairs. But we didn't mind that too much being healthy. But older people might want to request lower floors. (2) No frills and not many amenities like computer access and vending machines.

Overall it is a good value. it is clean, efficient, and a convenient place to stay. SERVICE: The front desk personel are very quick and efficient and are friendly as well. They will help you find sights and are easy to deal with. They ask for you to leave your key with them before you leave (for security purposes - they said in case you lose your key). There is someone at the front desk 24 hours a day so leaving the key did not seem like a big deal to me. They buzz you in past the front lobby and that made me feel safer. A quick aside, they list an airport pickup service called AirLink at the Murray Hill. Don't use them, we almost missed our flight because they picked us up an hour late. LOCATION: A little past 30th and Lexington. It is a very convenient mid-town location. It is 2 blocks from the 28th street station for the 6 train. You can reach Macy's in about 8-10 blocks. There are few cabs on 30th but hit Lexington and it is much easier to get a cab. There are plenty of caf\u00c3\u00a9s and restaurants close by. The hotel is on a quiet street (except on Friday-Saturday nights) near residential brownstones. The neighborhood is very safe in my opinion and I never felt uneasy. The hotel has no elevator and staying on the 4th floor means going up some steep stairs. This isn't hard unless you have luggage. They do have a porter during the day and I am sure he could help with luggage. There is a good Italian place called Caio Bella Italia on Lexington and the Bagelry has good bagels and great coffee. ROOM: We booked the queen room with a front view. This is the largest room they offer. It has a clean but somewhat hard queen sized bed. They do provide plenty of pillows. It has a wood floor and dark wood furniture and a small but usable closet. The bathrooms are new and have a good sized shower and are larger than you would expect. Our room had a 21\" flat screen TV which was nice. There is a mini-fridge in your room so buy your soft drinks and water at Duane Reade and that can save you some money. Keep in mind that it takes 5-10 minutes for the water to get hot, so be sure to run the water before taking a shower. We were there in the winter and they run the boiler quite a bit. Our room was a bit warm most of the time but it is better than being cold. The boiler is a bit noisy and can be annoying when you are trying to sleep. My biggest complaint is that the smell of cigarette smoke came through the boiler vents and that was very annoying. They are a non-smoking property but I think many of the guests ignored that rule. They refill the towels and clean the room very well. The street side rooms can hear road noise from Lexington. Even though they are double paned windows you will still hear outside noise. That is the only downside to the front view rooms. PRICE: During the winter it is $189 a night and I believe it is $209 for the weekend. During the spring/summer it goes down to $169 and $189 for the weekend. We paid an average of $210 a night with taxes for 4 nights.

Needless to say, we will be returning to both as soon as possible. Let me start by saying that if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a luxurious hotel, the Murray Hill Inn isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it. But if you are looking for something that won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wreck your budget but is clean, well-maintained, secure and close to everything, then this is the place for you. The missus had business at Bellevue Hospital on Sunday night (not being committed, har har), and the Murray Hill Inn was recommended by a local who works at the hospital. We arrived Saturday afternoon around 1:15, and even though we were early, the super-friendly staff welcomed us and checked us into our third-floor room. There is no elevator, so you will need to take your luggage up how ever many flight of stairs there may be. The desk clerk offered to help, but since we are relatively healthy people, we schlepped them ourselves. No big deal. Upon opening the door to our room, we found a spotless, clean-smelling, almost-new (albeit small, see the pics) bedroom and a very nice bath. This was plenty for us. After all, we only needed a place to leave our stuff, bathe and sleep. After all, who wants to hang out in a hotel when Manhattan is sitting out there, waiting to be explored? When you leave the Inn to explore the city, you are required to leave your key at the front desk for security reasons. As the desk is manned 24/7, this poses no problem. Never once did we feel our security was compromised in any way. And again, the desk staff is very friendly and greets you going and coming and gets to know who you are very quickly. About the location: 30th Street is primarily a residential neighborhood and it is very quiet at night. Noise will not be a factor when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for some shut-eye. On the southwest corner of the block is the Brasil Coffee House, which has a wide variety of caffeinated beverages and sweet stuff and a very efficient and polite staff. We stopped in several times for coffee. On the corner of 30th and 3rd Avenue is The Bagelry. We stopped in Monday morning for pancakes and bacon and sat outside and watched the city come to life. For first-time NYC visitors like us, it was an incredible experience. The food and coffee rocked, too. In addition, for those of you who have never been to NYC, nothing is more than three or four miles away from the Murray Hill Inn. A $8 cab ride gets you to Rockefeller Center and from there you can wind your way back south to the Inn, through the various street merchants, restaurants and attractions. Do yourself a favor: Get on the street and soak up as much of New York City as you can for whatever time you have. The people are friendly, the crowds are exciting and the city s electric. And eat as many street hot dogs as you can! You will want to go back to the city the minute you leave. We did, and we will be coming back, to both Manhattan and the Murray Hill Inn.

I found my room - right next to the employee lounge. When I opened the door, I was not surprised to see that there was a tiny window that faced a brick wall, but I was surprised to see how unkept the place was. The beds must have come from a jail cell, because it was like sleeping on bricks, and the sheets came from the local hospitals - they were stamped with the different hospital names at the bottom.

I called the front desk, and asked if they had a clock, I was told no, and then I asked for a wake-up call, and they said that they did not do that (I was not really surprised by this answer). As I was preparing for bed, I went over to lock the door. Come to find out that the only lock was a push lock (and anyone who's ever been locked out of a room with a push lock knows that you can just slide a credit card through the door and viola, it unlocks). I was a little disturbed by this, so I did what anyone else would do and baricaded the door with the desk chair.

By midtown standards this hotel is about as cheap as a room with private restroom can get. This is the price level equal to $40 night motel in the states, where the land is cheaper, so people who book the cheapest rooms in this already not expensive hotel really should not expect the rose garden under their windows. 2. As for those who just loved the place - I suppose, if you come there at 4 a.m. drunk and drop on your bed, wake up 30 minutes before the check out and rush out - yep, it's a great place. My experience (I had 1 Queen bed w/ bath, front view): The place was clean; linens and towels were of the variety expected for the price; the room was rather chilly; there was no way to make it warmer and there was no additional blankets. Security is a concern - the door and lock resembled the door I have in the bathroom, not a regular hotel door. Soundproofing is non-existent and there was some commotion, yelling and door banging somewhere on the floor about 4 am (I guess, one of those who loved this hotel so much came home). The staff was extremely helpful. Would I stay there again? Probably. The price / location combo is great and the building I used to live in for a couple of years (also in NYC) was about as good in terms of security and soundproofing, so I'm used to it.

For starters there's no elevators so walking up four flights of stairs with luggage wasn't too cool. The hallways are very narrow and entering into my room was a choir. The room was roughly 7' x 11' with one double bed in the corner and night stand next to the bed. This left no more room in the width. The room door would not open all the way because it hit the small entertainment stand across from it.

The price we paid was $170 a night for a weekend in December. Location along makes that a good price to pay in Manhatten. But for what you get it's not worth it.

Our room was like a room in a basement. It had a very nice bathroom and that's about all that was nice. The window's view was of a building, one inch away. So the purpose of the window, I still haven't figuered out. There were no other rooms down there. We freaked out. Two young girls in New York City in a dungeon!!! Anyway, I spoke with the front desk and they were reluctant to change our room. I said I would leave and they suddenly had a room for us on the third floor. This time the 2 windows faced the street. The room was ok. There was no closet, rather a stick with 4 hangers. The vanity table had a mirror that was set at the corner...it was very odd since the two of us couldn't figure out how to use the mirror together...instead we had to take turns. The bathroom was nice, but not as nice as the dungeon's bathroom. Lighting in the hotel was very bad and the furniture was pretty old. Most importantly, however, was that the hotel room was indeed clean. However, we did not allow for maid service and kept our valubles lockecd up in our suit cases. We were a bit afraid of the workers. The manager/owner? was always smoking in the 4ft X 4ft lobby which was very disturbing. We were able to check out some of the other rooms and we noticed that every room differed. One room we saw had brand new furniture and looked very nice. Another room was like a prison cell. So I guess it all depends. Location wise, the hotel is in a great area. Close by to everything. The empire state building is 3 blocks away, and shopping is close by as well. There are also a lot of restaurants very close. What I can tell you is to expect anything. No elevators, workers are weird and not that kind.

So I stopped and made the reservation over the phone. As soon as I had made the reservation and right before I received my comformation number I was hung up on. When I arrived at the hotel I was made to sign two different papers. The hotel clerk said that the first paper was confirming the dates of my stay, and aknowledging that if anything was stolen it was not their responsibility. Although it gave me a weird feeling I signed it anyway thinking I just won't leave anything of value in the room. The second piece of paper was allowing them to authorize my credit card. So the clerk gave us our key for a room on the fourth floor to which there was no elevator or an offer to help with our luggage. When we arrived in the room right next to the steps, it was only three feet wider than the double bed which was as hard as a plank of wood. We thought it wasn't a big deal, we weren't planning on staying in the room a lot. So besides being woken up every morning by people dragging their suitcases down the stairs instead of carrying them or using the nonexistant elevator the room was at least clean.

Upon check out I found that I was being charged the wrong rate for all three nights. Not the rate I was quoted on the phone when I made the reservation. I let it go because the manager was not there and they said she would have to take care of the situation. So later that day I called and tried to get in touch with the manager. I was told she would call me back. The next day no word, I called a total of six times, every single time the manager was not there, and I never recievd a call from her. This went on for three days.

I had made reservations three months ago specifically requesting a room on the second floor, non smoking, two beds, private bath and a late arrival time. I called every week for 6 weeks to confirm the reservation which were made to accomodate physical limitations. I reiterated when I confirmed that we would be arriving late but was assured that our room as requested would be ready upon our arrival. Alas, when we arrived we we're given a smoking room, on the 5th floor, with one bed. The woman at the front desk said that they were \"sold out\" and that we would have to sort it out in the morning. This sort of thing clearly happens on a regular basis as she was immune to our complaints. I requested that someone at least help us with the bags and were told that no one could help us. After \"schleping\" our bags up 5 flights of narrow and steep stairs we arrived at our room. The room was so small that it could not accomodate two suitcases on the floor at the same time without having to literally leap over one bag. Exhausted we prepared for bed and pulled the covers back. Eeeeeks! The mattress was covered with a thread bare, stained flat sheet. No mattress pad to provide comfort or protection from previous sleepers germs. The pillow had no pillow protector and many many signs of previous sleepers drool. Uchh. Fortunately I had brought my own pillow (which if you stay here I recommend that you do too!) laid some towels on the sheets and tried to go to sleep. I have traveled all around the world, slept in hostels and luxury hotels and have NEVER encountered a bed as hard and uncomfortable as the one in room 509. It isn't worth the trouble of attempting sleep. The next morning we went down to the equally unhelpful front desk person and were told that we would have to wait 1/2 an hour for the next person to get on shift to switch rooms. That wouldn't have been a huge deal except that we didn't want to waste any time in a 48 hour vacation getting a room changed that shouldn't have been wrong in the first place. After waiting an hour we spoke with a woman who said that we would have to call because she had to speak with the owner! Finally we we're switched to a smoking room on the 4th floor (room 401) with two beds and double the size. Unfortunately the rooms air conditioner/heater didn't work. The remote control to the 1975 t.v didn't work and the hot water in the shower didn't get to the 4th floor for 10 minutes after the shower began. Oh, and the same thing with the thin sheet over the bare mattress. If you are planning on staying at the Murray Hill Inn you should know the following: the staff is unusually and puzzlingly unhelpful, you will not get the reservation that you asked for, the doors to the rooms do not have any kind of dead bolt or secure locking systems, and smoke from smokers will seap under the 1\" cracks under the door. You should bring your own pillow and sheets and snacks. While I was befuddled at the room problem I would be negligent if I didn't point out that the rooms have gone through some renovations and appeared to be clean. Be very careful while stepping in to the showers as the floors have flat, non textured large tiles which when wet and soapy are as dangerously slippery. The renovations appear not to have been done by a professional as evidenced by the new shower door that doesn't quite close or the bathroom door that doesn't shut due to the 2\" misallignment of the tile. If you are a smoker in good shape and a single traveler the Murray Hill Inn might be the place for you. If you are a non smoker, have any kind of physical ailment, and are traveling with someone else I would recommend a different hotel, unless you don't mind playing the Murray Hill Inn lottery of rooms.

Overall a good place to stay!", "Date": "February 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cWhat value!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3184332", "Content": "I have to say that I read all of the reviews on this site before booking to stay at the MHI... While some claimed it to be dreadful, I found it to be clean, warm, tidy and just right for the budget traveller. If you are going to New York, the chances are that you are going to see the City, not a hotel room, and for the price, one can hardly complain! I booked a single private room with a bathroom and was pleasantly surprised. The bathroom was immaculate and while the room was definately on the small side, it was just right for my needs. I also compared the prices of the MHI with youth hostels and the like, and found it to be only about $10/20 more than you would pay for a dorm room with a shared bathroom! So! If you're going to NYC to see the city I'd recommend it, if you're planning on stayin inside a lot, perhaps you should spend the $30 more for a 'proper' hotel.", "Date": "February 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albany, NY", "Title": "\u201cStraight scoop on the MHI\u201d", "Author": "wthrvanes", "ReviewID": "UR3025332", "Content": "As I write this review, the Big Apple is about to get 15-20\" of snow. Consequently, I bailed out and headed back upstate, where we can typically deal with this type of predictiment. However, regarding the MHI, I stayed there last night and was suppsed to stay tonite also, but had to get out..or I would have been stuck for 2-3 days. The MHI was absolutely perfect for me. The rate was cheap by my standards for NYC. My room was clean, nice bathroom and the queensized bed was more than adequate for a single traveler. Don't get me wrong...it was small, but it was everything that I needed! Room dimesions were 12' x 15' the bath was very new and 5' x 8' and all the furniture was relatively new. A new Pergo floor, and no dust kittys underneath the bed. For $103.00 (tax included), in the shadow of the Empre State Building, it was an extremely good value. My desk clerk at checkin and checkout was very cordial. I will advise you that the continental breakfast is given at a little bodega-type store 1/2 block away. I've stayed in $400.00 a nite rooms and hardly remember being there. For $103.00....there's nothing to complain about. If you are looking for $400.00 worth of amenities...go somplace else! If you want a centrally located inn that's very reasonable, this place fits the bill. I'd stay again tomorrow!

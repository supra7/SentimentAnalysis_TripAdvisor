The bathroom is small but the fixtures are updated and well maintained. Most of all, our bathroom was clean and stayed clean thanks to the maid service all weekend. The beds were comfortable. Though I don't drink wine, they do have a wine reception every night which is well attended and a nice touch. I especially loved the garden area with the walking/running path. It was a nice oasis in the middle of a large city. Though the exercise room is small, the hotel is close enough to take a nice morning run along the wharf. I was super happy with the location. It was near public transportation so it was easy to get to Fisherman's wharf. It is literally blocks away from China Town and Union Square so it was so easy to walk or take the train everywhere. Joel patiently made sure I understood where to go to use public transportation and even called the tour company I had booked my tour with to make sure he gave me the right directions.

Note: not all rooms have tubs. If you plan on doing sightseeing, I would request a room with a tub so that you can soak your feet after you return... We requested a quiet room since we're not accustomed to the 24/7 traffic of a larger city. \u00c2\u00a0We did not hear any other guests during the entirety of our stay aside from the occasional opening and shutting of room doors. \u00c2\u00a0Our room had a single window facing out into an inner courtyard that really wasn't too much to look at, but our main concern was that we be able to sleep after a long day sightseeing. \u00c2\u00a0The hotel was incredibly quiet at night despite the fact that so many people were staying there. \u00c2\u00a0 We would definitely stay here again. \u00c2\u00a0I feel as though we got a great value for our money and that the people who work here couldn't have been nicer.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Providence, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value, Great Staff, Great location\u201d", "Author": "Catherine T", "ReviewID": "UR126832242", "Content": "I was here for a conference at another hotel up the street, but I wanted a hotel that had free wifi and was a little less expensive.

The bed and room appeared to be clean and kept up well, but it's an old hotel. The rooms are small with minimal amenities. The price though isn't small with a hefty nightly cost. Staff was always friendly and attentive. I had a room on the 5th floor and it was an outside corner. The wifi signal in the room was very week and often there was a hard time connecting and frequent drops. I don't know if an inside room or other location on the floor would be better, but the room I had was poor for wifi. At least wifi is included in the high room price. There's a nice size flat screen TV in the room, but the channel selection was poor. It's a HD TV and I'm sure there's HD service available, yet all channels were SD and stretched to fit the 16:9 screen. Compare this to a hotel I stayed in the following weekend that was 1/3 the cost, 4x the room size and 4x the channel selection with most channels being HD. other than that there was nothing special about the room, which would be fine if the price was 1/2 what it was.

While the room was a bit dark and a little smaller than average, it had plenty of room to move around, and the bed was very fluffy and comfortable. The huge walk-in closet helps hide your suitcase so you don't feel as cramped.

The Internet was a little slow, but it was free, so I can't complain! BATHROOM: The bathroom was clean and standard with a tub and shower curtain, though little storage space. It did need more shelves or drawers or a medicine cabinet or something, but that's not a dealbreaker. AMENITIES: The hotel boasts a number of useful boutique amenities, such as a complimentary wine happy hour and a fitness room. It also had an outdoor garden/track on the third floor, and I would've used it if I'd had leisure time. The room had an ample mini bar, and although it would have been nice if the water bottles in the room had been complimentary instead of $5, there's a 7-Eleven on the next block, as well as a coffee shop and an Asian-Mexican fusion cafe on either side of the hotel. SERVICE: The service was very attentive and friendly and the front desk was always helpful with giving directions, getting taxis, etc. I had booked rooms for a number of colleagues, on various credit cards, and the hotel made everything very easy, and correct!

Check-in was seamless and competent. 2. Clean room and bathroom - My favorite was the bed and sheets. Pillows were the best , thus far. Comfy! 3. Really delighted to see a pair of 46\" LG LCD HDTV, one in the bedroom and living room. There was also an impressive size desk in the corner office for the workaholic. 4. Free stuff whereas other hotels would charge - Wine hour - 5:30 everyday. Guests would pack the lobby for this, and free wireless internet 5. Location - shopping paradise the moment you step out; Chinatown very close, restaurants, Union Square, financial district, trolley stops, etc. all within comfortable walking distance. Wife really enjoyed the close proximity of the high end stores like Burberry, 7 jeans, Bulgari and Neiman Marcus to name a few. 6. Price- reasonable for everything that you would get.

I simply couldnt get over how thoughtful the staff and management had been and how much effort that they had gone through to make my stay special. It was a great start to a great race too!!

The desk chair was a beautiful and comfortable office chair. The flat screen TV was large, and there was a good selection of channels. The bed was comfortable, and there was aircon/fan plus the windows actually opened, too. Top quality linens as well. They really have it together. Room service is during limited hours, from the restaurant downstairs, Hecho, an interesting combination of sushi and tequila. I had Japanese dinner one evening, and it arrived quickly and was good, and one morning I ordered breakfast, also delicious and delivered promptly with a smile. Expensive, yes, but room service always is, and hey, it was my birthday. Maid service was excellent, too, and again, the guys at the front desk were great. The location is easy - just a few short blocks walk to Union Square, and many high-end stores are on the way. There are countless restaurants nearby, including sushi, fast food, old-school San Francisco places, and the restaurants of Belden Alley. You're just a couple of blocks from Chinatown, and there are buses galore nearby. BART is just a couple of blocks so you can get to either airport easily. This time, I used my miles to stay at the Galleria Park, but it would have been worth the money, too. I can see this becoming my regular San Francisco treat-myself-to-a-retreat base.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201csan francisco 3 night stay\u201d", "Author": "deb g", "ReviewID": "UR120806970", "Content": "Stayed at the Galleria on our 3 nights, it was a good hotel basic and bit on the expensive side for what it was.

The entire staff gave this intimate little hotel a warm and welcoming feel each time we returned from our adventures in this fabulous city. They were always smiling and ready to offer restaurant recommendations, hold a door, give directions or pour a delicious glass of California wine in the late afternoon, such a nice touch. Our room (727) was small but in an older building this is to be expected, we've actually stayed in smaller rooms in NYC. Size can be overlooked in our opinion if the room is clean and the beds are comfy. Which was the case at the Galleria Park, we had two full size beds with very fresh linens. Our bathroom was spotless, I had no reservations about actually soaking in the large tub, after two days of constant walking (crazy hills ya know). Our room had a large flat screen TV. There was a little street noise one morning but for the most part our room was nice and quiet. Coffee is complimentary each morning, and very tasty. We ate breakfast each morning just two doors down from the hotel at a little place called Fountain Cafe in the Galleria Mall, it was yummy and so reasonably priced.

The location is excellent - close to the BART to get in from the airport, right next to Union Square, cable car stops couple of blocks down the road. I was slightly concerned about the noise given it is a city hotel and I am a particularly light sleeper. We had a room facing Sutter Street and we didn't find the noise to be an issue at all. As the hotel is slightly in the financial district it is quieter at night than other locations nearer to the bars and restaurants of union square. The hotel itself is great - it is in an older building but has been decorated with a modern twist whilst still maintaining its character. We felt this style of hotel is far nicer than the modern block chain hotels that feel somewhat soul-less! The staff were very pleasant and friendly and the free wine hour a real bonus (nice quality Californian wines). The room itself was a good size for a city hotel. Very comfortable bed, windows that open, flat screen tv. The bathroom was by no means that biggest in the world but for an American city hotel it was very nice. Huge big shower and again nice and modern. This was the cheapest and lowest star rated hotel we stayed at during our trip, but we had absolutely no complaints and would not hesitate in returning.

They really deserve a great review and it's because of them that I decided to write today. I travelled with my mom, my aunt and cousin. We all got double rooms with double beds. Theirs (the older ladies) was a bit bigger and definetely made you feel better. Ours wasn't bad at all, but a little bit of more space couldn't hurt (although it would be very difficult since the hotel is build from the structure of a victorian house or mansion ...) The hotel lobby is really nice, smells good and has nice design furniture. They offer a VERY fun thing on the weekends: free wine and appetizers in the afternoon, so it gets full of guests and people ready to explore the city and make new friends. It's a cool little thing that youngsters and adults will enjoy for sure!!! The rooms are very clean and well mantained. The beds are OK (but then again, my bed back home is top notch, so I kinda of miss it everytime I travel) and the linens are comfortable. The pillows could definetely use a revamp (they sink too much, so for those who prefered a big plush pillow, it ain't happening). Overall the experience of sleeping in those rooms was very comfortable and quiet (something we didn't expect in downtown SF). We loved the selection of channels and that of the mini bar (we raided it!!! i don't recall EVER pigging out so much from a hotel's minibar lol) They have an in-room Nespresso machine that you really appreciate in the morning. The furniture is modern and yet classical, and it makes the overall look of the room really soothing and elegant. The hotel is very well appointed, a few blocks away from both Union Square and the Financial District. We had our breakfast 3 out of 3 mornings at the hotel's Hecho Restaurant next door, and we had our first dinner there. Hecho is a mix of japanese and mexican style (they serve sushi and tequila!!!) and we enjoyed it VERY much. The people were awesome and the food for both, breakfast and dinner was great.

No problem. After I received my confirmation number I filled out the online form and was instructed I would hear from them within 48 hours. I did notice that they would only price match US dollars but with the Cad.$ being higher I didn't care about the difference. To shorten the story, 10 days later and after numerous calls and emails....I found that the original rate of $110 per night was in fact for three nights and the last night being NY's Eve was going to be $309! No one bothered to get back to me about the price match. The last communication was with Esther [--], their reservation specialist who while being apologetic basically told me to book with Expedia.

You never feel crowded or overwhelmed like you do in a larger hotel but you still have all the amenities and then some. The evening wine tasting,the outdoor walking/jogging track and the 24Hr Fitness center next door made it the perfect place for me. Chinatown and every store you could want to shop at are very near.

We LOVED the Galleria Park. First off, one has to realize this is an older hotel and accept a few quirks in the spaces, but then appreciate the charm of, eg, the elegant marble staircases connecting all the floors. The room we had was spacious, for an older building, with 2 queen beds. The bathroom space was adequate as there were shelves on which to place toiletries while using the sink/mirror. Our shower head gave less than vigorous stream of water, but we made do. The cleanliness was of an excellent standard. Loved the linens and Frette terry robes! Beds were comfy, but noise from windows of our outside room was a bit troublesome. We were on the 4th floor, facing the street. Saturday night was the worst, with noisy night owls in the street. I think you should do all you can to get an upper floor or inside room. (We had requested that when making the reservations, but it must not have been available when we checked in.) The 3rd floor roof terrace was a lovely space in which to sit with a coffee and read or make a phone call. The staff were wonderful, from front desk to bell staff to housekeeping. Very friendly and ultra-accommodating. (And very likely may have found us another room had we asked.) The location at Sutter and Kearny, just north of Market, can't be beat for being close to Union Square without being right on it, with the hassles of the crowds there, and for easy access to BART for connection to airport, East Bay, other locations as well as all the Muni bus routes running along Market. It's an easy, 10-15min walk to Ferry Building for ferries to Sausalito, etc. As for dining, we did not use the attached Japanese restaurant, but did use the breakfast cafe right next door, which was good (but limited menu, mostly drinks and pastries) and there are dozens of choices within a quick walk. My husband and I have visited San Fran several times, staying at the bigger hotels, but I am now sold on this one. The amenities are as good or better and the warm, friendly staff are the best I've encountered. I'm excited to have discovered this lovely gem of a hotel!", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cLove my stay and will definitely be coming back!\u201d", "Author": "Dona T", "ReviewID": "UR116480928", "Content": "Loved the services by front desk, Joel and Pete - they made all the difference between an acceptable hotel stay against a terrific stay!

We booked the Galleria Park via a Priceline bid and got a great deal. This is a great hotel. We really liked the central location and how there were shops and restaurants abound in the area. The decor of the hotel was very classy and sleek looking. Everything was very well kept and clean. The front desk staff was always friendly and attentive. Our room was small, but still comfortable. Since we booked on Priceline we didn't get to choose our room type, so the hotel put us in the smallest room type -- one double bed. I had never heard of a hotel room with only one double bed before. The room couldn't have been more than 200 square feet. It was tiny -- but very well decorated and organized so it was comfortable for us. The bed was really comfortable and the bathroom was sleek and clean. After driving through a few other areas of San Fran, I really appreciated the location of the Galleria Park. Fisherman's Warf feels like an overpriced tourist trap, and some of the other areas had sketchy parts. I also really liked the originality of this hotel and that it was not a major chain like Hilton or Radisson. It made our stay more authentic feeling, and we felt less like \"tourists.\" A few restaurant tips -- Anderson Bakery in the galleria right next to the hotel has really good sandwiches. They are not open on the weekends though, sadly. Scala's Bistro, which is just a few blocks away, is phenomenal. We had the best meal there. I would definitely stay here again.

I brought my wife here on one of our first dates over twenty years ago. So when we were able to get away for the weekend away from the now teenage kids I did not hesitate to make a reservation here. There was no mention of the on going construction across the street by the helpful reservations agent. When we checked in yesterday, again, no mention by the clerk and no letter from the manager about the loud construction site across the street (a mere 15 paces away.) We were assigned a room directly across from the construction site- it's mostly a major renovation. We had a lovely dinner at Scala's Bistro and revisited the lovely Starlight Room at the top of the Sir Francis Drake hotel. When we were walking back to the Galleria Park at 10PM we heard a lot of noise coming from the construction site. When we entered the hotel we asked the clerk if the noise was going to go on all night. No, we were assured. We watched a little TV and had to crank up the volume to mask the noise. Went to sleep at 10:30PM. Was awoken the first time at midnight by loud crashing- turned out to be huge chunks of concrete being tossed down metal chutes to a dump truck. Called the desk again. Yes, I was told, the noise is bothersome but it will end at midnight. It did not. Awoken again at 1:15AM. Oh, the clerk said, the permit allowed them to work until 3AM!!! but the manager had asked them to stop work at midnight. I was offered ear plugs. I left a voice mail for the manager which, I am sure, recorded the loud noises from across the street. A sleepness night capped by the constant drone of diesel truck parked across the street at 5AM with the engine running. I dressed and went to the lobby since I could not sleep. I asked the clerk to check on the truck and call the police to have it at least turn off its engine. He first said there was nothing he could do. At my further prompting he said he would check on it. He came back and promptly called the police. Based upon the lack of advance notice by reservations and no notification by the manager I would have to say that this borders on fraud and I would not recommend staying at the Galleria Park or any of the Joie de vivre properties. It was certainly not a professional way to treat guests and potential guests. There are lots of choices to stay in downtown San Francisco and I only wish I was afforded the opportunity to make a more informed choice.

The room was a little too small for comfort and there was not much natural light coming in as we were facing one of the towers, but it was OK, especially since we did not spend too much time in the room (and the rooms overlooking the street can get really noisy). I really enjoyed their bathroom products. The hotel had free wireless internet, which is a rarity, however be aware that it can be slow to download attachments etc. and the strength of the connection can be very weak from time to time. Overall, our experience was really great and we will definitely look for the hotel chain when we are back in the region.

I'd give the hotel restaurant a miss. That was one dry, bog standard burger. The bizarre thing about this hotel (and many other SF ones apparently) is the fact that the doormen operate a con. Ask them to order you a taxi, and they call their favourite cab company. When the cabbie arrives, he asks you whether it's cash or credit card. If you say the former, the cabbie has to pay the doorman $10 and if it's CC, they pay $5. I saw the \"transaction\" - the cabbie passed the bill to the doorman who palmed it. Now that HAS to be illegal. I asked him why he paid the doorman and he said that if he didn't pay, he would not get the call from the switchboard putting him on the fare. He said that the doormen have an agreement to share what they take from the cabbies with the cab company switchboard operator. My cabbie told me that this is the way it works in San Francisco.

The room was booked on a room only basis via hotels.com The location of the hotel is excellent - about a 5 minute walk from Union Square. Check-in was simple and the reception area was quite glamorous with a fire and plush seating. Good start! The staff were really frienly and helpful when we asked about how to get to particular places. We took the lift to our room on the second floor and this is where our disappointment began. The bed was comfortable and I was pleased to have feather pillows. However, the room was small and dark, and what with the furniture including a desk, side tables and TV table, there wasn't much room to walk around in. Some of the furtniture pieces were really quite scruffy and needed replacing. The bathroom was small, and the bath really low, but the power shower was great. It had been refurbed with a modern WC, sink & taps but the grouting on some of the wall tiles was atrocious and really needed re-doing as it looked a botch job and grubby. The hotel had a business centre which was 2 PCs offering free internet access. But the internet connection was SO slow and had weird parental control settings on them so that I couldn't read up about gambling in Vegas - ?!! There was also a printer in the room. I was on holiday with my brother, and whilst I was in the business centre, my brother was in our room watching TV and suddenly heard a hissing sound. It turns out that the heater / cooler system was leaking and we had to have it switched off as the carpet was wet. It didn't affect our stay as the temperature outside was fine so didn't need the heater/ cooler on. What was slightly concerning, was when my brother pointed out a sticker on the inside of our bedroom door which gave a health warning along the lines of 'these premises may contain traces of carcinogenics in the fabric of the hotel structure' and that they were obliged by the law of the state of california to declare this. Nice! What was a nice touch though was free wine (red or white - no rose!) for residents between 5.30pm and 6.30pm downstairs in the reception / seating area which gave an opportunity to relax abit in the early evening and chat to fellow residents. We didn't eat at the as we were on room only basis. We missed the complimentary coffee in the morning which was served up until 10am. There was a modern separate bar in the hotel which looked trendy but we didn't have a drink in there as we went out for the evening. To summarise, I can see what the hotel is trying to be - the staff are friendly and the reception area is lovely and gives a good first impression, but the hotel really does let itself down with the decor in the room and it really isn't to the standard of a boutique hotel. I know that San Francisco real estate isn't cheap and the location of the hotel is superb, but I expected far more for the price we paid (approx \u00c2\u00a3200) and on that basis, I wouldn't recommend the hotel. A few days earlier, (we went to Vegas in-between) we stayed at the Holiday Inn Express at Fisherman's Wharf, and although the location isn't as central, it's a lot better value, has much bigger and better rooms and has breakfast was included in the price and I would prefer to stay there.", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cShe's been ridden pretty hard\u201d", "Author": "fidelrobert", "ReviewID": "UR47596241", "Content": "Don't understand what others are saying when they say the rooms are spacious.

The front desk staff were quick to check us in and really friendly. We stayed 3 nights and checked out Monday morning to carry on to our next stop which was Napa. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. I can't really understand some of the negative comments because our expereince was great. We would definitely recommend the architectural walking tour that leaves from the hotel lobby every day at 11 am. My husband was more into this than I was, but as the tour started I found that I was really enjoying it too. It was one of the most interesting things that we did while we were there. The tour lasts about 1hr 45 mins and you never get more than about 3 blocks from the hotel but the information and buildings are really interesting and you wouldn't get to see that stuff on your own. The tour normally costs $20.00 per person I think, but guests of the hotel get to do it at no charge. Yes, the rooms are smallish, but the building is OLD, what do you expect? The furniture is comfortable and there was plenty of room for my husand and I. We would recommend this hotel and stay there again wothout hesitation. It was nice to be in the Union Square area as opposed o the Fisherman's Wharf area (where we stayed last time) just for the fact that it was less busy in this area. The shopping is amazing at Union Square and Chinatown is only a few blocks away. We would also recommend getting a MUNI pass which covers all buses and cablecars.

I decided to treat myself for my birthday last week and booked a King room on Expedia. I had researched the Joie de Vivre chain & liked what I saw. Hotel Tomo, Americania & Good Hotel were booked, so Park Galleria was the choice. In the past I've stayed in a youth hostel & the Hotel Max, which were both located in the Tenderloin. This time I wanted to stay in a different location. I don't get the negative complaints about this hotel. How much room do you really need for a business trip or basic vacation? Boutique hotels are generally smaller & honestly I felt that the size of the King room had enough space to my liking & looked like the photos on the site. The decor still has a Victorian style to it, but colorful & plush. My room was on the 3rd floor - 321 - facing Sutter Street. I love outside noise so hearing taxi cabs, buses and people on their way to work was not an issue. I slept like a baby after sightseeing half the day. Third floor was quiet & I barely heard a peep from the cleaning crew or other travelers. The hotel staff was pleasant & helpful with providing info on which Muni buses & trains to take. The location is central and the Montogomery BART is right around the corner. Internet connection worked fine for me. The wireless connection was \"Stay Online\" so those that say the connection was slow may have selected the wrong one. Considering what this hotel looked like in the past, JDV did an excellent job updating the decor. The restaurant Midi had my mouth watering for more. I devoured my flank steak & garlic fries. The good thing is that if you don't want to spend money on expensive alcohol at the hotel, you can walk 30 seconds up the street to the mini liquor store. BUT, they do offer the free wine tasting from 5:30 -6:30. Unfortunately I was always on my way out when the tasting started. Galleria is definitely an affordable boutique hotel, so it probably better serves couples & solo travelers.

The hotel had a great staff, all of whom were extremely friendly and were very willing to answer any of our questions and provide local advice on San Francisco. The rooms were well-kept and the cleaning staff always did a nice job of cleaning our rooms each day. The biggest reason I would recommend the hotel, though, is because of its location. The hotel is within walking distance to Union Square, Chinatown, the Embarcadero Center, Little Italy, and the street and cable cars. There are several really good restaurants, bars, nightlife within a four-five block radius of the hotel; plus, it is also located in a safe area. The only downside, though, was the hotel wasn't as posh or nice as I expected, especially since we paid a lot for the suite. However, I must admit I have been spoiled by Las Vegas; for those who have been there, hotels in Vegas are cheap, yet extremely nice.

Upon entering the lobby we were very impressed by its decor, even though they slammed the door on us as we were carrying our luggage. When we checked in I was very surprised to find we had a room for 1 that had a single bed, when we booked 2 beds. They were rude, and not helpful in providing another room which we specified on before arriving. Since, it was a long trip we asked for dining suggestion and the lady, was not forthcoming so we wondered around and found a lovely place to eat in Chinatown. While, the room was small, and they wouldn't provide another room with 2 beds unless we paid over $100.00 for our stay it is an excellent location. Since, we were out sightseeing, the peeling paint, holes in the walls and the noise from the adjoining room didn't bother us too much. One tip, that I was shocked about was the airport shuttle. The night before our departure I inquired at the desk about a shuttle service to the airport. The hotel said they didn't offer such a service nor were they willing to help us locate one, and get a cab and pay the $50,00 to the airport. We found American shuttle which offered $14 per person. In the morning Eric was very helpful and asked if the hotel arranged our service I was appalled when I learned they in fact did have a service. I learned near the end of the trip, the ladies who work the desk are usually rude, indifferent and their answer to everything is get a cab whether you are going to the golden gate bride, or the wharf. The men on staff, especially Eric are helpful and nice. There was also another gentlemen, I have forgotten his name who was excellent and apologized as well for the shuttle fiasco. He carried our bags to the cab and was the only person who wished us a nice day with a smile.

We each had our own room which was good as the rooms we were in were a bit small but that is very typical of SF. I was in an inside room and found it quite warm, she was in an outside room and found it nice & cool. Loved the decor and the location. We walked to Chinatown fairly late in the evening and felt no concern until the businesses starting closing-time to get back to the hotel. The bed and linens were excellent, very comfortable, clean and inviting. The bathroom was very nice, small but sufficient. I had a tub which was a little odd in that it sloped down which made standing in the shower a bit tricky. My sister had a walk-in shower which I would have loved. Not sure why hotels still do baths, I like a bath but find the idea of a bath in a location other than home a bit off-putting. Staff was friendly and helpful enough. Only snafu was that I had called a month earlier about King Tut tickets and they said they had lots. Checked the night we arrived and said they had lots. Checked the next day and none . We were planning to go Monday a.m. and I was quite disappointed. They called us on cell mid day and said they'd found 2 tix but by then it was too late, we were almost on the way to the airport. I called head office on return and they investigated, turns out there were tickets but likely they were locked in the safe and nobody knew which made it even worse. I missed the exhibit in London about 37 years ago as I was too ill to go and have been wanting to go since. But sort of my fault for not ordering beforehand to ensure we had them. The hotel was quite apologetic but no offer of a discount on our rooms or anything else which I found a bit odd. I would have liked a continental breakfast, saves trudging the streets looking for a place to eat. Other than that, no complaints. Nice walk to Ferry Building to catch the ferry to Sausalito, close to Union Square shopping. A tip - Cable Car lineups can be daunting, we caught the trolley for $2, worked like a charm. You can catch it from Fishermens' Wharf back to hotel area. We had dinner at John's Grill nearby, charming, historic, great lamb chops - huge order. Also had dinner at the E & O Trading Co. nearby-updated Asian, good, food & service, esp. the ribs done in coffee sauce, wish we'd ordered one each instead of sharing an order.

About the dinner hour they serve free wine at a lobby reception, which is a nice touch. There is an adequate fitness room. Shop around, as rates seems widely variable. If your dates are flexible rates vary consdierably depending on what day you are there. And this is San Francisco, so call ahead if you need parking and expect it will be expensive.

The hotel was great in accomodating us, even with things that we didn't plan in advance. For instance, we had planned to have 45 of our guests meet in the lobby one night before going out on the town. Right before, we decided to bring some alcohol to the lobby so our guests could have a few cocktails before departure. This little gathering actually ended up lasting 45 minutes and turned into a bigger party, and the hotel staff had no problem with it. In fact, they even quickly cleaned up any mess we made as we left. They were wonderful! I stayed in a suite, and while not huge, it was spacious and comfortable. The beds are quite nice. And the prices of the mini bar are the most reasonable I've seen.

If you are looking for the run of the mill hotel, this is not the one for you. It is eclectic but tastefully designed and gives you the feeling of home...at least our home. My husband and I were lucky enough to stay in a junior suite which was offered to us because we found a lower rate after we had booked directly with them. (you must do so within 24 hours or reservation) The room was what a normal sized room may be elsewhere and the other rooms we saw were small but if you are going to visit, and not spend all your time in the room then they are perfect size. Room service was actually cheaper than visiting the restaurant they get it from across the street and unless you order by nine, there are very little options around for food. The only complaint I had was the air conditioner. It didn't feel like it was putting out much for a room that size and we had to open a window in addition but come to find out on the last day the heater in the other window was on simultaneously with not way to turn it off. Once the window was open it cooled off, but if you run into that problem be sure to get earplugs if you are a light sleeper. The bed was a little soft for us but we are used to sleeping on a Tempurpedic. We did not partake of the wine service but thought it was nice seeing people mingle and enjoy each others company. I must say housekeeping was outstanding as well as the concierge. The complementary WiFi was alright but we are used to higher speed internet. The bathroom was small for a junior suite but not complaints about hot water or being dirty at all.

It made an excellent base of operations for our many trips exploring the city. The room itself was a bit on the small side, but more than sufficient for the two of us. The decor and ambiance throughout were modern and classy. One slight downside is that our room was on the inside, so the window looked out to an open area with hotel on all four sides. I'd call it a courtyard, but it wasn't pretty, and I think it just held things like air conditioners and the like. On the other hand, if you do want to get outside without going far, the hotel has a nifty rooftop park with plants and a walking/running track. That was pretty nice to get some fresh air. There's also a complimentary wine hour, which we attended once, and didn't return since the wine was so awful. I can't really complain about free wine, but I certainly wouldn't plan my schedule around it. Overall, the Galleria Park was a very nice hotel and we had a pleasant stay there.

We are young (41&34) with no kids yet and like to travel well. Galleria Park was chosen after researching the onlines (ExOrbHot.com, etc.) and was booked directly through the property's website. Hope this helps you. As this was our first vacation to SanFran and Napa Valley, we felt best being stationed in the Union Square area. Galleria Park (GP) was chosen because of its boutique style - which is to say that it wasn't \"just another chain\" hotel but something nice enough and unique to the city we were visiting. We took the BART in from SFO (easy and safe if you don't have more than one bag or so each) and walked to the hotel no problem. GP is in a safe area entirely - that issue should now be completely settled for all of you. Checkin was prompt and efficient. We actually arrived at noon and fully anticipated our room would not be ready yet and intinded to just check our bags till later. It was at this point that a very important factor of a good stay began. The attendant Jacob (?) was most accomodating in every way with an unusual ability to do so without making me feel crowded or rushed or uncomfortable that he's just bucking for a tip. It's a little difficult to explain, but in hindsight I believe it's because their customer service for us kept being incredibly helpful throughout our stay. And that's a thing about GP that needs your consideration. We were informed at noon that our room was not yet ready but that we had been upgraded to a larger room. Why? I don't know, but wonder personally if it is because I kept my reservation during a time when the online's (for a period of about one week) dramatically cut the rates per night by $50-75. We noticed this for other hotels we were considering too. With the jitters in the economy for some, I wonder if the hotels needed to fill up. It didn't seem crowded in SanFran/Napa at all. (March 29-April 4) Our room was very much like the website shows. See my pictures for our room (715). The room is clean and daily maid service did well. The bathroom is small with no counter space at all. The shower pressure was awesome and the temp good. Why don't hotels install fans in the bathrooms? Linen is good. Floors are good. The hotel is old, but it's been redone. It is fine. Our king bed was good, but not great. The pillows were the same. It really was fine, but not exceptional. This is where it differs from Campton Place or The Ritz. It's a hotel room that has been as well done over as could be in an old facility. We don't camp out in the room when we are on vacation, so really, don't you just need a good room in a nice place that is above average? GP is a good choice for that. We did feel comfortable and safe here. The staff does make a difference when you're away from home in unfamiliar territory. Studying and planning make the difference. Chinatown is close, the cable cars are close, cabs are available without much ado, etc., etc. I'll be writing an overall review of our visit in SanFran. I will say that Mr. Toad's tours are THE one you want. They dropped us off right at the GP saving us another ride from the wharf. The bottom line is this: If you can get a good deal, it is a good deal. I would stay here again if I could be sure to get this larger type room. Reading other recent reviews makes me believe that the hotel's smaller rooms would have compromised my impression quite a bit as we have been in such smaller type of rooms at other hotels in the past and they are not good. No, no, no.

Our first reaction when we open the door was \"uh...ok\". There was not much space in the room, where the bed took up most of it. There was not even much room just to put one small luggage while it's in use. One inconvennience was the sink area, which was facing the bed and away from the bathroom. It was hard to get things done in one place. Another thing that bothered me was the noisy sounds outside the hotel during the night since the hotel was right by the street in the financial district. It was very hard to sleep at night, even when the window was not open. Also another feature that I was not happy with was that the conference rooms and the hotel rooms are on the same floor, which it was hard to get the quietness one would like to have. In the early morning, all you hear is opening and slamming of the doors, and people using the conference room talking. I feel that they should have separate floor just for the conference rooms like other hotels does. It was very distracting.

Even with one person, moving around the bed at all made it feel like being on a waterbed. With two people it was very uncomfortable. The bed seems to be a basic mattress on a cheap, simple platform. My bed had the tendency to move around and rock side to side at the slightest movement. I hope it was just mine that had a problem because I can't imagine anyone being comfortable. Early in the morning I moved to the couch which wasn't much better, but at least it didn't move and make me seasick! This hotel seems to be a converted single room occupancy hotel. Rooms look like they could have been studio apartments at one point or SRO's. As you walk in you have a small sink/wet bar, a closet to your right and a desk in front of you. On the desk they leave some basic office supplies, sticky notes, paperclips etc. They also offer pads of paper \"for sale\". The room had about a full size couch.which was good because I needed it. It was more comfortable than sleeping on the bed. The room also has a large pot for heating water, a 27\" TV with satellite dish reception, the normal pay per view movies, etc. The hotel also provides drinking and water glasses and coffee cups. The hotel offers free Wifi which I had no trouble connecting to. One note for people with children, there are potential safety issues with the bathroom window. It opens easily, and there is nothing to limit how wide it opens. The handle is close to the floor, and it would be very easy for a child to climb up and open the window. I'm a bit afraid of heights, and when I opened the window to see if we had a view (we didn't), I was surprised how easy it would have been for a child to fall out. I hope this hotel does something to make their windows more child friendly. The room itself is alright but unless they do something about the beds, I wouldn't stay here again. This hotel advertises itself as a \"boutique\" hotel which usually equates to 3 1/2 star level accomodation and service. wish I had booked myself into a cheaper 3 star hotel or even 2 star, because I would have been more comfortable.

The location was decent as it was simple to get to from Bart. I arrived early on Friday. Don't bother requesting early check-in, they do nothing with the request. I had submitted an email AND called requesting directions and early checkin. Neither were honored. When arriving at the hotel, I was very pleased with the decor. It was tastfully presented. The lobby is small, intimate, and not overbearing. I asked for early checkin but the front desk agent was pretty rough around the edges. She did not seem the hospitable type the entire weekend. Hence, I tended to use the service of the man employees instead. They told me an hour for my room....waited 2 hours...and finally got the boom boom room. I don't know if they put me in this room because I was a Priceline consumer, but it was small, noisy, and in need of repairs. I'll post pictures. On Saturday, I requested assistance in directing me to the Legion of Honor museum. I was told taxi would be approx. 15 dollars. The hotel employee called us a cab, and sent the cab driver to the wrong park and wrong museum. Hence, costing me 35 dollars. I don't know if I'd stay here again. Maybe one of thier other properties.

I know that there are homeless people everywhere and you need to be careful, but this was one hotel I didn't see even one complaint about the homeless living outside the hotel. I booked it and was not disappointed by any means. This hotel is in the 'Financial District' which we noticed is probably about the best place to stay. Everything else is very touristy (such as the Warf) or in shady areas (such as anything on Market) or noisy areas (like Lombard St). This hotel was in the right area for us. There were no panhandlers near the hotel and it was in the middle of EVERYTHING. Market Street is like 3 blocks to the left, Chinatown is only about two blocks to the right, and there is the number 15 bus stop right outside the front doors on Kearny Street which takes you to the Warf and Little Italy. BUY A MUNI PASS!!!! They are only $11 for one day, $18 for three, and I can't remember what the week pass is but it isn't much. It gets you on to everything. We don't suggest riding the bus at night much. Some shady people were on and we felt uncomfortable. The hotel was beautiful, Staff was great, and rooms were nice. We came in at 9:30am and they allowed us to check in because they had a room available. If you dont have a room available that early, they will store your luggage so you can go out and enjoy the city. The room is the perfect size, very comfortable and tastfully decorated. We did hear a horrible noise like sheet metal outside in the hallway and we didn't know what it was. We told the hotel staff and the manager promptly went to investigate. It ended up being the laundry chute. The staff assured me that it only is in operation from 9am-5pm and asked if we wanted to switch to a more quiet room. We didn't feel that was necessary since we didn't plan on being there during the day - but it was very nice they offered. They were correct too - it was only until 5. Sign up for their Joy of Life club. They put a welcome card in our room with a 1/2 bottle of Chardannay and little mints. It was a nice touch. We unfortunately didn't eat at Perry's, though it smelled delicious. We did however eat at Pomodoros (sp) across the street on Kearny and it was wonderful. We also went to Murphy's Bar and we had breakfast every morning at Posh Beagle just one bock north on Sutter across from the Seven Eleven. We ended up ordering pizza to be delivered a couple times and that was great too. It was some place the hotel recommended. HINT: The city pretty much shuts down at 8-9pm, so if you want anything, go before that. The Seven Eleven and our pizza delivery is how we got by. I can't say enough about this place and this city.

After more careful insepction of the room, we found that old soap that were used by our rooms previous tenent (in the sink and shower) were not thrown away. Neither was the shampoo, conditioner or lotion. I sure hope they do not expect us to us someone else's old toiletries.

We stayed here for two nights at the end of October 2006 to see if it would be a good choice for guests of our upcoming wedding. We stayed in a renovated room on the 7th floor, which was decorated beautifully and was a comfortable size. The bed was exceptionally comfy and luxurious. The bathroom was small however, and had absolutely no shelf space so we had to pile up our toiletries on the floor by the sink. There was only one small mirror in the entire room - over the sink - which made getting dressed and ready a challenge for 2 people. I can't believe they didn't even bother to install a full length mirror somewhere. There was also no in-room safe, which meant I had to carry all my valuables in my handbag all weekend long. Another disappointment was the staff - although most people at the front desk were friendly, they weren't very helpful. We called the \"concierge\" one morning and asked for help in contacting a rental car company; we were told they couldn't help us, not even with getting a phone number. I know this isn't a 4 or 5 star hotel, but you would think they would help with a basic request like this. Avoid Perry's - we went here for a quick bite and the food was not fresh and not even cooked all the way through. There are several other restaurants within walking distance that are much better. I really wanted to love this hotel - the interiors are quite fashionable since the renovation, and the location can't be beat. But the nonchalant attitude of the staff and some oversights on the details tarnished our stay.

When the front desk clerk saw we were checking in with a Priceline rate her whole attitude changed.

She then proceeded to charge us $25 addtl per night b/c we will have 2 beds in our room w/2 children. Nothing we could do about it. The lobby was very \"tired\". The \"pleather\" chairs had rips in them with foam sticking out. The elevators were very slow (ok, we knew they were in historical bldg) but they also used them for service (i.e construction and housekeeping bins) and when they were on them we had to walk the stairs as there was no room for all to fit and it would be forever until it came back to get us. We stayed in room 505. They must have given us the worst room in the hotel (I'm thinking b/c we paid a \"low\" /$125 price from Priceline) My wife worked in hospitality for 10-years and could not believe they were putting guests in this room. They also had no other guest room to move us to, so they said. The room had old, dirty carpet (I would not let my kids walk in bare feet) with bedspreads and blankets which were \"pilly\" and quite disgusting looking. The wallpaper was ripping (my 10-yr old pointed it out!). they had duck tape and tin foil wrapped around a hose to some pipe leading to the a/c unit which was noisy and obnoxious and had to be turned off at night from the noise. The windows were so dirty you could literaly not see out. Finally the cracked tub had a gooey chain connected to the drain. It did not seem sanitary and the hotel never cleaned it after our request.

The woman at the front desk was actually incredibly rude, and obviously just wanted to hurry us through the process, not willing to discuss our room type and location. We stayed at the hotel Dec 29-Jan 2, and she kept explaining to us that the hotel would be completely booked the night of Dec 31 for New Year Eve. Fine, but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain why we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the King bed we requested when we booked the hotel, since when we arrived on the 29th, the hotel was empty. So after finally realizing we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting anywhere with her, we accepted the fact that we would have two double beds. Also, I called the hotel before we arrived to make sure we could count on the wireless internet available in the rooms, as we both needed to do some work during our stay at the hotel. The nice woman I talked to at the hotel (I wish I knew her name, she was great!) explained that some rooms are better than others, and that generally the inner courtyard rooms don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have as great wireless connection. I mentioned this to the woman who checked us in, and she completely blew me off, saying that no particular area was better than any other, and basically said the wireless was spotty throughout the hotel! Not great news for us, because we really counted on this amenity when we booked the hotel. Needless to say, we were extremely frustrated at check-in and figured the rest of our stay would be a nightmare. We got our room key, and ended up on the 4th floor in a TINY room with two double beds, and not much room for anything else. My husband tried to get the wireless to work in the room with little success. It would come on here and there, but it was mostly off. My husband called down to the front desk to see if there was anything we could do, expecting to have another frustrating conversation with the same woman. Luckily, another woman answered the phone (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m thinking it may have been the same woman I talked to over the phone a few days before) who was much better to work with. He explained the wireless problem, and she said we could be moved to a room with a better connection. He also decided to take a chance and ask about a king room, and somehow a room was suddenly available! She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even act like it was a problem, and acted surprised that the first woman hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given us one. We picked up new room keys for our room on the same floor, and were pleasantly surprised by the new room (rm 415). I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call it luxurious or anything, but it was more than twice the size of our previous room, large king bed, better bathroom, and the wireless worked through our whole stay. What a relief! The hotel is obviously old and rough around the edges. Random things were broken everywhere and looked like they had been only halfway dealt with. For example, one of our window curtains was ripped, and a safety pin was holding it together instead of being sewn back together. There were cracks in the sealing and walls. But the hotel does have a certain amount of charm, and the location really is perfect. We had no problem with street noise at all, and we were above a very busy street.

The lobby is medium sized with a large, ornate fireplace, that in the daytime, looks horribly fake, but is dramatic after dark. Overall the hotel looked like a Kimpton on a budget, not quite as ornate as other Kimpton's I've stayed in, but not bad. We were only able to get double beds, which was a bit of a problem, but overall the room was nice, clean, the bath stocked with Aveda, etc. Up on the 8th floor, things were quiet, which compared to my last stay in SF, was a treat to return to after spending days out in the city or Napa. Located on the edge of the Financial district, 2 blocks from Union Sq. I found it convenient enough to what we wanted to do. While everyone knows parking a car in this city is expensive, I though $38 a night (w/tax however) was a bit steep, I'm guessing maybe the proximity to the Financial area is partly to blame? Overall, other than the bed issue, no problems. One note of humor, in the bath there is a Kimpton card noting things you can request for free or for a fee which you may have left at home, on the free list was \"Wrinkle Releaser\" (I.e. Downy Wrinkle Releaser) I asked the front desk for this as well as Two (2) bathrobes (which we should not have has to ask for) upon our return we found a small container of Static Guard that appeared to have been manufactured sometime in 1987.", "Date": "April 29, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Galleria Park, a Joie de Vivre hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d80990-Reviews-Galleria_Park_a_Joie_de_Vivre_hotel-San_Francisco_California.html", "Price": "$185 - $423*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">191 Sutter Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Francisco</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94104</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "80990", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e9/35/c8/galleria-park-a-joie.jpg"}}

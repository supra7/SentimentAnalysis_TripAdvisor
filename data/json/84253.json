(My wife also heard another ladies complaint: Another lady and her older son were also were given the same run-around and were forced to take a room with one king bed \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 WOW. The mother had to sleep with her older son.) After booking it for 4 people, they assign us a room for 2 (one king bed) and said they have no more rooms, they were full. (we booked on Hotwire). After a talk to the manager, we were given a room for 4. (even after they said they had no more rooms for 4). They are liers. Then when we went to the room it was second rate. There was a huge blotch on the carpet, about 3' across. When looking for a sock under the skirting of the bed I found someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s candy wrappers, and a large letter from New York. The covers on the bed had a cluster of spots on it, about 1' by 2'. The bathroom Mirror frame was greasy, and dull, I cleaned a patch with water and soap and it sparkled \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it had not been cleaned in several years and perhaps never. They first said that they had no room for 4 people, and that they were booked up, Then they assigned us one after I talked to the manager. Then they said we should have booked the hotel through them direct (not a travel booking company, then things would have been different) yet they had the reservation right there on their screen ...then things would have been different????? I suspect that since we were booked on Hotwire at a reduced rate) they had managed to sell off all of their premium rooms themselves and decided to give us this nasty room to make their point. They gave us an un- renovated (second rate room). What is their game?? They lied to us about not having rooms, they did have our reservation and said that they have the choice of giving us a room with one king bed or a room with two queens. Yet knowing fully that we were 4 people they said the room we get is for 2 people only!. This sort of crape is not necessary. I was in LA with my daughters for a trip to see LA and Disneyland etc. Their hearts were set on a nice hotel for this trip and the hassle and lies I had to deal with were totally unnecessary.

For airport hotels you do, however, have to keep your expectations low. These hotels serve one purpose- give people arriving or departing a place to stay- it's not an escape or an indulgence to stay at most airport hotels. This one is no different. Everything is now clean and nicer but it's just a solid 3 star hotel. And they have made one bad decision with their new LG tvs- no sleep timer. Not sure why some models have one and others don't - these don't and I love that feature when I travel. Here's the big downside: This is essentially a v-shaped hotel. Everything on the inside of the V looks directly out on a very active LAX runway about 1/2 mile away. That would be fine if the airport operated on a 9-5 scheduled but it is more likely running on a 6AM-11PM schedule. Thought soundproofing is good we are talking about jet planes taking off- you will hear them!

A short and pleasant interaction. When I arrived to my room, everything was what one would expect of a 4 star hotel. I asked for a renovated room and discovered I had been already upgraded because of a membership that I have. A nice touch was a personal message on the phone (not a recorded one) checking to make sure that everything in the room was in order. I guess all I needed after that was cookies and milk and to be tucked in. I am a stickler for water pressure, so I was not disappointed when I had bathing time. The deep tub was a plus. Room service was fast and very efficient. I ordered breakfast in my room the next day and was satisfied with the service.

Definitely a plus, the bed. For less than 100 US dollars, this is the place. If you want to be near the airport and have a good nights rest, this is the place.

Rooms are like-quality to some of those in Waikiki (rundown, disrepair) but the last time I stayed there the room was awesome and seemed to have been fixed up. I usually book directly with the reservations person at the hotel and she is awesome! The check-in staff however, have ALWAYS been miserable, unfriendly and impolite. Definitely need to fix that! There is a great little bakery in the lobby featuring Krispy Kreme and the restaurant is good too. Beware of parking gouge. $13.95 per night self-park or $23.95 for valet. And in that neighbourhood, you probably want valet so prepare to be gouged. Definitely ask for a room away from the runway, otherwise your view and sound all night will be of planes taking off and landing at LAX. My mistake the first time. Also, this place does not offer free Wi-Fi like the rest of the modern, hotel world. Definitely a knock against a hotel of this calibre.

I'm a Priority Club member and visit a lot of IHG hotels. The Crowne Plaza's are usually very nice but the one at LAX is a little unusual. Here's Why: 1 - It is a pretty old and dated hotel as far as Crowne Plaza's go. The place DESPERATELY needs an update. Construction is starting on that and it is going slowly. 2 - It is a little noisy being only one block off the northern runway of LAX. 3 - It is probably the best staffed hotel I visit on a regular basis. EVERYONE is professional and pleasant. From the maid staff to the front desk and conciege, all have been nothing less than professional with me and many go beyond what is required to make you comfortable. 4 - Finally there is TONY. He is a wonderful combination of waiter, cook and concierge who runs the club on the 16th floor. Tony is really the reason I return here 2X a year for the meetings I attend at the Sheraton . Make sure you either stay on the 16th (execuive) floor or make use of your Priority Club status when you stay here. Good Stuff: If you enjoy a view of LA lights at night, most rooms have some sort of view. The food in the restaurant is always good, not superb, but good consistent food. Try the pizza's. The staff is top notch and it is convenient as it gets for access to LAX. Wireless internet is good. (I'm using it now) Not so good stuff: The rooms are decidely average. Old TV's, carpet, furniture, phones etc. There are better equiped rooms at most Holiday Inn Express, but I hope the re-model will fix that. Perks: The Club room and Tony.

Check-in: Very prompt and I was on my way up to my room. Room: As stated, they are refurbishing this property. My room was very large and had a nice view, buthad not been updated. Pros - very comfortable bed/linens (slept great); four great pillows; variety of TV channels; free bottle of water; good shower; excellent hair dryer; top floor of the hotel. Cons - badly stained carpet; duvet was worn and frayed; toothpick lying next to bathroom trash can (not my trash); went to the desk drawer to see if they had stationery so I could mail a letter and found Trojans instead. Amenities: - Wifi - the hotel charges $10.95 for 24 hours of Internet. The coffee shop in the lobby charges for wifi (cheaper with drink purchase) and four PC's available at a minimum $5 cost. I was surprised this served as the business center. - Restaurant/coffee shop - I visited the restaurant for breakfast. It is an extensive buffet with a combination of hot items, fruit, pastries, muffins, etc. The coffee shop serves a variety of coffees, danishes, muffins, bagels, Krispy Kreme, and to go items. - Gym - the gym had treadmills, bikes, ellipticals, free weights, and machine weights. Small, but very functional. - Airport shuttle - there is a free shuttle bus that us used by multiple hotels. At 630am, it was full and some had to wait for the next bus. One thing I want to mention... My family drove me from dinner and shopping to the hotel. My sister waited at a red light to make a right turn onto Century Blvd - it was hard to see oncoming traffic because of parked cars, so she waited at the red light for a green. The shuttle driver behind us laid on the horn a lot since she waited, which I'm pretty sure is legal; I did not know it would be the same driver that pulled up in front of the CP as we unloaded my bags. We were along the curb unloading my stuff and the bus lays on the horn again...claiming it was not us he was yelling/honking at when I approached him to ask for a minute to get my stuff. He said it was the other car...which was unoccupied, so his honking was not going to help move it anywhere Anyway, as a customer I thought this was really unprofessional ... perhaps an open trunk and me taking out my belongings was not obvious. I've stayed at CP properties in London, Atlanta, and NYC. Of them, this is the most dingy (room wise, the facilities were fine) I've stayed in, but they are re-doing it.

Firstly, it turns out the discount I received was actually far less than advertised, they seem to have just jacked up the price on Hotwire; and secondly, I felt like I was being treated as a second class citizen because I tried to be thrifty. I understand that you can't always expect the same level of glamour when trying to save a few bucks, but to be poorly treated by a major hotel chain? That's appalling to me. I was traveling with 3 other people (myself, a friend, and a couple), and we were shocked by the size of the room. The beds were too small for the couple to sleep comfortably, let alone for two grown men to share. We asked for a rollaway bed, but they said they couldn't because it was a fire hazard which seemed odd to me. I'm not saying that they were lying about it, but I have never had a problem getting a rollaway bed in similar establishments in California. The front of desk's only recommendation to me was that I consider sleeping on the floor if I wasn't comfortable. I had to leave that conversation I was so upset at those childish remarks. I was polite and rational, and I was met with hostility and sarcasm. My friend, who is admittedly over emotional at times, almost cried at being treated like that. What really irks me is that the room was clearly set up for two people. Two towels, two cloths, two individual shampoos. The desk staff said that they simply give rooms to Hotwire who then fills the rooms, but they could at least maintain some communication with Hotwire to ensure that they're ready to welcome your guests in a professional manner.

This is my second stay at the Crowne Plaza LAX and up to this point I did not know how to appropriately rate this property. Both times I arrived at the hotel quite late at night and had an early departure which did not leave much time to get the full experience. I will say that I enjoyed both of my stays at the property but it really started to cement the thought that most of the Crowne Plaza properties that I have stayed at are getting very dated. Please keep in mind, I stayed at this property over a year ago and they may have refreshed their property since my last stay. Table of Contents Looking for a particular section?

For example, CTRL+F and \"ii.\" will take you to \"Air Transat Flight\". i. Booking ii. Airport Transfer & Check-In iii. The Room iv. Club Level v. Conclusion (i.) Pre-Booking --- Booking the room was quick and easy as it always is with ICHotels group. Not only were we able to book a room on the Executive Floor, they also charged the same rate for the same room on a standard floor. Excellent touch! Excellent reliability with PC points to book the room. (ii.) Airport Transfer & Check-In --- After a very long day of flights we finally touched down at LAX at 00:30 and took the long taxi towards the terminal. Finally getting outside of the airport at around 1:15 it was time to wait for the airport shuttle. Surprisingly, there was not much of a wait! About 10 minutes of waiting curb side for the shuttle it showed up with \"Crowne Plaza LAX / Raddison LAX\" on it's planned route. The bus ride was another 15-20 minutes as we navigated the cars around the terminals and drove the maze of roads onto West Century. Arriving at the hotel provided a quick and easy check-in experience. The reservation was already prepared and without any delay we were on our way to the elevator to swipe our card to get to the CP Executive Floor. On the previous stay being on a standard floor meant having to share with a travelling youth band. As you can imagine they weren't the quietest bunch. The only thing we heard on the floor was the ding of the elevator when we arrived. The Crowne is close to the airport. A quick complimentary shuttle ride away. (iii.) The Room The room was comfortable. We were located on the West side of the hotel with a view of the LAX tarmac (something which I had requested in the reservation). The room was your average Crowne Plaza style. Two double beds with the Crowne Plaza red pillow for decoration, a working desk and television. The room needs an update, there is no doubt about it. From what I have seen on the other reviews there is a refresh program that is starting to pop up throughout the hotel; a welcome change indeed! Bathroom was clean and once again a standard Crowne Plaza room. Good amenities, great water pressure. No complaints at all. As with the bedroom, it also needs a refresh. (iv.) Club Level --- If you are on the fence on whether to upgrade to the Club level, just do it! On the first stay we opted out and stayed on a standard floor with significantly more noise and traffic. The second time, we upgraded and were very happy we did so. The primary reasons were the quietness of the floor and complimentary continental breakfast. The area around this hotel is barren. The only place to get something to eat within walking distance was snack food at a VERY sketchy convenience store. The breakfast in the morning was fresh and offered a large amount of different pastries, juices, and coffee. Even for an extra $10 it's so much more worth it then going to the \"store\" or waiting to pay through the roof at the airport. Note: I am not a very frequent user of Executive level services. To me it was perfect, but to other seasoned business travellers it may not be the same experience. (v.) Conclusion --- As the title says, it was an average Crowne experience. I don't expect the Crowne brand to be grand in any sense but it should live up to it's name as an upscale business traveler hotel. I can't say that if I have the opportunity to stay at another Crowne I would \"jump\" at the chance, but I do know that they hold a quality product that is a little dated. As with this property specifically it is comfortable, close to LAX, provides an airport shuttle, and will give you a good night sleep. If you aren't tied to Priority Club and earning through them I'd say take a look around the area and see if another property really attracts you. If you're looking for an average CP property near LAX, this is for you.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat Expereince ... every time\u201d", "Author": "a m", "ReviewID": "UR122096271", "Content": "I have travel to LA 5-8 times a year for the past 3 years (for business) and have stayed at this hotel almost every time.

It's an airport destination; I've seen few families staying here and that's probably because there are more family oriented hotels closer to the touristic sites in the L.A. area. On my last stay in August 2011, our daughter drove up from San Diego to see us off. She has a three year old an an infant and as we entered the lounge to have a drink and appetizer I noticed the waitress view us out of the corner of her eye as she stood at the server counter visiting with the bartender. We chose a table at the back where we would not bother any of the guests, though there were few. We didn't get waited on so I eventually had to get up and go ask the waitress to take our order. Service was tendered but with an attitude. Not a family experience! Rooms are adequate but I've always found the bathrooms - and I've stayed here a number of times - to be dated. The upside: beds are comfy and the pillows are so good I ordered some. The dining room is laid out around a central buffet but you can order from the menu. Meals border on average but I've never been disappointed with the service during breakfast or dinner. The wait staff in this restaurant go beyond the call of duty and I'm never reluctant to leave a generous tip. Curbside parking valets are friendly and efficient. Finding a valet to carry luggage to your room can be problematical, though, and on more than one experience. I checked in one night and found a college age valet standing in the lobby with nothing to do but not meeting the shuttle bus at curbside. I finally got his attention and got my bags to the room. I flipped him a $20 bill to help pay for his education and told him next time to pay attention to arriving guests. But this is really management's job. On another occasion, I made reservations on line (I'm a Priority Club member) for my wife and when she checked in they weren't going to give her the room after traveling over 20 hours from the Middle East because she wasn't me! If they had scrolled down on the reservation they would have found the notation that she would be arriving late and checking in in her name.

Being an IHG employee, I can not believe that a Crowne Plaza of this nature has even past inspection and flagship is still in tact! Starting with the pro's: - 24 hour shuttle through the airport will bring you directly to the hotel every 20 minutes. - Gentlemen working the guest service desk on August 5 at 3pm recommended us to an amazing Thai food restaurant and was very helpful Now the long list of con's: - Checked in with Len and asked her for a great room. The normal saying when you go to a high end hotel to make sure you get what you pay for. Problem is she found it funny that there were bad reviews on Tripadvisor and that heavily stained carpets were nothing. It could be that we were staying on an employee rate, but if she gave my party the sass we received, wonder what she is like with others. **** ROOMS RENOVATED AT $20 EXTRA. If you do not pay the extra $20 please keep reading. - Desk chair was stained and broken, wires exposed everywhere in the room, phone was sticky and dirty, coffee maker in the room was broken and missing a filter tray to actually make coffee, carpets stained, lock on door broken with the handle and chain lock loose, AC unit kept letting air out with what smells similar to cat litter and cleaning supplies (when the heat was accidentally switched on, a foul burning smell stuck in the room), window was beat up with the frame bent and molding covers gone and glue exposed, shower tiles were cracked, grout everywhere had stains of all different colors, heavy water buildup on shower head, towels were so frayed and worn that they look worse than the ones at car washes, and the last, of probably will not be the last, is that the counter to the bathroom was cracked and a heavily applied yellow substance was still oozing out of the crack.

I should preface this review by saying that we got Airline staff rates which were much cheaper than normal - however this does not justify what we found when we stayed there. We had a double room (two double beds, one for me and my wife and one for the two kids) on the 15th floor of the hotel in what was supposed to be the \"quiet\" area. The room was fine but it took us a while to work out the A/C since the unit had controls that did not work - until we discovered that they were in fact redundant and the room control unit was on the wall! The room itself was fine except that we were right above runway 25 left at LAX. Great for plane spotters but really loud if you want to sleep. Clearly, the windows were not soundproofed and I was surprised to find flights taking off still around 1:30 in the morning! When we booked this hotel, I was told that breakfast was inclcuded for the two adults but the children would incur a fee. This was similar to the arrangement we had at the Sheraton Four Points in San Diego where we flew into the US before we arrived here. Actually, for a buffet breakfast where my kids did not eat much, we were charged $63! I queried the bill and the hotel stated that British Airways rates did not include breakfast! I was not happy. In the end, the Resturant Manager agreed to reduce the bill to $40. Still not happy about that really. By the way - the Pool? Don't bother. Its a postage stamp! The thing is on the second floor and so small that when the people sitting at the far end start smoking, the kids get irritable in the pool at the far end! And we had to wait ages for replacement towls to be delivered while we shivered by the pool, which itself is in shade most of the time because it is between two buildings - which also means that there is a fairly strong wind around most of the time. Parking the rental car on the hotel property costs $13.75 which is reasonable, despite the fact that at the Sheraton in San Diego it was free! To be honest I expected much more from this hotel as I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza in the UK both at Heathrow and in Chester where the service and prices were impeccable. But the hotel here at LAX was pretty bad considering. Even the lady who sold me the road map in the gift shop was rude when I stated that the map only showed LA north of the airport and I wanted to see the south part.

Got to my room and it was clean. The bed was comfortable. The room had a view out onto a main road, but it is an airport hotel that you don't go to for the view, and I had no problem with traffic noise. I ended up waking up around 9:30am the next morning and decided to have a shower and go to breakfast (which was supposed to be available until 11:00am). By the time I got down to the breakfast room it was about 10:20am and it was empty. I had to wait a minute before someone noticed that I was there and I asked if I could have some breakfast. I was told the breakfast buffet had already finished, but I didn't want the buffet anyway, i just wanted some eggs on toast and juice. They accommodated me while they were setting up for lunch. Breakfast was good - massive plate of eggs and steak (not sure if it's the same everywhere in the US, but the steak was so fatty that I could not eat it - but I am picky about meat anyway). Cost was reasonable considering I was staying at a Crowne Plaza (about USD$18 total inc drink, tax, tip). The hotel also has a cafe that sells snacks all day also at a reasonable cost. As I was awake I went to ask the concierge what there was to do around the area as my flight did not leave till about 10pm that evening. He suggested paying $5 (round trip) to take the \"trolley\" (it's just a bus with wooden seats) to Manhattan Beach. I did do that and it was a great suggestion. You can get off either in the main town area (near the beach), or go to either of the two malls a little further on. Overall this hotel is reasonably priced and I had no problems with the room or the staff. I assume they mostly get people staying for 1-2 nights on arrival or at the end of their holidays as the hotel is by the airport (free shuttle to and from airport) and there is not much to do around the area and it's not close to any of the usual tourist sites in LA, but I will definetely go back there at the end of my next trip to the US.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBest breakfast buffett with the freshest, tastiest fruit near LAX!\u201d", "Author": "changrcc", "ReviewID": "UR115069051", "Content": "OK... if you can handle the occassional aircraft landings and take-offs at this hotel a few blocks away from LAX, then you don't want to miss their breakfast buffett, especially the incredible in-season fruit.

Maybe our expectations of what LA would be like were off, but it was disappointing to have to spend $60 (one-way) to get to the nearest place of interest. On the way back we had a similar problem, in that the hotel is too far away from anything interesting for it to be cheap or practical enough to see the sights before you have to catch a flight.

We are not picky about the hotels we stay at. All we require is that the room is clean and the beds are reasonably comfortable. This room was far from that! I can honestly say that this was the worst hotel room we have ever had and we have stayed in many hotels. Even the $50 a night budget hotels that we have stayed in were way better than this hotel. The only reason we choose this hotel was because we like to park in the quikpark parking garage right next door when we fly. So we didn't have to go far to check in after parking. The Marriot down the street is a way better choice than this hotel. Only downfall there is no covered parking. But the rooms are clean and comfortable there.

Despite its affordable price tag, I seriously reconsidered even pursuing our 3 day trip plan to LA after reading all the bad, depressing reviews and seeing the disgusting photos posted by other travelers. With a toddler and a clean-freak like myself in mind, it seemed like throwing away around $200 (because Priceline bid offers cannot be refunded) might be the only way to save our vacation from the worst hotel nightmare. Fortunately, I figured out from the Crowne Plaza Hotel website that there were renovated rooms at an extra cost. So we decided to upgrade our room as soon as we arrived (only additional $20/night). And boy, am I glad to have done that! With an exception of a bath tub (which has apparently not been replaced, but not too shabby either), everything was in brand new, sparklingly clean, and excellent condition. It definitely looked like a 4 star hotel room. Another thing that we liked is that they offer an option to gain internet access for 2 hours ($1.95), which was sufficient time to check emails and search for sightseeing/dining options for the next day. It would have been even greater if the internet was free, but I thought $1.95 was pretty reasonable. The only downside was the noise from the flights (relatively minor though) and from next room through a paper thin wall. Our neighbor was watching TV literally all night (from 1am to 6am), and that did bother our sleep on our first night of the stay. But since our neighbor left on the second day, that noise issue was no longer a problem. So all in all, we were happy with our stay. Important tips to the future travelers: 1) Try to play as much lowball bid as possible (I even saw someone got a room for $40/night) to get an overall decent deal. 2) For those of you who have higher expectation on hotel rooms, please do not hesitate to spend extra $20 per night to go with upgraded rooms. 3) Do not park in the garage which adds $14/night. There were always a few street parking spots in the back of the building (2 hour parking from 12am to 8am, which translates to a free parking from 10pm to 10am). 4) When you check in, ask for quieter rooms on the backside of the building.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cVery Pleasantly Surprised!\u201d", "Author": "Californiadreaming64", "ReviewID": "UR101297670", "Content": "We flew in on a red eye from the east coast.

The \"manager\" pointed to my bill which had the CORRECT CHECK OUT DATE and said that I was not and that I shouldn't freak out about it. I told him that the ONLY reason I was \"freaking out\" was because his employee told me that I had to leave and the hotel was sold out. Never an apology from either of them. The maids knocked on our door early in the morning two out of the 5 days, even with the do not disturb sign displayed. We got one extra bottle of shampoo in the time we were there. There was a horrible stain on the bed skirt that was extremely disgusting. Use your imagination. The queen size beds are not...they are doubles. The water never got hot...we took luke warm showers. The hallway to our room was freezing cold...there was an open vent at the end and it whistled at night. The restaurant was just okay but the wait staff was terrible. Some couldn't understand us, and I'm pretty sure we speak decent English. I've never had a hard omelette before...I didn't like it! The coffee shop which sold coffee, donuts, sandwiches, etc. was much better. All-in-all, not a good trip and the hotel is also under renovation. I'm not sure if our room had been renovated or not...hope not. It looked like it was in a time warp.

The room was clean other than the carpet and the daily cleaning service was efficient. I personally would not take a bath in the small tub, but the shower had a massaging head and the curtain was curved out a bit as to make it less confining. I parked in the self parking lot (a reasonable $12 a day or something like that) and was able to walk to my conference at the Hilton in 15 minutes each way. The breakfast buffet was a good deal with the 50% off coupon given to me at check-in and seemed to be a popular choice.

The windows were dirty and one did not shut properly which caused noise difficulties from the nearby runway & flight path. The ancient aircon unit rattled and the pipes vibrated through the wall to the next room (even if ours was switched off!). This noise was 24/7. Whenever the room above us ran their sink water or shower we found water coming into our bathroom sink and bubbling up in the sink pipes. The walls to the rooms were thin and we could hear people in the rooms either side talking. The outer bedding did not look particularly clean and the beds were not so comfortable. The restaurant is relatively dark with just a few windows that look onto a smoking courtyard. Again, the furniture and decor is tired and does not appear inviting. Our second visit to the restaurant was a real turning point due to the delivery of some bread and butter to our table by a waiter, which was accompanied by a long thick black hair woven through the butter scoops. This was utterly disgusting and we were in disbelief that not only had it been placed there by whoever prepared it but that it had also gone un-noticed by the waiter. It was clearly obvious and we immediately questioned the overall restaurant hygiene. We pointed this out and cancelled our food order, although the staff did not seem that suprised. Needless to say we did not eat here again. Good points; Either side of the hotel are the Sheraton and the Marriot. They are both very nice with relaxed yet smart restaurants.

(See below for an earlier review and a message to third-party guests. Usually, I get rooms in this hotel via Priceline, and although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rated as 3.5 star, bidding for a 3-star will often return Crowne Plaza. Bid $50 or less.) Some of the caveats remain, but some things have improved: NOTABLE: (I am now known by name, and am on a list of some kind at the hotel, so this may get me a level of treatment not given to all guests.) Checkin was swift and easy. I was placed on the 15th floor, reserved for CP \u00e2\u20ac\u0153priority\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd guests, and given a room with a nameplate that identified it as a suite. It was different from other rooms in attractive but cosmetic ways: faux marble entry and bathroom floor; a lovely quiet-flush toilet, an attractive ice bucket and new furniture fixtures, a soft ceiling light next to the bed, and a bottle of water. An airport shuttle runs about every 20 minutes. Nearby competitors (Courtyard, Radisson) offer free wireless, so the $11 charge is an irritant, but the option to buy 2 hours @ $2 works and download speeds are nothing short of remarkable--500 KB/sec, twice what I get at home. Free wireless that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work, common in hotels, is a big marketing mistake. BE WARNED: The shuttle is not announced inside the hotel lobby--you need to be outside. The stops are brief and you can fail to get a seat the shuttle because it is too crowded. (It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s run by a vendor, and also stops at Radisson.) Plan this possible delay into your trip. Another guest told me she missed two prior shuttles, and when she asked a bell desk employee, he was dismissive. In her words: Thirty seconds is not enough for me to get my luggage and myself outside. Announcing the shuttle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival INSIDE the lobby is a small step that would help some slower-moving or hard-of-hearing guests a lot. A coupon given at check in for 50% off food and beverage used to help small eaters, but now applies to buffet only. The price of the buffet is high to begin with, so this is a big bonus for big eaters. Room doors still slam--hard. This is addressed by asking guests for quiet on the door tag, which clearly does not work. A fix would probably involve installing hardware closures, a big job. The hotel web site notes free local-area-shopping transportation but an inquiry to the concierge produced a referral to a taxi. The bus transit center is on 96th, a 1/4 mile walk. Know in advance the route you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for, and have exact change for the fare. January 2010 Exceptional Bedding, Many Customer-Unfriendly Irritations [This note to Priceline & other third-party guests precedes all my reviews of hotels I purchased through a 3rd party vendor] 3rd-party customers read reviews and arrive with expectations; high attentiveness to guest needs distinguishes one 2-3-4 star from others. Third-party prices fill rooms, and provide the business with opportunities to sell services and win future customers. My advice: pay attention to reviews, articulate needs clearly (both in advance and on arrival) and speak directly and immediately to management if your expectations are not met. If basic room needs are unmet, ask management for adjustment; if unresponsive, tell the 3rd-party vendor in writing; use snail mail to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s street address and direct to Customer Service VP. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found them responsive. Talk to management directly and pleasantly: they value meaningful guest feedback and often can use information you provide to correct persistent problems. Whatever rate you paid, be courteous and civil to a fault: it never helps to be confrontational. Commend with care what is commendable.] At almost any time of year, rooms can be had for LAX-friendly overnights at $40-50 on Priceline. If you are bidding on higher-star hotels, you may be rejected under $95. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fail to adjust your bid DOWN if you drop star levels from 4 to 3.5. CP is treated as 3.5, but it can nearly always be had for under $50 on Priceline, and if you are bidding on 3-stars you may get it (3.5) instead, described by Priceline as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgrade.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd COMMENDABLE: Guest laundry, regular free airport shuttle, very nice bedding. Expensive but well-operating wireless internet, with 2-hour-at-$1.95, 4-hour at $4.95 (What??) and 24 hours at 10.95. Simple but good curtain closures.

There were marks on the wall that looked like they may give you a disease if you touch them. UGH.

The hotel is well taken care of and has clean facilities. Our room was on the 10th floor, but facing the airport's runway. For the most part, that was not a problem, though the plane noise did wake me up once on a day that seemed to be particularly busy at the airport. I would recommend requesting a room that is not facing the airport if you are a light sleeper. My favorite features of the hotel were the fitness center and the sauna and steam room, both of which are in great shape and well-kept. The two downfalls: parking is $12 per day; Internet is $10 per day. We had two minor incidents while there. First, three of the towels in our room were stained, but were replaced with new ones. Second, there was a scheduled power outage to occur for a few hours after midnight one night (apparantely ordered by the county). Letters were sent to all occupied rooms to inform them of it, except we never got one in our room. It totally caught us off guard, as we are \"night people\" and stay up late. I kindly spoke to the manager about it upon check-out, and he was more than understanding and courteous. He more than made up for it by waiving some room charges. Although those experiences were not pleasant at the time, one cannot expect everything in such a large hotel to go perfectly well. It is how those incidents are handled that matters to me, and this manager went out of his way to ensure customer satisfaction. For that reason, I would definitely stay here again. One thing to note, though: if you are going to LA as a tourist, I do not recommend that you stay in the LAX area. I read one reviewer write the same thing and disregarded it, but later wished I had listened to the advice.

The garage was a little confusing to figure out at first -- the first time I parked in it, I came out the wrong side and had to walk all the way around the office building next door to get to the hotel.

Actually, I have like any other Crowne Plaza I have stayed in, but this one was just awful. I had a problem with someone trying to get in my room (don't know if they were lost or front desk gave them a key to an already rented room- oddly this happened to a reviewer who stayed at the Crowne Plaza in Seattle as well) and then my key wouldn't work.

The hotel is one of the closest to the airport, and right between the two main runways. The windows really need to be triple-paned, and they aren't. I came in at 1:30 AM, and it's amazing how many planes are landing even at that ungodly hour. That being said, I need earplugs for some reason or another 2/3 of the time I go to hotels, so I just used the ones provided and slept well. The hotel is actually pretty convenient to the beaches, Westwood, and the Getty museum. If you can get the Entertainment Card rate, it will save you a bundle from the price of a hotel with comparable quality in Santa Monica or Westwood.

The check-in and check-out were without problems though the hotel was experiencing some computer problems. I was given a room on the club level with complimentary drink and breakfast coupons. I did not expect this and was pleasantly surprised. I had turned in my Hertz rental car and they provided a courtesy shuttle to airport hotels which I took advantage of so I felt like I received a very good value on this stay--free ride, free meals, free room. I highly recommend joining all the hotel point clubs. The room here was very nice. I appreciate how Crowne Plaza properties provide guests with curtain clips--I have found this to be true at all properties and it is so nice to ensure that the morning sun will not interrupt one's sleep. I don't care for the other \"sleep\" amenities they leave--the room fragrance, the sleep CD, etc. but the curtain clips are a good thing!! What will interrupt one's sleep at this property is the runway noise. There were earplugs in the room for a reason! The noise is constant all night long. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spacious with good water pressure. The television had pay per view movies and the room was furnished well. The restaurant downstairs was especially good with a lunch buffet that I enjoyed. The two breakfast buffets were also good with hot oatmeal, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, fruit, etc. I also had dinner at the restaurant. My rib-eye was probably not the best I had ever eaten but it was cooked well with a good flavor and I was pleased with the meal. The elevators were very fast-I never had to wait for an elevator and the people were all very friendly. There is a sushi bar and a coffee bar near the check-in desk that is open most of the day and there always seemed to be people there. A lot of airline personnel were in the hotel. I personally will use this hotel when I need to be near LAX as the shuttle service is good and the restaurant is a plus, but I would not choose this as a \"headquarters\" hotel when visiting the area due to the airport noise.

First they gave me a key that didn't work. Then they gave someone else a key to my room who actually walked in about an hour after I got there with her bags and tried arguing that I should leave- note to self- always use the dead bolt or chain lock. Then my key wouldn't work again. When I brought this all to the attention of the front desk, they could not have cared less. The rep just shrugged his shoulders and gave me a new key. Then a few hours later, more people tried to get into my room with keys given to them by the front desk. At least this time I had used both locks so they didn't actually get in even though their key worked. I called the front desk again. This time they may have taken care of the problem because no other strangers tried to get into my room that night. I travel all the time- literally 2 or 3 weeks out of the month, and I have never had a hotel give strangers the key to my room before.

I requested and recieved a room on a \"quiet floor\" and other than guests allowing the room doors to close (slam) loudly, I was undisturbed. Now there is of course some noise from the adjacent airport... Not much the hotel can do about that, but what they can, they do. Earplugs, a sleep CD, sleep mask and linen spray are thoughtfully provided. I did not need them as the planes were kind of a white noise in the background. Truthfully, I was bothered more by the sounds of the street traffic--which did lessen after 10pm or so. The room was clean and ready early. My check out was extended without issue. Room service was prompt and delicious. There was plenty of lighting in the room and the internet worked great. Oh and the shower was hot and had plenty of pressure (unlike many in So Cal)! Probably the nicest thing was that this was the first time I have stayed on a lower floor where I did not hear ANYONE walking around above me--that was GREAT! There is even a nightlight in the room (though no place to plug it in in the bathroom--which is where I would have liked it). About the only thing I did not like in the room was the heat/air unit which is noisy (like most) and since it was a wall unit, was actually the source of the aforementioned street noise entering the room. One shortcoming is the hotel restaurant... There is really only one and the menu is the same for lunch and dinner. Pricing is just ok and so is the food. I guess if I really wanted to I could have walked to a nearby hotel and checked out there restaurant, bus since I am only here for one day it was no big deal.

Not wanting to make a 50-mile drive on unfamiliary freeways at 6 a.m., I decided to leave a very nice Hilton Garden Inn in Ontario and go to LAX and stay at a nearby hotel the night before my flight. I chose the Crowne Plaza Hotel because I was a member of the IC Hotels Priority Club (which includes Crowne Plaza and the Holiday Inn family). I was very happy that I did. First, when I checked in, they told me that as a Platinum member of the Priority Club, they had an upgraded room available for me. Wow...a feature of a frequent flyer or guest program that really works! Of course, it's based on availability, but it's nice to get a perq without having to ask for it or point it out. The front desk and bell staff were extremely helpful and patient with me, a person who is not accustomed to staying at a full-service hotel. My room was on a \"quiet\" floor on which they try to place flight crews to ensure rest. That floor has an earlier noise curfew than the rest of the hotel. Each guest on that floor will find a gift pack including a complimentary eye mask, ear plugs, and even a relaxation CD! Because of the hotel's proximity to the airport and concern for noise from aircraft taking off or landing, they may offer the same gift pack in rooms on other floors. Although I didn't need the package, it's a considerate touch. The bathroom appeared a little dated, and the hotel can't help it that city water is so laced with chlorine, you'd think that you were in a swimming pool. The bed and bedding were fantastic, and the room itself was very clean and comfortable. The airport is in a mixed neighborhood, so while the \"Hotel Row\" itself is fairly safe, there are some places like a 24-hour US Post Office and a Burger King a few blocks away that you may want to drive to rather than walk. The hotel provides a shuttle to the airport. If you don't feel like driving around to find a meal, there are several great restaurants or snack shops downstairs. If I hadn't had dinner on the way to the hotel, I would have liked to try their handmade pizzas. They also have Krispy Kreme doughnuts. In general, prices seemed very reasonable for food items. Need to work off the calories? They have a good exercise room with several TVs to help take your mind off your exertions. They also have a nice outdoor pool and spa on a balcony a few floors up from ground level. I'm glad I decided to go to Crowne Plaza Hotel for the night before my flight. It's convenient, and it's comfortable. You expect more from a full-service hotel, and they deliver.

I am a Priority Club member (same program as Holiday Inn - free to join), and I received vouchers for 2 complimentary beers, glasses of wine, or starbucks coffees.

There is noise, and some of the worst is between 11pm and midnight when many trans-Pacifics are landing. Some guests have cameras at the ready, and others have stuffed cotton wool in their ears. I checked in at 1am after a late flight from the east coast and had to stand in line. Like the airport, this hotel is gangbusters 24/7. Flight crews are boarded here, and so are many TSA personnel.

I agree with previous reviews that this is not a good location for tourists but if you are on business or in between flights with some time to kill, I think this is a fine hotel to stay at.", "Date": "April 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Canada", "Title": "\u201cI'll never stay at this hotel again!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4824956", "Content": "After a tiring flight from Winnipeg to Los Angeles, I needed to rest for 7 hours before my long haul flight to Malaysia. I went to Travelers Aid at LAX and leafed through their folder for a hotel which had a hot tub because my back was killing me and I really needed to relax before my 16 hour flight to Malaysia. Travelers Aid was very helpful and called several hotels that advertised hot tubs. When Crowne Plaza was contacted, they informed Travelers Aid that their hot tub was working so I checked in with them. The room was okay so I took a nap, had dinner, and then changed to check out the hot tub. That's when I received my rude shock. The so-called working hot tub was cordoned off with yellow warning tape, like a scene from CSI, and when I crawled beneath the tape and dunked my toes into the water, it was freezing cold! I thought perhaps it wasn't turned on so I turned it on. The bubbles came up but the water remained cold while I sat beside the freezing \"hot\" tub for 15 minutes, shivering my butt off! I went upstairs, completely distressed, and complained to the front office, who, instead of apologizing for it, blamed Travelers Aid, who had done absolutely nothing wrong. Later, when I checked out, they wouldn't look me in the eye and were quite rude when I tried to get my valuables out of the safe deposit box. They wouldn't help me when I told them I didn't know how to work the funky box and finally, after shoving around, I managed to get it open.

We had a coffee perculator, hair dryer, tv, telephone, clock radio, iron and ironing board and ice bucket in the room. There is a free ice vending machine on every floor. There is a laundry room on the 15th floor - 2 washers and 2 dryers (1 dollar to wash which takes 30 minutes and 75 cents to dry). There is a lovely restaurant but if you have children and just want a simple meal this would not be the place. There is a mini mart just around the corner if you want to purchase milk, cereals, biscuits etc. We did and put the milk in the ice bucket and had cereal for breakfast. This hotel is definitely for business travellers only. It is the wrong location for tourists. There is a free shuttle bus to Manhatten Beach but apart from that you will either have to take a 40 minute bus trip to get to e.g. Santa Monica or shell out for taxies everywhere. We took the LA City tour (which the consierge arranges on your behalf) and the Universal Tour. These were great but if we had stayed in a hotel in or very near Hollywood, we would probably have had more fun. On the tour, we only had 20 mins at Hollywood (Walk of Fame and Chinese Theatre). I would have loved to go around the shops and stop for something to eat there. To get there from LAX would be 2 bus trips taking about 2 hours or a taxi trip (a lot of money!) The hotel has a well equipped gym and a pool and spa. Great hotel but not for tourists. Strictly for business travellers only. You will see a lot of air pilots and airline crew!! Important tip: Do not take the bus to downtown LA (number 42, if i remember rightly). It takes you to the wrong part and through the suburbs where you see a lot of poverty. We appeared to be the only tourists on the bus and the driver discreetly told us that we were in a bad area and to get back as quickly as possible. There were no taxies to be found (strange!) and when we finally got back we were very relieved. We had been given some dodgy looks on the bus. Go on the Tour!!!

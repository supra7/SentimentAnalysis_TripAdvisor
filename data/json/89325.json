The remodeled rooms are nice, it's always clean, and with the exception if one time out of about 20 nights I spent there I had no trouble sleeping. The front desk staff has always been helpful and accommodating and the breakfast is nice as well. If you need a cheep place to craswh for an evening or stay near Baltimore and don;t want to pay Inner harbor prices, then this is the place. Also, avoid the other two hotels in the vicinity, the Motel 6 and Leisure Inn (I think it used to be a Clarion or Comfort inn) like the plague, they are havens for prostitutes, drug dealers/users and other unsavory characters. That being said, the Days Inn itself doesn't attract that element. Also if you are looking or a bite to eat, there's a lot in the area, they have and Indian place which is attached to the hotel which is really good, also Wendys and Dunkin Doughnuts just down the driveway, across the street there's Citiview (get the crab cakes!), and in the shopping center behind the BP station there's a Subway and another great local eatery, The Salsa Grill.

Frankly, our stay was not enjoyable or even at the lowest of our expectations. I contracted a rash after my first night in my hotel room. I went to the walk in clinic and they confirmed that they were bed bug or mite bites. There simply was not any other reason for this rash that appeared on my body. It had only got worse throughout my stay. We had taken a nap and after I had woken up I noticed that the rash had gotten worse. I went down and told the evening desk attendant who wasn\u2019t wearing a name tag about my concerns. Not once did he apologize. Rather, he insinuated that I had gotten a rash from going out during the day into the city. Even though I was permitted to spend two days here by the staff knowing that I am under 21 (because I have a credit card to guarentee the charges,) the attendant simply said that there will be no compensation because I am under 21 and that I should have come down when I first woke up instead of waiting until later in the afternoon. I told him that I wasn\u2019t sure where this rash had come from but when I woke up from my nap it had gotten considerably worse. I asked for housekeeping to change the sheets or to inspect the bed and he told me that there is no housekeeping on the premises and he \u201cwasn\u2019t going to call someone to come in just to change the sheets.\u201d He changed our room and said nothing else. There were people with carts outside the room at 8 in the morning and you can hear the highway from your room.

Our unit was on the fourth floor with mountain views although excellent view of the beach and sunset was also had! Was traveling with a group of four friends so we wanted extra personal space hence getting such a large condo We each shared a bedroom with another person. My room had a larger than a king bed and the other room had a king bed plus a cot at no extra cost. The layout was excellent with large living area and kitchen and dining room. I was worried that the unit would have dated furnishings but to my suprise was very modern and new looking. We had two washrooms both a nice size. The shower in the master bathroom is not senior friendly. There is quite the step to climb into and out of this raised combo tub shower. Alternatively the second bathroom has a stand alone shower. The lanai was so large we didn't even use the rear section of it! The side section had a dining table with chairs and a few loungers that were well used. Maid service is daily and the place was kept sand less. Very respectful cleaning staff. The grounds of the property are maintained to a very high standard as well. Most of the outdoor facade renovations seem to be complete however there was still some landscaping going on but the work was done at decent times as not to disturb guests too early or too late. Check in was a breeze as was booking on the Aston website. No hidden fees on checkout. Parking is a hot commodity with overflow outdoor parking which could be a hassle. The pool and hot tub were clean although chlorine based. Large decks available as well as towel service and beach activity desk to make reservations. Excellent beach although very wavy while we were there. I loved the waves, my friends stayed near the pool. The black rock near the hotel was fabulous for snorkelling. The Whalers Villiage Shopping centre was convenient as were the restaurants nearby. There is a $1 shuttle from the entrance Of the villiage to the town of Lahaina a few miles away. Very convenient. Taxis are only about $12 to lahaina as well! Would definately recommend this place and would stay again if I return to Maui!", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fresno, California", "Title": "\u201cParadise Maui style!\u201d", "Author": "TravelnJoanna", "ReviewID": "UR125950926", "Content": "We stayed at the Whaler Feb.22, 2012 for 6 nights in unit 1160.

It is great as much for what it isn't, as much as what it is. I rented a studio condo unit from the owner for the second week of December, just before high season. Real value. It was spotless, with a great balcony view. The first night was a treat. Arrived, easy check-in, walked left next door to the outdoor Hula Grill. Dinner at the edge of a lawn, a path, lush bushes, and the ocean right behind. Welcome! It's only 100 yards from Black Rock, so if you like to snorkel, get up at sunrise (when the fish are having breakfast undisturbed and the tourists are snoring). And if you want, you can walk the path along the resorts from the Sheraton to the Hyatt, pop in, check them all out, check out the prices, and flee. The Whaler has a nice, modest pool where people get together during the day. The guests and owners mostly (not all) are adults 50+, very friendly, welcome kids and grand kids, AOK. Very wide, clean, uncrowded beach. Near Lahaina. Lahaina: don't miss the Annabell comedy show--witty, funny, fresh, and with a baffling musical secret. A+. Honest! What I especially liked is the Whaler is human size. It's not a big, fabu, look-at-me, institution. I felt at home. The landscaping is pretty, and adequate. It does not have a lot of facilities or add-ons. Laundry, fitness, plenty of parking underground, soft drinks, yes. Restaurant: no--so what? I wanted to tour and discover, who needs more? My Maui is \"less is more\". I love the air, the ocean, visiting with the sea creatures, the variety, discovery, the flowers. Lodging that is imposing is a distraction and gets in the way. It was just right for me. If you want to get knighted, and pay like a king, you won't be happy here. Nice touches, no pretense. I wanted it on Ka'anapali Beach. The only other condo is the Al'li--nice but much more expensive, and the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel is a hotel. I liked saving money using the full kitchen and the outdoor BBQ, and the coffee for guests at the pool in the morning. Do stay off their internet, though--it's way too expensive. I toured all the hotels on Ka'anapali, north of the Sheraton to Kapalua and the Ritz, Lahaina, Kehei, and the Wailea resorts. I would come back here before the others. I liked it. I'm just a regular guy, with Southern efficiency and Northern charm. The Whaler: nice, lovely site and location, and nice people.

The owner has backpack beach chairs in the room. Easy. The Whaler beach hut is right as you walk out to the beach for umbrella renting. It can be windy so we had a professional put the umbrella in. Tip: Afternoon only umbrella was $10.00. We spent every afternoon on the beach after our Maui activities. Basically, if you don't want to walk far to get beached, this is the hotel for you. Great beach in front of the hotel. Sandy, but beware of the 6th or 7th wave set. Small and then kapow!! You could spend all day just being entertained on the beach .

It is where some boats take people but you can drive there, and walk through a jungle road, and snorkel away. Great fish. Probably only good in the summer. Winter may be too harsh. Liked the Hula Grill next door, the Whaler shopping next door, Starbucks at the Westin a little walk down the boardwalk, coffee at the Kaanapali beach hotel next door (small shop in front of lobby), magic show at Kaanapali (expensive and old fashion magic), always the Napili Shores breakfast-Gazebo, Longhi breakfast in Lahaina, boardgames in the condo were a hit.

I was afraid I was going to get stuck with one of the horrible rooms some people did. However, when we walked into our studio we were very surprised! Our room was nicely upgraded. The only downside was a mold/mildew smell. The beautiful grounds are kept up. The pool and spa are nice. Yes, there is some major construction going on but we weren't bothered by it. Whenever they were doing the construction we weren't in our room anyway. One thing though...if you got a ocean front room you might want to reconsider getting just an ocean view room because there are scaffolds blocking your view. Now for the bad parts...the woman working the concierge is VERY rude!!! No aloha spirit there! My husband went down to the front desk to see if he could get a voucher/receipt printed for a parasailing reservation we made online (you get a discount if you reserve online). However, it would have been $7 (or something crazy) for them to print it. So, the lady at the front desk said that the concierge could help him. My husband explained to her how he wanted to get the online discount and she said she could help him. She called the parasailing place and began making reservations for him. However, when he was told the total he said that it was the same price as just calling and making the reservations...not with the discount. She then very rudely said to the parasailing person, \"Nevermind! He's going to do it himself!\" then HUNG UP on them and then RIPPED UP the peice of paper that she had written down his information on right IN FRONT of him!!!! How incredibly RUDE!!! My husband walked away and then went to the lady at the front desk and told her they need to get a new concierge but the front desk lady seemed to be \"whatever\" about it. The $12 per day parking, the concierge lady, and the lack of caring by the front desk lady in the situation is what is making us consider not staying here the next time we are in Maui. P.S. The front desk guy, Ron, is amazing!!! Very accomadating and full of aloha spirt!

Our expectations have increased along with our ages, and The Whaler met our expectations. It is not a flashy resort with a lot of bling but it is fast (as in service, check-in/out, ease), fun and friendly. The resort is extremely clean and the grounds are beautiful. Everything is well maintained (some of the exterior needs cleaning/painting which was just getting started) and the employees are extremely friendly and helpful. We were assigned a 3rd floor unit on the north side of the north tower. This is probably among the worst locations as the balcony faces the hotel to the north and much of the grounds between units is being used for the construction equipment and materials for the exterior renovation...and the higher floors obviously have better views. Nonetheless, our spacious balcony still afforded a nice ocean view and we loved sitting out in the morning and evening. Our very spacious unit (318- a studio w/kitchenette and 1 bath) has been completely redone and was magnificent: ceramic tile, granite countertops, stainless appliances, inlaid bamboo ceiling, great ceiling lighting fixtures, beautiful modern furnishings, large flat screen TV on wall swivel, beautiful artwork and excellent attention to detail, large walk-in closet with safe, built-in wooden cabinetry for storage, free wireless internet...the list goes on. Apparently some units have not been updated (or maybe to not such a high standard) so it might be worth asking when checking in. This might have been the quietest hotel we have ever been in. Though it was completely filled, once our door was shut there were no noises from anything...real nice. The fitness room (convenient...also in the north tower) is well equipped and mostly empty when I used it. The pool isn't real splashy (except for some of the little kids frolicking)...a standard rectangle, but was fine...as was the accompanying hot tub. Some might not like lack of a bar/grill/snack shop at the pool but that was not an issue for us. And, the Kaanapali beach walk (it goes from one end of the beach to the other...great for walking/jogging/running) goes right by the pool (great people watching) and is just a few steps either direction for food/snacks/libations. What the Whaler lacks...pool slides, waterfalls, \"caves and grottos\", expensive landscape sculptures...ie, Las Vegas glitz...it makes up for in its simplicity and for us made it a great stay. The only real minus wasn't real bad...and seems to be a chronic Maui problem: parking. It's $12 a day at the Whaler and the underground garage and surface lot seem to be perpetually overflowing. One night there were no spaces and so the lot attendant gave us a pass to park in the Whaler Shopping Center lot which is immediately adjacent and worked fine.

The balcony was facing at the construction tennis court and next door property; however, it did not bother us too much since we were mostly outside for activity or at the beach for snorkel. The only thing that was missing in the room was the iron table.... but that was ok since we only used the iron once during our 5 night stay at the Whaler. The staffs were all kind and helpful. We did not use the pool cuz it was always crowded... plus we had rented snorkel gear so we were mostly at the beach. The kitchen had everything we needed so we went to Safeway which is around 6 min away from the property and bought things we needed during the stay. This property is perfect cuz the water is not rough and close to Sheraton and Westin. plus the Whaler village for shopping and free hula show. (it was very cute) The parking is $12/day at the Whaler and there is a towel service outside (but u must bring back the towel otherwise you will be charged for $25 per) We miss Maui (Lahaina) and we would like to go back to the Whaler when opportunity comes in future because we find that this location is close to everything - Old Lahaina Luau, Safeway, the beach etc. FYI: there is the construction on this property at this time pls another construction at the whaler's village parking lot.

Between the three of these great people, we were set up in Unit 670 for very little additional money per night. The unit was beautiful, clean and had an awesome view.

I booked my \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ocean view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room at the Whaler by calling an Aston reservations representative. Based on previous reviews, it appeared that there may be construction projects scheduled for the Whaler. During the booking process, I was reassured by the agent that all construction projects at the Whaler have been completed. Upon my arrival to the Whaler on October 29, 2010, I was immediately greeted with horrible construction noise. At check in, I was given a room in tower one, where most of the construction was going on. The construction noise was unbearable and I kindly asked for a different room. I was then given a room in tower two. I mentioned the construction noise to, Annette, the front desk representative. I also informed Annette that I was advised by Aston staff at the time of booking that there was no planned construction for the Whaler. Annette explained that the construction noise during renovations two years ago was much worse as compared to the noise now, which was no solace to me. The room in tower two was dirty and the furniture was dated. The noise from the construction in tower one was still very bothersome. During my first night at the Whaler, I noticed that the toilet was leaking. I advised the front desk staff of the plumbing problem, however, the maintenance man wanted to see an actual puddle before fixing the leak. It took five days for maintenance to fix the toilet leak. Not once was my room properly cleaned during my stay at the Whaler. My room was plagued with an increasing amount of dust. Housekeeping staff also neglected to change the original tattered blood stained bed sheets. On day five of my trip, I woke up in the morning to find a lizard crawling on the ceiling of my room situated on the twelfth floor of the structure. I called the front desk and security was kind enough to remove the lizard from my room. The Whaler staff found a lizard crawling in my room to be very amusing. At $200 per night, I do not wish to be sharing my accommodations with reptiles. I am from LA and I do not even do camping. While walking down the stairs at the Whaler, I noticed numerous dead cockroaches the size of rats and a chemical smell. Based on the previous review of the Whaler, it appears they were fumigating the property for pests at the time of my visit. None of this information was disclosed by Whaler staff. I do not wish to be exposed to chemicals and other carcinogens during my vacation. If I had known about the fumigation, I would have left the Whaler immediately. The staff at the Whaler expressed no remorse for the condition of their property, the construction noise the reptile infested room or for completely ruining my vacation. Annette appeared especially condescending and unprofessional. My long awaited one week of relaxation on Maui turned out to be a nightmare, due to the Whaler. The Whaler is situated on a nice stretch of Kaanapali Beach and has nice potential.

The property is right on the Kaanapali Beach. This is a nice beach. The Owner Bob is a pleasure to work with for all the arrangements. Bob knows a lot about Maui. The true value of the condo can only be experienced when you are actually there and see the view. Yes, an oceanfront unit would be grand and probably cost \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a few grand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but this unit was second to none. The Whaler is in an excellent location and you can walk to snorkel down the beach 5 minutes at Black rock. If you get the courage you may even cliff dive Blackrock. It may not look high, but try it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.and find out. This studio unit is well equipped with everything a vacation couple needs to enjoy their vacation. The kitchen is stocked with every cooking utensil you can imagine. The appliances are brand new. It has blenders, toasters\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6everything. The bathroom is also well stocked. Plenty of towels and wash rags. We loved the glass doors on the shower but even better yet the soap(s) & conditioner dispensers in the shower. The water pressure is awesome. The unit has a recliner chair to sit back, relax and watch the huge TV screen. It has a DVD & VHS and a connection to the internet all included. The bed is very comfortable. Two more pillows would have been nice. The lanai is excellent. We had breakfast every morning while gazing out over the view. The added screen doors were great. It faces black rock side of the island and is wonderful because you get the early sun and afternoon shade after beach time. The unit also comes with coolers, beach chairs, umbrellas, straw hats, iron & board. It has a library of books. We were too busy to read. The breeze on the 11th floor is excellent and most times A/C was not needed. The check-in staff were wonderful and the lobby area clean. On our last day we found the business office where they allow you to print boarding passes for free. They have an underground parking lot with huge spaces and if fills up then they have additional outside Parking lots. The Whaler also supplies shopping carts to bring groceries upstairs. Our only negative if needed to mention would be that the parking spaces in the other lots are too close together. The garden grounds and ponds are well maintained and the pool was clean with plenty of chairs and cabana shades. The Whaler Village next door is nice for a quick bite or fancy dining, as well as, shopping. Although they have a person in lobby to set up day trips we did not use the service. Lahaina which is 5 minutes away has everything. Shopping, tours, and a Safeway food store to stock up. Sign up for a Safeway card and save lots of money. Excursions tips: Save your money and see the best snorkeling at Black rock for free. The Molokini crater snorkeling was nice, but very rough waters. There were more fish & turtle at black rock. If you do take the tour look for the Pacific Whale Foundation near the ocean center. They give a great trip at $51.00 with breakfast, lunch and all the equipment included. You will also be supporting their efforts to save the environment. The submarine tour is cute but overpriced. The best entertainment we saw was the Annabelle & Warren Comedy/magic show. All we can say is you must see this show. It is like nothing you have seen before and very funny at that. We will tell all our friends and relatives to call Bob Thompson before they look anywhere else. This unit was a home away from home place to stay.

The Whaler is located in the middle of a stretch of beach shared by several hotels. Right next to the Whaler is Whaler's Village, a mall with several restaurants and shops. Its along the west coast of the island, and about a one hour drive from the Kahului airport. I booked a room with one king sized bed on Expedia. The room had a kitchen (pots, pans, cutlery, etc) a spacious bathroom, and a walk in closet with a safe. The kitchen included a full size fridge, stove top, dishwasher, and a coffee machine on the counter. The main part of the room had the king sized bed, flanked on each side by bed side tables, a couch along the wall, opposite of the bed, and a coffee table. Next to the couch was a round glass kitchen table with 4 wicker seats. Mounted to the wall left of the bed was a large flat screen TV, probably about 42 inches or more in size. Beneath the TV was a dresser. To the right of the bed was the lanai. In the hallway was the door that led into the bathroom/walk in closet. The bathroom was separated into two parts. When you walk into the bathroom, you'll have the sink in front of you, along with some additional drawers to the left of the sink. If you turn left, you walk through another door into a walk in closet that has additional space for you clothes and equipment, and a wall mounted safe. Inside the closet was an ironing board and an iron. If you turned right, and walked through another door, you'd find the toilet and a very spacious shower. The shower is tiled, with a mosaic on the wall. The shower had a large round shower head that reminded me of a sunflower. My only problem with the shower was that it took a long time to heat up. The room did come with free high speed internet, but not wireless. The Whaler does having parking underneath the Whaler's Village parking deck, and I think they charged guests of the hotel $12 to park there for the day. They do have a \"business center\" but it consisted of 2 computers and a printer/fax machine. And in order to use the computers you had to swipe your credit card into a machine attached to the computer. There is also a small pool outside in front of the property, facing the beach. A small gym, a spa, and a sauna are located in the basement of one of the buildings. If you have a late flight they'll let you use the showers by the sauna to freshen up before you leave. The front desk also appears to be short staffed. I only ever saw one person working the front desk, no matter how busy it was. One day I saw about 20 people from a family reunion waiting in line as the desk clerk tried to help them all as quickly as he could. The service could have been better, but it wasn't for lack of trying on the part of the employee.

Excellent value for the money, very comfortable and well-appointed, remodeled rooms (see our pics). The Whaler is in between the big resort hotels, so you have all the amenities close by within short walking distance, without all the foot traffic and crowds right in your complex. We stayed in 164 and our friends stayed right next door in 162. Both studios, ground floor, tower 2, north-facing onto the garden area. We could see Black Rock and watch the nightly torch lighting and cliff diving, right from our patios (see pic)! Nice to be able to walk right out from our rooms onto the lawn and directly over to the pool or beach. Negative for 164 is that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right next to main tower entry door, so you see/hear people coming/going, and you can also hear the elevator bell. We acted as unofficial greeters, and really enjoyed getting to chat with folks. If you want more privacy and less noise for the same price, go just next door to 162, same layout and high-quality remodel. If you really have to have a view room and are willing to pay a LOT more, then that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your choice. We found it much more convenient to be on the ground floor and not have to go up/down elevator every time we wanted to go somewhere. Some have also commented here about the parking garage being in need of repair. Only thing we saw was pooled water over by tower 1 parking, no concrete falling from the ceiling. Others on this site have also commented about the age of the Whaler complex. True, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 30 or so years old, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been well kept up. Some areas of the building could stand to be repaired, but nothing dangerous/unsafe. Please note: we are experienced travelers to Maui, and have stayed at numerous condos and hotels in Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali, Kapalua, Kahana, etc. We are also quite picky, and will not stand for low-budget room quality or service. We also want to get our money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth, so we refuse to pay for seriously overpriced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153luxury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotels or condos. For the money, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat the Whaler. Besides being within walking distance of great shopping and restaurants, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only a few minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 drive away from dowtown Lahaina. The staff was FANTASTIC (again, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had some bad experiences at other properties) and they went out of their way to make you feel like you were at home, instead of only on a short vacation. We originally were looking at the El Dorado, as it was about $300 overall cheaper than the Whaler. However, their swimming pool was on top of the garage, and it was a short hike to the beach through the golf course. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a golf enthusiast, the El Dorado would probably be a great choice. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking to have the pool, beach, and shopping convenient, then the Whaler can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beat. Whaler Village, right next door, also has an ABC store for basic sundries and groceries. As many folks have commented here, the Safeway in Lahaina is best for normal groceries, otherwise stock up on bulk items at Costco just outside of Kahului airport. If you want to use the barbeque grills at the Whaler, best use tower 1\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as tower 2\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seemed to be always in use.

A small safe in the closet, there was no charge, however, it said on one of the papers at check in that there was a daily fee when the safe was used. The unit had two beach chairs and a cooler, we used the cooler several times at the beach and on the Road to Hana. The day we arrived there was a fresh cut pineapple in the fridge, very tasty and free. Our one and only complaint was that this unit is right next to the Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village and you smell the kitchen at the Hula Grill restaurant a lot, and a bit of noise, but not bad. This is a garden view unit, but you have a nice view of the ocean from the balcony. We would sit and eat breakfast out there every night. Very quiet and very few people around the property.

The parking is underground and we never had any issues finding a spot right next to the elevator. It was great because when you would exit the parking lot and pull up to the parking lot attendant the lot attendant would smile and give you a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shaka\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign, or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hang loose\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for mainlanders.

I chose the Whaler largely based on TripAdvisor reviews and its location on Kaanapali Beach. An extensive variety of research went into planning our first trip to Hawaii and it was booked a year in advance. We stayed in #708, one back from the ocean on the Black Rock side of the tower. There are 2 Whaler towers. If you stay in an inside unit you will have an ocean view, but you are also facing directly across at all the lanais on the opposite tower. We had a fabulous view, as well as a sense of privacy b/c the Kaanapali Beach Hotel next door is only 4-5 stories high. We enjoyed watching the torches lit nightly on Black Rock and being so close to the ocean. #708 is beautifully decorated and well appointed with all essentials. Listening to the ocean waves in the comfy king bed every night was downright therapeutic. There are 2 full bathrooms -- I loved having my own bathroom. We found this condo on VRBO. The owner was lovely to deal with and very helpful. It is a looong trip from Boston, but we would love to return to #708. Note: units at the Whaler are individually owned, some nicer than others. If you go through the owner you will know better what you're getting. The Whaler has undergone renovations recently. The community areas, lobby, grounds, and pool are quite nice. Big fresh towels are provided by the pool. The Activity Concierge helped us to organize and arrange various trips and tours, all of which turned out well. We enjoyed the long paved beachwalk and the convenience of Whaler Village shops and eateries (especially the fish tacos and hula pie at Leilani's). We had a rental car, handy for going to Lahaina which we did a number of times, to the grocery, exploring the south and north coast beaches and coves.We decided we liked Kaanapali Beach the best.

I was totally overwhelmed by how awesome the Whaler condo was. Sure we didn't have the fancy pool you'd get at a Westin or Hyatt, but when you sat in our condo or on our lanai, it felt like we were surrounded by water on all sides (thanks to mirrored walls). You could hear the surf crashing in every room. I never wanted to leave the condo to go to the beach because it felt like we were already there. (Lucky for me since I was stuck in the condo a lot with my kids nap times.) Great soundproofing inside and outside the condo -- we could barely hear the kids waking up. Decor was a bit 1970s and pots and pan typical rental quality (costco) but we didn't mind a bit because we had the surf pounding in our ears and the sun setting directly outside our windows. My hot tips: Go for an ocean front, not ocean view condo. World of difference to look directly out at the ocean, not at another condo block. Or if that's not available, go for any corner condo (the mountain behind Kaanapali is pretty stunning too, lots of rainbows back that way). The corners have HUGE lanais. Book directly with an owner, and if you are going in low season or at the last minute or for a long stay, try to negotiate a lower price. I thought a 2 bed 2 bath ocean front was way way out of budget, but I contacted the owner through VRBO and she cut the price by 40% since it was last minute and I wanted a 10 night stay. We were on the 3rd floor but any corner condo on any floor would probably be similarly awesome. Don't worry about not having support because you booked with an individual owner not some big company -- we had to call the Whaler maintenance a couple times (small leak, door wouldn't lock) and they always came right away and fixed the problem immediately. If you have young kids and need a crib, shop around the different rental places because their prices vary a lot.

The condo's we've been in have been clean and well-maintained and the staff have been good. The ocean-front corner Lanai's are second to none on Kaanapali. We won't be back though and it's because of the new pool fence. Many will not be bothered by the fence and for them I'd highly recommend The Whaler. For us though the fence completely changed the atmosphere around the pool. We used to be able to lay by the pool and have wonderful views of the beach, Black Rock, nearby islands, people walking by, etc. Those views, where still available, now include a LOT of aluminum. The pool area always felt connected to the beach but is now separated. The Whaler has always been kind of understated but nice in appearance. It now has a decided 'Motel 6' feel to it. It always fit in well with other properties along Kaanapali, but now sticks out like an ugly sore thumb. Whaler mgmt states that they were required by law to install the fence, yet no other property along Kaanapali has such a fence.

We went to the Big Island for 5 days after too. Our last time to the island was 31 years ago. We were first off blown away with the wonderful roads from the airport to Kaanapali. It was clear sailing and took us about 45 minutes. It was such an experiece to drive along this scenic route. I don't think I could ever get tired of it. We saw so many whales along the shore, this time of the year I guess they are very plentiful. We stayed at the Whaler with an ocean view on the 11th floor. It was so beautiful. This condo had just been refurbished. It was #1160, we loved this unit. They had a memory foam on the bed and it was heavenly. I don't know when I've slept so well. I live in Florida so just laying on the beach does not do it for me but I have to say that the waves were quite big and a lot of people were body surfing and it was fun to watch. The beach in that area is very nice and quite large. I wanted to drive around and see some of the sights. We went to Makena beach to check this out and see how it had changed in 31 years.We did the scenic road trip on the west coast to Nakalele. We drove down to where the blow hole is.It's a winding road but not as bad as the road to Hana. We also went to Ioa Valley state park and enjoyed that too. It's something to see and it's free to walk all around. We fell in love with Maui all over again and are hoping once we retire that we will check into buying a place over there to escape the hot, humid summers of steamy Florida. We loved dining at the Plantation restaurant in Napilii. we went there twice. I would suggest dining before sunset so you can really enjoy the view to the ocean. We went later and did not get to enjoy that. We went to Maui Brewing Co and enjoyed some of their home brewed beer. I loved the Blonde bikini beer, they also have a delicious BBQ chicken pizza. We went to Roy's restaurant, We were hoping to get their pre fixe menu but you have to get there early for that. They only offer that for the first hour they are open. We really enjoyed Mama's Fish House for lunch too. It's pricey but what an experience we had. We also ate at Cane and Taro for breakfast once. It was good and not too pricey.

We also had ocean front massages at the 4 Seasons at Wailea and it was awesome. We had only one other night that we could have an off site activity and were torn between a luau and something else.

Walk the expansive beach walk for any type restaurant/bar ..and also less expensive food court in the lower level at the Whalers Village. We enjoyed meals at Leilanis lower level..can't beat the prices, the drinks and being ocean front! Walk to the N. and enjoy the shady lawn and a drink at the Kaanapali's Beach Hotel hotel..or walk to Black Rock.. Pizza at BJ'S Chicago in Old Lahaina was great..more expensive meals were so so!!

In fact, the bellman commented on how we ended up with some of the nicest rooms he has ever seen at the resort. Both had new everything with state of the art televisions and appliances. I stayed in unit 720 and my in-laws were in 814. The bed in 720 was so comfortable, it was tough to get out of bed in the morning! The unit had umbrellas, beach chairs, and snorkeling equipment available. There was also every utensil you could imagine needing in a condo, including an espresso machine. I would definitely rent these units again and highly recommend them to anyone. The pool area is nice and clean. The water is comfortable. In addition to the regular loungers, there are also shaded and padded loungers available for free at the pool-- you just need to be sure to reserve them in advance by putting your name down at the towl counter. I didn't discover this until the day before we left -- I thought you had to pay! There are also shaded loungers and umbrellas available for use at the beach for a fee. The BBQs were a nice convenience. However, watch out that there can be a short wait if you plan to use them around 6 pm. Of course, waiting is no problem because you have some nice people to chat with while you watch the Maui sunset. Not a bad way to spend an evening. The closeness to Whalers Village is a huge asset.

We travel with another couple and have always enjoyed ourselves to the max. In Tower 1 with a view of Black Rock, sitting on the lanai for morning coffee is awesome (or any other time, for that matter!). We love the beachwalk that passes by restaurants and hotels, and usually walk from one end to the other & back, every evening after dinner. The smell of flowers is everywhere, and with a soft breeze, lilting music from the restaurants, tiki torches along the way, and the gentle sound of the ocean, you couldn't find a more pleasant place to take an evening stroll. We highly recommend the Whaler as a place for a low-key, relaxed, island vacation. Having your own condo with kitchen means sparing the expense and hassle of eating every meal out (unless you like that kind of thing.) The only downside was the garage, in that there were some leaks when we were there last time, with some areas cordoned off; OTOH, I believe that's being renovated. On the whole, the property is very well maintained, with attractive garden & pool areas. If you book at the Whaler, go for Tower 1, facing north....the best view....and on a high floor for an unobstructed view of Black Rock. Once you're settled in, you'll want to stock your kitchenette; on the way back from the grocery store (located a short distance away in Lahaina, & elsewhere), find a shopping cart in the Whaler garage (they're parked by the door in) to carry your groceries inside and up to your floor. We also love the close proximity to restaurants, and to Whalers Village (upscale shopping center), right next door.

First of all, I think the Whaler will be a very lovely place to stay once the construction is completed. It is a great location. I met several other owners who were so very kind and saw their units and some of them are very lovely. We plan to return...just not to Unit 805. I am writing this to help other people avoid a disaster on their vacation. I wish I would have had information like this when I booked. We rented through VRBO. I looked at several units and spoke with the owners. We decided on this unit as it was one unit back from the beach overlooking the courtyard and had the view of the island of Lanai on the ocean view side. Our contract arrived with the terms outlined and it had the Whaler Logo on the top of it. There was no mention at all of a parking fee. Three weeks prior to our arrival I was on TripAdvisor and saw an ad for The Whaler offering \"Construction Pricing\". I called the man we rented from and inquired about this and he said, \"They are just sealing some sidewalks on the side of the courtyard.\" I asked if there were any noise issues and he said, \"No. I have one couple who just stayed there and they said that it really was no issue at all.\" All I can say is that upon our arrival we were greeted with a major construction project! There were 3 Bobcats going and 4 concrete saws. The entire courtyard was being completly demolished. The noise level from our balcony (lanai) was deafening. I tried talking with the propery management company to see about getting our room moved to an outside room that did not overlook the courtyard, but they said they would have to charge me since I booked it through the owner. I showed them the contract that had the Whaler logo on it and they said that it was not a valid \"Whaler\" contract. Additionally, we were charged another $15 per day for parking...this was never mentioned in our conversations with the owner and it was not in the contract that we signed with him. I suppose we should have told him we were not going to pay it and made him pay it. I tried contacting him several times but he did not return my calls until the next day. You would think that an owner would call to make sure everything was OK...we are owners of a property and do so for our guests. But not this guy. He was hiding from us. When I finally got him on the phone I confronted him with all of this and he said, \"Yeah...the couple who stayed in it last week (the one he had refernced to me before) said it was pretty noisy and I asked him if I could do anything and he said I could send him some money back.\" The owner lied to me in his earlier version of that conversation. Then he proceeded to tell me that when you are in Hawaii you don't want to sit in your unit anyway...you need to be going out early everyday. The audacity of him to dictate how I should spend my time. My husband and I both work very hard and don't get any down time with our daughter. The notion that we should jump out of bed everyday and be out of the condo by 8 am when all the drilling, hammering, bulldozing and sawing starts was....well....let's just say, an unwelcomed and unsolicited suggestion. Well, it might not have been so bad if the unit itself had been nice. It was filthy and smelled awful. In fact, the management sent someone over to check the airconditioner becuase the smell was so bad. The linens provided were all very old and ripped up. THe pillows were completely covered with yellow stains. I called his cleaning lady and insisted that she bring us new pillows, which she did. The carpet and walls were dirty. The bathrooms were dirty and the wallpaper was coming off the walls. THe showerheads were so corroded that my daughter would not shower in her bathroom at all. Again...I met some of the other owners and they showed me their units and some of them are really lovely. I would not suggest staying here until all the construction is complete. Then it would be a very nice place to stay. The units are very large as are the lanais. And like I said...the other owners I met were lovely. Just be extremely cautious when choosing a unit to rent.

Instead, I was assigned a 4th floor room in Tower II. They were able to change it to a 9th floor room, but still in Tower II. I asked again, and suddenly they were able to give me an 11th Floor room in Tower I - which was what I had requested in the first place! B) The concierge overcharges. I asked about a discount I could have received by booking a snorkel trip on my own and was told they are given the same discount. I found out later I was overcharged $21. Not a huge amount of money, but it was how I was lied to directly to my face about details of the discount. C) I tried cashing a check for $100, rather than paying ATM fees. They need to get verification from a 3rd party service. She tried for 15 minutes, but kept messing up the procedure! I finally grabbed the check from her hand and RAN to catch a bus I was trying to catch. I simply used an ATM later on. The day I was checking out, I asked to see a manager, which brings up another concern... D) It took 15 minutes for the manager to come out. He only came out after I STERNLY requested to the front counter person a 3rd time I wanted to talk to him. The manager appeared to smirk as I mentioned to him the problems mentioned above, and the answer I got really only seemed to be that with the construction, it's been a very trying time at the resort. There's nothing he can do about the concierge as they use an outside service, and as for the staff member that couldn't handle the check cashing procedure - well, he blamed the company they use for cashing checks! The manager never once faulted his staff or representatives on their property for their errors on any issue. Oh, the staff did seem concerned about us on one occasion - checking out! They called TWICE to see when we were planning on checking out! Gee...must be their way of saying \"Aloha\" to their guests!

That site is great. You get pictures and descriptions of places for rent by the owners. When I compared the prices, it was a way better deal through the owners than calling the hotels direct. We ended up choosing a studio, unit 315 at The Whaler Resort on Kaanapali Beach. It was perfect. The place had just been remodeled with top notch everything and the coolest mosaic picture in the shower. They made a huge double size shower that my wife fell in love with. All of their furniture and tile floors and carpet was new and everything was clean. The bed was king size and we slept like babies. We really liked the idea that this complex had full kitchens in all the units since eating out in Maui gets pretty expensive if you have eat out all the time. The kitchen had nice granite counters and new cabinets and appliances. All the pans and eating/cooking utensils were there and we did not need anything extra. We really enjoyed getting steaks at the Costco on our way out of the airport in Kahului and cooking them on the gas grills they have by the pool. We had fun talking with the other people who were visiting and sharing places and things to do there. The balcony, they say lanai, was really nice too. There was a table, higher than normal, and two high style chairs with a chaise lounge. The table height was perfect and we could sit and not have the balcony rails obstruct our view. We spent a lot of time out there for our meals. You could see the pool and ocean/beach and watch the sunsets every night. They have a fish pond and the gardens were very pretty with all kinds of tropical flowers. We visited the gym they downstairs one day to just see it, but did not work out. Who wants to work that hard in Maui? It was decked out for a good workout though. Tennis courts looked nice but we did not play. There was a big flat screen tv on the wall that you could angle in any direction and they had a big selection of movies. There was also a stereo with lots of music cds including some really authentic island type music. They also had a nice feature with the elevators that went right down to the parking garage. The unit was very close to the elevators so we appreciated that. They had grocery carts in the garage to put all your stuff in so single trips were all that was needed. The best part though is the path that goes all the way down Kaanapali beach. There are tons of restaurants and things to see and do. They give surf lessons and parasail rides from the beach. We ate at Hula restaurant and it was very good with live music outside. We went down to the Marriot hotel and had maitais at their really nice pool area. The snorkeling was also a blast. Black Rock at the end of the path was the place to go. We saw sea turtles that did not seem to mind us at all. It got a little crowded at that end with everyone wanting to snorkel in the same area but was still really worth it. The drive over to Hana was interesting and scenic. My wife got a little scared at the skinny roads and it was hard to get past cars coming from the opposite direction. Worth a one-time drive though. Great picture areas on the whole dirve. We ended up going all the way around the island from Hana. It turned into a dirt road but you got to view the really dry, almost eerie side of the volcano. Other than that I could really recommend unit 315 at Whaler Resort. We are already looking for a date to go back. Oh, they also had a really generous and very thoughtful welcome basket for us when we got there. There was a bottle of sparkling apple cider with lots of chocolate covered macadamia nuts, a photo album, cards with stamps and even a mousepad with the view off the balcony on it. We were very impressed. A couple we talked with by the bbq area said they got a pineapple so we felt very special with our basket stuff.

I loved the mini kitchen to prepare my own food, coffee, cocktails and snacks. I enjoyed immensely relaxing on the lanai in the morning with my breakfast, charging up for the day. The grounds were clean and well kept. YES, this is an older building and the grounds and towers could use a face lift, but it was certainly not in terrible shape. I found it to be a very comfortable place to stay. It is an extremely convenient location and I enjoyed being next to the Whaler's Village and adjacent restaurants. I didn't mind the very short drive to Lahaina and other locations on the island. If there is anything to complain about I'd say it is the parking situation. It seems the garage has been under construction for a very long time and we found that to be quite frustrating. There is an adjacent lot that you can gain access to, but it is not nearly as convenient. I found the parking situation to be an irritating inconvenience but by no means is it a deal breaker. Note: If you enjoy snorkeling, I HIGHLY suggest that you take the time to snorkel around black rock.

On this trip we stayed at the Whaler on Ka'anapali Beach. Following are some details and recommendations for staying at this condo. The Whaler complex was built in 1976 and it is definitely showing signs of its age. There are two buildings - Tower I and Tower II. Both are two very basic, concrete rectangular buildings with 12 stories each. There is a basic lawn and garden area in between the two buildings, and a small pool and one spa tub. For your best experience, I highly recommend you get a unit in Tower I facing the interior of the complex (south side of the building). These are units ending in 1-23; e.g., 1123. This side gets the direct sun exposure, with views of the sunrise and sunsets. You'll also be able to look at the pool and shared grounds from your private lanai. The south side of Tower II will also get sun exposure; however, they are overlooking The Whaler Village shopping mall and the back side of several restaurants. These are units ending in 51-73. We stayed in Tower II on the north side, unit 1170. These are units ending in numbers 52-74. We rented our unit directly from the owners. Our unit was tastefully decorated and clean. It had a washer/dryer, free Internet access, and was well-stocked with kitchen supplies and spices, etc. for cooking. As mentioned above, our unit is on the north side, so it never gets any direct sun whatsoever. But it does have beautiful beach, ocean and mountain views. We could also see Black Rock and Molakai island. Overall our unit was very nice. Nevertheless, we spent most of our time on the beach and outdoors. Food is VERY expensive here on the islands. Therefore, if you are staying at least a week, we recommend that you make a stop at Costco in Kahului (very close to the airport). If you don't have a Costco membership there is a Safeway grocery store just a few miles from the Whaler condos. If you want to lounge by the pool, you'll need to get a space reserved before the sun rises. There are only about 45 lounge chairs for the entire complex. Unfortunately, people place their towels and cheap personal property (suntan lotion, magazine, etc.) to keep their chair reserved for the entire day. Be warned that the underground parking garage and main entrance were under construction. These are in between the two towers. Therefore, note that there is construction noise (jack hammers, saws and machinery) from 8:00 - 5:00 weekly if you are staying in units that face the interior of the complex. Confirm with the owner and/or front desk to inquire on the construction schedule and completion date. Overall, this is a nice complex that we'd rate as 2.5-3 stars. It's clean and the staff are friendly. The primary draw-back is the very small pool area. It's entirely too small for a larger complex. However, you can lounge by a pool at any hotel. This is Hawaii, so enjoy the gorgeous sandy beach and truly warm water!", "Date": "January 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cRoom 1265 Tower two The Whaler Kaanapali\u201d", "Author": "Maui_10_07", "ReviewID": "UR11918372", "Content": "It was my husbands and my first trip to Hawaii (both in our twenties). After looking at the hotel prices around Kaanapali we found VRBO. Boy are we glad we did. For the price we got for a 12th floor room on the beach we were skeptical coming in. We walked into the room and were pleasantly surprised. It was perfect for two people. The kitchen was great for breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and lunches \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who wants to be at restaurants their entire vacation? There were plenty of towels to last us the ten days. Most importantly, the bed was comfortable after a long day. And the best part of course were the views off the lanai. To our left were the mountains and daily rainbows, and to our right was the ocean, beach, and the island of Lanai. The only down side were the smells/noises from the Hula grill below\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but again, it was 12 floors down. So it was bearable. And of course the room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t updated and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have all the services hotels have, but we could care less about that. It served the purpose and was fairly clean (some green stuff around the bathtub drain). The elevators came quickly, but even if they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have minded because there was an open air hall and you could look down at the pool and ocean while you waited. The pool was small, but we never found it too crowded to find a chair or take a dip if it was too windy at the beach (sand would sting). The staff that provided towels were also very friendly. The beach was beautiful white sand and swimming was nice as well. It was a little steep getting in, but leveled off after that. You could snorkel right in front of the Whaler or take a three minute walk down the beach to Black Rock to snorkel. I have snorkeled in Bermuda, Aruba, Key West\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.and Black Rock was by far the best we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen, even better then taking the boat trips out into ship wrecks, etc. Bring your gear! Food: Unfortunately about an hour after we arrived at the island we had a bad experience. We went to the grocery store (Safeway) down the road to stock up on breakfast and snacks. At the register we did not have a store card. At home if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a card the clerk has one behind the counter and scans it for you. Well, this clerk must have smelt tourist from a mile away because he refused to scan a card and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even let the woman behind us share hers. He proceeded to crush every item of ours as it went down the belt. Bread, cookies, chips\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6all smashed. We were so shocked we just left with our broken food. Just be warned, some locals are bitter about tourists and will be very rude. Fortunately that was our only bad experience, but b/c it was the first hour we were there it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start the trip off right. Other than grocery\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (expensive, but not as bad as eating out every meal), we went to several restaurants around. The Hula Grill at the Whalers Village was very good. Fish and Poi in Napali was excellent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a little drive up the road but worth it. Cheeseburger in Paradise in Lahaina was also good at night, live music and ocean views of the cruise ships. I would also recommend getting reservations for the Old Lahaina Luau one night. Giovanni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the top of the road was Not good. They had feral cats climbing on the tables -the waiters did nothing about it. They also had awful service and brought us the wrong food as well as the three tables around us. Things to do: We took a day trip to Oahu. Went to Pearl Harbor, hiked Diamond Head crater, and went to Waikiki beach. Fares on Hawaiian Air were reasonable. I would definitely suggest it if you can. A lot of people said go to Kauai as well. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a chance. In Maui, do the road to Hana. Wake up early, because it is a full day if you make all the stops. We went on a Sunday to avoid local traffic and because a lot of people are traveling on Sundays and we had no traffic problems. For a mile marker guide I just used this link: [--] and was happy with what we saw. I would skip the Arboretum ($10pp and can see so many things for free just as beautiful). The red sand beach was tricky, but worth it. Park on the Uakea road, then go through what looks like a schools back yard to find a path. Wainapanapa State Park was also worth a stop. It has a gorgeous black sand beach, blow holes, and lava flow tubes to explore \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also a bathroom stop. One morning when the weather is suppose to be good I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d suggest going to a Sunrise at Haleakala crater. Beautiful views of the island \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bring very warm cloths! It went from 80 degrees at the bottom to 40 at the top(10k feet up). We went to the Maui aquarium for a couple hours. It was ok. Probably better if you have kids? Shopping in Lahaina was also a good time. There were lots of people from all over the world there. Over all we had a great time at the Whaler and in Maui. I hope we make it back there some day!

The balcony (or lanai as it's called in Hawaii) had a nice view of the ocean (not a full on ocean view) but from the table on the balcony you see a large portion of the ocean and part of the island of Molokai.

The room did show it's age in a few areas but not in an icky way. We were very comfortable in the room and felt it was quite spacious. The beach area was plenty big for setting up chairs in the sun, the pool area was small. One warning for families with smaller children, the beach is very steep and the waves crash right at the edge of the water and within a few feet you are in water that's well over 6 ft deep.

The pool was very average. The best part of it was the view-hands down.

The pool is small, but for me, a perfect temperature (some people thought it was too warm to be refreshing, but I loved it) in a perfect location right next to the beach. It could, however, use some \"modernization\". Chaise lounges were reasonably plentiful and the beach hut people were very nice. Be aware there are no drinks or food sold at the pool, but you can bring your own.

The description of the hotel says ocean view rooms but my room, unit 961 only had a partial view of the ocean. So the view wasn't that terrific either. The room had a dish washer; iron with ironing board, stove, refrigerator and a couple of beach chairs that were already in the room that you can take on the beach with you if preferred. That would probably be preferable considering the expense of the rental chairs and cabanas on the beach. The cabanas went as high as $40.00 for the whole day until 5:00. There was also a guest book in the hotel for visitors to sign and write about who they were and why they came to Maui.

Room 770 was dirty looking (Carpet was discolored) and smelled dank and mildewy, as did the entire hall, but less so. It took a day to \"acclimate\" to the smell, and so long as the AC was full blast, it kept it at bay. The smell was characteristic of washing clothes and then forgetting about it in the washer for a day or two. All your clothes smelled of this when you left the room. The next huge problem was the elevator...it was located directly behind the headboard of the bed. All day long and through most of the night it sounded as if a grocery cart was being rolled up and down the wall. I would assume all the rooms on each floor located adjacent to the elevator had this problem, but when I brought it up to the manager she acted as if this were the first time it was ever brought up. This noise and vibration is way too loud to act as if nobody else has ever mentioned it. She acted surprised. We were there for 6 nights and it never relented. The last problem was the mysterious bites we would wake up with. They didnt look like mosquito bites and we didnt have them before we went to sleep. They itch like crazy and look like little dots...not raised like a mosquito. I got mine mostly on my belly and butt...kinda odd to get bit through clothing.

Also, the studio looked out over the hotel next door, and it did have a view of the ocean, but only if you looked sideways off the balcony. The front desk was very accommodating, and gave me the keys to a couple of empty units so I could check them out before I upgraded. We ended up upgrading to a beautiful 1 br/2 bath unit on the 11th floor, that had just be upgraded and had a wonderful view. We did have to pay a little more, but that's only fair. This particular unit was really wonderful, very new and clean. We stayed there a few nights, then had to move to a different unit because the first unit was booked at the end of our stay. The second unit (a 1 br unit overlooking Whaler's Village) was also very nice, but much older than the first unit (but it was also cheaper). A word about placement: The first unit was in tower 1, with a view of Black Rock. This tower and view is much quieter than the unit in tower 2, which overlooked Whaler's village. In the unit overlooking Whaler's village we could smell the cooking from the Hula Grill, and heard music from below (we were on the 11th floor too), sometimes from 3 in the afternoon to 9 at night. For a few nights that was fun as kind of atmospheric (and it was Hawaiian music, so that was great too), but it started to bug me after a while. If you are sensitive to ambient noise, just be aware of this. We tended to keep the doors shut so the condo didn't end up smelling like food. On the other hand, we did have some really nice dinners on the balcony under the full moon, listening to the music below. My little one really enjoyed the pool, which seems quite warm for a condo pool. I've stayed at a few condos in Kaanapali, and this one has the warmest pool I've experienced - the sea was 78 degrees, and the pool was warmer than that. The front desk staff were very accommodating about finding us a condo that we liked. They did everything they did to make us happy. When we moved rooms, the staff moved our bags and all of our food for us, while we went out sightseeing. We didn't really need to do anything (except pack bags). These units are all privately owned, so they are all in a slightly different state of upgrade.

We were in room #219 a one bedroom. We had a partial view of the ocean and great view of the grounds. I am glad we weren't too high off the ground with young kids and it made it a quick trip to the pool and beach. Our room was newly renovated with granite counter tops in the bathroom and kitchen. Stainless steel appliances in the kitchen and all the utencils necessary. There was a double pull out bed in the living room and a twin bed in a secret alcove area in the bathroom with another tv. The kids loved that space. We found the room service to be great. Fresh towels everyday. The pool was a big hit with the kids. We were there daily. It's nothing fancy, but very clean and lots of loungers to chose from. You get a new towel with each visit to the pool as well. The beach is just steps away. Very handy. Loved having the Whaler's Village next door and so many great shops and restaurants to choose from. Lahaina town only a 10 min drive where there is a lot of great shops and more great restaurants.

We were in studio #914 in tower one, which gave us a lovely view of Black Rock and the breathtaking scenery behind the complex as well. This was overlooking the roof of the Kaanapali Beach Hotel but as this is a lower rise building and we were on the 9th floor, was not a problem for us. We had a renovated kitchen and bathroom and everything looked clean and quite new. It had aircon and a really comfy king bed. Another great feature was a superb block out screen which we could operate at the push of a button. We found all the staff to be helpful and friendly. Because we booked through an agency we had a daily housekeeping service and the room safe was included in the rates. The only additional charge we had was $12 per day for parking which we were expecting anyway. As a previous reviewer has stated, under cover parking got a little tight coming back at night but we just parked in the outside car park still on the grounds of the complex. When we booked with Royal Hawaii Condos we requested a high level, renovated unit with good ocean views, so be sure to request this when booking. We were lucky enough to also have views of Black Rock. The Whaler is in a prime location on the beach with an easy access path leading right to Whalers Village shopping center and local restaurants. There is also a BBQ area and nice manicured grounds. I liked the pool area and it was very refreshing to spend some time at the beach and then shower and finish off with a dip in the pool. The surf was too rough for me so the pool was a great alternative. There are a variety of restaurants a couple of minutes walk away. I would recommend going into Lahaina for a better meal though as we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go much on the two restaurants we went to nearby with average meals and small servings which annoyed my husband. Definitely try BJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chicago Pizzeria in Lahaina. The best pizza we have ever had and plenty of it. There is a beautiful golf course behind the hotel strip if you like golf and there are tennis courts at The Whaler you can hire if your passion is tennis. Also if you drive a little further along the main highway instead of taking the left turnoff for the hotel, there is another shopping center. This may offer more options for purchasing food items as Whalers Village, though a nice shopping center, only seemed to have an ABC shop for basic food items. We found the ABC shop sufficient for what we needed though. To sum up we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll definitely be staying at The Whaler again if we can get back to Maui one day.

There were beach chairs, a cooler, binoculars, Bose CD player, books on Hawaii/Maui, fully stocked kitchen (with full sized fridge, dishwasher, blender, etc.), Q-tips, cotton balls, soap, sewing kit, etc., etc. Basically anything we needed was there in the unit. Even though it was a studio, there was plenty of room. It had a king-sized bed, dining table, couch, coffee table and bar stools. There was a table and chair set, as well as a chaise lounge, on the lanai. Which brings me to the best part of the unit--the view! It is on the 10th floor with an amazing view of the ocean as well as the mountains. We saw rainbows every day from the lanai. We also enjoyed the music that would drift up from the Hula Grill below. It was a great view for whale-watching and people-watching since you can see Whaler's Village, the restaurants and the beach all in one glimpse. The property was overall a great place as well. Yes, the pool is rather small, but there always seemed to be plenty of chairs and they would let you move them up to the grassy area overlooking the beach. The exercise room was really nice--two treadmills, three ellipticals, 2 bikes, etc. The staff at reception was very nice, as well as at the pool.

Summary. Excellent room. Excellent location. Helpful staff. Older building, but upkeep appeared to be quite good. Pros. My wife and I spent 5 days in late April at the Whaler. (We made reservations in January through Priceline.) The condition of the room was excellent. We had a studio that overlooked the beach and Black Rock. The studio had a complete kitchen and utensils were included. The refrigerator had two bottles of water and a sliced pineapple waiting for us. The Whaler is a 3 minute walk from Whaler Village. The shopping center has everything from a Louis Vuitton store to Borders Express. The ABC store there is good for groceries and souvenirs. The restaurants we ate at there were very good. The Rusty Harpoon has breakfast we found especially good. The Maui Bus leaves from the east side of the shopping center. The stop is hard to miss because it is next to the skeleton of a large whale. (A whaling museum is also in the shopping center. Admission to the museum is free.) The bus left for Lahaina every hour and cost $1 a person. The bus took about 10 minutes to get the Cannery Wharf Shopping Center, which has a Safeway and Longs Drugstore, and about 10 minutes more to get the wharf center. For snorklers, we found that snorkel rental at The Whaler, at $7 an hour, was cheaper than renting the gear at the Sheraton, $8 an hour. The Sheraton is at Black Rock making it very convenient. Cons. Very few. We didn't find a muffin pan with the kitchen utensils. The pool was a bit small compared to other hotels along the beach. The concierge was usually very busy. We often had to wait a while before being able to talk to her. (Wish the Maui Bus ran back from Lahaina later but The Whaler has no control over that.) Hints. We ended up with $200 of dining gift certificates and a $125 gift certificate at Hilo Hatties, a Hawaiian gifts store, for attending two timeshare presentations. Lahaina has lots of excellent places, including a Ruth Chris, to eat. $200 buys several very nice meals.", "Date": "May 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kelowna BC", "Title": "\u201cStudio 461\u201d", "Author": "oree", "ReviewID": "UR7492381", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Whaler for 8 nights in April. We were in a studio suite which was recently reno'd. The studio met our needs however we would prefer a 1BR next time. The closet space is small for suitcases and then clothing and also to put in used laundry. This studio is supplied with bare necessities only. There are linens and towels to accomodate 3 people however if 3 were there it would not be enough. Only 6 towels and no towel change daily as we booked through Monte Fits Realty. It is private and therefore you do not have access to daily maid service or anything associated with the Whaler or Aston hotels. ie I forgot my hairdryer and that is not supplied in unit and not accessible as we were renting thru private rental agency. There are no plastic mugs or cups to take to pool so bring your own. If you wanted to cook you would have to bring all your own materials as there is nothing in the cupboards. There is not even a coffee filter supplied if you forget to pick any up or bring your own. We have been in many condo rentals and in comparison this one has the very bare minmal in the way of supplies. Most supply coffee filters, foil etc and you replace what you use. Just a thot for the owner. Same with the towels, could use few more if no change is given till 9th night. It is a nice clean unit and the King Murphy bed is comfortable. The restaurants around the area are reasonable and even more so during happy hrs and early dinner specials. The Kaanapali Beach hotel has a breakfast buffet however it is 15.95 and that is costly for fruit and toast/pancakes only. There is a super little restaurant in the Kaanapali Villas north of the Whaler about 10 min walk and it is called the Castaway cafe. It is reasonable and huge portion breaky for less than 10.00. If you want a reasonable breaky to serve yourself then do the BEachwalk cafe in the Marriott Ocean club. It is pretty good for selfserve and free refills of coffee if you use the same cup. There are many little bargains along the beachwalk and you pay for location and view. The location is perfect beside Whaler's village and also in middle of the beachwalk to go either direction. The pool is on the small side and can be busy with families and the upper deck is nice for a quieter space. The grounds are nice and well kept. There is computer access in the business center however it is costly and very slow speed. Mexico has them beat with high speed and cheap internet. It is not at the Whaler which is sad considering this is a new business centre. There are faster computers in other hotels on the strip or even in the little coffee kiosk at the Whaler's village. All in all the weather was awesome during our stay and we certainly enjoyed the location. We would go there again perhaps in larger suite and higher floor for view. there is a safe in the little storage closet and there are books there to read as well. That was handy to exchange with. We did the motorcoach tour by Valley Iles to Hana. It was well worth it. We did it on a Sunday which is a great day with less traffic and our driver was Barry. He was awesome and very informative and we learnt much about the area that we would never have known if we had driven ourselves. There are only 12 people on the bus and it is nice trip. Long day but the time passes quickly as we were kept busy seeing all there is to see there and back. There is lots to do and see if you want to cut into your tanning on the beach. It is worth walking the shops in Lahaina and taking in a dinner from one of the restaurant decks and taking in the sunset. Very pretty. We are looking forward to our next trip.

While we got off to a bumpy start, everything smoothed out quickly and we ended up absolutely loving our 11 day stay there, and we were sorry and not ready to go when it was finally time to leave. We arrived on a Friday afternoon, around 2:30PM. The front desk personnel are very much \"on Hawaii time\" and went about their tasks quite casually. After waiting for our turn, we did the usual paperwork, then were told that checkin time wasn't until 4PM and we could not get our room assignment until then. We were a little disappointed, but we went down to the beach, came back at 4, ad got our keys. Our first room had some problems. The front desk quickly took care of that and assigned us to another room. It too had a minor issue with the door lock and air conditioner (which were very quickly fixed by the efficient maintenance people). However, we were very pleased in every other way with the room: the decor was fresh and friendly, it had been cleaned meticulously, and appeared to be in every way a well-maintained unit. Each of the 2 rooms was equipped with a flat-panel TV, DVD player, and VCR; the kitchen was well-stocked with utensils and so forth. A security safe was available for our valuables. We loved staying in our \"condo by the beach\". The main room had a kitchenette, dining table for 4-5 people, and a sitting area with an L-shaped couch which doubles as a foldout bed. The other bedroom (a hotel-room style \"lockoff\" which was opened up to make it a suite) was nicely furnished with a very comfortable bed, dressers, and its own bathroom -- very nice! The rooms are very well sound-proofed, to the point where TV watching in one room is virtually undiscernable in the adjoining room. The Whaler is in a marvelous location, perhaps the best-situated property on Kaanapali beach. To the south, you have the Whaler Village shopping complex (literally right next door), with 3 fine restaurants, many shops, ice cream, a convenience store, all within a 3 minute walk from the condo towers. Further on are other hotels, including the Westin, Marriott, and Hyatt. To the north, you'll find the Kaanapali Beach Hotel and the Sheraton. This means you have many opportunities for dining and shopping all within strolling distance along the beach \"boardwalk\" as the locals call it (a little sidewalk that runs along the beachfront up and down the strand). This property was delightful to us. We had two other families meet us there, and the eight of us enjoyed many happy days on the beach, going to the luau at the Hyatt, dining at the Hula Grille right next door, or barbequing right there on the Whaler property, on one of the 5 gas grilles all setup with granite countertops and picnic tables! I don't golf but there's plenty of golfing right across the street, again just a quick stroll or jog. There's a full service beauty salon and health spa in the basement of the north tower. The fitness center and sauna are both recently redone, freshly equipped with ample equipment, and appeared well-maintained, clean, and safe.

Located directly on the beach, it has all the amenities one would want for a vacation in paradise. Before booking a condo there, however, find out as much about the specific unit that you can. We stayed in Unit #764, a studio condo suitable for a couple. The Whaler was built in the mid '70's and many of the units have been updated or upgraded, but this one has not. It appears to still have the original stove, although the refrigerator, microwave and dishwasher appear newer. Veneer is coming off the kitchen counter, the cabinets are banged up and the faucet needs replacing. In the bathroom, you will find peeling wallpaper surrounding the original fixtures and filth dropping down from above the tub where the drop ceiling is not completely finished. The unit contains all the appliances you will need, including coffee maker, blender, can opener, all cooking pots, pans and utensils, along with dinner service. The furniture is mainly wicker, giving more of a Hawaiin theme to the room, and well maintained. The Balcony overlooks the grounds in between the buildings of the Whaler and gives a good view of the ocean and part of Black Rock. The biggest problem to guests of any unit is the parking. The Whaler's owner and guest parking is underground, beneath the common grounds between the buildings. Concrete chunks fall from the ceiling on a regular basis, forcing the maintenance crew to construct a lattice work of 2x4's and chicken wire to catch the falling chunks to avoid hitting cars or people walking in the garage. The floor of the garage is always wet, leading one to believe there are either leaks from the koi pond above it or from the ocean (since there are warning signs indicating that high tide will cause additional water.) Overall, we enjoyed the Whaler and its location, and would recommend it, especially if they can make adequate repairs to the parking garage. However, I cannot recommend Unit #764 without the owners renovating it. These units sell for upwards of $1.5MM, so it surprises me that the owners are unwilling to spend $30-50K to have a completely up to date and more attractive unit.

This was our second visit to the Whaler and think it is perfect for a family vacation. We have two young children(4 years & 8 months) and booked a ground floor unit (159) through Maui Beachfront Rentals. What a great location for children. The Lanai opens up to a nice grass area where the kids can play while mom and dad enjoy a Mai Tai. Also the ground floor unit is nice for young families as it provides easy and quick access to the beach/pool. No need to haul umbrellas/coolers/toys etc down the elevator and back up. Unit 159 also has a good ocean view for a ground floor unit and easy access to the great BBQ area. Condos are definately the way to go with children, the extra space compared to a hotel room makes a huge difference.

We booked our trip through American Airlines Vacations. When we arrived at the property I asked the front desk if we could see several units before making a decision as to which unit to stay in. We had booked a 1 bdrm, 2 bath unit and the front desk allowed us to inspect two such units before making a choice. We chose unit 1008 which was on the 10th fioor in tower 1. It had a wonderful ocean view of Black Rock and Molokai. The lanai (balcony) was about 35 ft. long and about 9 ft. wide. There were two entries onto the lanai, one from the bedroom and one from the living room. It provided a great view of the ocean and the ever present sound of the ocean waves cascading against the shoreline was unforgetable. The unit was furnished with rataan furniture, nothing fancy but certainly adequate. There was a kingsize bed in the bdrm and sofasleeper in the living room. Additionally, the Whaler can provide you a rollaway if you need one. The kitchen was nice and comes with all of the dishes, utensils, pots and pans you need in order to make meals during your stay. Both bathrooms were more than adequate. The unit was very clean and well maintained. The only mild complaint about the unit was that the carpet had seen better days,however, it wasn't too bad. There is daily maid service and a free morning paper. The Whaler's manicured grounds had a tropical feel and were well maintained. The pool and jacuzzi area has a lot of charm and is very clean. It has plenty of lounge chairs and clean towels are provided free of charge between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. A few reviews about the Whaler have stated the property is outdated and worn. This is not the case at all in my opinion. While it may have been built 30 years ago, the Whaler has been very well preserved and is in very good condition. It is the equivalent to a 30 yr. old well preserved home. The best part about the Whaler is the beach and the location. The beach is a swimming beach and is one of the very best beaches on Maui. The location is enviable-next to Whaler's Village and many restaurants and resorts on Kaanapali beach. I can't imagine the beach and location being any better than this. Before selecting the Whaler I had considered booking the Mahana, therefore, I could not resist visiting the Mahana to see if I made the right decision. The grounds of the Mahana are very nice, the property appears to be well maintained. I went through the lobby area and out to the pool and beach. The pool area was not nearly as nice as the Whaler's and the beach was pretty much non-existent--no room to walk or lay on the beach in front of the Mahana. While I am sure the Mahana is a very good property, it's beach and location pale in comparison to the Whaler. However, the Mahana is located as about as close to the ocean as you can get so I am sure the view from your condo is spectacular. The Whaler is significantly more expensive than the Mahana so if you can't afford the Whaler I would definitely stay at the Mahana. In closing, we had a terrific experience at the Whaler and would definitely stay there again. Thanks to Trip Advisor, your site was invaluable in helping me select the Whaler and I hope my post is helpful to others who are deciding where to stay on Maui.", "Date": "October 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "longhorn_mike", "ReviewID": "UR5933883", "Content": "This place is actually a condominium complex. Each unit is individually owned, though many are managed by ResortQuest. I initially contacted an owner directly. This particular owner had a minimum stay requirement that I couldn't meet, so he graciously contacted ResortQuest and got me an owner referral discount that was better than the internet rates on the hotel's website. The disadvantage of reserving through ResortQuest is that you cannot choose your room. I preferred a high floor for the view, but ended up on the second floor. Aside from this, there are a number of advantages with reserving through ResortQuest that aren't available or cost more when reserving through individual owners: daily maid service, no registration fee on arrival, updated rooms. The maid service even took care of the dirty dishes we left out from the breakfast we cooked in our kitchen. Our studio oceanview room was good-sized and perfect for a couple. The pool was nice and not too crowded. There is no restaurant or bar on site, but there are some at the nearby hotels. This hotel is right in the middle of Ka'anapali beach, with great snorkling at Black Rock only a 3-minute walk away. Next door is the Whaler Village, which has restaurants, shopping, and a convenient store that we found to be very... well, convenient. A couple of complaints: when we arrived, the studio room they had assigned us was not ready yet. They could have upgraded us to an available room, but instead told us to leave and come back at 4pm. Also I wanted to use the business office briefly one evening and was told that I couldn't because it was closed.

For all the details, keep reading. My wife and I stayed here for a week in September 2006. As numerous others have stated, the facility is ageing and in need of upgrades. The Whaler itself admits this (to its credit) in a handout they give you during check-in which states that the facility is showing its wear and you need to be aware of water problems and the possibility of falling concrete in the underground garage. To be fair, I didn't think the underground garage was in nearly as bad of shape as what I have read in other reviews, or even in the Whaler's own literature. We didn't observe or have a problem with either water or falling concrete. And they do have an outside parking lot although it is not as convenient as the underground garage. Our room was very nicely decorated, practical, and roomy for just the two of us. It had cable tv, free internet, stove, refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, plates, cups, utensils, etc. It did however have a musty odor to it that was noticable upon entering the room. We did sniff tests in various places but couldn't smell anything on any of the furniture or carpet. We assumed that it must be coming from the air conditioner unit and one day left the Lanai doors wide open (without air cond running) which appeared to cure the problem. We could have asked for another room, but frankly after 20 minutes or so we just got used to the odor. Like the garage, the room showed some age but it certainly was not to the point that we felt we weren't getting our moneys worth out of it. The facility itself is rather drab and there is no attempt to spruce up the grounds with a hawaiian atmosphere (tiki lights, etc). In my opinion, it is literally just a place to sleep which is what I thought I wanted when I booked the room. I didn't know what I was missing until I walked through the Sheraton facility on Black Rock which really has an impressive hawaiian atmosphere on the grounds and is just a \"fun\" place to hang around. Of course, there's a price to pay for that kind of atmosphere and the rates at the Sheraton reflect that. The Whaler has no restaurants, cafe's, or other such facilities. Yes, Whaler's Village is just a two minute walk away but we didn't find any of the three restaurants there to our liking. Two of them are extremely expensive, and the Hula Grill had too many flies around to enjoy eating. Of course you can always visit restaurants at other hotels or just go into Lahaina where there are lots of places to eat. The Whaler's pool is a typical rectangular backyard swimming pool. We didn't use the pool because there's a much bigger one (the one we came to see) about 50 feet to the south. I figure pools at resorts in Hawaii are for those who can't swim or are afraid of the ocean for some reason. However, there are other facilities that have long flowing pools throughout their grounds including water-side bars. If you are not going to enjoy the ocean but DO want a pool with atmosphere, the Whaler pool will probably not thrill you. One of the biggest positives for the Whaler is that it is located on one of the best sections of Kaanapali beach. We swam directly opposite the hotel and snorkeled there as well. Only 20 yards or so offshore there is coral with lots of fish. We swam with our masks and fins down to Black Rock and then flittered with the Sea Turtles, needlefish, triggerfish, and every other kind of fish you can think of. VERY VERY convenient if you like the ocean. We found the staff pleasant and friendly. This is a gated facility and the girl at the check point always had a nice smile. The room was cleaned adequately every day between 1pm and 3pm. We received a plump, juicy, delicious pineapple within 30 minutes of checking-in as a welcome from the facility which was a nice touch we weren't expecting. My advice to you is this...look at yourself truthfully and consider what kind of person you are and what kind of facility it is going to take to please you. Then take a look at your wallet and consider the compromises you might have to make. Some of the negative opinions I have read about the Whaler are outragious compared to what I experienced. Yes it is showing some age, but it's not a dilapitated building waiting to crumble into the sea. However, it is a no-frills facility. It is no different than any other high rise apartment building you might find in any large city (except it is in Maui). When we booked the Whaler, we figured that we didn't care about restaurants onsite, we didn't care about the pool because we intended to use the ocean, and we didn't care about the atmosphere because we didn't expect to spend much time at the facility. After all, we're tourists and would be out touring around. I do not regret booking the Whaler. It was functional and convenient. However, knowing what I know now about the other facilities in the area I would spend the extra money and stay someplace else the next time. It's not that the Whaler is a bad place to stay, its just that some of the other facilities are so much nicer. And in fairness let me add finally, there are other facilities in Kaanapali that are a LOT worse than the Whaler.", "Date": "October 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Stevens, Washington", "Title": "\u201cWhaler was Paradise\u201d", "Author": "Amberly", "ReviewID": "UR5932286", "Content": "We stayed at the Whaler in late September for our honeymoon.

We enjoyed the Old Lahaina Laua. The grounds were beautiful and the employees put on a good show. It was fun watching them unearth the roasted pig. This laua was really expensive, and I'm not quite sure it was worth so much money, but it was done to perfection and the family enjoyed the experience.

The Whaler is great for families who want a more low-key time. The condo resort consists of two towers, with a pool and gardens in between. The buildings are probably the closest of the resorts to the ocean. So, regardless of the unit you rent, you will see the surf, unless you stay on the first floor. Plus the beach is the largest in this area. To clear up the confusion - the Whaler is many things. Many units are privately owned with year-round residents living in them. Some privately owned condos are available for rent. These units were top notch oceanfront and oceanview condos and I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend them highly enough (you need to contact owners directly). You will pay more at the Sheraton for a hotel room or family suite than what you will get at the Whaler. Finally, Resort Quest rents out the remaining condos, like a hotel would. I can not vouch for the RQ's condos, but the privately owned ones are in great shape and worth the price as many have been updated and have a personal touch. So, you may not know what you are getting if you go directly through RQ (they operate the front desk, and I suspect that is what you get if you call directly or go through a travel agent), but you can guarantee it will be nice with a private owner, with many listing their condos on private websites that you can find through a simple google search, or looking on websites for condo owners like VacationsFBRO. I also keep a list of people too. Now that that is cleared up (as I saw alot of bad RQ press), the Whaler is in such a great location! Right next to the Whaler Village - which means you never need to get in your car (unless you need to run to Safeway or venture out to Lahaina). Resturants and shops are a quick casual stroll next door. The beach is very beautiful and great for long walks, snorkling, body surfing, and day-dreaming. You can rent cabanas, chairs and umbrellas from a third-party on site, but I recommend heading over to Snorkle Bob's in Lahaina - I believe his rental package included 2 chairs, a cooler and umbrella for $30 for a week. (The cabanas are $35 per day) The pool is quite nice, but I warn all the pool lovers of the world that the Whaler is not a mega-resort with pools the size of Manhattan. Its a regular pool, that you can swim in, or lounge about. Expect no bells and whistles that you might find nearby at the Sheraton, Hyatt or Marriott. Its clean, pretty and kid-friendly. There are plenty of tables and chairs, and several grills which gives you no reason not to enjoy your very own oceanfront dining while there. The grills are cleaned daily. I would love to point out that the two bedroom/two bathroom units are approximately 1400 square feet (quite spacious!) with 500 square feet of a wrap-around lanai (not your ordinary hotel lanai thats for sure!). The kitchens are well stocked, there are chairs and tables and loungers on the lanais, central a/c, washer and dryers in most (otherwise on the floor), etc. etc. Finally, as I saw it mentioned, there is a parking garage underground, and yes, there are some puddles, but I am not sure how that would impact a vacation. When the garage is full (and it will be if you pull in at 9pm at night), there is a lot about 100 yards from Tower I \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is by the tennis courts. It is by no means \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of the way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I guess you would need to stay at the Hyatt to understand out of the way parking lots.

Tours leave the beach right in front of the Whaler and Whaler's village shopping and restaurants are only a few minutes walk. Snorkeling at Black Rock is a 10 minute walk and there is a path running the length of the resorts along the beach. If you like to exercise, get to the walking path about 6:00 am, it's not as crowded yet and it's a perfect temperature. The area felt safe and I did not worry about wandering around the beach and walkway at night. There are lots of people, entertainment outside nightly and security for all the hotels usually visible along the way. We had a great dinner at Leilani's, near the entrance to Whaler's Village. Try their Mango Colada! . Kimos in Lahaina was good too. The only negative thing about our stay at the Whaler was that because the building is older, there were a few construction projects happening. Three just happened to be centered near our room and involved jack hammers. They tried to be sensitve about the scheduling but jackhammers are noisy! Overall you cannot beat this location, the beach is wonderful and fun, lots of activity close by. And after comparing rates with the nearby resorts, The Whaler was a great deal for us.", "Date": "June 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakmont", "Title": "\u201cBest..Dollar for Dollar\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5318513", "Content": "Vacationed there first time May 10-17th.

Something that was new was what we referred to as Pool Patrol. These are people who hand you your pool towels and also rent cabanas and sell sunscreen. One woman in particular was rude and nasty and the only way to appease her was to buy sunscreen from her. It would have been comical had it not been so sad. They literally walked around the pool area on a regular basis ready to reprimand people about trivial things. I didn't have any confrontations with them, but other guests did and it was unnecessary. The pool is open till 10:00 but you have to turn your towels in by 5:30. One day I returned mine at 5:15 and Pool Patrol informed me they had already turned the cards in, meaning that I would have been charged for the towels had I not walked over to the front desk and told them about it.

Eating dinner at the beach side grills costs about $10-$12 a plate vs. $25 a plate in the actual resturant. Use good sun screen as recommended by the snorkle shops.

Upon check in, the receptionist said as it was our Honeymoon did we want an upgrade (we had booked a studio Ocean view room through Bookit.com). Of course we said yes, she said she could one for $20 per night, which we thought was a reasonable deal as we would have a much larger condo. We were happy with this when we walked into our condo as it was lovely !!!! Shame we didn't get any other 'Honeymoon packs' like we believed the Whaler gave to each Honeymoon couple. Our Condo had a dual aspect which we found most pleasant. The interier of the condo was excellantly furnished. There was everything one could possibly need. The kitchen was superb, maybe the bathrooms needed a slight refurb to match the rest of the condo. The position of the Whaler in Kaanapali is very good. Its right on the beach and literally next to the Whalers Village, where you can find shops (most very upmarket !!!), a few restaurants and bars.

There is a free bus that run to various hotels/condo's in Kaanapali or a $1 each way bus that runs to Lahaina town but really you need a car. This is something we would have preferred not to do but it is a must as everything is so spaced out and public transport is not easy to find to everywhere. The beach infront of the Whaler is really very nice, except the Whaler will make you sign a form because of the strong currents of the sea.

Some comments on the general operation- the courtyard door to Tower 2 was broken and wedged open for most of my stay- there didn't seem to be any rush by the staff to get it fixed. Since the beachside walkway opens into the property, in theory anyone could walk into the building and gain entry to the hallways and parking garage through that door. However, I did not perceive any real security problems while there. The staff was very friendly and mostly eager to please- although they don't seem to be staffed quite as heavily as a full time hotel might be - not an issue for me but might be for some. Since each unit is uniquely furnished, you may want to specify that you want a studio with a Murphy bed. My more elegant 1bd2bath unit didn't have screens on the doors- so leaving them open would have been a problem. The north side of Tower 1 (even numbered units) faces the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel property. The south side of Tower 2 (odd numbers) faces Whalers Village. For anyone who is concerned about sound, insist on a unit facing the inner courtyard (odd numbers in Tower 1 or even numbers in Tower 2) or directly on the ocean. Whalers Village also throws up light at night. I saw comments below about the parking - I used the underground garage the entire time without incident. Yes, there were warnings about falling debris, but I didn't see any evidence of it. For anyone who is not familiar with the Ka'anapali area, this property is really well situated for access to dining and shopping and other hotels. You could leave the car in the garage for most of the time and enjoy walking up and down the beachwalk for many of your needs and entertainment. I paid the internet special rate through Resortquest and feel that I got very good value compared to what some of the hotels were charging.", "Date": "October 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Whaler\u201d", "Author": "Novalobster", "ReviewID": "UR4014537", "Content": "We stayed at the Whaler from Sept. 28- Oct 6 and loved it.

We were married in Wailea on the 15th. (See my review for Precious Maui Weddings, first class wedding coordinator!). What can I say. The whole trip was unbelievably perfect. From the time we checked into our room we were surprisingly pleased. We felt at home immediately. Our room was beautiful. When booking the trip I made certain requests and each one was met: high floor, newly-renovated, oceanview. We were on the 11th floor and had perfect views of the ocean, mountains & golf-course. There were champagne, glasses, a pineapple & chocolates waiting in the fridge for us as we were honeymooners. We never had a problem with parking or bugs, the place is extremely clean and well kept. They even had grocery baskets in the garage for our convenience of getting things to the room. That was a very nice touch. We slept with our doors open every night to let the waves and ocean breeze lull us to sleep. It was sheer heaven being able to have breakfasts, lunches & a few dinners on our lanai where we could see everything. (Shop at Safeway with a discount card-takes minutes to get) We awoke every morning at 4:30 because of the time difference (5 hours ahead of us) and I was running on the beach by 5:30 just when the dawn was breaking and before it became crowded with other joggers. The beach was simply lovely and the ocean is crisp and crystal clear. I would spend a whole hour at a time just playing in the water. The walkway to Whaler's Village and other hotels is very convenient. We were right next door to Whaler's Village. One night we had dinner reservations at Swan Court/Spat's so we just took our time and walked along the walkway to the Hyatt. About a 15 min. walk. Renting a car is a must but Maui is very easy to get around. And we didn't encounter bad traffic. For beautiful and elegant dining, we ate at the Seawatch in Wailea (after our wedding ceremony). WONDERFUL food & service. Exqusite decor & a piano that plays itself. We also ate at the Hyatt's Swan Court restaurant (Spat's was serving dinner at the location). The food was pretty good, I think I just made the wrong menu choice, but I had the veal layered with prosciotto & provolone and my husband had the rack of lamb (which he loved). But the exotic ambiance of being seated right on the lake more than made up for my bad menu choice. The waterfall, huge swans, & shimmering lights off the water was breathtaking!! For more casual dining we ate at Bubba Gump's and all the hype was justified. They have tremendous food & cocktails and at Leilani's, their Ono fish tacos were superb. We thoroughly enjoyed the Old Lahaina Luau which was well worth the money: the food, the entertainment, the customer service. All first class. Although my husband missed the acts with fire like at the Hyatt & Sheraton Maui. We enjoyed lots of shopping and the post office was minutes away where we could ship our purchases back home. While it's true that that part of Kaanapali is very touristy with lots of kids, we were able to find quiet spots along the walkway more towards the Hyatt. It was so quiet in one place my husband dozed off into a deep, snoaring sleep. Very peaceful.

We booked The Whaler because of very good recommendations from our travel agent, as well as numerous good reviews on this website, but our experience didn't turn out very well. This was our 5th trip to Maui and we have stayed at a variety of condos and hotels, but we have never checked out early or had an experience like this one! We booked the trip more than 7 months in advance and paid for a 2 bed/ocean front condo. We had 5 in our group, and the accomodations were SOLD to us as 1 king, 2 twins and a sofa sleeper. Our only request was that it be on a higher floor for a better view. We checked in on Wed. July 6 and were told the only 2 bed /ocean front condo was on the 1st floor. We were very disappointed, but after a long day of traveling decided to just settle in. After checking in, we went to park the car. The outside parking is limited, so we had to park in the underground garage. It was then that we discovered the WARNING signs saying that the parking garage is aging and there could be FALLING CONCRETE that could hurt YOU or your car. \"Park at your own risk\". We went to our condo, and the first thing we noticed was a rollaway bed in the living room. It didn't have a sofa sleeper as were the accomodations we had paid for. The next thing we noticed was the view. Being a 2 bed/ ocean FRONT condo the view should be great! Because it was on the first floor, there were shrubs to the top of the patio railing which was over 4 feet tall. So to see the ocean from the front, you had to stand up! That night we learned that the barbecue area for our tower was directly in front of our condo because people were out there enjoying the barbecue until the wee hours of the morning. When we went to bed we found that our king size bed was actually 2 smaller beds pushed together...where you felt like you were going to fall thru the middle. The next morning there was a note on our door that they were fumigating the INSIDE of the condos on Fri. and we would have to be out for several hours. Not only is that inconvenient to HAVE to be out, but we had someone with us with severe allergies and that would be a big problem! We went to the desk several times and the best they could do was move us to a higher floor half way through our stay. I realize this is a very busy time of year and they can't be blamed for being booked up. BUT, the accomodations that we paid A LOT for were not what we got, and the front desk didn't really seem to care. After going back and forth with the travel agency and the tour company we moved to The Hyatt on Fri.( before the fumigation) and enjoyed the rest of our stay on Maui. (The front desk was shocked that we checked out!) Let me add that our condo was VERY clean as were the grounds of the Whaler. I didn't realize The Whaler complex was 30 years old, and the pictures of the condos on The Whaler website must have been updated, as our condo was out of the 1970's and nothing like the pictures.

Parking is an extra $7 a day, but we never had to search around for a parking spot and always got a spot right by the elevator. The room was very clean and well kept. Some reviews complained about bugs, however, I did not find one our entire stay. The hotel gave us a two for one coupon for the luau at the Hyatt, which was great. The Whaler is right next to Whaler's village, which is great! I do not recommend the restaurants there though, as they are wayyyy over priced. It was nice to go out for dinner elsewhere, and we also stocked up on some groceries at Safeway in order to save some money on food. We honestly had no complaints about our stay here! I highly recommend the Whaler for a good deal and great hotel stay.", "Date": "May 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marietta, Ga.

I have been staying at The Whaler for over 20 years and have had NOTHING but great experience there. Although I have stayed in dozens of their units, I can not vouch for the one he was in. I have to think that he must have just gotten a bad apple because all of the units I have stayed in have been BEAUTIFULLY decorated and immaculate(one bedroom 2 bath; one bedroom 1 bath; studio units. I have never stayed in the 2 BR units). This condo is without a doubt the best deal on Kaanapali beach. The units are huge, beautiful and clean. Not to mention the location is ideally situated ocean front right next to Whaler's Village with incredible shopping and restaurants i.e. Hula Grill, Leilani's and Tropica. The staff there are very friendly and there is an onsite concierge and a small grocery/gift shop with liquer, beer, soft drinks, food, etc. This place has been newly renovated on the outside and inside hallways and looks FANTASTIC. For twice the price ($500/night or so)you can go next door to the Westin or Sheraton Black Rock and all you get is a bed, a tiny bathroom and an even smaller lanai. The lanai's at The Whaler are HUGE; big enough to fit 2 lounge chairs and a dinner table with 4 chairs. The 2 bedroom lanai's are just obscene they are so big. They wrap around 2 sides of the building. The studio lanai's are even spacious. I've been traveling to Maui for over 30 years and have been to all the islands. Since I discovered the Whaler, I have not stayed anywhere else on Maui. Kaanapali/Lahaina has it all and The Whaler is a wonderful place to stay. You will not be disappointed.

March 11-18. I have read many reviews of the Whaler and the majority was good. Our experience was terrible. The room that we were given was very outdated. The carpet was white with stains everywhere. The wallpaper was coming off and had hand prints and stains all over. The bathroom was filthy. The bed was rock hard. Inbetween the bed and the nightstand had never ever been vacumed. The floors in the kitchen were dirty and sticky. We complained about the room and they offered to show us a new one but none were available until the next day. The next room that we received had a better view of the ocean and was a little cleaner, but not much. I have read in some of the reviews that you don't go to Hawaii to stay in the room. This is true, but it does help when you have a comfortable, clean place to stay. The weather was cloudy and rainy for 4 of the days we were there and so we ended up in the room.

Suite was excellent. Well appointed, clean, comfortable; everything you need is furnished. Washer/ dryer provided via coin-ops in a laundry room on each floor [not in the unit as I had thought.] I have read reviews recommending you avoid the S. tower rooms facing Whaler's Village. I have mixed feelings about that. Our room faced the courtyard/ N. tower; and while it's true that it was always quiet, and I have no complaints about the view; the drawback was that we never had any sun on our lanai. I cannot speak from experience re. staying on the other side; but I saw that their lanais do get sun exposure. The lanais are so spacious; and loungers are provided, so it would have been nice to do some sunning there if I could have. From the outside looking; it seems that as long as you are above the Whaler's Village rooftops (7th floor+,) those units would be great. I wish that the Whaler staff would enforce the posted policy of not \"saving\" pool loungers (though this is certainly not exclusive to the Whaler; I'm sure we've all experienced this, worldwide.) Every day I saw people put towels down on the best chairs as early as 7AM, then not return for several hours; or one person would save 4-5 chairs for people who never came. The shortage of pool chairs would not be an issue if this practice was stopped; and if everyone would remove their towels when they leave (many people leave their towels on the chairs, so new arrivals assume the chair is still occupied.) Personally I prefer to be on the beach anyway; but the first few days it was just too windy. Fortunately the latter 5 or 6 days were ideal. As others have stated; parking is $7/ day and is very limited, but I do appreciate that they offer a secure, shaded parking facility. I do highly recommend the Whaler if you need to have a fully equipped condo; but unless I find a better deal, next time I visit during peak season I will probably stay elsewhere on Ka'anapali Beach, primarily due to the cost. For our party of 3, none of whom was interested in cooking a lot; the meal savings just did not come close to offseting the room rate. I also rather like the convenience and social aspect of an onsite tiki/ pool bar, and the Whaler lacks this. During my stay, the clientele was primarily seniors and families (not an ideal atmosphere for young-ish singles.) If you are able to plan your vacation 6+ months in advance, you should have better luck finding vacancy through an owner. I did not have that luxury; so despite weeks of exhaustive searching, I finally had to book through Aston and pay an exorbitant rate (almost $400/night.) At checkout I learned that they do offer an Entertainment discount that would have saved $50/ night. (I had checked entertainment and it was not listed. So if you're a member, be sure to ask!) I have stayed at 6 different places on Maui, and have always had a fantastic vacation. The Whaler was very nice; but I will not return unless I find a substantially better rate.", "Date": "March 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHoneymoon In Maui\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3215355", "Content": "We stayed at the Whaler the week of Feb 11-18, 2005. Both of us were extremely pleased with the condo we rented. The furnishings were very nice, and the view was excellent (1 bed/2 bath/ocean view). The Whaler is very well maintained. Parking could be more spacious, but it was never really a problem. Being located directly on Kaanapali beach, and next to the Whaler Village stores, puts you in an excellent position on Maui. There is also a boardwalk that runs the length of Kaanapali from the Sheraton to the Hyatt. If you like to golf, there are two very nice courses across the street from the Whaler (Kaanapali North and South courses). We took a cruise on a 65 foot catamaran to whale watch. This boat (the Gemini), along with other similar catamarans, pulls up directly to the beach for you to board. If you want to do a luau, and I suggest you try one, there are two on Kaanapali (Marriot and Hyatt), one at the Royal Lahaina, and two in Lahaina. Other activities include snorkling, diving, surfing, kayaking, horseback riding, and various island tours.

We were on the 6th floor one room away from being ocean front and the views were amazing.

We did over hear that they will be overhauling the parking garage this year. I have to say that we drove all over the island and checked out various other hotels, the Whaler has the best location and the best beach you simply couldn't ask for more.

Hawaii was wonderful and we had a great time. It was beautiful weather, but the Whaler was pretty dissappointing. I looked and searched for a hotel for months. And I used this website. We got there and no one helped us with our bags. The condo was being remodeled and no where, were there signs of the remodeling. The staff also failed to mention it. We woudln't of been so surprised if we were notified. We parked in the underneath parking which was pretty croweded during our stay. We had to put our luggage in a shopping cart and push it to our room. It was actually pretty funny and made a great picture. As we got upstairs we were greeted with torn out lighting fixtures and cans of paint lying in the hallways. There was dust everywhere from the sanding of the walls. The room was spacious, though we weren't greeted with the pineapple in our fridge. We tried getting a new room to no avail. Two days after our stay we were able to change rooms, that room had the pineapple and was a lot better. The next day as we were going out we found out the jeep we had rented and parked in the Whalers' parking structure was overflowing with water. We left the top of on our jeep and the pipeing had leeked into the jeep. Fortunately, for us the weather was hot enough and we parked the jeep outside the structure and it dried pretty fast. The Whaler is a convienient place to stay at if you want to be by the big resorts and the Whaler Village(a shopping mall) made up of great stores. Its also in close proximity to Lahaina where there are great restaurants and shopping as well. I recommend the trip to HANA! That is made the whole trip worth it! Hana is gorgeous.

We requested for the highest floor possible and was given exactly what we asked for. We have noted that this trip was our honeymoon trip on our reservation and we were surprised with champagne, chocolate, and Hawaii pineapple, free, in our fridge! We saved A LOT of money by having breakfast and cooking some meals in our studio. Our studio was a little bit dated but very clean. The maid had done a great job cleaning it (especially all the dishes we left behind after breakfast/lunch) every day. The Whaler is so close to the beach that we could hear the sound of the wave each night and that was just so relaxing... The only complaint we had was, after paying $7 per day for the parking, we found the parking full one night when we came back around 9-10pm. Luckily, the hotel staff said we could park at the guest parking (there are about 5 right outside of the hotel lobby) and there was 1 left. We are very looking forward to go back to Maui again and will definitely stay in the Whaler for sure. By the way, remember to stop by Walmart and purchase all the water and basic stuff you need. It's quite expensive elsewhere. For food, Safeway is cheaper.

We had plenty of space for the 2 of us, they did offer us an upgrade to a 1 bed/bath for an extra 100/day, but seeing that is more of a hike than their original ticket price, we decided the studio was the perfect fit.

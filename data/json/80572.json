Our original plan was to find a cheap room near the beach with a pool to rent on Sunday so that we could eat without sand in the cooler, have an unshared bathroom and be able to get out of the sun if the little one needed a break/nap. Before we picked the cheapest place to stay we decided to check out a couple places in a guide book we found outside of a gas station that rates the were \"too good to be true.\" After checking out five places, we went back to LaPlaya (which was place #3 that we checked out) and rented the room for Saturday night and asked about late check-out times. They didn't guarantee a late check out time so we were hoping one would be available, if not, we would have rented another night that we would not have stayed for. We ended up with a two bedroom suite on the 9th floor, full kitchen and an oceanviewing balcony that slept 7 comfortably for around a hundred dollars. The pool was clean, the room was a little \"stale\" due to it being a smoking room and the elevators are slow. We knew that the indoor pool and hot tubs were not working, so that was no suprise. The tiki bar and music was nice and going almost the entire time we were there, which was from 1:30 pm on Saturday until we checked out on Sunday night at 6:00 pm. It did rain on Sunday very hard for at least an hour and a half and I believe the music and bar shut down then. It was still pouring down rain when we left, so I don't know if they started up again or not. I would go back. I only saw two bugs the entire time we were there. Staff isn't the friendliest, however, they aren't rude either, just very professional. There were a few leaks in the roof/ceiling that we had to walk around on our way checking out, but not in our room, that we noticed. Walls must have been pretty thick because our neighbors partied until 1 in the morning. I know this because I could hear them very well while I was on the balcony but not while I was inside the room. My husband and I slept on the murphy bed and I slept very good. The doors were a little hard to open and close. If you think the Hampton Inn is a decent place, then this is not the hotel for you. If you think that Motel 6 is a good value, then you should try this place out.", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scott Depot, West Virginia", "Title": "\u201cHad a Great time\u201d", "Author": "Joy Ann C", "ReviewID": "UR137508737", "Content": "We have had a great time every year that we have stayed at this resort.

My name is Tina. I grew up in Daytona Beach. First I cannot believe all the bad reviews. If you come to Daytona beach just to sit in your room and watch tv, then you should book at the Hilton.

Willie at the front desk is accommodating me with a room on the 1st floor that goes directly to the pool and beach. I explained if I had to walk all around and get on an elevator to get to the pool and beach, it would be to much on me. I stayed last year and was very satisfied. Like I said, the tv is old, the decor is old, but there are no bugs and if there is one, remember, this is Daytona. It's hot and muggy and the palmetto bugs love that weather. Just hit it with your flip flop and go on with your day. I won't stay anywhere else.

We then went to Bokerz Comedy Club for the show, we laughed till we had tears coming down our face. Drinks were not overly priced for a show and as was the entrance fee to the show GREAT NIGHT! Saturday we enjoyed the breakfast buffet, we found the service to be good as well as the meal. Since the weather was turning nasty we went shopping across the street to Bealls and the outlet, found some great buys! As we went back to the hotel after dinner we watched the waves roll in as well as the clouds and people running in from the storm.

(1) This is an oceanfront resort! You are not at a five star hotel in France. The bedroom is large and the living area big enough for a family of four. When I travel for work I stay in five star hotels and I enjoy them very much. But when I am on vacation at the shore I stay at a typical oceanfront resort which is what LaPlaya is. There are bugs if you leave your door open you will get bugs in your room. This is Florida. Roaches are plentiful and although I did not see any I am sure that they are around. I kept my garbage in the freezer and made sure I cleaned up any food or drinks, this is Florida! The ocean is literally steps away and it is beautiful. The pool is right on the ocean and the chairs are plentiful and the water is clean. The staff is outstanding and ready to help. They go above and beyond. Yes they charge $5.00 a day to park your car but they can do that because of their low rates. The hotel is directly across from the Belair Shopping Plaza with a Bells, Walgreens, Publix, doggie supermarket, dots, payless, bowling area and Ruby Tuesdays.

Once we checked in it was fine. The rooms are out dated but you get what u pay for. If u want a five star resort then I would suggest u pay the extra money and book with a five star resort. The rooms were clean and the ocean front rooms had a beautiful view. We had a full size fridge a small stove and microwave. The beds were a little small I believe they were full size but it worked. The pool was great! They have a smaller pool for children and the best part is the tiki bar that has a DJ that plays music by the pool and you can order drinks and food poolside. There's also a publixs right across the street which is nice we walked over and bought a few groceries... We had a great time and would go back again.

We got in to town early, I called and one of my 2 rooms was ready for early check in. The hotel was very easy to find and had good access from either North or Southbound A1A. Across the street is a grocery store anchored strip mall. The check in process was quick and painless with no unexpected surprises, they took my number and called me when my second room was ready which was still before standard check in time. There is a parking fee of $5 per vehicle per day, we had 2 trucks and 4 motorcycles, they only charged for the trucks. There is a 2 story parking ramp, and even during this busy week we had no trouble finding a place to park. Facility: There was a single elevator near the lobby and 2 more at the back of the hotel on the way to the pool area, they all functioned as expected. In the mirrored hallway between the lobby and the rear elevators is a breakfast restaurant which we patronized several days, it was cheap and tasty and had good service. Out the back of the hotel you\u2019ll pass a couple vending machines on your left, then out to the pool deck. Pool deck had a Tiki Bar with too loud dj music all day, good drinks, good service, and what seemed to be randomly selected prices, a blended margarita was between $5 and $8 depending on the day of he week, bartender, and phase of the moon. Also on the pool deck is an ankle deep kiddie pool, and regular rectangular pool, entry through a broken gate to the beach beyond, and a shower area to hose off after visiting aforementioned beach. If you look real hard you can also find an indoor pool and hot tub, I verified the hot tub worked, but never used it. On the 10th floor (rear elevators only) there is also some type of penthouse bar, it was never open when I wanted it, my friends did use it, I believe they said they had some booze there. Room: We entered room 824 from an outside corridor that faces the 2 story parking ramp. Enter through the door which had a deadbolt and a chain lock. To the right was a door with a long mirror on it, I assume it went to an adjoining room. To the left was a bathroom alcove, Toilet and shower behind a closed door from the sink and closet. There was a hairdryer, iron, ironing board, and a safe, we only used the hairdryer and I assume it worked fine since my wife never complained about it. Past the bathroom alcove to the main body of the room. Clockwise from my immediate left- Kitchenette with Microwave, counter height ice cold fridge, full size coffee pot (Hint: we bought coffee, filters, and coffee fixins across the street), ice bucket and plastic cups, single medium to small sink, a few drawers, and a few upper cabinets. In the cabinets we found service for 4, real plates, coffee cups, and silverware, I don\u2019t recall if they had bowls. Continuing around the room, a table with 2 cushioned chairs, an armoire with three drawers and a standard definition 20ish inch tv, the far wall was all glass, covered in light blocking curtains and had the AC/Heat unit, the sliding door on this wall had seen better days and often went off track during operation. Out on the balcony, look left for a1a facing North, straight ahead to another hotel\u2019s pool area, look right for a just slightly obstructed view of the ocean. There are two plastic chairs and a plastic table out here as well. Back in the room a single drawer night stand separated the two full size beds, they were comfortable enough with standard bedding and several pillows. The room also had free wifi with an accept the terms push page. It worked with my Ipad, but my phone couldn't get connected. Overall opinion: Overall the hotel served its purpose, but it really does need some maintenance in almost every area. The beachfront location is excellent, the service and all the staff were good to great, it really is too bad that the building is in such rough shape. It was totally worth the severely discounted rate that I paid, but I would be upset with the quality if I had paid full price.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clermont, Florida, United States", "Title": "\u201cWould NEVER stay here again!

I cannot believe that some reviewers actually said this was a nice hotel, I AM SHOCKED!! Where have they stayed and I could only imagine...well nevermind.. On our stay we left right after our Thanksgiving turkey dinner to head to Daytona for their annual Turkey Run which is a classic car show & we stayed at this hotel. I was hesitant after learning that this was the hotel we were booked in because I knew about this hotel from way back when I was 17 and stayed here on spring break (I'm 41 now). I remembered what we did to the room and that it was a complete party hotel and I mean that to its fullest extent and thought boy I hope they've made improvements along the way. I went online to look at the hotel and also read the reviews on this site. Some were great and others were horrible but after calling the hotel I was told they have completely renovated the hotel and we had the best room in the house. We were on the 7th floor in a suite equipt with a kitchen, murphy bed, and seperate bedroom. The second we walked in the hallway and onto the elevator I knew nothing had changed. The floors were cracked and you could tell the original paint was there but hiden by grime. The elvator floor made me check the last inspection date the second I entered. When we got to our floor at midnight I saw the old Jolousy windows and the musty heavy drapes and knew I was in trouble. The floor was completely covered in stains that you could tell they repeatedly tried to remove but its was past cleaning by about 20 years, the toilet paper roll was rusted and almost falling off, the lock on the door had so many screws it in most of which werent doing anything for the lock they were just too lazy to take them out as new locks were installed. The dishes in the kitchen were filthy... I could go on and on.. Its was the most disgusting hotel I have ever every stayed in. Since everything was booked for turkey run we had no choice but to stay. Thank god we brought pillows and blankets for our kids on the car ride up as I would have never put my head or body on that bed. I wore socks constantly and flip flops and checked for bed bugs. I laid the comfortor which was gross over the floor so at least I could think it was somewhat cleaner.. The balcony had rebar sticking out and just seemed unsafe to even be on. Yes the staff was nice but that doesnt make for a clean safe hotel...are you kidding.

Today the weather was sunny, fluffy white clouds, the birds were even singing. In our room I saw no roaches, we had plenty hot water, the ac did not leak, worked fine, did not look old. The was no odor in the room. Sure in a few places the carpet showed some wear. One spot on the ceiling, and a small spot on the bathroom wall needed some TLC.

The rest of our time was spent in the indoor and outdoor pool, and on the beach. We traveled to the Mall and checked out the speedway. Daytona has a beautiful library with a large play room that the kids enjoyed.

It was also packed down there but again to my surprise was another cheerful employee Kara. In my opinion she is the best bartender and makes a awesome Long Island.

I'm unfortunately, very disatisfied with La Playa Resort and with Bookit.com, and this is because they misrepresent the quality of the La Playa Resort in Daytona Beach, FL. I have been ripped off and lied to by Bookit.com and by La Playa Resort. They are not a professional service basically ruined my vacation with my kids. La Playa Resort is listed and misrepresented by them and by Bookit.com as a 3.5 Star resort. And they know very well that this property does not qualify even for 2 Stars. The property is dilapidated, broken, small, unsafe and plain ugly. It would never even come close to a 2 star category. How can they even think that it would qualify as such and misrepresent it to customers. Here are just some of the problems we found: broken door jams; peeling paint off the walls inside the rooms and throughout the property; dirty and stained floors in the public areas; broken fixtures; clogged toilet; slow drain in bathroom sink; smelly blankets and sheets; stained and old bed covers; broken door locks; clumpy paint job - painted over old paint over and over again; dirty stained lounge and pool chairs; broken vandalized vending machines; broken window glass; and much more. This hotel is a disgrace and they should never be advertising it as a 3.5 Star, it would never, never qualify even close to that. Through this experience I have been cheated and lied to by your Bookit.com and by La Playa Resort and I doubt that I will ever trust their services again. My kids and my vacation experience was truly ruined by trusting Bookit.com and La Playa resort with our vacation plans.

I was cheated by both Bookit.com and by La Playa resort/hotel.", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lynnwood, Washington", "Title": "\u201cStay away no matter how good of a deal it looks like!\u201d", "Author": "Omonyja", "ReviewID": "UR106237322", "Content": "This hotel was a result of a 'Name your price' offer on priceline and as a consequence of this experience, I will never be naming my price again. Sometimes, it's just not worth the money saved. Arriving in the room, it looked old and unmaintained. The rug had so much wear and tear and it looked liked like the carpet was many years old. The kitchenette was ok, and the beds were not terrible. The balcony gave a decent view of the garbage. Water from the airconditioners above was dripping onto the balcony as well. Arriving back to the hotel at about 1am, we were greeted by an entire family of roaches in the bathroom. This was the final straw. So at 1am, even though I had only been there for a few hours and I knew I couldn't get a refund for the 3 days I paid for, I checked out and found another hotel. Trust me, this is the worst hotel in world... or at least, the worst in Daytona...

Never mind the fact that I just paid to stay at the hotel, now my car does also? Checked out the indoor pool, so much chlorine that it cleared our sinuses and bleached our clothes just standing there. Walls have cracks in them, there are chucks of the building missing, oh wait, there's a \"tiki bar\" out by the pool. It's nice taking a 13, 7, and 5 year old to a pool where they here \"make sure you strap one on\" coming from the speakers, and the DJ saying \"Ya wanna see what happens when you have too much to drink at the beach? These girls are about to show us!\" Wood is warped and rotten and needs paint. 4:30p, still no room. Sit in the car, drive down the road, 5pm, still no room. Finally get our room, after the first one on the second floor opened right to the tiki bar. Placed on the 7th floor. Had to shoulder tackle the front door to get it open, looks to me like the whole door is coming off its hinges. Appliances are 20 years old, room smells musty, fridge is dirty....a knock on the door. Maintenance man, here to fix your tub. What? Housekeeping said the handle was off the bath nozzle. 5 minutes later, it's still leaking, have to put a new rubber insert in, be back in 30 minutes to 1 hour. Next day, still broken. Great view of the tiki bar, supposed to close at 11pm, music still playing at 2am, on top of neighboring room doors slamming and hearing what was happening down the hall. Let's not forget the dead bugs clinging to the ceiling. Paint peeling from the balcony railing. Oh yeah, the balcony door won't shut unless you slam it. Need ice, there are ice machines on the 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th floors...never mind the fact that none of them work...and you don't know until you've taken the elevator all the way to the top. Paid for parking, came back to hotel and one spot left. I wonder what happened to the guest that arrived after us that had no place to park.

LISTEN TO REVIEWS!!!\u201d", "Author": "brynn272002", "ReviewID": "UR102631984", "Content": "I decided to not listen to reviews and give it a whirl...worst mistake of my life. We stayed for four days and not because we wanted to but because everyday we tried to get out of it but there was never anyone working that was supposedly authorized to give our money back. Every day they told us to come back in the morning because their supervisor would be there to complain to but every morning nobody could do anything. Finally the last day they told us they couldn't do anything because we waited till the last day to say anything. I have never been so angry. The hallway to the lobby smelt like rotten garbage and the the ceiling was leaking so bad and all they were doing to help the mess was to lay down mattress pads to sop it it. Our first day there, i stepped on one nail out of about 20 that were visible from a tack strip not covered going into the bathroom. The floor was so stained and dirty I would not let my children take their shoes off. The ceiling was falling apart all over our beds, luggage, and floor every time we opened the stained dirty shades. The appliances were all rusted out and still dirty. There was blacks hairs on the plates in the cupboards. The fridge was leaking water so every time we opened it water spilled out. When we pulled the bedspreads off (i always bring my own) the sheets were still dirty from the previous guest. After we complained the first day, they switched us to the room next door. It was better but the floor was still gross and stained, those sheets as well were dirty (i could tell because there were no fold marks in the sheets from being folded, just all wrinkled from being slept in) When they brought clean folded sheets, they still stunk ( they should smell like bleach). Our keys for this room never worked, maintenance was having to let us into our room after several trips to the front desks. People partying till 4am blowing their blow horns right outside our door and even after complaining from midnight til 3am, security did nothing. the covered parking deck leaked so much water we thought it was going to cave in. People constantly dealing and doing drugs in the parking garage. Walked into the laundry room with my 8yr old to find a couple in there having sex. Her pimp clearing watching guard because he told us we couldn't go in there but i did any way because my clothes were in the dryer. Told front desk and security where they were and they did nothing. The housekeeper never once while we were there cleaned our bathroom, or did any cleaning for that matter. My daughter had an accident so i stripped the bed down for the housekeeper and when we came back to our room, we noticed she had put the same soiled bedding back down. That was the last straw, tried to get our money back to get out of there and they told us in the morning they could help us out. But in the morning they told us they couldn't do anything because we waited til our last morning. We went next door to the Grand seas which was amazing. Their three pools were clean and not all rusted out, their four hot tubs were working and the rooms and bedding were clean. The staff was nice and helpful and clean. DON'T STAY THERE!! I would wait in line in the lobby for an hour listening to other guests' complaints just to be able to voice mine which they clearly could have cared less about. It is disgusting and the health department should shut it down. Trashy trashy and I still feel gross even after being 1500 miles away from it. There is no going back after staying there.

Very quiet, nice room, massive bed, a sofa, desk, tv, fridge, microwave etc etc.. The staff were pleasnt and helpful and the hotel was only a short bus ride to disney. We had quite a few ants in our hotel room about a week into our stay, and since wed never been abroad before we didnt realise this happens alot and we complained about it. we were told that there were no other rooms available so they gave us a free upgrade to a suite which included a living room and kitchen which was great! the first suite we moved into had a real ant problem all over the kitchen so again we complained and the guy on reception gave us keys to all the empty suites and let us have a look round and choose the one we wanted. The shuttle bus to Disney was very handy as we didnt have a car but getting to universal was a bit of a problem. the shuttle bus advised us that a hotel up the road did a bus to universal and to jump on there so that wasnt a problem :) the nearest shop and restaurants were about 30mins away so a car is really advisable! The breakfast wasnt great, plenty of choice but quality was pretty poor im my opinion.. the pools were alright, a little bit dirty though. the brouchure i read said there was a games room but when i asked on the recpetion they said there wasnt a games room. i actually found the games room and realised why they lied and said there wasnt one.. it was pretty shocking! All in all we had a fantastic holiday and thought the palms was definatly value for money... we had 3 weeks accommodation and flights for \u00a3600 each :)", "Date": "June 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "michigan", "Title": "\u201cdecent\u201d", "Author": "herecomesleatherman", "ReviewID": "UR27809336", "Content": "it was a good hotel, quiet, clean.

We actually switched to this hotel shortly before our trip thanks to reading the horrible reviews of our first hotel on tripadvisor(that was when I first discovered tripadvisor, I use it for every hotel I stay in now). We had a great time on the trip and the hotel served it's purpose pretty well. It is very close to Disney and an easy drive. We drove to Disney, the shuttle service was at odd times. I would plan on driving to Disney if you stay here. You get a free breakfast that was passable. It's not great food but not terrible either, it saves you some money. The pool was nice, if sometimes crowded. The room was a nice size but in need of some updating.

It kinda sucked !!! First off, the check-in is in a different hotel. So you gotta take all your luggae to the other hotel first. Then the rooms are not that great. The breakfast pretty much sucked. They alternate between eggs and biscuit. Everything else is the same everyday. Its eggs and biscuit every alternate day !!!! The Disney shuttle is a joke. Comes only 3 times and takes you only to one park. And picks you up from only one of the Disney parks at weird times. So the last shuttle pickup could be at 9 pm. when the park is open till 11 pm. So if you want to stay at the park, you'll have to take a taxi back. The breakfast was horrible and shuttle timings are very inconvenient. You can definitely get better hotels for the same price. This hotel is located at the end of a long driveway. So if you don't have a car or don't want to take a taxi, forget about going anywhere !!!! The staff is not friendly.

We read all the reviews here and were a little apprehensive after reading some of the horror stories, but we didn't find any major problems. We knew what to expect, such as checking in at another building and how there was a resort fee. We found the place easy to find and nicely located. It was quiet, peaceful and the grounds were really nice and well-kept. Check-in was a breeze, the room was ready and we looked at each other as if to say: \"What's the big deal?\" We visit Disney a lot seeing as we live in Florida, and we've stayed in some pretty bad places, including Disney property, so this was just fine and suited our needs. Breakfast was great...so what if there were a lot of carbs, you're just going to walk it off in the parks. So what if it was crowded, you could go back to your room and eat. Okay, so the coffee wasn't great, but hey, you're not at Dunkin Donuts. There was plenty of hot water, the bathroom was extremely clean, the room itself was clean and roomy enough for two people. We have a few negative things, but you'll find that anywhere. The walls were too thin and the air conditioner took awhile to cool down, but it was mid-July and over 100 degrees out, so that may have had something to do with it. Also, the pillows were lumpy and the bed was hard , but it didn't affect our sleep too much. We would recommend this place if you're looking for a room that's comfortable, reasonable and close to the parks. You're really not in the room that much, so it's more like a place to crash at night.

As far as the proximity to the park, it was very close to all disney parks. We had no problems with this hotel. I knew from the beginning that we had to pay an additional 7.95 resort fee, so that didn't bother me. The one thing I thought was a little bothersome were the speed bumps on the driveway to the hotel. Overall, this hotel was very clean, modern, and close to parks and restaurants.

The worst part was when the water was shut off for an entire day and no one seemed to think that it would be an inconvenience to the guests.

The Hotel is at the end of a long parkway with nothing around it, so it's quite a walk to find something to eat and the only place that delivers to the hotel is Dominos. There is no place to get a drink at the hotel and the vending machines in our building were out of order.

Breakfast isn't great at all! We had a group of tennagers staying there at the same time and as every all teens they are disturbing and used to make a mess during the breakfast. The staff at the front desk almost never gave us a smile and at check-in she barely spoke to us! On the other side the room maintenance staff was very good and always give a smile and hello.

Like some of the other reviewers, we were prepared for the speedbumps, resort fee, and checked-in at the other building. All went off without a hitch. Here is our review in terms of pros and cons. Pros: - Hotel is at the end of a quiet residental street off of Hwy 192. - Rooms are modern, spacious and very clean. - Amenities in the room: hairdryer, coffee and tea making facilities, free internet access and an in-bed lap desk. - Very close to all Disney parks and many restaurants. - Self-laundry facilities in the hotel. - Called for extra pillows/blankets and received them within 5 minutes. - Including the resort fee, we paid about $60 per night for 4 adults. Cons: - The aforementioned laundry fees were very expensive at about $6 per load for soap, wash and dry. - The included breakfast contained no variety and was heavy on the carbs (muffins, stale bagels, pastries, cereal, toaster waffles, pancakes, instant oatmeal, biscuits). The fruit salad was from a jar/can and the eggs were inedible. This may not be a problem if your stay is short, but after a few days, we decided to eat out. - A fair amount of dust on the artificial plant in the room. Stay at this hotel if you're looking for good value for your money.

This was our first visit and I was NOTvery impressed at first. The location was questionable as was the entrance. We had to go down a few steps as we entered with our luggage. We then had to proceed to a set of elevators and go to the 3rd floor to reach the lobby!! After that we had to take another set of elevators to our room. When we did reach our room, it was beautiful, clean and bright. Our multiple walks, and I do mean multiple walks to downtown Boston were nice. There were plenty of stores, restaurants and patrols. That's where I found out the reasoning behind the ENTRANCE. The building itself is over 30 years old, so it was originally designed to keep the RIFF-RAFF out. It still does, because there is a doorman and also someone in the downstairs lobby, not to menton the numerous people on the 3rd floor before you get to the second set of elevators. It actually sounds more confusing than it is. We visited the hotel bar, where we met Peter and William. They were great!! They were our highlight of the hotel, and they didn't even know it. I would definately stay here again. All the staff were great. A special thank you to Peter and William !!!! Last but not least, our room service was precise on their timing, the room was perfect and quiet....the halls were quiet....and everything was clean, clean, clean!

Which means you take your luggage into an an elevator, go up two flights, then have to take a second elevator to your room. It's ridiculous and minor league. 2. Wear headphones - stuff your ears with cotton balls - then put on background music because you will hear EVERYTHING - every word uttered - by people in adjoining rooms. The people next to us had their alarm clocks go off one morning and I could have sworn I set ours by mistake. 3. You get NOTHING extra: Coffee is charged to your bill if you just want to get a cup in the morning. 3. Cost of breakfast: Highway robbery - $22 for the buffet? You can't be serious! I have never heard of such a price. Go up the street and eat anywhere but here. I will say the beds are comfortable - but what good is that when you hear the people in the adjoining rooms. 4. Now for the health room/pool: A \"luxury\" hotel with no whirlpool? If you want to walk a half mile to the sauna or pool, you traipse through a long hallway of guest rooms, go down steps, and eventually find the pool in the middle of nowhere. Again, ridiculous.

The hotel is a very good value. The rooms are generally very comfortable, always very clean and the service is good. The room service is prompt and reliable. Occasionally the front desk gets a little overrun with checkins but, nothing you wont expect from time to time in a hotel of this type. Health club and pool are among the best in Boston. Restaurant serves a great breakfast. When the hotel was built (As a Swissotel) it was part of a shopping mall complex. Escalators and elevators took you to a third floor lobby to check in. I supposed the idea was to separate the lobby from all the foot traffic in the mall. In a very short time, the mall folded and was remodelled into offices. However, the hotel was left with a third floor lobby that is now accessed by elevator. It is a minor annoyance. Maybe its less annoying if you know the history. I am always a little surprised by the number of tourists i see staying here becasue the location is not all that attractive. The immediate nieghborhood is a little down at the heels and grundgier than most of the other areas in or near downtown . While Boston isnt huge, visitors will have a bit of a hike to most of Boston's attractions like the waterfront, Fanuel Hall and Back Bay shopping.

As a Diamond member, I recieved an email the week prior to my arrival asking if I had any special requests, needed dinner reservations, etc. This must be unique to the Hyatt Boston, as it had never occurred before; but is a very nice welcoming touch. My niece and nephew had never been to a big city hotel, so I requested an upper floor with a city view and a welcome snack on their arrival. The hotel took care of everything, checked everyone in while saving the official check-in for me, gave everyone rooms on the same floor but separated and brought the kids a big plate of cookies and milk. I found the rooms very clean and average size for a city hotel and the bed was very comfortable. The dinner suggestions were very nice the first night, although the second night the concierge suggested a gastro-pub type of place. I should have known better...it wasn't really the place for kids, although was a lively and noisy place so good for active kids. The breakfast buffet is very nice, with plenty of options and tastes for everyone. The made to order station has many options.

I stayed here for a number of weeks and I have very few complaints about the hotel itself. Positives: The rooms are spacious, nicely decorated with a nice bathroom. The location of the hotel is perfect if you are working in the financial district. However, this area empties out at 6pm and can be dead at weekends. It is however, only a few minutes walk from Boston Common, Beacon Hill and the theatre district (or street). It is located very close to the Downtown metro stop and a couple of minutes walking distance from the South Station (Boston's main train station). There is a basic keep-fit gym in the hotel (some free-weights, treadmills and machines) with a nice pool and steam room. There are some negatives. Overall, the hotel lobby and corridors appear a little stale and worn. The restaurant and bar is very average and inferior to the other hotels of the area (like the Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton), but the staff were friendly and the service was great overall. I am always frustrated with the priced-wifi situation in hotels, however I can understand the economics of it and mine was in fact free due to the time I spent there. The fact that you need to get 2 elevators to your room is a little annoying, but thats the way it is. In Summary, good but dated business hotel, in a district that empties out after 6pm.

Check-in was very quick - you have to take an elevator to get to the lobby if you're coming from outside or from the parking lot, which is an interesting design. We were put on the 18th floor - a previous recommendation to get a higher floor for less noise is definitely worthwhile. The room itself was pretty typical. King-size bed, flat screen TV, desk, chair with leg rest. The washroom was okay - the shower has this ledge that goes along the inside which is great for putting all of our shampoo and soap from home. We could quite clearly hear conversations between people in the hallways that were passing through - there were a few signs in the room asking guests to be quiet after 9pm. They must have had noise issues in the past. Bed was very comfortable and had tons of pillows. Check-out was quick but the elevator area to get to the parking lot/main exit got a little congested.

There might have been cheaper open lots nearby, but that might take you some running around to find, and if there's a saturday event nearby at the theaters, just give up and pay.

The on-street parking opens up significantly sunday. We didn't eat there but I'm sure it's at least OK. There are so many good choices to eat at every price point, I'd look elsewhere.

All were within an easy walking distance, ranging from a minute or two to the T to just over 15 minutes to North Beach. I have to agree with some reviewers that our room on the 8th floor, while comfortable, was lacking in some areas. The bathroom had the most obvious deficiencies: both the wallpaper and the wood panel below the sink were worn and chipped. The toilet paper holder looked unnecessarily cheap and was installed crooked. The bathtub had marks near the drain that made the tub look unclean. Upon rubbing, however, I discovered the marks were really chips in the surface or some other permanent defect. Finally, the bottom sheet on my bed did not cover the entire foot of the bed. I woke up one night to discover my feet extended beyond the end of the sheet and onto whatever lay underneath! It's hard to understand how anyone could think this was an acceptable way to make a bed. As of Sept. 2011, there was wireless internet for the common $9.95 daily fee, contrary to other travelers' comments. We found the information in our room's Hyatt binder was outdated. There was an insert in our key sleeve informing us of the wireless option. The two elevators (one from street/garage to lobby and another from lobby to rooms)are an inconvenience, and we never got used to it.

The hotel was in an excellent location for us as we toured Boston for the first time, being situated in the midst of shopping, steps from the subway and at the edge of the Common. While the Regency overall was good and clean, the housekeeping was spotty. Dirty glasses left behind, sheets not renewed when requested and other small things that don't measure up to the standard of a hotel like this. All the staff we interacted with were lovely and helpful. The room mini bar can't hold anything you might want to keep cold - you have to ask for an additional refrigerator. There are no vending machines, only a Gift Shop in the lobby where a bottle of water and a soda will set you back $7.50. You get a sense of being nickeled and dimed here. It's a good thing there are options within walking distance such as a cute little coffee shop, a Dunkin Donuts and a wine store. So, with a little planning and forethought you can avoid senseless costs. I believe that staying at a nice hotel should offer many of the things this hotel does, but what would make me come back would be if the details were more tangible. I would have much rather had the convenience of getting a soda steps from my room, than TWO doormen greeting me each day as I left or returned.

The doorways were so small, a wheelchair could not fit in the room (I had visiting friends that needed access, and I didn't feel comfortable taking up a \"handicap room\"). The toiletries were nice, but housekeeping didn't bother to replinish them each day (even though they were empty). Actually, housekeeping didn't bother to do much cleaning at all. We had to call down and actually ask them to come clean the room 2 days into the trip. The food at the buffet breakfast was mediocre, but the service was good. The omlette bar and pancake bar were nice, because at least the food was hot and fresh (unlike the lukewarm bacon sitting in its own grease for several hours), but the choices for omlettes was limited (e.g. no spinach). Also the fresh fruit was no very good, considering the season (but that might be the Californian in me not realizing that the East coast has bad fruit...) The atmosphere in the diningroom was very nice, so that made the breakfast a plesant enough experience. The pool was decent for a city hotel. It was warm enough, without being too warm. It had a door that opened up to a roof-top patio, which was a nice place for the kids to get outside and run around. But, to get to the pool you had to follow a long maze involving a lot of stairs. I never did locate elevator access (thereby making it handicap inaccessible). Overall, I wasn't impressed with this hotel. My friends (who stayed there because of me) were VERY unimpressed. It seems that the only redeeming quality I found (decent service) was not present in there experience.

The hotel is a pretty short walk from South Station, Boston's major transit station, and had an enjoyable walk over. We were checked in by a Ms Maggie, who was professional and did her job well enough, but it was a series of motions rather than an engaging conversation. The rooms are nicely decorated and we had a pretty view of the city; we had a two bed room. Everything was flawless; the housekeeping staff had paid a lot of attention of detail. We went downstairs to the Concierge Desk, and were greeted by a Mr Mike, a Mr Stephan, and a Ms Susan. Each were friendly and extremely knowledgable. We had some pretty non-standard questions about the city and bars, but they were able to help us set everything up. A+ to all three individuals. They were also able to give us information for the tours we wanted to take, the places we wanted to go, and gave us suggestions for further exploring. As we headed out, Mr Steven, the bellman, was extraordinarily friendly and offered to help us find where to go and how to get there. He even remembered us later in the night when we checked back in -- they were doing a simple check for keys, which made us feel a lot safer --and he not only remembered us but remembered a joke we had made with him. Kudos to that fine gentleman. We also had a chance to dine in the restuarant. For breakfast, which was an excellent buffet, Mr Andjul helped us and was extremely friendly and an excellent host. A better server could not be asked for, save for Ms Alyson, who served us at dinner. Both made enjoyable small talk, recognized us when we came back, answered our questions, and couldn't have been nicer. Dinner was spectacular, and I couldn't more gladly recommend the creme brulee. Overall, we were blown away. The service was exceptional and memorable - hence why I can name names and give examples. The room was beautiful, the location excellent (it was only about 1/2 hour walk to anywhere we wanted to go) and the food fantastic.

I was here for a conference the last week in June, and didn't have a say on where to stay, and was concerned about the reviews I read, but was hoping it was better than others thought. The most negative of the reviews were right on!! The first night, the a/c in the room was non-existent, and the room would not cool off. We called several times, and they told us to radically lower the thermostat, which had no real effect. We then asked to have a fan sent up, which they did after some time. We then asked the next night to have a different room, which was somewhat better, but we luckily kept the fan, or it wouldn't have been usable. The minibar in both rooms was set up so that you couldn't use it to store other cold items without being charged $25.00; even Red Roof Inn have usable mini refrigerators in their rooms! The problems continued - the conference I attended ran out of coffee after 1/2 hour, and the hotel, claiming to take care of this, did nothing until the 2nd day, at which time they still provided inadequate coffee. The hotel staff, other than one young man, were surly and ineffectual. To top things off, in the new room my wife opened the nightstand and found that someone had left a sexual device there! I couldn't make this stuff up! The cleaning staff obviously didn't do their job. We returned the sexual device to the front desk, and didn't receive any formal apology about this. Then after the second night, the comforter that was on the bed was taken, and when the room was made up, the comforter was never returned! 7 phone calls later, on the 4th day we were there, they finally brought a comforter, but it was a full size (the bed was a King), and it was wet! We returned that. For our hassles, the hotel did provide us a free dinner, but the restaurant had horrible service on the terrace, and the young waitstaff acted as though they had never waited on any customer before. I should also mention that the rooms were small. The pool was not handicap accessible, there were two staircases of 10 stairs each leading down to it, in a very inaccessible spot. There were no soda or snack machines anywhere on any floor. They charged 50 cents a minute for computer access in their \"business\" center. Once people found that out, they didn't use it, and it was empty, although the hotel employed a person to sit there and provide service (mostly fielding angry comments about the cost). They charged $ per day for wireless internet access, which is incredibly cheap. On check out, there were hassles with the hotel charging me several Massachusetts taxes, even though I had documentation that because it was a Federally Funded Conference I should not be charged state lodging taxes. Other people at the convention I attended had the same problem.

Policy is your name has to be on the reservation, ok fine I get that- but no need to be rude about it. The front desk girl literally threw her hands up in the air saying nothing she can do. Wow. I was also corrected when I asked where the \"rooftop bar is\" It is NOT a rooftop- it is a TERRACE ok.... 2. The hotel layout is confusing. You walk in and must go down about 8 steps with all your luggage (hard for a petite woman by herself) and nobody was there to assist. Then you go to one elevator to the lobby then to other guest elevators to get to your room. 3. The area isn't bad by the hotel, but it is not great either. I went for a walk and was turned off by the gobs of odd characters on the couple streets right next to hotel. Don't be fooled by the Mac and Macys next door - there is also this weird circus music playing which makes it feel more like a freak show. 4. This bothered me the most. All I wanted was a bottled water. We moved from a different hotel (just for change of scenery) called the Omni and they brough bottled room to your room everyday FOR FREE. Not the Hyatt. They don't have a vending machine either so your forced to buy their mini bar water for about 4 bucks each. Fine. We did but it make me SO mad. What happened to vending machines?! 5. I guess hotels are doing away with business centers since they charge people for wi-fi. The business center had 2 computers you need to pay to use. All in all I would not stay here ever again. I see much nicer areas very close by and it would be worth it to pay a little more. 6 At check in the girl asked why I blocked off a certain room.

To avoid dealing with additional charges, we selected \"Balance\" package that (according to Hyatt's website) included breakfast, valet parking for hybrid car, 2 reusable bottles and tot bag. When we arrived at the hotel, the front desk discovered that there is a massage session added to our package which they \"have never seen in their lives\". I guessed that it might've been because it is our anniversary but they had no idea and it was just for one person. We did receive an upgrade to a suite from a corner room - it was a great gesture by the front desk person but massage has never materialized as it had to be booked in advance with an outside party... The room was very nice and spacious with a good city views. Bedding is comfortable, bathroom amenities and towels of a standard Hyatt quality. Internet is $10 per day - even for Hyatt Gold program members. Buffet breakfast in the hotel - nothing extraordinary but good selection and good quality. Wait staff at breakfast - excellent! Dining at the only hotel restaurant was much better than expected. More on the gourmet side then your regular hotel restaurant dishes. Service in the restaurant - probably the best service in the whole hotel - very good! Health center: sauna did not work in the women's room, pool was overcrowded and had cold water, steam room - zero visibility (my husband slipped and cut his knee), no personnel at the pool or health center at all... Back to the \"mystery massage package\" - I ended up calling front desk who asked me how they can make up for the massage that never happened and offered a bottle of wine or champagne with a cheese platter. I selected the wine and an hour later they brought a bottle of wine with some fruits (not cheeses) and asked for a signature and asked (yes) for tips (suggesting to change a big bill we had). At check-out time - $60 charge appeared on our bill for room service - they did take it off when I related the whole story about \"massage\" to them, but the fact itself does not play in the hotel management favor. And we never got the reusable bottles and a tot bag that was originally included in the hotel package - they told us that \"each location is different and we don't have any bottles for you\"... Overall, the hotel staff seemed a bit clueless and unsure of how to serve customers. The location of the hotel is closer to Chinatown and Financial District. It is a walkable distance to the most attractions.

Public areas were nice although a bit tired looking. Business center was way too expensive for internet access and printing, which was not a surprise but still annoying.

Plenty of space and everything was very clean and well-kept. I do agree with some other reviewers that housekeeping was a bit inconsistent. One day they restocked the amenities and included different toiletry items, folded the towels over - the next day only toothpaste was replaced, not the lotion or soap, and towels were not folded. Again, just a small thing but I think consistency would be good to maintain the brand since this is a fairly expensive hotel and part of what you pay for is service and knowing what to expect. The room service operator was very professional and my food arrived 20 minutes earlier than expected, which was great. Food was tasty, although very small portions.

Message to Management \" get a grip of this hotel standards\" Take a trip to Europe and see how a Hyatt should be run and then send your staff, particularly \"front desk\" for a visit to Cologne,Dusseldorf,Hamburg, Mainz and Berlin all of which would put this hotel to shame.

From the street, you have to go down a set of stairs to a small lobby and then take an elevator back up to check in. 2. Later in the evening, they don't let you access the hotel elevators unless you are a guest. Some Hyatt's accomplish this by requiring that you put your room key into a slot in the elevator. Here, they had an employee standing outside the elevator banks asking to see your room key. He was very pleasant and polite, but it continuously made me wonder whether they had a security problem. 3. The small conference room facilities are on the first floor as well and are adequate although not necessarily nice. The catered lunch included with the conference was quite tasty though. 4. Modern flat screen tvs in the room were appreciated as I could hook up my own dvd player. 5. Yes, wireless is not free, but that's standard for all Hyatt Regency hotels, not just this one. 6.

Boy was I glad I saved that letter. The staff at this hotel simply don't know what they offer. One of the days we went to breakfast. I had to argue with the hostess that I was 100% positive that one breakfast was indeed included on my room rate. And upon checkout I was told that long distance calls were not covered. I pulled out the letter to show the desk clerk that indeed they were covered. She quickly changed it and said that they had just changed what the business plan offered.

I don't want to have to go to the front desk to check out and get a corrected bill. I would rather have checked out online in my room.

The Hyatt is of a monstrous size, feels worn and hollow. The room was a little shabby with chipping paint in places and banged up furniture. Our heating was not working when we first arrived (a cold January night), the window was leaking whatever little heat was in the room. Someone came to fix it shortly after we called down. Once it was fixed he asked us not to touch the controls. The vent kept turning on and off all night, making a lot of noise. Our king bed was very high up and had a feather bed on top of the mattress, which made it too soft. I felt like I was floating all night. The pillows on the other hand were too hard. The location was ok, but too far to walk to Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market area, where parking is once again outrageously expensive. The last time I was in Boston I stayed at the Omni, closer to the market and North End where there are tons of great restaurants and shopping.

I could not have customized a better location if I was given the opportunity.

The hotel is also located steps away from downtown crossing, a major shopping area in the city, and a 10ish minute walk to the waterfront/quincy market area. I would say this hotel is a 3.75, though the staff would get 5 stars, Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. The hallways are really bright, as is the color scheme of the rooms. Our room was on the 18th floor with views of the Common and State House. The room was immaculate and the beds were super comfortable. There was an LG flatscreen TV..I would guess 37-40 inches?? The bathrooms are a good size, pretty decor and the closets are large too. There was a well stocked fridge with snacks/soda/beer/nips etc....though the price was a little high for all the items. We didnt touch it, but did go to the lobby gift shop for drinks, which were less expensive than in the room. We went to the pool, which was a good size(rectangle). The fitness center had plenty of equipment (though to get to both was a small workout..down a long hallway and couple flights of stairs) We ate dinner at Avenue One. The food was delicous, the wait staff was superb. In addition to the regular menu, there is a childrens buffet filled with chicken tenders, burgers, mac and cheese, veggies, apple sauce etc....fantastic idea for those with children as children tend to be picky eaters. I read comments before going about the layout of this hotel. I didnt find anything to be unusual, except possibly the pool area, but I was just happy to have a pool area! I also read comments about the smell in the common areas. I did notice this (a clean smell) and actually spent more time than I should have trying to figure out what scent it was! Valet parking was a breeze and they do also have the option of self parking. All in all, our \"1st Night\" out was wonderful. I will definately be back at the Hyatt Regency in the future. If your planning a trip there, do not go by the wesite directions. Use a GPS or mapquest. Also, if you plan to dine there, dont use \"Open Table\" on the website.

The location is really great - its a 15 minute walk to Copley Square, a 15 minute walk to the North End, and a 2 minute walk to Boston Common and the Public Gardens. Keep in mind that there is a ton of stuff to see during your 15 minutes of walking. I ate in the restaurant on 2 occasions, once having a steak and cheese sandwich which was one of the best I've ever eaten, and one having the clam chowder, which was delicious. The food was pricey, but very, very good.

I needed a hotel I could stay in long term, so I stayed in a few different hotels until I found one that could make me feel comfortable, like home. This hotel had the worst service of all the Boston hotels I tried in that time period. The day I arrived, my companion and I were tired, so we decided to have a little bit to eat and some drinks in their restaurant, I can't remember the name, but it's the one by the lobby. The service was miserably sad. The hostess, who was holding menus, asked if we were here for dinner. I said yes. She told us to seat ourselves and never gave us menus. I thought she might follow behind us with menus, but they never came until we requested them. The service was incredibly slow even though the restaurant was mostly empty. It took us 20 minutes just to get water and we only received it after we asked for it. The drinks took nearly 30 minutes to arrive. I watched two people hold our meals and look around at tables for at least 10 minutes. They put the meals down, walked away, walked back, looked at tables, looked at the computer. I tried to make eye contact, and indicate that they were looking for my table, but it was useless. The food eventually made it to my table cold. I knew we couldn't expect to keep drinking at this place, and we were too tired to find someplace else on a Friday night, so I decided to go to the room, and invite a few friends over for drinks. I thought just one friend was coming, so I ordered 2 bottles of cava and 3 glasses. My friend called, and said she would bring her boyfriend, so I called room service back to see if I could add an additional glass to my order. I was told that it had not left yet, so the extra glass would be added. About 15 minutes later, my cava arrived with only 3 glasses. The person who brought it said that she would be right back because she forgot a wine bottle opener. I told her we don't need a wine bottle opener for cava, but that we had ordered 1 extra glass. She told me she would bring it right up. My friends arrived and started drinking. Over 20 minutes later, I still had no fourth glass. I called room service, who told me it would be there right away. 15 minutes later, I still had no glass. I called guest services, who told me they would send me a glass. 15 minutes later, there was no glass. I called the night manager, who told me they would send a glass. 15 minutes later, after an entire bottle was finished, a man knocked on my door, shoved a glass into my hand so quickly that I almost didn't catch it, and took off without a smile or even a glance in my direction. I called the night manager to say that it had arrived, but that I was entirely disappointed with the service this evening. The manager said that there was nothing she could do, but that she would have someone call me and apologize the next day. I never received any sort of apology for this horrible evening. The next morning, I had forgotten to put the privacy sign on the door, so when housekeeping came around and knocked, it was no surprise. We were already up and getting ready for brunch, so it was not an inconvenience. My companion answered the door and said that we were not quite ready to leave. The housekeeper rolled her eyes, and asked when we would be gone. I was shocked. It wasn't like we were staying over check out time, I had two more nights here. I started to wonder if we had been blacklisted for complaining the night before. After this, I decided to limit my use of the hotel services as much as possible. I ordered breakfast the next morning. It arrived, and I was setting it up, when the server returned to my room because he had given me a plate that belonged to another hotel guest. So I suppose he just exchanged the plates because my eggs were returned to me cold and overcooked. I just ate them because I came to realize that a request to correct a problem is of no use here. The next morning, I stuck to a continental breakfast, which arrived on time and warranted no complaints. As for other issues, I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they are worth commenting on after all the service concerns, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll mention them quickly. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was pleasant. The bedding was comfortable, but I found the pillows to be too tough. The comforter was shedding feathers, but they were very soft feathers. The restaurant menu was unappealing. In general, the food is named by the method of cooking and the protein. I would normally have cared that I was eating at a place with a menu that you might find at a truck stop, but I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even care about that with the service issues. If I had even had mediocre service, or if management had made any effort to correct this horrible experience, I would have given them a higher rating, and I would have felt like I could recommend them to others. However, it was horrible to be committed to staying in this hotel, and I will never put myself in that situation again, and I certainly would never advise a friend to be stuck there.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "CT", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!\u201d", "Author": "jasejase", "ReviewID": "UR80280235", "Content": "After securing this room on priceline, i was a bit nervous after reading some of the TA reviews! However, we had NO problems at the Hyatt! First of all, there is an elevator that takes you from the street level to the lobby. Then another elevator that takes you up to the rooms. Some people were complaining about this feature, but this is becoming more and more common in larger hotels. It also adds an element of security to your stay. One evening as we were walking from the main elevator to the guest elevator, a stationed Hyatt employee stopped us, and asked to see our room card before boarding the guest elevator. A comforting touch nonetheless. Check in was a breeze. Got the room we requested, and everything was smooth. Julia at the desk was extremely nice and courteous. When we got up to the room (10th floor), the room halls were very cool. Its interesting how they designed it. Blocks of 4 or 5 floors are kind of exposed.. you can look up once you get off the elevator and see the other floors (or down). it has a eurpoean/bavarian forest type of feel in a way! it was kind cool, and unexpected. The room was very clean. The bed was VERY soft. the LCD tv was brand new. the view was even decent. we self parked ourselves... (i believe this was $32 for the single weekend day/night we stayed for). From what i read on the website, i think valet at the hotel, was $42. the parking garage is extremely convenient. at about midnight we ventured to the bar at the hotel.. not a seat remaining. There are tables that are seat yourself to the right of the bar, that are staffed by waiters. we sat and looked at a menu for a late snakc as we just had gotten back from fenway, and decided the late night menu wasnt exactly what we were looking for. Not to mention in the 10 minutes we were there, no one approached us. So we went to Dylan and Max's... about 3-4 minutes down the street. cool, low key bar. Great bar food! The location of the hyatt is interesting. It's suprisingly convenient. The T is really close. The Common is a block away. You are just a block or two from Chinatown section, and you are 'in' the financial district. In my opinion, this isnt really the financial district. We usually stay at Club Quarters. IMO, THAT is the financial district. The Hyatt is more on the fringe i would say. it took about 10-12 minutes to get to fanuiel hall, etc. not too bad. There are stores very close by (dunkin donuts, cvs, tons of retail). I must add that they were SOLD OUT (overbooked actually) the night we stayed... And we had no service issues, nor did we hear anyone else through the walls, floors, ceilings, etc. we had no complaints! The Hyatt's reputation here MAY BE what's hurting it the most. The hyatt is known for its plush accomodations and catering to the higher end. Im thinking this could be it's downfall on the review boards in many instances. We rated the hyatt as very comparable to the other 3.5 to 4 star hotels we have stayed at in Boston and NYC... Clean. Comfy, and conveneint.

The tags were still on. (You know where this story is going...) Anyway, we were literally on the Mass Pike westbound not even at I-84 when we called the front desk. We were immediately transferred to Housekeeping and begged the supervisor to go to the room herself and grab the items. She called us right back to say that the room had already been serviced and that no items were reported in the room and there was nothing in lost and found. We were so mad we almost drove the car into a ditch, and if we didn't have a time commitment we would have turned around and created a scene in the lobby to be remembered for the ages.

I should also mention we'd never been to one of the big chains of hotels. The lobby was clean, the room was kept neat, the front desk was efficient, the doormen were great. Three strikes for us: No free internet. We're budget travellers, and have yet to find a budget hotel, B&B or hostel that does not provide either a dataport, in-room or lobby wifi, or even a ratty old PC in the corner with communal web access. The Hyatt wanted $10 per day to access the internet. At $200/night, we felt we'd paid enough. The Concierge was brusque and not very helpful with our dining enquiries. Perhaps we caught her on a bad night. Perhaps she just did not understand that, unlike some, we wanted to have a say in the cuisine offered by the restaurant rather than 'just anywhere with seats'. The Financial District is dead at night. It's good for some, as it's close to touristy things during the day (Boston Common etc) but it was not for us. After our first night there, we went back online and found the nearest budget hotel. Hotel 140, in the Copley Square district, turned up for about $150/night including taxes. My god what a difference that made. All the cleanliness and great front desk of the Hyatt, with rooms that were just as functional and comfortable (the lack of a minibar and a desk covered with ads for additional fee services did not phase us) plus a coin operated laundry, much faster elevator service and, oh, FREE INTERNET. The Hyatt appeared to us to represent the standard of large chain hotels. We've learnt that we are not chain hotel people, and will look elsewhere from now on. It hit average right on the button.

I didn't think the entrance was that big of a deal - I find it very common to have to take a separate elevator to the lobby in any big city hotel. If you arrive by car you go right in (without stairs) into initial elevator lobby. Location is very good - just off of Washington near lots of shopping, Macys and just on the main downtown subway station. Easy to get to from the Airport if using public transportation (From Airport - Silver Line Bus to Red Line Subway then exit Downtown Crossing station) 1 1/2 blocks to Boston Commons and area attractions - 15 min walk to the wharf area, etc. We were upgraded to a corner room which had a king bed and separate sitting area. There were some stray hairs in the sink but otherwise the room seemed clean. Staff was ok - not great but ok and friendly enough. Ate breakfast in Avenue One which was tasty and worth the 20 bucks. Although the servers weren't all that friendly but the people working the omelet and waffle stations were super nice and the food was great. There was a bit of a heat wave over July 4th weekend and the room a/c just did not keep up - hard to sleep when it's that warm. I didn't complain but probably should have. I also noticed loud beeping noises in the hallway throughout the day - very strange. All in all I would stay here if you could get a great rate but otherwise I probably will try another hotel.

Streetside, there isn't anymuch visible but a door way that leads down steps into a mini-lobby. (There are also some weird blue lights along the street). Guests are then required to elevator up to the 3rd floor to the actual lobby, which unlike many Hyatts, is uninspiring and rather conventional. The rooms themselves are conventional for a property of the Hyatt level; not particularly large or exceptional. Soundproofing is not particularly good. The activities of the people next door to my room where clearly audible. Management at this property on the weekend i was there had clearly made the decision to maximize volume with discounts and arrangements with various sites and organizations. It was an international bazaar with travelers/tourists from all over the world. This suggests that a good price for a room can be had for the diligent. Location is on the edge of being excellent. It's about two blocks off the Boston Commons, which is good, but its precise location is a little fringy, across from a forlorn lookinng parking lot and not precisely in the middle of bustling activity. Breakfast buffet is $20. Parking is $33 self-park. Valet parking is over $40. Internet is $10. My room had only one \"coffee basket\" for the coffee maker. There is a charge for coffee in the lobby. This is certainly a servicable hotel but certainly one at the lower spectrum of Hyatt properties.

My biggest surprise (dislike) was the fact that there were price tags all around the room, e.g. $250 cleaning fee if there was smoking in the room (not that I had plans to do this), if even a thing was moved (not consumed) from the mini-bar/fridge I would be charged for that item, $25 cleaning fee for storing any of my own drinks/food in the fridge -- ridiculous!

Internet is $10/day in room, much better price than the business center which was kindly pointed out to me at the front desk. The staff were friendly, but almost erring on the side of too casual.

The price was a major influence in our selection, it was the cheapest central hotel they offered. It was only after that we read more of the reviews and began to get worried. We took a taxi from the airport and the doorman offered to help us with the bags on arrival but we declined. The entrance is strange, the lobby is on the third floor so you need to take a lift (there are 3) from the ground. However, to get to these from the street entrance you need to go down a small flight of stairs which was a pain with the luggage (we wished we had used the bellboy)! Also these doors don't really open properly, they are stuck open at an angle which you can walk through without luggage. If the doorman is there they manage to force them open. Check in was a breeze there was no queue and the agent Rosario, was so helpful making sure that our requests had been fulfilled and offering further help and information. It was then, however, we found out that the pool was shut for renovations which had overrun. This was disappointing for us as we do like to chill in the pool normally. However, Rosario explained they had an agreement with the Langham should we wish to use a pool although as it happened, Boston kept us so occupied we didn't have time. We were on the 19th floor which pleased us and there were four lifts, which although were a bit creaky, were always working and we never had a situation where we had a long wait. The room was very spacious and clean and well maintained. It was, however, a little dated and this is reflected throughout the hotel but not to any extent that disappointed us. We had absolutely no issues with noise at all. Every member of staff we met was always friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make sure we were happy. Even after we had checked out the staff on the front desk were more than happy to give us a key to use the sauna and fitness suite so we could shower before our flight home. We found the location to be ideal. It is on top of Downtown Crossing subway station and Boylston was only a couple of minutes walk too. So many of the attractions were such a short distance anyway that sometimes it was just quicker just to walk. There is also an alternate entrance through Macy's (an alternate set of 3 lifts take you down to there).

To our suprise one of the room service attendant (a guy) told us not to walk there at all if we're not happy with the wetness! I simply cannot accept that since the region that was wet was next to where we put our baggage. 2) NO verbal pre-warning and obscured notices for the use of the fridge. Having bought some fruits from the Haymarket, we wanted to keep them fresh but the fridge that they have was fully occupied. Personally, of all the hotels we've been (even Hyatt in other countries) doesn't do it like the Hyatt we stayed here in Downtown Boston - we were not told that the fridge was not meant for storage and that there were an automatic inventory notification should we remove any items out from it. The notice that they pasted was obscured and hardly noticeable!!!! And worth to point out was really meant to mislead their customers into the same situation we faced - whereby we were then billed $99 for things we removed to make room for the fruits. Although they did a courtesy waiver for the billing, the experience was enough to classify it as an unacceptable experience. 3) Baggage handling @ Hotel's Concierge Last and worst service ever was the bell man of the Hotel who's name is Willie. Poorest of poorest of service. He purposely ignored my initial warning telling him that our bag cannot be lifted from the topside and later on rudely said that I didn't give any pre-warning.

I don't mind taking the stairs occasionally, even if I was on the 11th floor, it was better than waiting for the 1 working elevator to make it's way down all 20 flights. Oh, and 2 people in our party got stuck in an elevator for prolonged periods of time, on 2 separate occasions...On the plus side, the location is fantastic - it's really close to the T and within walking distance of almost everything on the Freedom Trail.

You'd think that hotel management would make sure it's staff treats everyone with respect, but especially when someone picked their hotel as the recommended place to stay for a wedding. Hotel staff was generally uninformed about event details even though the bride provided them with all the information and travel gifts for her guests (which weren't delivered in a timely fashion). Hotel security was lacking. Guests with the wedding had to actually leave the bar area one night and go somewhere else to avoid some rude random customer who eventually started a fight and was arrested. I can't say for a fact, but I don't think he was even a hotel guest. Regardless, is this a Hyatt Regency or Moe's Tavern? And the icing on the cake was when the bride's computer was stolen while in possession of hotel staff. As if that wasn't bad enough, hotel management has not offered to reimburse her for her stolen property or done anything more than offer an apology.

If you are going in and out anytime during the night, use the valet service. Like I said above, the rooms were very nice but the noise was unbelieveable. We had a two couples next to us who were very loud and truly sounded like they were in our room instead of theirs. The people in the hallway might as well have been in our room too. I heard two females who joined the party brag how they got past the lobby attendants with a false story about leaving their husbands upstairs and forgetting their room keys. I have never been in a hotel where the walls and doors were that thin. So if you are fortunate and do not have loud neighbors, it's a great package.

The screen is flat, but it is still a large TV that would have been state of the art in 1993. Only 24 channels on the TV, not including Hyatt promo stuff. Minibar was one of those \"sensor\" types where if you take anything out, you are charged for it. High prices, $4.50 for bottled Dasini water and soared from there. People in the room next to us were partying hard, and it sounded like they were partying in our room. Fortunately they lefty, but made another huge racked when returing at 3:30 a.m. I slept through it, my wife woke up. We were with our baby, and the crib brought to the room was quite nice. They provided a \"baby kit\" of products in the crib, which my wife was very impressed by. Checked out the pool, found the water to be a little cold. It's attached to the exercise room, which was pretty impressive. The first time I've ever seen free weights at a hotel gym. The bar, we had a drink while waiting for our friends. I had a Stella ($6) and my wife a glass of sauvignon blanc ($8.75). Went to the lobby restaurant \"Avenue One\" for breakfast and found it to be grossly overpriced. Continental breakfast buffet $14, full breakfast buffet $20. Coffee by itself $4. I guess it's par for the course for a big city hotel, but looking at the menu I wanted to walk right out. But we stayed and it was fine, and the staff were really great as had been the case our entire stay. Overall it was pretty much what we expected, but the staff clearly made it extremely enjoyable. We left the hotel feeling really good about our stay. I would stay here again for sure.", "Date": "November 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cDifficult to review\u201d", "Author": "nycthing", "ReviewID": "UR48718003", "Content": "This is a difficult hotel to review - the rooms are nice but the entrance on the second floor is awkward.

Yes, of course, what was I thinking...). But this hotel is just what you'd expect from a big Hyatt in a big city, and there's nothing wrong with it. I paid about $300 which was a bit expensive for what I got, but not by much. My Hyatt status gets me free internet, tho' I'd guess it 's probably not cheap otherwise, and it worked generally ok. Tea/coffee and ipod player in the room gets plus marks, as does a big bathtub. The negatives weren't life-threatening. The hotel's been well renovated, but it's nevertheless an old big-box hotel, \"mutton dressed up as lamb\". The one major niggle wouldn't be a problem for most travellers. I checked before I booked that there was a pool, and what the opening hours were (from 5am). I checked again when I got to the hotel, with the front desk. And I checked once more in the hotel services booklet. Jetlag, an early flight, and a training programme, meant I was at the door of the pool at 5:00 sharp in the morning. Locked door. 5:05 still locked. I called reception, who said they'd get someone from security to come, which they did... at 5:30. So my long workout turned into a short workout and I could have stayed in bed another half an hour. And neither the receptionist nor the security guard attempted an apology. So any other lunatic early morning athletes beware. The rest of you... ignore that whinge!

The Hyatt website describes their \"elegant granite bath\" in each room as well as pointing out the presence of a large flat screen tv in each room. Well, the flat screen tv is any old regular tv with a screen that happens to be flat. do not think that it will be LCD or a thin flat screen. And the bath is NOT granite. It is a regular, smallish bath with a granite COUNTER next to it. The mini bar seems to be quite hostile- there are sensors on each item and the room is charged as soon as an item is moved.

I was just looking for something in a decent location at a resonable price. We didn't want to spend a lot, it was more of a place to sleep so we didn't have to worry about driving home after a few cocktails. So I tried Priceline and got the Hyatt Regency for $75 on my first bid. For the money I could not complain. The hotel is in a good location. It is about a 15-20 min walk to Faneuil Hall and a couple blocks over from the Boston Common. It is also not far from multiple T stops and the Back Bay area. It is in a really convenient area for those looking to visit both areas. Like everyone has said in past reviews it does have an odd setup. You take an elevator to the lobby and then a different elevator to your room. We never found this to be a real issue and it only added an extra 30 seconds or so to getting to street level. Check-in was easy and fast. We were able to check-in when we got there at 2pm with no problem. We were off to our room in less than 5 mins. The room was a very nice, standard hotel room. We had a king size bed that had nice sheets and a feather mattress topper. Overall the room was very clean, except for some hair my wife found in the shower later. The TV could of used a few more channels but it sufficed. Our view was pretty much the roof of buildings next door but it wasn't bad. The next morning there were some slamming doors but other than that it was nice and quiet. Overall, for $75 ($92 after fees/taxes) it was great!! For that price in Boston just about any room would be worth it. So for what we wanted and for the price it was great. If you can get the price we did, or close to it, I would definitley recommend it. One tip for those with a car, park in the Boston Common parking garage. We got there just before 2pm and left around 10am the next day. Total price = $22.

I figure that if a place charges three or four times as much it doesn't need to add on a fee for internet access and could afford to give you at least a banana and cold cereal for breakfast. He really didn't have any explanation other than \"Those are the rules of the franchisor.\" In my opinion, those rules will cost these chains a lot of money in the long run. For a business traveler on an expense account, four or five dollars for an internet connection might not matter, nor would paying an additional eight or ten dollars for breakfast. For someone traveling for pleasure, or with a family, then it does make a difference. Whether you're saving $12 or $15 (which is what I figure the cost for three would be for a typical \"continental\" breakfast of muffin, juice, coffee and cereal--such as that served by Super 8 or Days Inn) or $30 (which I figure the free hot breakfast for three that we had at a Holiday Inn Expressin St. John NB, complete with waitress service, was worth, at a minimum), those amenities add up. That general complaint aside, this was an adequate three star hotel with a weird entrance, through a parking garage and up an elevator to get to the lobby. There's no real street entrance for pedestrians.

First of all, I must note that it's very easy to navigate around Boston by foot or public transportation. Hyatt is only a block away from Boston Common, and T stations, so it's very easy to get everywhere from Hyatt. It's also very close to shops, restaurants, Dunkin Donut and CVS (I don't how many of these are in Boston, but it seems like every block has at least one of these). - Customer Service. I'm going to list this under pro and also con, and I will explain why. Concierge was very helpful, and very professional. This was our first trip to Boston, so we didn't know where to go, what to do, etc. We stopped by concierge literarly every day. They were very helpful and very patient in answering all questions we had. We especially loved Mike. We had the same lady who came and cleaned our room everyday. We met her on the first day. She was always friendly. I wish I had gotten her name. - Comfy Hyatt bed. Self explanatory. - Room size is pretty good.

I don't know what exactly can be done about this and how this complaint may help, but this was one of the annoyance we encountered, especially when we were trying to check out with our four suitcases. It took us a while to get down to the lobby. - The lobby is NOT on the first floor. This was so confusing to us. We got to the hotel at midnight due to flight delay, and there was no door man, so it took us a while before we figured out that we had to go up to the lobby to check in. Considering I live on Tripadvisor, I should probably have been aware of this fact. My only excuse is, the long flight left me exhausted to think straight. - One of the elevators broke down while we were in it. We were stuck in an elevator for good 10 mins.Picture a very close space with a bunch of people you don't know and crying children. Despite pushing the emergency button, no one came to our rescue. The elevator door opened up to a WALL. We kept on pushing the button, until it finally opened up back to the lobby, however, we had to jump up to reach the floor since it didn't actually stop on the \"right\" floor if you know what I mean. Only then, the service people noticed and came running to our rescue. The elevator was then closed down for repair for the rest of our stay there. - Is there a doorman? Not sure. Sometimes there's someone there, but most of the time there wasn't. We only encountered 2, neither was friendly. They seemed to be bored perhaps they're were too cold to crack a smile. I don't need anyone opening the door for me, but it'll be nice to get a \"hello\" at least when you walk by them instead of them pretending you don't exist. - Bathroom is on the smaller size, however, this seems to be the trend in a lot of hotels, so even though I'm listing this under con, I'm giving this one a pass. Overall, it was a good stay. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't anything to brag about either. Will I stay there again? If the price is right, yes, sure. However, I would not pay a four star hotel price to stay here. My suggestion will be to shop around if you decide to stay here.", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cNice place, but not up to 4-star quality\u201d", "Author": "jtolson32", "ReviewID": "UR22970394", "Content": "My wife and I stayed overnight at the Hyatt.

We stayed at the Hyatt, a few minor problems checking in but we survived. The rooms were clean and and spacious.

We elected to save some money by using the public parking because we did not plan to drive around the city. Otherwise, if you do plan to, the valet parking is definitely a better deal. We had no problem finding parking, but were confused when we got off of the elevator to the hotel. There were several options of where to go but no clear directions to the hotel. Eventually we figured it out, but were a little discouraged that we had to take another set of elevators to get to your room...just a little inconvenient if your just trying to get out of the hotel. Otherwise, the entrance, lobby and hallways of the hotel were very nice. The staff was almost overly perky and actually asked the same questions more than once. Overall, good though. We ended up on the 21st floor was provided some pretty decent views. The room was nice enough but nothing spectacular. If I was actually paying the regular rate, I would have been disappointed. The most disappointing part was the bathroom. Although at first glance it looked nice, once I sat down on the toilet, I noticed that there was white paint splattered all over the dark wood portions of the sink/vanity. Then when I jumped in the shower, the grout was clearly discolored. From the ceiling to about half way down the wall, it was white grout, then all of a sudden turned dark gray. It almost appears that they started re-grouting with a different color and never finished but I'm not sure if that's the case. They have a decent bar area but the drinks (of course) are pretty over priced. In the middle of the night, it got hot in our room for some reason so I called the front desk. The offered to have engineering take a look at the unit and also provide a fan. They brought the fan up within minutes and also reset our AC which seemed to have fixed the problem.

It is a 22 floor building that is grey and red on the outside- not beige like one would expect when looking at the website photo. We stayed here for around 4 nights in June, and it was a OK experience. There were definitely some clear ups, while there were some downs in the experience as well. And lastly, we paid 186 per night for a standard room on the AAA S&N England rate. Check in was not a extremely good experience. However, you do need to know that we were checked in by a staff \"in training\", and he didn't know all the ropes yet. He didn't know that we had an AAA rate and was supposed to get free breakfast for 2 everyday. We had to make him ask his fellow staff members so that he would know. The lobby looks completely different than the photos on the Hyatt website. It is more dim, with dark brown wood and yellow/beige tones. There are two televisions explaining upgrades you can get for your room. In addition, there is a giant vase of flower arrangements. Not too far from the lobby is Avenue One and the lounge. Our room was 1714- on the 17th floor. The room was OK sized compared to some rooms we have been in, but it was definitely smaller than the norm. Entering the room, there is first a small empty area with a stone table that protrudes out of the wall, and then a closet. To the left, there is the bathroom. Again- the same wood tones (but lighter- more like a walnut) and beige tones were in the room. In addition, there were splashes of silver and blue glass- from the Sony Dream Clock as well as the outdoor label. Some features included a sitting area with a large comfy chair with legrest, a small flower arrangement, magazines on Boston and books as well, a Sony Dream Clock that had a CD player, a writing desk with a modern black, silver, and white lamp, a single cup coffee maker, and lastly a silver CRT TV- I am not sure which brand. It was overall pretty pleasant and warm. Everything functioned well until later on our stay. And also, although we did have a view, most of it was the 93 freeway and the State Street skyscraper. And some rooftops. The floors have an atrium- in which every four floors there is one. It is a weird thing though, that they didn't make the hotel floors atrium, but instead in series of 4's. In addition, near the elevators, there is a sitting area with planters, as well as a silver phone and a window with a view. The bathroom had a granite countertop, as well as a scent fragrance- a bottle, with wood things sticking out. There were the standard Portico Spa Lavender Citrus toiletries, which are always good. Like other reviewers said, the bathroom is small. The right is the sink, the door area (middle) is the toilet, and the left is the shower/tub combo. The showerhead was a Speakman Airstream head, which is also used in some other hotels. Housekeeping was very friendly too. When we asked for extra toiletries, they responded. I did have a complaint on them and that was that the put the pillows on the floor when doing housekeeping- hopefully they changed the sheets before putting them back on the bed! Their health club- the Stay Fit Gym- was also good. To start the workout, you first have to go thru three sets of stairs to the gym! You do need your room key, and once you go down the first set of stairs, you put in your key, open the door, and then there are photos of Hyatts on the east coast. It's called the Hyatt Walk. However, the photos are really old. Then, you go down another set of stairs where there are athletic photos, and then down another set of stairs to the gym. There are a ton of tools for the workout- your elliptical, treadmill, and bicycle cycling are all there. Along with that are yoga balls and weights, as well as harder, more confusing workouts. Complimentary in the gym, you can get filtered water and Koss Headphones to listen to music during your workout. The equipment is all made mainly by Life Fitness, and one Precor eliptical. There is also a pool that is 3 to 5 feet deep. In addition, there are foam boards, in which people use. The health club mainly is busy during the night time- but during noon, it is almost empty. Last but not least, they use Neutrogena toiletries for the shower, and cool, refrigerated towels are provided as well. Our breakfast was really good. It's around a 50 dollar value. There were really interesting things such as cold oatmeal along with jars of condiments such as dried fruit and raisins. In addition, there were 4 types of cereal, great fresh, ripe fruit, pastries, danishes, croissants, and milk at the continental breakfast table. At the main table, there were roasted fingerling potatoes, bacon, sausage, scotch oatmeal, pancakes, a plate of salmon and varieties of cheeses and grapes, and farm raised scrambled eggs. Not only that, they also let you sample a small glass of strawberry smoothie- at least that was what was being offered in June. Our main complaint was that they didn't refill our OJ, which made us thirsty. So- overall right now, it was a good stay. However, we encountered problems. One thing was the AC, which had malfunctioned in our room. The engineers tried to fix it, but it didn't really work. Secondly, we got a pillow which had black marks on it. This truly disgusted us. How could a Hyatt be like this? On such a great, high caliber of hotels, this shouldn't be happening. And so, we transferred hotels later on our stay. Like others have said, the doors are just plain loud! It is confusing why this happens. When a door shuts without you touching it, it makes a loud noise. And lastly, parking at the Hyatt was expensive. Their valet isn't really even a valet- you just left your car in the underground port cochere! They didn't even move it away! And you had to pay 41 dollars for it! That is more than the Intercontinental- which is only 39 a day! Plus, their self parking has no in and out privileges- however the Hyatt Airport, for the same price, does! The only good thing in parking was that the person who helped us was very nice- he shared stories with us on his life and helped us open the doors and luggage. Overall, it's a good hotel. Most people are probably not going to experience things we experienced, and so I recommend it! It is a nice hotel, but it was just plain weird the AC and the pillow would be problematic. It was a good value as the room was low compared to other hotels which are probably the same experience but for twice the price. Also in the factor was that the breakfast was included- and it cost a lot! In conclusion, it's a good hotel- but if you do encounter problems, you need to get help instantly.

Also had a bar, iron and board and a robe to use (if going to use the swimming pool). Decor was slightly 80's style mixed in with the new furniture.

I got a room on the 16th floor and got nice views around the city. Staff were super friendly at the check-in desk. Couldn't say the same for some of the concierge/bell boys.

Too often one asks for something and waits long for the execution or have to remind/re request. Not here ask once it is is done with alacrity. Doormen greeted our exits and entrances genuinely. And when 5 people appeared at the bottom of the stairs at the street entrance with rollerboards and suitcases the lone doorman sprang into action insisting we leave them all for him to bring up. We didnot have to get his attention..he was there for the guests. Two requests for housekeeping was met within half an hour. Too often one waits long much too long. Not at this Hyatt. Other reviewers had remarked on the thinness of the walls. I had to ring Front Desk to ask they have a neighouring room turn down the TV volume. The F.D. said they would send up hotel security. Shortly after the fone rang in the offending room. No change to TV volume. 1 minute or 2 later the fone rings a second time and the TV is turned off. We received a voice message from the duty manager that night to speak with him in the a.m. When I did, he was most apologetic and offered to remove our internet charges and also proffered a full breakfast voucher. I have stayed in hotel rooms where noise was a problem...but the Hyatt's reponse and follow through here was impressive. And their concern for our comfort and satisfaction is indicative of their high service standards. Big city hotels . Downtown hotels too often service their clientele on autopilot and lip service. We never felt that during our stay. Sure the physical plant and surroundings are not stellar. The F& B have to compete in a city of fabulous restuarants.

Also was a very powerful aroma in the lobby areas (not in the rooms though) so not advised for people who are sentitive to perfumes. Rooms were acceptable but definitely not what the hotel website describes. Beds are nothing special, just a feather mattress pad over a plain old mattress. They look comfy but feel mediocre. Our 6th floor city view room was an up-close view of another building's roof \"junk\". Kept the drapes closed. Rust around tub drain and rust stains in the grout. Just rust, but still made me queasy when I had to bathe my toddler. Hair was stuck to the paint on the ceiling in the bathroom. Nice to have robes in the room though and the soaps were nice. Pool liner also seemed to be rust-stained. No hot tub. Overall, I was mostly horrified by the X-rated noises from the next-door room. I was with my mother and toddler for a Mother's Day weekend!

FOOD we enjoyed: Dim Sum at Chau Chow City in China Town, ( I preferred this over Peach Farm ), seafood at Union Oyster House near Quincy Market, and the Barking Crab, Pizza at New York Pizza and appetizers at Cheers at Quincy Market. We boarded a City Line trolley at Stop 1 in Quincy Market. Board early in the day as there are 9 stops at which you can re-board. The tours of Old Iron Sides ended at 3:30 but we were still able to walk around. The WW II ship closed at 4:00. Thru Sept. the $27 ticket also included a free harbor cruise which we didn't have time for. There is a CVS near the hotel. One can take a shortcut through the parking garage. If you want bottled water buy it outside the hotel if you have a budget. All of the STAFF performed their roles in a HIGHLY PROFESSIONAL manner. Housekeeping was good but I sensed perhaps someone had not vacuumed around the edges. Towels, toiletries were well supplied. There was no fan in the bathroom and no make-up mirror. CHECK-IN was efficient and there is self check-out. There is computer access in the registration area where you can print your return trip boarding pass at no charage. CABFARE for the airport was $20 and up depending on the day we used it. That included a generous tip. If you are traveling solo, the shuttle cab was $14.50 per person we were told. I felt having 2 elevators was a good security feature of the hotel, personally. I didn't find it to be inconvenient as some have said .It did mean that I needed to have baggage handling due to the stairs at the entrance.

They were told they had to wait. It was ridiculous. At 6:30pm, our room was still not ready, and my friend and I had to leave for the evening. We told reception that we'd return around 10:30pm to check in, and to please not give away our room.

The rooms were average and on the small side like most city hotels but it was fine.I guess I expected a little more from a four star hotel. The bathroom door kept closing, hitting you in the back, and that was annoying, the door also hit the curved shower rod they obviously installed long after this hotel was built. It was a very small bathroom. When we checked in I was surprised to see only two bath towels and no shampoo (there was shower gel, conditioner, and body cream). None of the soaps were added during our stay which I thought was rather cheap of the hotel. I called and asked for more bath towels and got two bath MATS....so, we just grabbed the towels from the cart we saw in the hallway on our way out.

There was some kind of convention there but we hardly even noticed. - The staff was very friendly and helpful. - There were 2 TVs, one in the sitting room and 1 in the bedroom. - Hotel was centrally located so we could walk to just about every attraction, or hop on the T from the station close by. What I didn't like: - There was only 1 robe. This isn't a big deal but past stays at other Hyatts have had 2 robes. A very minor thing. - The blow dryer was very old and low wattage. It's like the models from over 10 yrs ago. There was also a crack and a hole in the handle. This was probably the most annoying thing in the room for me. - The view of the room was not very good due to the floor level (8). I'm sure the view is better at higher floors. Again, not that big of a deal for me since we weren't in the room most of the day. - The parking prices are ridiculously high ($30 for self parking, $41 for valet). Our package came with complimentary valet parking, thank goodness. - The breakfast buffet was nothing to write home about. At $21 a person, I expected a little more than very runny scrambled eggs and the standard affairs (bacon, sausage, bread/bagel, cereal, fruit, oatmeal). The fruit was fresh and good. My recommendation is to take the $21 and go to one of the local cafes. Even better, take the T to North End ($4 roundtrip) or a cab (~ $20 roundtrip) to Bova's and experience some of the best pastries on Earth (yes, it's that good!). Other comments: One of the room elevators was not opening the doors once it got to our floor. This was a bit unnerving at first since the elevator just sat there. But then we just avoided going up in that particular one. Problem solved. Some of the reviews on this site said how scared or hesitant they were, or that is was a ghost town in this part of downtown. We stayed there Fri-Mon and experienced neither of these. But like in all major downtowns, people have to take some precautions, especially at nite. We didn't eat at the hotel's restaurant, Avenue One, since we preferred to eat at other, more well known restaurants (my reviews of Legal Seafood and Union Oyster House will be posted shortly). Conclusion, I would definitely stay at the Hyatt again if I'm ever back in Boston. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be centrally located to many of the local attractions and wants to be able to walk to them.", "Date": "June 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Providence, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!\u201d", "Author": "JCortez224", "ReviewID": "UR7948372", "Content": "We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Boston for one night during Memorial Day weekend.

The staff was very knowledgeable on the surrounding city and I often utilized their advice for restaurants and things to do. Even the bell staff was willing to answer questions about directions and such and were always one step ahead in opening the doors and helping with bags. I was very impressed. The room we stayed in was gorgeous. We were on the 19th floor overlooking the city. The views were breathtaking. Waking up in the morning and looking out over the surrounding area was a pleasant experience. The architecture of the hotel was also impressive. Stepping off the elevator, there was an atrium that was three floors tall. Instead of walking out into a narrow and claustrophobic hallway, we were greeted with a sitting area complete with artwork and statues. Normally, hotels focus their main decorating on the lobby. But this hotel had all the right touches in all the right places. The beds were one of a kind. I have never felt so rested before. Everything about this hotel will make me want to choose Hyatt in the future. I forget exactly what the nightly rate was, but it was definitely worth every penny. The fitness center was well-equipped and the pool was very nice, complete with sauna, steam room, locker room, showers, and rest room. The restaurants also looked very good, but I did want to leave the hotel to walk around. Next time I will definitely dine in the restaurants.

I didn't have that much interaction with hotel staff, the doormen were always courteous and when we needed assistance the hotel swiftly provided. However the breakfast was a let down, the Hyatt are clever in that they include a continental breakfast in some rates and then charge you 8$ to upgrade to the buffet breakfast. Is it worth it, when you're hungry anythings worth it, choice was limited, i would of preferred a la carte in that price but that wasn't an option. But again it did the job, if it got that bad, i could of walked down the road to one of the diners we'd found for all day eggs and pancakes.

On most days we walked up Boylston to Newbury Street, it was fantastic! Ok so whats the deal here is it worth it? Depends how much you pay the Hyatt throw around a stupendous amount of offers, we did make use of one of those offers so i paid in the region of 150-200$ a night.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had better experiences at Motel 6. Much better. Oh, and they forget to tell you about the $41 per night parking fee for Valet parking and $31 a night if you park yourself. We noticed this and moved our car on the night of check-in. But apparently this didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t register so on check out we were charged the $41 dollars on top of the $31 dollars I already paid. I will say that when confronted on this, they removed the $41 charge. And don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe the listed prices for room service. My $9 ice cream came out to $12+ tip. Speaking of room service: I ordered assorted pastries and muffins for breakfast. I got two muffins. I guess assorted means blueberry and bran. Want more nickel and dime? Careful not to open the mini bar fridge. Everything is bar coded, so if you take something out and put it back in\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it registers on you bill as purchased. Want to save that ice cream you ordered, or chill a bottle of wine for later? Sure\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but there will be a $25 cleaning fee for storing things in the fridge. The front desk warned me to not bump up against the fridge\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6could cause charges to show up on your bill. Oh! And get this: one night we settled in to watch a movie. We surfed the choices: fair\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6not good, but fair. Then chose one. The price? $12.00. We watched Monk instead. Service: Very Poor. The Bell Man gave a curt and rapid review of the rooms features when we arrived. Bordered on fearful. On the first day, the toilet started to back up and almost overflow. I fiddled with it myself and got it going again. (How many stars is this hotel?) Finally I had to call for a plunger on our last day. They showed up 30+ minutes later. And the lay-out is just weird. You have to go up an elevator (no stairs as an option) to the 3rd floor for check in / lobby. These elevators are slow and one must wait for them for some time. Then you have to go up a different bank of elevators to get to your rooms. These elevators are even slower and you have to wait longer for them. There is usually a line. The music in the elevator is nice and loud. Kind of like being in a small psychedelic club with mirrors. Was there a complementary paper in the morning? Funny. No way. If I had stayed at some 2 star hotel? Probably, but not here. The pool? I found it one night\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6after traveling through a maze of corridors.

I would not object to staying there again, but if I am doing the reserving on a future Boston trip, I will seek a better alternative. We booked a larger, extra- cost \"corner room\".

My conclusion is the King beds are wide but short. The quality of food and breadth of choice at the breakfast buffet were outstanding. The hotel somehow adjoins Boston's old retail heart and theater district. Both went to seed a long time ago. We never felt unsafe, only unimpressed. The hotel has only a tiny entrance at street level and then requires an elevator ride to the lobby on the third floor, which negates the sense of \"entrance\" you get when you walk into a nice hotel.

It was very well staffed, and I didn't have to wait for check in, check out, or to talk to the concierge (Mike was extremely helpful).

I saw no evidence of any of the hotel being outdated. Our room was immaculate, and was as up to date as they come. The room service meals were great (although a bit pricey). The athletic facility was excellent. The equipment was new (treadmills and bikes had built in tvs), and there were even refrigerated wet washcloths! The pool was rectangular and had a lane for lap swimming (18 yards), and rarely used. By the way, the location is about a block from the Boston Commons, and quite convenient.

But overall i might say it's quite fair to say Hyatt Regency Boston's a 4-star hotel. Checking-in (*watch out) ------------------------------------------------- My friend booked two rooms on Priceline at the price of $138 per night three days before the trip. At about 3:45pm on September 30, 2006 (which was a Saturday), our party of four arrived at the check-in desk. The wait was okay, but as many other guest had suggested, we were told that there was no room available at the time (check out: 12; check-in: 4!!). We were assured, though, that there would be rooms for us when we come back later that night. The hotel staff were patient and nice. Our party was attended by a lady named Stephanie. i left my cell number and asked if we could have two rooms on a higher floor. i called back about 6:30pm, front desk said the rooms were open but not yet ready. At 8:00pm, the hotel called and said the rooms were ready. We went back to the hotel past 10pm, and were placed on 15th and 20th floor. i asked how the hotel dealt with the wait list, and was told it is on a first-come, first-served basis. Therefore, if you want to have a room available as soon as possible, make sure you come to the hotel when you get the chance. Don't wander off like our party did and don't wait till the last minute! Luggage ----------- Since our only piece of luggage was brought into the storage when we first checked in, i thought we had to wait a long time for them to come up, like some guests complained. But it came to our door within a fast 10 minutes! Room (size, cleanliness, etc) -------------- When you step out of the elevator, you can see right away that floor 19 to floor 22 has a loft-style waiting area, where there are comfortable chairs for guests. My husband and i were on the 20th floor (i believe the room number was 2034). The room has a king-sized bed, and the size was pretty decent (approx. 12 x 18). i think the width could actually fit two king-sized beds. i wanted to take some pictures, but my camera battery was so dead, and by the time it finally got fully charged, all our stuff was everywhere :-p The next morning we were in a hurry to leave, so...sorry for not being able to get more photos!! (Photos from previous travelers were very helpful; they reflected what i saw anyway.) The front desk said that rooms on higher floors have similar sizes, so i guess you can always ask for rooms on a higher floor. The room itself was quite clean. i liked the bathroom. There was a bamboo bowl on the sink counter with scented leaves and stuff, which was pretty pleasant. The view outside the window was okay, not a whole lot. Bed was very comfortable and nice. There were three sets of phones available in the room: one with a wireless headset, one wired by the bed, and also another in the bathroom. The hotel site says they provide bathrobes and slippers, but i didn't find the slippers. Fitness center and swimming pool ----------------------------------------------- Open till 11pm. The gym equipment is new and well maintained. Would have been nicer if it was open till a later time. i did see other guests come in at 11pm, and they weren't asked to leave. Neighborhood -------------------- A lot of guests complained about the neighborhood being \"unsafe\" or weird, i have to sort of agree. i wasn't really concerned, since there were 4 of us. During the day when all the shops are open, there are a lot of people around, but it is true that the whole area die down after it gets dark. Seemed like most shops are close at 8 or 9pm. Watch out if you need to get back to the area very late and if you need to get a quick bite. There is a 7-11 on the other side of the hotel entrance (which is near Macy's), but for others such as CVS, i think they are really quite a walk. i didn't try to look this up, but i read it online that the hotel is \"connected\" to Macy's. So if you are concerned about the safety, maybe you can get to Macy's from within the hotel, and then the subway station (the \"T\") is quite near. i found the location okay, it's quite a nice walking (about 10-min) distance from Quincy Market. i personally perfer taking the subway, which saves much time.

To tell the truth, it was a bit disappointing. I arrived at 2.30 in the afternoon after a fairly gruelling three and a half hour train ride from New York to be told, before I had said anything else, that I was politely asked to go away until six o'clock in the evening because the hotel had some sort of difficulty with its accommodations. I quietly and politely explained that, given that I was paying a hefty sum for my room, I really hadn't expected to be told this, especially as I had just got off a hot, sweaty train after a long ride. This was politely ignored. The receptionist gave me a map of downtown Boston and told me to go away for three and a half hours. I agreed to do so but it was not without some (suppressed) infuriation. I don't know whether you've ever walked around downtown Boston before. I had, and knew that killing time for three and a half hours would not be easy. And all I really felt like doing was taking a shower and a rest. My wife was due to arrive at Logan airport at 6.30pm, and I had not wanted to do anything but lie down. However, that was not an option so I did indeed walk around the town for three and a half hours. This is no way for a hotel of any quality to behave. If they had a problem with their bookings, it was their job to get that right, not to penalise their customers. (My booking, by the way, had been in their system, for months.) The room they gave us was satisfactory, but for the money I paid, I thought it small. For much less money, I was given a much larger room at the Affinia Dumont, and that was in New York City. My wife and I ate on our first evening at the downstairs bar. The menu is limited and uninspiring. The hotel restaurant has a better menu, but we didn't want to try it. Frankly, the smallness of our room just made us want to get out of the hotel completely and go to restaurants in town. In other respects I would describe this hotel's facilities as adequate. If you're a business traveller and just need somewhere for one night, it's fine. But whoever you are: be warned. This is the kind of joint where, even if you've just arrived at a reasonable hour, they're quite capable of making you wait 3 and a half hours to get into your room.

Also the fridge buzzed a few times also (the fridge cannot be opened, unless you want to be charged). There was a kettle and hot drinks for free. The hotel is very pleasant and the bar area nice. I would say that I did not like the location it was in, as it seemed to be surrounded by some 'unsavoury' streets, we did not feel safe even during the day and so had to get taxis out in the eve (I live in London, so can comment on unsafe areas). Another bad experience was that when we checked in, the porters took our bags and 2 hours later we were still waiting for them to be sent to our room. I telephoned about 4 times and in the end my husband had to go to reception to complain. I had visions of our bags being lost, which was not a nice thought after the long flight we had just had. If you want a clean, comfortable hotel for a good price, this is a good choice, but bear in mind the location is not safe. I think that a lot of the competitor hotels in Boston can charge more as they are in nicer areas. This also struck me as a business hotel/ used for conventions.", "Date": "June 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cStaff can not handle the busy times!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5316679", "Content": "We checked into this hotel around 11pm on Friday of Memorial Day weekend.

Durning this phone call they never bothered to take our names or look up our reservation, just said \"no problem\" to the late check-in. At the time we didn't think anything of this. When we arrrived they told us that a room with two beds was not available and would not be available for our entire three night stay. Mind you, I booked this room 4 months in advance. We were told that we would get a room with one king bed and a sofa. One of our children would have to sleep on the sofa (not a pull out) and the other would get a roll a way bed. When we explained that this was completeley unacceptable and asked what had happeded to our reservation for a room with two beds, they basically said, \"sorry, nothing we can do\". I was quite irate, because providing a bed for each of it's gets is a hotels most basic service and they were failing to do that. The next morining I phoned the \"Perfect Stay Ambassador\" and she was very sympathetic and told me that we would get a new room that day. I made arrangements with her to have our luggage moved to the new room while we were out sightseeing. Upon returning later in the day to our new room (with 2 beds) our luggage was not there. We had to phone several different departments to track down our luggage and it was temporarily lost. It took them a very long time to locate it and bring it to the room. There were other little complaints that I had about the hotel, that alone they would not have been a big deal, but after the disaster with the room assigment, the other problems just left me feeling more aggrevated. The sink in the bathroom was clogged, the thermostat in our rooom wasn't working and them maid never left enough towels for four peoople. We were constantly calling to get them brought up. Also, since it was a holiday weekend the hotel was booked to full capacity. There were several groups of college students staying at this hotel and they were quite noisy in the middle of the night.

(once you find your bearings in the city, I'd suggest the Park St. T stop) (MBTA has a great website with trip planning tools if you can check it out in advance) The hotel itself does sit in an area that could be a little sketchy in the evenings, as the entrance is on a street without much going on, but we did find all the staff at the Hyatt to be friendly and helpful.

I was just as happy to find a nearby Dunkin Donuts and splurge later on lunch & dinner! Another caution I might add would be if anyone is sensitive to frangrance allergies, be aware that there is potpouri in the rooms along with the strong scent of the supplied shampoo & shower gel.

In our other Hyatt stays we've found unusually shaped rooms and other amenities that set Hyatt apart from other chains simply offering a \"nice\" room. Not here, nothing other than the great Hyatt King Bed distinguished the room. Additionally, the AC was not quite adequate given that I like my room cool at night. The thermostat may have read 60 degrees but the room was considerably warmer, not uncomfortable, but not 60 degrees. Also one of the just two light bulbs in the bathroom was burned out and it's unclear how the maid could not have noticed given how dark it was in there.

The manager then 'interviewed' the maid who said she knew nothing about the underwear or how they got there. Since my room was not cleaned most days even though the manager said they were sending a maid up and finding the 'mysterious' underwear in my room it seems that maybe this maid on the 7th floor had a little extra 'business' going on the side. Another party in our group stayed on the 14th floor and never had to request maid service or changing linens - it was done everyday as soon as they left the room. I called a week ahead of time to request that both parties be assigned rooms on the same floor but at check-in was told that was not possible.

The bathroom was tiny - but clean, the ledge on the side of the tub is incredibly handy for storing toiletries. Yes, I found the dispensers on the wall a little strange - but since I am a bath product nut we had more than enough of our own bath products so we never had to partake of the wall dispensary unit.

Alison in the lounge was friendly and very attentive - the lounge is very comfortable - full of couches put together in cozy configurations.

I'll tell you about the bathroom. Missing bulbs showed a lack of attention (but the extra darkness was welcome). Rust on the bar for what was supposed to be clean towels made one worry about how well anything else was cleaned (took a photo with the camera phone, low quality but you'll get the point). They also do not provide soap/shampoo unless you request it -- otherwise the shower and sink have on-wall hand-pump dispensers that you would otherwise see in the shower at the gym. The staff was nice enough. The TV screen in the room at checkout asked for guests to call the front desk if there is anything that would prevent a guest from rating a \"5\" if called for a satisfaction survey. I shared the info above, and they were very understanding (gave a comp for breakfast). They cited the ongoing renovation project. I was very aware of the renovation -- it started before 9am on Sunday morning. The hammering and drilling were a pretty good clue that there was construction going on. Other items: * We did breakfast by room service which was good quality and very quick * There is a gym with a pool, but you would not believe how many levels of stairs you have to descend to get there! * Parking is via valet ($36) or self-park ($20) at an unaffiliated garage somewhat attached to the hotel Overall -- unless I was committed a room that had the renovation and was FAR FAR away from the construction zone, I would avoid the hotel for now.

We booked the rooms on Priceline (for about $90/night) and, for that price, we were quite happy with the hotel. If however, we were paying the more standard $200-300 for the room, I would not be satisfied. What got me especially excited prior to our stay was Hyatt's website, which advertised that, in November 2004, the hotel would be renovated with \"Boston's Newest Hotel Room.\" The website certainly makes it appear that the renovation would be completed by then, though it does not explicitly say so. Given our rate, I was under no false impression that we would actually get one of these nice renovated rooms, only wishfully hopeful. It's a crock. Turns out, NONE of the rooms have been renovated (as of our stay); we know because we asked the staff. He mentioned that no guest rooms were, though they had done one room up as a \"model\". Don't believe the false hype of Hyatt. Nonetheless, the rooms was standard Hyatt/Marriott level. Nice, satisfactory, nothing overly special. Our friends and us had adjoining rooms, with a door between, which was nice. The first rooms we were given were on a smoky floor (though it was non-smoking), and we asked to move and the front desk staff was excellent in quickly changing our room. In fact, front desk staff was excellent on the whole and extremely professional and courteous. Parking in the garage is outrageous, though I'm sure fairly typical for downtown Boston. I forget the exact number - $30+/night. We were lucky in finding street parking and, given that it was a weekend, only had to feed the meter on Saturday. The location is excellent for those who do the FAnueil Hall/Quincy Market thing. About a brisk 10-minute walk away. Very close to Boston Commons as well (5 minute walk). On the whole, satisfied for the price. If you are expecting luxury, come back to earth (at least until the renovation is actually started, not to mention completed). But the Hyatt is a standard business hotel in a decent location. In terms of the elevators mentioned by a previous poster, we also found that extremely annoying and time-wasting.

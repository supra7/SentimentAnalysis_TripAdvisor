The hotel's front desk personnel are very helpful and courteous. The meeting personnel are the best I've seen in awhile, and i travel a couple times a month doing meetings. I especially give accolades to Spencer and Herman. They were proactive in making sure my meeting room was exactly how I wanted it both days. The food was pretty good too. The sleeping room was average, but the bed was very comfortable. There were lots of pillows, nice sheets, etc. This hotel brags about the air quality, and I have to say, as a non-smoker, it was very nice to be able to breathe at a hotel in this city. The casinos are fun, but I feel sick after a few hours of second-hand smoke. This hotel also has a shuttel service to and from the airport every half hour or so. They are good at notifying you of the times it's available, and the driver is a nice guy. The shuttle also runs to the MGM hotel once every hour and will pick up once every hour until 10 PM if you ask. On the negative side, the hotel is not on the strip. In Vegas, it is really fun to be able to walk out of your room and be \"in the action\". If I was traveling for pleasure alone, I probably wouldnt stay here, unless they increase there shuttle runs to make them more frequents and also take you downtown to the Freemont Street area. And I feel redundant in saying this because most hotels have this problem....the walls are a bit thin. Why would any hotel that is not full, ever put a child on the same floor as business people? Business people don't want to be around screaming babies, or loud people of any age. We come to work and need to be able to sleep without hassles. Sorry, but not that many hotels give a crum about this issue, so I'm putting it in here in hopes their manager will find an innovative way to cure the issue. If so, this hotel would be excellent. For small meetings, this is a great hotel.

I felt your front desk staff were not really supportive in resolving the issues that I had. My first experience was that I asked for early check in at 10:30am as I had flown all night from Hawaii. The manager said he only had smoking rooms available (I am alergic). So I waited in the lobby. Instead of him checking, say every 15 min to see if a room was made up, I had to ask again at 11:30am to see if a room was available. It was. He insincerely said, \"sorry for the wait.\" After a short nap, I came down to catch the bus to the MGM. Only to find out that it only left every hour, not every half hour as I understood from the website. I left the room at 12:30pm the next day and the cleaning person asked if I wanted my room made up. I thought it was strange that she asked that question. When I returned late that night, I realized that my trash had not been removed. The next day I left about the same time or maybe 12:45pm. I took the do not disturb sign off my door before leaving. When I returned about 9:30pm, I discovered my room had not been cleaned at all. When I called the front desk, all they could do was to send up more towels as there was no cleaning staff. The next morning when I was checking out, I told the manager I was displeased and would like some compensation. She said because I pre-booked she could not do anything. Never apologized for the problems I experienced. I asked if she could remove my tab from the bar...less than $20. She said she would ask the other manager. He said he would research to see if anyone had come into my room and either call or email me. I was insulted! It seemed like they thought I was lying or something.

This DoubleTree Surprise Was Good!\u201d", "Author": "Lifetraveler1", "ReviewID": "UR123050040", "Content": "Spent three nights at Sam's Town Gambling Hall and Hotel, while attending 2012 CES convention. However, when I wanted to add a fourth night (this Friday), the nightly rate doubled. So I hopped on priceline and this Doubletree accepted my bid of about $50 for the one night. With taxes I saved about 30% off the rate of the other hotel. Location: This Doubletree hotel is located very close to Las Vegas International Airport, in fact it is pretty much across the expressway (I-215) from the airport in what looks like a low-rise office complex. It is convenient because I have a rental car and the facility to return the car is about 5 blocks away from the hotel. Its proximity to the airport does allow you to hear aircraft taking off once in awhile. However, the noise is not loud and intrusive. There are no restaurants close by, but there is a Starbucks about one block away. To get to the Las Vegas strip there is a shuttle that will drop you off at the MGM Grand once an hour. It also will take you to the airport. The Building: The grounds are fine, but this is a desert town, so there is not a lot of foliage. However, the building itself looks relatively new and the parking lot is well lit. The lobby is bright and inviting and the staff is very courteous and they offer you a warm cookie (it's a DoubleTree thing). The Hallway: It appears to be well maintained and it is very well lit. The rooms use the key card type for access. When I first tried to access the room, my key card didn't work. The front desk personnel apologized, reconfigured the card and was going to send an engineer up to make sure that there was no problem. The new card worked fine. The Room: It is very long with a little foyer on the other side of the bathroom. You could easily accommodate a family of four in here without feeling too squeezed. That assumes that you get a roll-out type bed for the kids. The walls are a gold/tan combination with white ceilings. The carpet is some squiggly pattern with gold/beige as the dominant color. The furnishing look pretty good, only the business table looks a little scuffed up. The multi-colored earth tone curtains match the mirror and compliment the rest of the room. There is an LCD TV, four lamps, a refrigerator and a safe (yeah baby). So if you had an extended stay, you could get a few grocery items to keep your cost down. The Beds: The coverings on the bed are kind of just one plain light mocha color. However, I welcome the fact that this bed actually has a spread on it. Why? Because it gives it more weight with the blanket and sheet. I sleep better when I have more weight on me. As far as the comfort level of the mattress, I would give it a 7 out of 10. The Bathroom: Well, it is really is not that big. Just one person at a time will do. There is only one sink in the bathroom. Issues: The only one I have found is that there is a faint stain on the bedspread on the other bed. It is quiet here, but that also means you are isolated from the activities of the strip. So you will need a car, if you want true flexibility out here. Other than that I really don't have anything to fuss about. For the money I paid and the high quality room that I got, it was a nice surprise. Other Item: I've been to Vegas many times, but I wanted to see something new. So I drove on to Red Rock Canyon. The views are breathtaking and the sky is clear blue, try it! On the way back I saw a casino that looked brand new. It was Red Rock Casino. Try that too. For they had the, 'Feast Buffet'. It was priced like the buffets from years ago ($5, $8 and $14), yet the food quality was better than some of the good ones on the strip that charge ($15, $12 and $30).

Found the deal to be a good value, considering I didn't want to stay on the strip. At the time, I didn't consider the logistics of getting back into town for the race - and later learned that on-strip hotels had similar offers - but I was locked in, so I went through with my plans. I'd mistakenly booked a King room, and wanted a double Queen instead, which was generously accommodated upon my arrival. I'd been expecting a few of my marathon teammates to join me in my stay, so needed the extra bed. Immediately upon walking into the room, I was greeted with a sour, mildewy odor that I couldn't put my finger on. I thought maybe the bathroom had been wiped down with a musty towel, but upon taking my first shower realized the smell was coming from the shower curtain. It was soon changed upon request and the odor went away. When readying for bed the first night, I looked down at the carpet between the two beds (in front of the shared nightstand) and saw a huge pinkish stain on the carpet. It looked like fruit juice or something, but it was disturbing just the same. To be safe, I called down to the desk to report it. I didn't want to be charged for something that was present when I checked in. My bed and accommodations were mostly comfortable, but I found the hotel to be dated a bit and greatly in need of some TLC. Things like cleaning the grout between tiles in the bath/shower, cleaning/repairing stained or frayed carpets (as others have mentioned), etc. Most of these are minor things, but they all add up. One odd thing that happened during my stay was finding a six-pack of beer (with one empty bottle) at my door one morning. Not sure I can fault the hotel for this, but for the life of me I could not figure out how it got there since I didn't know anyone else staying there, and it wasn't something I had ordered / asked for. I chalked up it to a fluke / perhaps a drunken mistake by another guest, but it was still kind of odd. All in all a decent hotel with room for improvement and need for attention to details.

Extravagant hotels can have an indifference when it comes to your room, cleanliness and service. Casino properties may be convenient but the noise and stress can become a pain. Also, there's limited \"real world\" shopping along the strip. The Doubletree near the airport is one of those beacons away from the cacophony of the strip. Yes, it's an older property and clearly not perfect. The tradeoff is that it's a non-gaming property not that far from the strip if you have a car and far enough away if you want nothing to do with what happens on the strip. Checking in was painless, friendly and nonharried. The room was basically clean with a laptop safe. The warm cookies at the front desk was a welcome touch.

I found myself sometimes having to run the thermostat up 5 or 6 degrees to turn the A/C off and get the HVAC unit to clunk over to heating mode. The one feature I liked was that one could have the fan running continuously (auto-mode override on the wall thermo) on either low or high speed, which I appreciated for white noise. I heard very little noise, though; mainly just the normal thumps and bumps of hardworking maids in the morning (which the fan mostly filtered out). I liked the DCH's location; it's a 2- or 3-minute drive from the rental-car center and airport. With the nearest 1-15 North exit closed, the hotel's proximity to Las Vegas Blvd/Strip was a bonus. As with most of Vegas's chain 3-stars, the DCH is on a quiet street (Pollock) just off a major road (Warm Springs). Parking is plentiful and right in front on the hotel. Check-in was a breeze, as was check-out (which I did from my room's new-looking LG LCD TV). I also appreciated the DCH's provision of complimentary internet service (not very fast/limited to 750 Kbps but reliable and fine for ordinary surfing and e-mail) and very good Wolfgang Puck coffee -- with little real half-and-half creamers, as opposed to the cheap powdered nondairy creamer that too many hotels provide. And the warm chocolate-chip-and-nut cookie at check-in was very tasty. Little things, but they do make a difference. I'd stay here again; it's a good value (excellent at the rate I paid).

I also made notice on the way to my room of a pen that had fallen and lay on the floor, and then a plastic strip on the floor next to my door. I kept seeing these literally each day as I came and went. Finally, on Thursday I mentioned it to the front desk manager. I asked whether he read Trip Advisor reviews, as someone also had mentioned the stained carpets. He attributed it to the once-pretty new carpeting that he knew would show stains. I retorted that if you take care of stains promptly, and also vacuum every day, the dirt wouldn't get ground in and look crappy. He then told me that although he was writing down what I told him I saw on the floor (pen and plastic), he didn't want to report it to the Housekeeping Manager, as he kind of wanted to see how long it would take before she would notice and correct it on her own! What sense does that make? I will also state that their Eco policy says that they will only change your linens every 3 days unless you request it sooner. I checked in on a Sunday, and they didn't change my sheets until Thursday, after I had slept on them for 4 nights. I spoke with the Front Desk manager again before I checked out on Friday. I told him specifically where on the 4th floor hallway the pen had been lying since Sunday. He jotted it down, and did say he was embarrassed, but did he do anything about it?

Next morning i visited so many other casinos on the strip as the strip is very flashy and upscale, the service was terrible and people dont treat you or appreciate your business, you are made to feel like \" you should be appreciative to be in their presence\" . We watched a show on the strip, at night i went to Old Downtown Vegas, saw the light show on freemont street, casinos had a very low limit, from 1 dollar - 5 thousand dollars, now this is what i call gambling when you can gamble as much as you want and as low as you want, really gives you an advantage when to bet more on one hand and lower when you are losing, waitresses were super nice, if you tip them good, they will bring you drinks and keep on checking on you every 5 minutes. They are not as lavish and fancy as the strip but service is impeccable and slot especially are loosest that you can find in Las Vegas. I ended up winning really good money and recieved really good service. Next morning, we were dropped by the hotel shuttle service to MGM Grand at 10am in the morning, our return flight to Dallas was at 6pm so we had plenty of time to roam around and see more of Vegas, The shuttle driver held our bags at the back of the front desk, dropped us on the stripped and picked us back again around 5pm infront of MGM with our bags and dropped us off at the airport - THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE!!!

One word of warning though - ask for a room overlooking the pool - rooms overlooking the otherside look out onto the freeway and the airport and you can hear cars and planes even through the doubleglazing. On check-out we asked to leave a suitcase with them for 7 nights (shopping from the outlet mail) and they obliged us. There is a courtesy bus to both the airport and the MGM Grand so this makes getting around easy. Within 100 yards there is an Applebees. Arriving back after 7 days our suitcase was waiting and we zipped into anothe great room. The hotel seemed to be in the process of some minor remodelling and this was extremely impressive. We arrived at around midnight and there were some workers ripping up the carpets in the lobby and around the public areas. Getting up for breakfast, the new carpets were in place.

After booking a King Non Smoking room using HHonors points (my wife is a Gold level member and I am platinum). We were using her points here, so the room was in her name. We arrived to the hotel at 11:45 am and were told that there were no rooms ready to check into. The desk staff seemed nice enough and assured us that our King non smoking room would be saved for us when we returned. After returning back to the hotel (12:30 AM) we were given a double bed room with an unbelievably loud a/c unit. My wife went back down to the desk and was told that we did not check in early enough to get a King bed. Based on this excuse, I guess that they did not have any King rooms all day. They also said that there was nothing that they could do about it. I asked to have the general manager called and was told that they could not do that. The following morning we checked out and asked for the shuttle. After having expereinced such awful service the night before (with a very poor attitude from the desk staff) we asked the shuttle driver to drop us off at Mandalay Bay instead of the the MGM Grand (the two hotels are only 1 block apart). The driver told us (by the way there were only 2 couples on the van) that he could not drive the extra block. This was the final straw. The bottom line here is that the staff really doesn't care about its guests and the rooms are awful. My advice is to AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE!

Secondly, I'm a travel agent, so I'm critical of properties and compare them to their value for the money. First, you get in the slowest elevator ever with markings and scratches everywhere (very old). Then we get to the room where the A/C sounded like a jet engine with lots of gurgling. The furniture was worn, chipped and the room was very dark and dreary. The bathroom was very old; blood streak on the wall by the sink, mold around all the caulking in the tub. The toilet had these silver markings all over the porcelain from someone using a wire scrub brush, rusted out sink fixtures. Oh.. so I thought, I can deal with this. I've stayed in worn out places before and all I really care about is the Hilton Serenity bed which it had, but as I went to wash my face with the washrag I noticed it was yellowed and very old with stains. At this point the A/C quits and it's getting very hot. So I call down to ask if someone could show me how it worked and I got a guy who didn't seem concerned and said he'd send security up right away. A half hour later, no help. It's now 86 degrees in the room. I walk downstairs to find the rude guy totally ignore me. The girl who checked me in was going to come up to my room with me but then sent another girl instead. I politely asked to speak with the check-in girl to the side so I could approach her about the nasty towels in the room, as I didn't want to embaress her in front of the line of customers already there. She ignored my request. The other girl takes me up to the room via a service elevator to get me new towels. She took me through the maids quarters! I didn't think that very professional at all. Plus she said nothing regarding the dirty towels in my room already. No way are these HILTON standards! I am only part of their program because of their higher standards and I know what to expect at most of their properties. Needless to say, I called Hilton the next morning and they moved me to the Embassy Suites and refunded my points that I already used. We did receive an e-mail from the front desk manager at the other hotel, but unless they improve their professionalism and get new front desk staff, I won't EVER stay here again.

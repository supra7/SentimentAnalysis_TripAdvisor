Great view from the room and my best part was eating breakfast on the balcony watching the world wake up on the beach below, priceless. Room was clean, it looked like it had recently been renovated and a great job had been done. One point though, this is not a hotel. They are all privately owned units and so there are no staff to assist. Dealt with the owner direct. Very pleasant and simple process. We had contact details for a local management company if we needed them but we didn't. For the price we paid, this was value for money and that view will be with me for a long time.

We were a bit scared. The outside of the building was not very attractive, but we decided to give it a go anyway. We get into the elevators and couldn't stop laughing because it seemed to be getting worse. The hallways were a bit dingy too. Then we got into our oceanfront room, and we were like, OK we can do this. By the time the weekend was over, we didn't want to leave! Let me explain why...first just so you know, all the units are privately owned \"condos\" so some are managed by the owners (that is who we dealt with, NOT the front desk) and some are managed by the management staff (if that makes sense). But either way, some units are taken care of more than others because of the owners. Also, it is on the beach, in Florida. Humidity + Salt = not so perfect carpet, furniture, paint, etc. I experience the same thing in Hawaii. I'm sure if you picked a part the rooms in some of the other hotels you would see some rust, etc. Another thing, and this was something I had to get over myself, you go to the beach to enjoy the BEACH, NOT YOUR ROOM! I know, I know, you want it to be nice, I get that, but in all honesty, we were in our room to sleep and snack and refresh our drinks. The beds weren't bad, it slept 4 just fine. The balcony and view was absolutely amazing. It's like the sunrise is dead center right in front of you. It was perfect. The pool is a decent size, and because it's a smaller hotel, it's not so packed. Everyone was friendly too. Probably because there are more down to earth kind of people staying there. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE my Resort/Spa hotels and there is no comparison to the quality, but for a total cost $140.62 for all day Friday, Saturday and Sunday, you just can not beat the price. You can't get a room per night at that rate at the Hilton next door, and I can't wrap my head around spending triple or quadruple that price just for a better room. Not when I'm there for the BEACH. If I was going for a longer stay somewhere, where I did plan on spending some time relaxing in the room, no, this would not be the place to go because the rooms just aren't that fabulous. But again, who freakin' cares when you're at the beach? You're on vacation. You just have to make the best of it, especially in these times when money is tighter, I don't care who you are. The place is in a great location, you can walk to a lot of the restaurants and shops, the pool is clean and a decent size, and it doesn't matter if your staying in a 5 star hotel or not, doesn't change the experience of a gorgeous Florida sunrise. So if you want to get away for a short weekend with the girls, or your honey, this really isn't a bad place to go. Just get passed the front entrance, and the elevators and into your room and check out the beautiful view of the ocean, and you'll forget your not in a glamorous resort and spa! PS. Get an oceanfront room!

I now live in Rochester, Minnesota were the average temperature this time of year is 32 degrees, need I say more.. I wanted to get away for an extended weekend for some low maintenance \"RR\". So I booked this hotel but was groaning after I read the travel advisory... expecting the worst. But I got what I expected and was Very Satisfied... for these reasons: This time of year the crowds are pleasantly non-existant I didn't travel with small children which always makes vacationing a bit high maintenance all be it enjoyable. The room # 618 was a bargain at 53.00 per night (3 nights) for 2 adults. It was clean but no frills. The room itself was an extended double bed kitchenette style room-perfect for 2 ladies on vacation. But certainly not suite size for small children. It was clean and orderly-No bugs or odors to be found. However the cleaning staff only changed towels daily. No bed change or vacuum.. but hey I don't do that everyday at home either. I would have been more obliged to tip the staff had those things been done. The location of the hotel \"right on the beach\" is the best. If you wanted something quick to eat for breakfast or lunch the hotel had \"mimi's cafe\" which served easy breakfast or lunch with specials at 3.00 per meal and nothing that exceeded 5.00 was a steal. The dishes were simple and yummy what I would expect at home. Things that will make your stay comfortable: Off season: lots of city construction and building maintenance going on. I always travel with ear plugs and an extra blanket. For this trip these were life savers. Our room cornered the busy street and beachview. There was no hotel hall noise but the street was pretty busy (earplugs work great for restful nights). For some reason the rooms had no blankets, I typically bring my own with me so that wasn't a problem either. Pool side was noisey because the hotel was redoing the balconies, strange seeing the ocean but not being able to hear it. Fix: rent the lawn chairs and umbrella rentals on the beach (already set up by rental company literally two steps from the pool) at 20.00 all day it's worth every penny.

The bed was riduclulously hard, and my back is STILL hurting from it. As far as the staff was concerned... friendly isn't the word, rude is more like what I was thinking. I asked for some towels and the guy rudely asked how many and I said \"four please\" then he said said I'll give you only two\".

When we checked in, we were sent to an excellent room, albeit on the side of the hotel, overlooking the construction of another tall hotel. But as it was for only 1 night, we knew that it wouldn't be a problem. After dropping off our bags, we went to explore the hotel & surrounding, & to find somewhere for dinner. At first, we saw a bar in the hotel lobby, so thought great for a beer later. Unfortunately, this was not the case as it wasn't opened. Little did I know it at the time of booking, but we were out of season, so the hotel didn't have the bar open. And in general the beach area was very quiet. We went out & found the only place within walking distance to eat at, Steve's Diner. It was great. The waiter took care of us 'English' & we left with full stomachs. If you are staying out of season, we were told to stay on the main land, rather than the beach as there would have been more to do. Overall, the hotel was average, but very reasonably priced for the 75 dollars we paid for the night. One tip - forget the complimentary breakfast, go eat elsewhere! We had a box with a muffin, orange & a few other items that a lot of people just threw into the bin!!

The first room we went to had dirty beds (that's right, the sheets had not even been changed!). We asked to change rooms and the next one initially appeared fine. There was an amonia stench which I contributed to some type of cleaning product and figured it would soon dissapate so we moved our luggage to our new room.

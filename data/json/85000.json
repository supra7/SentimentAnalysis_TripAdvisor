Don't bother coming back until 3. Yes, I asked if earlier was going to be possible. Silly me. We had shopping to do and had a rental car, so killed 2 hours. we returned to the hotel to find we were the only people waiting at the front desk when we walked in. Perfect! Or so you'd think. Despite the fact that there were 4 desk staff present, we waited for a conversation to be completed before we were helped. And even then, one at a time. It is possible they could have been less helpful, but how much remains to be seen. Rooms assigned after my friend was told his room was not ready. A quick check said otherwise. Into the room by 3:30. The elevator stunk. The floor stunk on opening. And the room stinks too. I suspect it is not a result of not being clean, but rather the musty smell of old air conditioning. Opening the door confirms the furniture and decor is c. 1960's and it smells like it. It's pretty grungy with torn wallpaper, wood chips missing from the door surface, old unlatched holes in the walls, etc. But it does appear that the people who work here try to keep it clean to the best of their ability. It's harder to keep an old property clean than it is to do so with new stuff. A single facecloth and single hand towel greet us in the bathroom. We will call for another of each. The lights work, the TV works, and we didn't pay a lot for a location close to the airport. So if that's a tradeoff for you, it may be okay. There are amenities close by such as Denny's, IHOP, Pizza Hut, etc. within walking distance. No pool here. Apparently you have to walk across the street to a sister property if you want to use one.

My story began from my driving from Key West to Miami at night. I wasn't able to find the hotel although I did a research on its location before I started my trip. The distances between the blocks were far greater than they appeared on the map near Miami Airport. Since the hotel was said to be within close proximity to the airport, I ended up getting lost at a cargo area in the airport in the middle of the night. I called the hotel to get directions. The front-desk spoke with a heavy accent so I didn't understand what he was talking about. He put me on hold forever, and never got back to me. I ended up driving back and forth around Miami Airport, feeling entirely exhausted and frustrated. I called 911. Police asked me to wait in the Sheraton Hotel so that they would send someone to help me. But no police officer showed up in almost an hour. So I asked a cab driver to guide me to the hotel, and of course, paid for his service! It was already 1 AM by the time I got to the hotel. To my surprise, there was a big crowd partying in the lobby, and there were smokers. When I got to my room, I was also surpised to hear someone peeing in my room - It turned out there was only a door separating my room from the bathroom next door. There must have been a big family staying in that room because someone would pee every once in a while. That kept me awake and it was so uncomfortable to hear strangers pee. I thought this was due to my very late check-in time because all decent rooms must have been taken and this room probably was the unwanted one left just for me. At 2-3 AM, I heard men and women talking in a room across the hallway, and it didn't stop. The wall insulation was so poor that I could hear everything they said. I called front-desk at about 3 AM to request switching a room. They told me all the rooms were booked for the night. The only thing they could do was to send a security guard up to my floor to intervene. So I got dressed for the security guard to show up. I was completedly exhausted. But the guard never showed up. But miraculously, the noise of human voice from across the hallway stopped after I made the phone call to the front desk. Then I realized that they had heard me because of the poor wall insulation. I went to sleep at about 4 AM and got up at 7 AM for my return flight home. From everything I saw and heard the night before, I imagined the people stayed at the hotel were red-eyed monsters and couldn't wait to check them out out of curiosity. To my surprise,they looked like normal people when I saw them in the breakfast area the next morning. What happened at night felt like a bad dream! BTW, I talked to the front-desk on the morning about why people talked at 2 - 3 AM. I was told that these people had travelled to US from foreign countries in a different time zone.

The next room at least had the ceiling in tact and I managed to lessen the mildew odor by turning off the air conditioning. The bathroom was not in great condition which I could overlook, but it was also dirty. The restaurant/bar is also very dark and dirty.

One elevator was broken and from the looks of the inside of the thing it had been broken for probably 4 or 5 years. The second elevator was very slow made strange noises and you thought you were going to end up falling down the shaft. Fire exits were another issue. While the fire exits are on the outside of the building the fire hoses were gone the fire extinguishers were the size of the small ones you would have in your kitchen. Emergency lighting was non existent and the hotel tried to fix this by using large flashlights but they were missing the big battery and the light bulb!! This place was definitely NOT up to code. The rooms were clean enough, our room was huge and had been re-done however they hadn't done a good job of it. The whole place smelled kind of moldy and they had portable dehumidifiers in the halls but it didn't help Checking in and out were a nightmare due to the language issues. Lets just say English was not their first language. I would guess most of the employees didn't even speak English. We will never stay here again!

On the positive side, there is free Wi-Fi if you have a laptop, a gift shop/newstand on property, and free breakfast with limited selections. Within walking distance is an IHOP, otherwise this a relatively airport industrial area that does not lend itself to strolls. My air conditioning and TV worked fair, but there was only one phone near the bed, not on the desk, nor did the cord reach. I was here for business and in order to work on my laptop and be on the phone, it had to be done in bed. Staff are pleasant, and there's a nice international feel to the place, lots of Latin American and African pilots here for training and plenty of Philippine sailors.

The rooms were clean, no stains on our carpet, no hairs on the sheets , the non smoking room didnt smell like smoke. The bathroom however could have been much better. I didnt want to walk on the bathroom floor barefoot. Also, the bathtub didnt look clean, but it could have just been old, but as a result I washed my baby up (bird bath) instead of sitting her in the tub for her normal bath. The hotel did seem to be doing some painting and other remodeling so it seems they are trying to improve on some things. Overall,this is one of the better looking hotels we have stayed at in Miami. Now, the questionable part was that we had a problem with another guest looking for something in OUR room. He stated he had something in our room and was constantly knocking at our door looking for whatever he thought was in our room. There werent any personal belongings of anyone elses in the room when we got there. He failed to realize this because like i said he came to our room several times asking about various things. Then, 6am the morning we were to check out he came banging on our door to verify what city we were from. I say verify because he said the city name. The only way he could have known that is if one of the hotel staff told him. We didnt wear, say or have anything with our city name on it. The manager of the front desk tried to asure us that no personal info was given out by her staff because its against their \"privacy policy\". Well, to that I say, it's against the law to rob a bank but people still do it.

I chose this hotel because I had some Choice Privileges points to use, so the stay was free. We waited for the airport shuttle for about 15 minutes - the airport shares it's shuttle with the Holiday Inn, so both names are written on the side. The ride from the airport to the hotel was only about 10 minutes. We arrived at the hotel around 10 AM, and our room wasn't ready yet which we expected since since check-in wasn't until 3 PM. We asked if it was possible to use the pool while we waited for our room to be ready, and the front desk staff was very accomodating. They gave us towels, and we changed into our bathing suits in the bathrooms located in the lobby area. The concierge took our bags as well so that we didn't have to carry them to the pool with us. Another bonus was that because we arrived before the continental breakfast buffet ended, the front desk staff said that we could partake in that. Although we had eaten breakfast on the plane we were still hungry, and were happy to eat for free again! The breakfast bar consisted of cereal, muffins, bagels, yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, juices, milk and coffee. It was adequate and exactly what I expected of a Comfort Inn. After eating we ventured over to the pool. The pool is actually at the Sleep Inn across the street which is a little strange, but the street isn't a busy one, so it wasn't a big deal. The pool was of a decent size and it was clean and not crowded at all. We stayed at the pool for a couple hours and went back to the hotel around 1 PM to see if our room was ready, and it was. Our room was pretty large. We had a room with one king sized bed and it was spacious. The amenities in the room were typical of a Comfort Inn. We brought our laptop computer with us and used the free wireless internet in the room which was nice. We decided to venture to South Beach that afternoon. We had been to Miami a few times before and knew our way around, but we decided just to take the bus instead of renting a car. There is a bus that runs right by the hotel. We had to transfer, and it took us almost an hour to get to South Beach - probably not worth it in the long run, but we were trying to save some money. It was harder to get back to the hotel in the evening because the last bus heading past the hotel leaves South Beach around midnight. We ended up taking a bus to the airport around 2 AM and calling the hotel airport shuttle to pick us up. Our check out was quick and easy, and breakfast the second day was just as it was the first day. The shuttles leave appox. every half hour to the airport, so we had no problem making our flight. I would stay here again if I had a layover, but I would not choose this hotel as a vacation hotel since it's too far away from the things that I enjoy.

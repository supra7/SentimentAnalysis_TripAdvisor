After coming to San Diego for seven years and always staying at the same few hotels closest to my work I was a bit concerned to be shipped out to a Ramada Inn. Much to my surprise it was way better than the other Comfort Inn and Suites I had been staying in. It has this incredible charm to it that made me feel like I was at a ski resort. The Suites in this hotel were very spacious. Huge might be a word I would use. Frankly you could fit four roll away beds in there if you needed too! There was free breakfast ( not pastries and bagels, but an omelet bar, waffles, fruit...the works!) and free happy hour too! The staff was excellent and the hotel is centrally located.

The owners and management have preserved this property well, changing little of its mid-century modern architecture, while tastefully updating the guest rooms. In fact, the most striking difference from the photos is the guest composition -- a wee bit more diverse in 2011 than 50 years prior! I enjoyed the central courtyard with a pool large by today's standard (8.5 feet deep) and found the breakfast restaurant a welcome change from the normal continental breakfast lobby. As others have pointed out, breakfast is not \"free\" here; instead, $6.95 will win you an omelet prepared as you wish along with fresh fruit, bacon, hash browns, juice, and a decent selection of cereals and cold items. Best of all, there is no lack of seating or a room full of bleary-eyed guests in night shirts and sweats.

We were on a golf trip with three guys pushing 60 and wanted to hotel with a hot tub to relax sore backs/etc. We would not have booked it had we known the hot tub wouldn't be in service as the hotel was further away from where we wanted to be. When I asked the front desk if we could be compensated in any way (I suggested more free drinks at the bar) they told me there was nothing they could do. We had prepaid for the room and they did offer to refund our money if we wished to go elsewhere. Second, our assigned rooms were facing the freeway. There is a lot of freeway noise in these rooms. Ask for rooms facing away from the freeway if you are a light sleeper. Noise doesn't bother me, but two guys with us had trouble sleeping.

The pool looked beautiful too but was too cold for us to go swimming. We didn't try the onsite Proud Mary's the prices were a bit steep for out budget since I had the kids with me and they don't always eat all their food. I did have to call because we hadn't gotten the microwave I requested when we checked in. They brought it within 5 minutes of my call.

We originally used Travelocity to find affordable hotels in the area, and found this Ramada at the perfect midpoint between our destinations at $65/night. Excellent price and the reviews were generally favorable. I went directly to the hotel's website and booked there to avoid agency fees. This was painless and it was the same reasonable price. Getting to the hotel was very easy. Parking is acceptable and apparently very safe. The front desk people were efficient and functionally friendly, which is precisely how I like it. I am not real fond of overly talkative front desk people. Courtesy and efficiency are my two requirements, and this hotel had them. The hotel's layout is one of an older property built in the 70's, having a \"garden style\" layout. It was kind of nice to have a walkway near a lawn and lots of greenery. We were at first worried because we were given a first floor room right next to the housekeeping laundry room! Fortunately that was never a problem and noises from that place were minimal. The room was reasonably spacious and the furnishings didn't look as old as the hotel itself. First quirk was there was no switch near the entrance to turn on a light! The king sized bed was a pillowtop, though my side of it had a slight mattress sag in it, but not enough to be upset about. Pillows were very nice and more supportive than your typical one. The work desk was a joke. It had a huge office chair that was nearly larger than this desk itself! Just looked odd. The TV cabinet was also on the small side. There was a BIG sliding door closet with mirrored doors which you'd expect to see in a home, not a hotel. The bathroom was amusing. The toilet area had its own alcove, as did the shower, with the sink in the entrance area. We were making jokes about finding a minotaur in this maze! The worse part of this room was the shower. It was a standup shower with no tub. First, the shower area was a bit small for me, second, the showerhead had very little pressure and set low so tall people like myself would have to kneel to get water on your head. Showering was bordering on annoying because of these two things! My much smaller girlfriend said she had no problem.. so this is not a room for tall people! (I'm only 6' 1\") Generally.. the hotel was VERY quiet, one of the quietests ones I've ever stayed in, and that was fantastic! There were plenty of other guests, so the solitude wasn't because of the place being empty. Be careful and wary of hotel taxes and fees tacked on to your bill when you book the place. Get your final price before reserving. My bill was about $8/night higher because I had *thought* the $65/night included these taxes. Read the small print. Overall, I'm pleased with the experience for the price I paid, though I would seriously shop around next time I'm in the area. The poor water pressure and cramped shower stall would have me looking at other properties first, but I wouldn't avoid this place if they had the best deal going.", "Date": "November 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "brisbane", "Title": "\u201cMAGNIFICENT A MUST STAY\u201d", "Author": "willywallywish", "ReviewID": "UR19727229", "Content": "My family and I have been travelling the States and Canada for 6 weeks and staying at 2-5 class hotels.

It's nice because it has a large king bed with a sofa sitting area. It has a small kitcknette with just a sink and a counter area. They also have a deluxe suite which you can usually find through hotels.com . The nice thing about the deluxe suite is the room is really large. It has a sitting area, and although the its a studio suite and everything is in the same room its very spacious. The kitchen in this room is very nice because it has to range burners.

We all are certainly aware of hotels having your card info and, upon checkout, reconciling your bill and if there are extra charges, they are put on your bill. But to take your $50 upfront for no reason is absurd. They will tell you that there is some fine print somewhere that warned you that \"other charges might apply.\" And to that I say: CROOKED. Keeping your money and earning interest on it at a rate of $50 PER RESERVATION, you can only imagine how much money they make on that alone. I refused to stay there and insisted my reservation be cancelled through hotels.com and that I have the charge backed off my card for my reservation and was told by the agent, who is in India, they would cancel but it would take approximately 30 days to get my money back for my reservation.

The guy was nice and friendly. We get to our room, and everything changed. The room smells awful. It smells like a combo of old stale smoke and paint. Our room looks nothing like the pictures. The furniture is not the same, it's a tiny chest at the foot of the bed with drawers, and then the tv is on a small end table looking thing. Certainly not the amoire shown in the pic. I go in the bathroom and there's not a bathtub (even thought the pics on the website show a bathtub) So I call the front desk. There are limited amounts of rooms with bathtubs and those were gone. So instead, we have this tiny shower in a corner that was dirty. So then we go to the spa. That was the only area that was the same as the pics. The pool was freezing cold so we skipped that but the spa was nice and clean. The jets don't work very well, but after a long day of walking around the zoo, just sitting in the hot water felt nice. That area is also very well kept, and nice looking. Then we tried to go to sleep, but the jets flying all night made that difficult.

When we got in the room, it smelled like smoke but we did not see an ashtray. Since we were advised that this was a smoking room, and we were so exhausted when we arrived, we figured that the maid had not left one on accident. We just used an ashtray that we had bought as a souvenier. The rooms were older and need to be updated and we had trouble with the toilet stopping up the entire time we were there. They sent maintenance a few times to plunge the toilet and the maintenance man saw us smoking and didn't say anything to us as did the maid.

But, our two night stay at the beginning of August went smoothly. Access from freeway was convenient. My two children and I were assigned a 1st floor room of the \"Executive Wing\" facing Kearny Mesa Rd. It was clean and comfortable, and pretty quiet, except for the occasional loud bang from slamming doors from neighboring rooms. The room rate for our group included a simple breakfast buffet both mornings which was okay. Both the coin laundry facilities and pool appeared to be heavily used from the time they were open in the morning until the time they were locked for the night. All staff I encountered, from front desk to maintenance to housekeeping, were polite, cheerful and helpful. Although it won't be my first choice, I will consider staying here again if another sporting event brings us to this part of San Diego.", "Date": "August 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denmark", "Title": "\u201cFind another hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Henrik22", "ReviewID": "UR5602910", "Content": "What an odd place this is! We (2 adults and 2 teenagers) had booked and paid our room in advance, got to the hotel, checked in and got a key to a room ... only to find out that the room was already occupied by someone else!!!! We went back to the reception and had to wait the longest time while the totally uncommitted staff looked for another room for us - and finally we were offered an \"upgrade\" to a suite. This meant that we needed two extra beds in the room because it only had one double bed ... and we got the lousiest extra beds with totally worn out mattresses, and then the people in the reception wanted us to pay for one of the extra beds! What an \"upgrade\" to be offered by the staff. Of course we protested and finally managed not to have to pay any more for the needed four beds we had already paid for. Aside from the not very helpful staff (if you go here, ask for Michael in the reception - he was the only truly helpful and nice person at the hotel, but unfortunately he wasn't there when we checked in), the air-condition was incredibly loud and excess water from it was running all over the place outside the room, the clientele at the hotel consists mostly of business people and truck drivers needing an overnight stay (on the positive side this meant that we had the pool almost to ourselves at all times ...), and the hotel's location is just not very good - you're simply too far away from everything San Diego has to offer, even when you have a car (which is necessary in this area). If this hotel wants to have a future, the staff surely needs to put on a more accomodating attitude so you actually feel welcome when showing up ... and some needed improvements as to the beds and the air condition would help a lot too. But my best recommendation is: Find somewhere else to stay, it's just not worth it to stay at this place.", "Date": "August 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winters, CA", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for!\u201d", "Author": "lfcreamer", "ReviewID": "UR5578991", "Content": "Old motel in need of remodeling.

All I really wanted to do was sleep. My first interruption came at 10:30pm when someone was pounding loudly on my door - being by myself (and a female), I looked discretely out the window and saw a taxi cab waiting outside my room. I did not open the door, but the cab was outside for about 15 minutes and I couldn't fall back asleep until I was sure it had left. At 1:30am, I was awakened by the sound of people talking loudly and walking back and forth on the upstairs walkway - the walls are very thin in these rooms. Then, at 2:30am, the phone rang (very loudly), but no one was there. Again, I couldn't immediately fall asleep. I had to get up at 5:00am and was tired from all the disruptions. The room descriptions given by others are accurate - the room is small with thin walls, the carpet is very worn, the shower is super tiny.

That's the #1 thing I check for each time I stay somewhere. In our 2 queen, one was newer and too firm, and the other was worn out and sagging. When I find a place with great beds, I never go anywhere else in that town. We will try somewhere else next time, but the deal was great at $71/night for 3 nights. It's cheaper, because its 5 miles north up the 163 from Hotel Circle. The staff was perfect. They resopnded to our every need. They offered to change our rooms to the newer ones, but we were settled in already. We asked for a microwave and got it (no chg). The grounds are very well kept (in a mom & pop sort-of-way). The older rooms (Building A, B, C, or D) are huge, and we chose them over the newer, smaller rooms in Building E with newer mattresses (only because we were already unpacked). Look out for this: A, B, C, D have only a 3x3 shower; while E has shower/bathtubs (same price). The walls in 240 were thin enough that my wife and I were given an awakening performance by our next door neighbors. We didn't use the pool, but it was heated and looked great. The summary: If your San Diego budget is below $100/night, this is a great pick. You need a car if you stay here, which is okay, it is still only 5 extra minutes to Sea World, Zoo, beaches, harbor, etc. This is a great ** (2 star), but a stretch at *** (3 star).", "Date": "October 3, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ramada Inn and Conference Center Qualcomm Stadium", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d83259-Reviews-Ramada_Inn_and_Conference_Center_Qualcomm_Stadium-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$67 - $206*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">5550 Kearny Mesa Rd</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92111</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "83259", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/bc/d5/bcd514d01bd7121fdb94f3b0449e06e15large.jpg"}}

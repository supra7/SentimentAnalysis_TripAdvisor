Whether that's because the room keys are actually shaped like keys, rather than swipe cards, or because the carpet in the lift changes every day to inform you what day of the week it is, or that the whole place is decorated like it's still the 19th century, I'm not sure, but it's a change. This can be both good and bad. Because the electrical supply to the room isn't controlled by putting a card in a slot, you have to go and turn lights on and off individually, and when I arrived the room was quite chilly because the heater wasn't on. But then why waste power unnecessarily heating a room when it's unoccupied? The lights aren't as bright as I'm accustommed to, but then you get free wifi, which is always a decent thing to have. Bathroom and shower are very good; bed also, although I was awed that there were so many pillows on it. There's an embarrassment of televisions: a huge flatscreen in the living room and another in the bedroom. Staff were all very friendly: the concierge was very helpful finding me a barber and you generally felt very at home. The area around the hotel felt a little bit scruffy to me, but as it's winter the streets are devoid of anyone, so there's nobody to encounter that might make you feel threatened. I suppose Seattle in January may not be the best time to walk around outside in the hope of encountering people.

The location is the only thing you sacrifice in this property but the rooms size (significant), free wifi and courtesy cars at your disposal a major plus compared to the peer group. We used the courtesy car 3 times and each times the driver was willing to give a little guided tour and insight. The only small negative is that the towels are over leaned and the odour of bleach on them needs getting used to but it is rare to say that the only downside was overcleaning!!

My husband had a surgical procedure at Swedish Hospital, about an 8 min walk from the hotel. In the mornings I would go to the Sugar Bakery (2 mins from the hotel!) on my way to the hospital...FABULOUS lattes, homemade pastries/scones/muffins and soup for lunch....incredible staff as well) I made the original booking over the phone and spoke to Trevor. I mention his name because he is amazing...always helpful, friendly, courteous, and very welcoming. We found all the staff, from the valet crew to the concierge to the front desk staff, the staff in the Lounge and the Hunt Club, to the few housekeeping staff I encountered, excellent, always greeting you with a hello and a smile on your way in or out. We were in Room 600, a JR suite and loved the room; clean, spacious, comfortable, nice bright bathroom, nice warm robes, big closet, and I really liked the desk where I used my laptop frequently. My husband's one night in the hospital became 2 and I felt safe and comfortable on my own in the room. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous and so we returned again the next week for 1 o/night. I would highly recommend this hotel. It is charming and has such great history and character. Beautiful high-back chairs in the lounge, nice warm atmosphere in the lobby and dining room. It was a bit of a stressful time under the circumstances (my husband's operation), but we felt very comfortable at the Sorrento and enjoyed our time there. We will definitely go back and hope to get room 600 again! Having eaten in the Hunt Club the first visit, which was good, we decided to try dining out on the 18th, as it happened it was Seattle Restaurant Week...so we ate at Osteria La Spiga and took the hotel 'town car' there and back. The concierge highly recommended it. It was excellent as well, authentic Italian food and excellent service. I did a lot of walking from the hotel and it is an easy 20-25 mins walk to downtown and a nice cardio hill climb back up from 1st to the Hotel on Madison!", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kennewick, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat two days @The Sorrento!\u201d", "Author": "Beck B", "ReviewID": "UR119716579", "Content": "The hotel staff were efficient and receptive.

My husband and I had a wonderful stay at this hotel last spring for our anniversary and wanted to be sure to tell you what an amazing time we had. My husband planned the entire thing without my knowledge so thank you the staff for helping him make it perfect for both of us! The hotel property itself is stunning and welcomes you immediately. We booked the \"shaken and stirred\" package which included a full breakfast in the Hunt Club restaurant (on-site) and in-room martinis. We highly recommend this package if it's still available. All I can say is WOW! Everything about our stay went perfectly from the valet greeting us all the way through our check-out and even included a call to our room a few minutes after arrival to ensure everything was perfect. They clearly understand what customer service means and they made us feel like nothing would be a problem if we asked. MARTINIS: We didn't know what to expect in the way of martini fixings in the room but we were pleasantly surprised. They supplied everything you need to make the martinis: martini glasses, lemon, zester, olives, toothpicks, shaker, ice and a nice bottle of SKY Vodka (enough for 2 drinks each). They also included a nice note to wish us a happy anniversary (nice touch). ROOM SVC: We really enjoyed our in room dining. The food was amazing and arrived sooner than expected since the hotel/restaurant were extremely busy that night. THE ROOM: The bed and linens were luxurious! You won't be ready to leave them in the morning...I promise :)! The bathroom was a little small - wished they would have had a soaking tub at least. We were in a standard room so they might have them in the suites...maybe next time :). We did not ask for an upgrade but somehow I think they would have done it if they had the availability at the time. BREAKFAST: The food in the Hunt Club was delicious and plentiful. My husband had the french toast (which could feed 3 people) and I had the quiche which also could feed 2-3 people. Our waitress was very helpful and very attentive (although not overly so). We have no hesitation about recommending this place for anyone who needs a little time away at an affordable price. You'll feel like you must have spent a fortune here when you leave because of the beauty of the property and the atmosphere you're in. However, you'll feel anything but poor when you leave this luxury hotel...truly refreshing! The service at this hotel once again gave me reason to believe that there are a few great hotels still out there that believe that \"hospitality\" really does mean being hospitable and accommodating to your guests. We never felt like an inconvenience to anyone and our money wasn't your first concern. Well done! It's been a difficult year for us (and lots of other folks) financially but if we can afford it we'll be back to celebrate again in February (maybe a suite this time). Thanks again for an amazing experience!", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Post Falls, Idaho", "Title": "\u201cAwesome & Awful!\u201d", "Author": "momto7", "ReviewID": "UR119369247", "Content": "This hotel is fantastic in so many ways. Check-in was a breeze as we were warmly welcomed. Upon inspecting our corner room, I saw that it was 2 double beds for our romantic getaway, which was not what I had planned. In a few minutes after calling the front desk, the clerk personally came up to accompany us to the same room 2 floors higher with a king bed--perfect! It was a suite but we have never seen such spacious hotel accommodations. The living room was huge & the bedroom oversized as well. The bathroom was tiny, but not a problem. We have a round window that opened from the shower & it was fun to open it a crack & watch the street below as I showered! However, the street below was a problem overnight because the Sorrento is 2 blocks from the Virginia Mason emergency room entrance where all the ambulances begin & end. I was awakened by sirens all night long, & this wasn't even over a weekend! That is the only negative aspect of our stay, but it's enough to keep me from going back. We ate in their restaurant which was outstanding. We frequently utilized their free shuttle service to the downtown area. It is also close enough to walk if you have the energy and time and aren't carrying a boatload of shopping bags. We did not need a car while we were there which meant we did not use the valet. The staff was outstanding in every encounter I had with them. The beds were great, the view isn't great, but the windows were large. And the interior of the hotel is just plain gorgeous. The coffee bar is very nice since we love French-pressed coffee & there is a small frig in the room as well. I only wish it was in a quieter location. I booked this stay through booking.com and was pleased to find that this did not affect how we were treated at all.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Omaha, Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cStaff is Absolutely Outstanding!\u201d", "Author": "daneone", "ReviewID": "UR119267232", "Content": "The Sorrento Hotel in Seattle is a lovely 100 year old hotel. My requested for early check-in was honored and I found Trevor the desk clerk to be extremely accommodating offering two rooms for us to actually view. Our room classification was a Jr. Suite and we choose room 600, a corner room, well appointed and comfortable. I greatly appreciate Trevor providing room options and allowed us to actually look at the rooms. Really, how often does that happen when you check in? Almost never in my experience. This is something that hotels use to do years ago, and I personally appreciate it. Bathroom space is often a valid concern with older hotels, I did not find that to be the case with this room; however I will note hot water was a bit of an issue only in the evening. It took about five to seven minutes before the bath water got hot, but once you are aware of this you can easily adjust. I appreciate the bathroom having a night light and the rooms providing comfortable robes, which always saves valuable luggage space. There is coffee and tea in the room with a French Press. After reading the instructions and two failed attempts of preparing coffee I requested a standard type of pour through coffee maker for the room which was immediately delivered. The hotel has a complementary car to bring you, and pick you up upon availability and request. We used this service three times during our stay. Our driver the first day was Lance, who was very friendly. All of our drivers were courteous and friendly. I met with Alex the hotel Concierge the first day and he took the time to sit down with me and review various tour options and places of interest. Alex was very helpful, and I truly appreciated the time he spent with me. We only had one meal at the hotel in the Hunt Club. Dining reviews are very subjective. With that said, I am sorry to say that I would not recommend the Hunt Club. I did not find my meal or my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to be what I would consider to be good, let alone outstanding. I would rate them as alright. The wait staff was excellent and attentive. The location of the hotel is in an area called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pill Hill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd you are up a very steep hill from the waterfront. You can walk to Pikes Market and downtown, utilize the hotel car or take a city bus, which is actually almost outside the hotel front door. We had absolutely no problem navigating Seattle from the Sorrento Hotel. There are some neighborhood dining options by the Sorrento. The Corner Caf\u00c3\u00a9 directly across the street, a bakery a few doors down from there. Across the street and down about two blocks towards the bay is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Georges Sausage & Delicatessen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this place is only open until 5:00 but I made sure we stopped the day we were flying home and purchased two wonderful deli sandwiches that were absolutely great, and extremely reasonably priced, this is worth the short walk. About two doors down from there the 1st Hill Bar & Grill is located, we had dinner and breakfast, both meals very good. This is a neighborhood restaurant; George the original owner is friendly, walks around and visits with customers. One evening we dined at the Metropolitan Grill, which is about 6 blocks from the hotel, we had an excellent meal. I only mention these dining options because I personally find it helpful when reading reviews of what fellow travelers have experienced in the area. Also, if you are down at Pikes Market, there are many options for fresh fruit, bakery items, wine, wonderful things to bring back to your room. Probably the only real disappointment I found with the Sorrento was my request to print our Southwest Boarding passes. Anyone who flies Southwest knows the game, bring up the site, enter your information, minimize your screen and click as absolute close to the departure time as possible. Unfortunately I received the standard excuse, they were busy and detained and I got B-28-29 passes which afforded me the very last aisle seat in the very last row of the plane. I am more than aware this can happen and took the chance this task would be a priority, it was not. I just want to be sure you are aware of this and if it is important to you, I strongly suggest you make other arrangements than having the hotel do this for you. I want to thank the staff at the Sorrento, everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. I specifically selected this hotel based on the comments posted on Trip Advisor. I also always book my reservations directly through the hotel. I would highly recommend the Sorrento to anyone considering it and I would definitely stay again.

I was told explicitly that I needn't worry and I couldn't book it ahead of time, I should call back a few minutes before needing it and there wouldn't be a problem. So the next day I called up half an hour before required to try and book the shuttle only to be told that it wouldn't be available for a few hours as the car along with many others was need for a very high value client activity. So my \u00c2\u00a3850 is for my stay wasn't important enough for one short journey. Up to that point The Sorrento would have featured on my list on a return to Seattle but I'm afraid that one \"small\" incident knocks them off my list.

The hotel offers a free car service to downtown, which is minutes away. There is also a good cafe/coffee shop just across the street for a good cup of Joe, sandwiches, salads, and breakfast items. My only complaint, and it's small, is that the music at the Fireside Room was too loud and really not appropriate for such a classy place.

Not at the the Sorrento... they care about their guests and are not into petty stupidity! Business center facilities are free of charge. The atmosphere, decor and ambiance is classy and of a superior grade. There's valet parking which is advisable anyway due to the fact that the hotel is situated on a busy junction with no campus apart from a very small forecourt. Criticisms? Few: (a) there is only one small elevator serving the entire hotel but this did not inconvenience us often despite the fact that the hotel was almost full during our visit, (b) we signed up for a bed-and-breakfast package and received a voucher for a free daily breakfast. The vouchers apparently have a face value of $32 which doesn't go very far if there's two of you and each has a $3 cup of coffee to start...

After being told by Priceline that I was booked at the Sorrento, I checked their individual website and tried to cancel the reservation because I knew it wouldn't work for a family. Here's why: the resort is TECHNICALLY \"downtown\" but in the First Hill district, past the I-5. HILL being the key word here. Yes, it is totally possible to walk to the waterfront and Pike's Place areas, but it is a very steep incline and you have to pass the I-5 there and back. Now, add a stroller to the equation and you're going to have a not so great time going down and a hell of time heading back up. There is NO shuttle service. NO shuttle service to the airport, NO shuttle service to the waterfront or Pike's place. As my family and I were walking down and up town, we were amazed at all the other hotels that offered shuttle services, it seems like that would be an amenity offered by a so-called 4 star resort. Well, not the Sorrento. Granted, the concierge or valet could dispatch you a taxi, but after paying $35.00/day for valet, plus tip, the last thing I wanted to do was pay $10.00 for a cab ride. And yes, we could've driven closer to the meca of downtown but parking can be problematic and will cost you just as much as our hotel valet fees. The Sorrento is in a \"quieter\" part of town; however, there is an Emergency room entrance within stone's throw of the hotel. Which means we were woken up only twice by ambulance sirens. Upon check-in we were told we were booked in a queen size suite (of course they don't tell you that all of their rooms are \"suites.\" When asked if we could get a room with two beds, due to traveling with kids, we were told that our \"suite\" had a pull-out sofa. After previewing the pull out, we opted for the roll-away that they also offered upon check-in. It barely fit in our \"living\" area and was not very comfortable. The air conditioning in the room is also located in the \"living\" area and didn't work very well. Which meant that the person sleeping on the pullout would be cold and the persons sleeping in the bedroom would be hot. I would have opened the windows; but they were positioned to low to the floor and having kids, would have been disastrous. The curtain rod in the living area kept falling down when we tried to close the curtains and the toilet \"ran\" unless you jiggled the handle after every flush. The caulking under the toilet is also cracking away which means that the toilet wobbles as you're using it. There is no indoor pool or hot tub, another amenity that I expected with a four star hotel. The customer service was above average and everyone we dealt with was pleasant. The internet was free but wired.

After all the great reviews we really expected more from this place. The pictures look GREAT but it doesn't really feel like that once you're there. It's a very old hotel and I really respect the fact that they want to keep it as original as possible, however it's tiny and dark and not really equipped with any modern amenities. (ie: no ice machines, vending machines, gift shop, etc) We arrived early and our room wasn't ready (even though I called the day before to let them know we'd be early) so we had lunch in the \"restaurant.\" They have a very small menu with very brief descriptions and everything is pricey. The server was nice and friendly and the food was pretty good but I don't know if was worth the price. The atmosphere was dark and old and felt like a gentleman's club so we weren't totally comfortable there. After lunch our room was ready so that worked out nicely. We headed up the tiny elevator to our \"junior suite\" which was definitely not what we expected either! Very, very small for a suite of any kind. The room was stuffy and the AC doesn't work so we had to open the windows which don't have screens so we had a few insect visitors- oh great. The TV was a joke- totally basic cable with no guide channel, info button or TV guide anywhere in the room so you have to just flip through and hope you find something you want to watch (and all the channels had crappy reception, very fuzzy). The bathroom was adequate- nice sink and vanity, closet with robes, etc. Separate tiny area with toilet and tiniest shower ever (my 6'4\" husband was rather cramped). The \"suite\" area consisted of a loveseat, two chairs and a coffee table. Wow! So glad we upgraded. The king size bed was mostly comfortable, lots of nice pillows that reaked of hotel bleach. There was about 4 feet of space between the end of the bed and the \"suite\" area so we're talking small here people. Trying to get room service of any kind took a while but everyone was friendly and helpful. The other major con of this place is the location. There is nothing around there that is remotely interesting. Since we ate lunch at the hotel's only restaurant, we decided to wonder around outside to find something for dinner. There was no one around at the concierge desk or the reception desk to ask for recommedations so we set off on our own and were sorely disappointed by what we found. Nearly everything was already closed and it was 5pm on a Saturday! Hello?! We ended up eating fast food because it was the only thing open that looked even sort of clean and welcoming. Not how we wanted to spend the first night of our vacation! We had to leave really early the next morning to get to the Amtrak station and mysteriously the awesome hotel car was gone so we had to call a cab. We were hoping to utilize that car a couple of times to save money but it was never there for us!

And thank goodness! In a world of mediocrity and warmed-over \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clock-watching\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hospitality, the Sorrento Hotel proved to this weary business traveler that there are owners and staff members who still focus on the customer experience. Like everything else in life, it's the little things that make the difference. Thanks to a delayed flight, I was denied the opportunity to enjoy an evening meal during my travels, and arrived at the hotel at 11:00 PM (exactly when the kitchen closes). I asked the server if there were any cold items that might tide me over until morning. He did one better: he convinced the kitchen to conjure up one more Huntsburger with smoked bacon, Huntsman cheese, and crispy fries (every bit as good as it sounds). Upon entering the room, I was astounded to find that my king-bedded room had a walk-in closet. My first car wasn't as big as this closet. In the bathroom - with Italian marble - there was a place for everything: shaver, lotion, toothbrush, shampoo, etc. How many times have you ever-so-carefully balanced all of your toiletries on the side of the deco sink, only to find them in the sink drain or on the floor moments later? This detail is too often overlooked in hotel renovations (tsk, tsk); which brings us to the study desk in the room. I like WiFi as much as the next business traveler - where would we be without it? But for those of us with a VOIP phone and/or a webcam, wired Internet access is the only way to go. You can imagine my shock and awe when I plugged my ethernet cable into the desktop port and witnessed the warm glow of link lights. I was almost as happy as my two-year-old daughter was to see \"daddy on the computer\". Every hotel on the planet brags about their bedding and linens. Sorrento is the first in my road-warrior career to back it up. Enough said. Heading down for breakfast my first morning, I noticed the word \"Monday\" monogrammed in the carpet in the elevator, and couldn't figure out what it meant. It wasn't until Tuesday morning that I figured it out after seeing that \"Monday\" had been replaced by \"Tuesday\". Wow!! In my defense, I had not had any coffee at that time. : - ) Breakfast - served by a professionally cheerful server by the name of Tim - was Salmon Eggs Benedict. Yes indeed. My meeting was held in the hotel - the Ravello Room (I think) - and was adequate in every way. Now if we can only do something about the car horns in Seattle... You would have thought we were closer to New York City. I just don't think I'll ever get used to that. After the meeting, Kody at the concierge desk recommended that we take a walk to the Pike Place Market. It seemed a far walk; but when broken up by a quick bite to eat, truly is an enjoyable walk (not to mention that the walk from the Sorrento to Pike Place Market is ALL DOWNHILL). The walk back to the hotel was not as friendly, but we resolved to walk the whole way, unless one of us collapsed from exhaustion. We didn't, and we have a new found respect for Seattle pedestrians, bicyclists, and parking brakes. After two days of meetings, it was time to return home. As my flight was at 6:00 AM, the front desk agent offered to brew some fresh coffee for her first check-out at 4:00 AM. Her offer was angelic and quickly accepted by yours truly. As I was driven to the airport in the rain, I told myself that I would post an online review of my experience. There is a saying that if a guest has a good experience at your hotel, he will tell three people. If a guest has a bad experience, he will tell ten people. I want to do my part to reverse this trend, because the Sorrento Hotel truly deserves the word of mouth. Heck, I may even tell more than ten people.

It was a special occasion for both of us (she lives in Seattle). I love the Capitol Hill area so I stayed at the Sorrento. Having made my reservations for a suite, I e-mailed the concierge and asked for a town car to be made available for the opera. The concierge responded promptly. When I arrived late Friday night, there was no desk staff but the concierge checked me in efficiently. I prudently took the precaution of handing out some green to make sure my stay went smoothly! The corner suite was very small, but well laid out and appointed. It was very clean. The hotel is old and the floor had some sags but it was also very quiet. As another poster noted, the bathroom has little counter space, but, mine had a window, shower and tub. Good thick towels. HiFi in room. Minibar and sink. Only one heater in the main room but the bedroom, and bath, stayed comfortable. No view from my northeast facing room, but not much noise other than usual city sounds. (Note to the reviewer who complained about train sounds: There isn't a train track for miles! You must have the hearing of a police dog.) The hospital is a block away, so there is an occasional siren, and, Madison is uphill at the Sorrento, so cars occasionally chug up the hill. I can confirm the hostess at the atrium bar was preoccupied with her seating computer. The atrium is crowded with Capitol Hill folks (read: middle aged and older) and appeared a bit pretentious, but the environment was pleasant. Entertainment was good, not too loud. True to promise the concierge arranged for a car to pickup my friend. She was delivered and seated in the atrium to wait for me, with true old-style concierge maximum class. In other words, he fussed over her. Our every need was taken care of expeditiously. We had a brief pre-opera meal in the Hunt Club. It was good without being extraordinary. There was practically no one there. The bar (tended to by \"Jill\") was old-style club, expensive, but generally efficient. Summary: Smaller rooms, even the suites, but clean, if a bit older. If you want to splurge a bit, try the \"Music Suite\", expensive but quite a bit larger. Bribe the concierge if you want stuff to \"happen\". Great location. Ignore the atrium hostess (she will ignore you) and just find yourself a seat. Try the small breakfast place immediately across the street from the entrance to the hotel. Cheap and good (2/2009).

The management also told us our wedding decorations would be kept in a particular place and when it was time to decorate, they weren't where the hotel said they'd be! Our family spent 30 frantic minutes trying to find someone from the hotel to help locate the decorations. They were genuinely worried the wedding would start late because of it. Additionally, a family member had to go back into the kitchen to ensure they saved our anniversary cake layer because they did not appear to be responsive when he asked them to save it. Surprise, surprise; the next morning it was not in the refrigerator where he had placed it! It appeared that the hotel would never have remembered it nor found it again. They only spent 15 minutes looking for it after we put up yet another fight. The management also did not help us in any way with decorating or even directing the wedding procession.

I booked online at a good price and was worried we might not get the best treatment from the staff, as is sometimes the case when booking non-directly. We were pleasantly surprised to receive a warm reception and great service during our night's stay. Desmond the concierge was very friendly when we checked in and even upgraded our room to a junior suite in honor of the occasion. The lobby was as I remembered, with rich wood tones and an old-world charm, and the Fireside room was a welcome repose after the cold rain. The second concierge on call brought the bags up to the room and hung my husband's suit in the closet, pointed out the room's amenities and was very helpful, as would be expected from a hotel with its reputation. Our room had plenty of space for the two of us, with a full sitting area, desk, and mirrored bar/coffee area. The marble appointed bathroom was separated into two parts, with the vanity and closet in one space and the toilet and shower separated by another door. No bathtub, which made the room feel somewhat European, but for one night it wasn't a problem. The room also came with robes and a CD system that had some great CDs provided by the hotel, which was an extra treat. We did not use the free car service, as we had our own car, and we decided not to valet but to park on the street, which on a Saturday night was no problem and on Sundays allows for free parking. When we arrived back at the hotel late evening there was a bottle of champagne, berries, and a note from the concierge wishing us a happy anniversary. It's the special touches that make a hotel memorable, and we were pleased with all of them. The California king bed was also of note, and although the pillow top mattress was still a bit too hard for my liking the wide variety of pillows and the well appointed bed sheets made the bed a dream to even sit on, let alone sleep. Our suite was in the front of the hotel facing the main street, and while there was some street noise when we had the windows open once closed it didn't bother us at all. We tend not to be an overly picky pair when it comes to traveling, and I'll agree that the Sorrento is not a five star luxury resort, but it did provide a great night of comfort for us during our little trip to the city and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a charming, romantic little hotel with a touch of history.", "Date": "January 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cSorrento Disappoints Again\u201d", "Author": "Entrossb", "ReviewID": "UR23379495", "Content": "Last night, my wife, Rose and I visited the Fireside Room intending to have drinks and dessert.

There was a hostess standing there but she was more intrigued with what was going on on her computer screen. My guess is we stood there for nearly two minutes without her saying a word to us or lifting her head from the screen. Four suitable tables were open but three of them had dirty dishes sitting on them. We waited awhile longer and then chose one of the tables that was not yet cleared and we consolidated the dishes onto the uncleared tables beside us. Those tables remained uncleared for another ten minutes until another guest (staying with you) came and sat down there - she then partly cleared them herself. The room was cold. There was no live music but there was also no recorded music playing throughout our 45 minute visit except for the last 15 minutes. No water was offered or brought. We ordered desserts. We almost always have one or two drinks each but seeing all the malfunction around us, we chose not to this time. We also noted that my usual order Laphroaig 10 year old was $15 a glass - at least $3 higher then anywhere else in the city. The desserts are fairly priced (kind of a disconnect). Everything was slow for us and for all around us. We heard several customers inquire as to where things were, how much longer, etc. I went to the front desk to get a comment card. None were there. No one came to the front desk to greet me. Three minutes later, the concierge asked me if I had been helped. I asked for a comment card and for your business card.

The room, although a little small, was absolutely beautiful and had heavenly scent of jasmine. The bellhop asked if we would like to make reservations anywhere in town for dinner that night, and since we didn't know where to go, gave us a few recommendations and let us alone to decide. We called the concierge who gave us great tips and recommendations. Our entire trip we found the hotel staff and concierge beyond helpful as far as making recommendations for dinner, bars, and clubs. Even though we had a car, we used the towncar service frequently everyday - and never had to wait more than about 15 minutes for it to arrive (although I recommend reserving it in advance if you know you will be leaving at a certain time). The beds were absolutely heaven and our entire stay was very enjoyable. We found the restaurant attached to the hotel to be a little pricey for what was provided, but immensely enjoyed sitting in the lounge of the hotel sipping some drinks and listening to the beautiful jazz singer they had for the night.

For me it is a matter of value vs price. I would give it good marks for anyone who has to be at the hospitals, but can't imagine suggesting it for a regular visitor. Why? The neighborhood is a M-F 9-5 sort of place, far from the rest of the tourist activities. Two blocks to the nearest Starbucks, but for those who can handle it, there is a Tully's across the street. The free coffee in the mornings is Illy's European style and quite good. I have a hard time understanding anyone wanting to be in Seattle and not being within sight or scent of the Sound.

Here are the pros and cons, keeping in mind this was planned as a romantic interlude. Pros: Fabulous, and I mean truly amazing staff. Jeffrey, a concierge, was especially charming. The staff members were beautifully dressed, low key and exceptionally professional. They knew our name each time we came down, and were very accommodating. Gorgeous king bed with excellent linens, including a variety of huge, fluffy pillows. Lovely decor throughout, dark and full of ambience. Beautiful Fireside Bar with soft Jazz entertainment. Pleasant restaurant. We didn't eat there as we are vegetarian and wanted to check out Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Flora. Cute factor: The elevator mat is changed daily and incorporates that particular day of the week. Cons: No coffee/tea maker in room. We went out and bought a kettle. I found this hard to take as I like my wake-up cuppa. I found out after my return that I could have asked for one. (This information was provided by their very helpful and pleasant client services manager.) However, there was no card advertising this point, it was not (as far as I can recall) in the service guide, and no one told me at the front desk. This minor point bugged me as, being a Brit, I find I get very antsy when I can't make tea. Not-too-pleasant scent of \"old buildings\" in the bathroom, which was also cold and drafty and did not have it's own heat. Very pretty though and well equipped. Lovely bath robes. Location not central. While the hotel operates a \"town car\" we had out own wheels and drove into Seattle's city centre. We think we prefer to walk out into the thick of things. The hotel is in a residential area. This said, that is just out personal preference. We would definitely recommend the hotel to friends, but we would mention the cold bathroom and to ask for a coffee press.

We were also told by the valet that we needed to tip the driver because he only was paid by gratuities. Not only was this advice unnecessary but it was unprofessional. No car service meant taking taxi cabs to dinner and shopping because this hotel is not within an easy walk of the Market or many restaurants. We were also disappointed by the general lack of service. In our previous stays, we were warmly greeted and our bags taken to our room where the bell-hop would turn on classical music. Turn-down service was automatic and fresh ice delivered nightly to the room. None of this happened during this last trip. In fact, when we asked what hours the Market was opened we were met with a shrug. If we hadn't been treated so well in the past, perhaps this wouldn't have been so shocking.

Upon checking in, the concierge came up to our room to show us the details of the room and comment on the conservative nature of the lounge/bar if we were inclined to go. I suppose we looked a little younger than their average guests (we're both in our mid-20s) and he wanted to make sure we knew what we were in for. He made dinner reservations for us and arranged for the towncar to take us there and back. While at dinner, Jerry - the incredible concierge, called in and sent complimentary crab cakes to our table. They never seemed put out that we requested towncar service several times a day. All the valet staff were extremely courteous and helpful - not to mention pleasant to look at :) My meal from the Hunt Club (via room service) was mediocre, but I wan't very hungry and I doubt that their tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich are the house specialty. Breakfast in the lounge was fantastic and I also liked the real in room coffee grounds and press. There is a definite musky odor in the hallways, but I think this could be fixed by a good Febrezing. The room did not have the same musky odor. Regarding a previous reviewer's comments about the lack of natural light - is the lobby darker than other hotels? Yes. However, I think this adds ambiance and beauty, rather than detracting from this hotel. You really feel like you are in the old world and the Sorrento is the longest operating hotel in Seattle - since 1908. I whole-heartedly recommend this hotel. My boyfriend regularly stays at the Seattle Westin and is switching his stays to the Sorrento after this week.

The rooms themselves (I was in a regular room, not a suite) are just fine, with an extremely comfortable bed, lovely linens, and nice touches such as real coffee and a real coffee press.

However, when we tried to turn the air conditioning on, it did not work at all, in fact not a bit of air came out and the room was very hot and stuffy. We called down to the front and she said couldn't we just open the window? I told her that I had children with me and since these windows were low, ie only 2 feet off the ground, if I kept them open, one of my children was liable to topple out! She said then, that she would send someone up to look at it and within a few minutes, someone came up and he confirmed that, yes, it was completely broken. Since it was Sunday night, he said that there were no engineering people available to fix it, so they offered to put us in a different room. We were pleased to be upgraded then into a suite, which was much larger, with a separate bedroom. Our kids both got their own bed and my husband and I planned to sleep on the fold out bed in the livingroom. However, when we finally got to bed, this fold out bed had no sheets, pillows or blankets, so we snitched some off the kids beds, but the mattress was SO uncomfortable that we finally ended up putting the sofa and chair cusions on the floor and sleeping there! The whole bed platform was slanted and the mattress was only a couple of inches thick. Really bad. As well, there was a huge wet spot on the living room carpet that the previous guest had made and so we had to be sure to wear our shoes when in the room.

The reviews on this site really influenced me to try the Sorrento as opposed to say the Inn at Market Place. This is a very nice property with many pluses, but my over all opinion is that it's nothing special, which is of course what you're looking for on these getaways. The Sorrento has an excellent concierge who gave very good recommendations, even when put to the test. They also have complimentary Town Car service to and from downtown destinations. This is a really nice thing. The public rooms of the hotel are top notch. The lobby lounge, for example is warm and inviting. I opted for a Junior Suite which ran around $300 a night. The room is a very small divided into a small sitting area with a tv in armoir and a bedroom that is tiny. The king size bed barely fits in the room, you have to squeeze buy it to get to the bathroom. The bedding was spectacular with super soft sheets and a large variety of pillows. The bedroom had an oversized desk that abutted the bed. The bathroom was nice with white marble and a spacious walk-in shower. Unfortunately, there's no tub in the bathroom and that's a minus for me. So here are there reasons for my average review: The room lacks any special aesthetic. The entire room is beige and boring and feels very, very cramped largely because of the poor layout. The bathroom is solid white. The room really needs the services of a good interior designer. The room temperature was impossible. They rely on small under window units that you just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get right. We were either freezing or boiling. There are no views whatsoever. No evening turn-down service was provided, so no evening straighten up of the room either. No coffee or breakfast service provided. Seating was uncomfortable and dated. So overall, this is a nice place, but more like a business destination than a getaway.

After our stay I think I have found the answer. It is the staffs at this hotel, starting from Front Desk to Housekeeping, which has made this a traveller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favourite. It is not only the service but the way you are getting the service makes a big difference. May be the small size of the hotel helps the staff to cater to individual needs but the main factor here is the positive attitude and it comes through quite clearly. It is not that everything is perfect at this hotel. As other reviewers have mentioned, this is an old apartment block which has been converted into a hotel with a pool in the middle and some part of the property shows its age. Some of the furniture and fixtures needs improvement and looks and feel dated and if you are staying at the upper level of rooms like us then anybody with a mobility issue will have a problem. Of course the lady at the reception helped my wife with her luggage but as there is no elevator at this property you have to climb a few stairs. But apart from these we do not have any other issues with this hotel. The rooms are actually one bedroom apartments with plenty of space. The hotel provides free soft drinks, snacks and DVD movies throughout the day which was a big hit with our son. The breakfast is a small affair with limited choices but whatever was offered was of good quality and enough to start our day. The hotel does not have a restaurant but if you are feeling tired and do not wish to go out then the staff provides menus of a number of nearby restaurants and will help you in placing the order. We ordered pizza on one occasion and the delivery was fast and the taste was good. Of course being just next to the Hollywood Boulevard there are number of eating options nearby covering all kind of budgets and taste. Major tourist attractions like Madam Tussauds, Kodak Theatre and Grauman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese Theatre are all within five minutes walking distance as is the Hollywood and Highland metro station from where the Universal Studio is just a station away. The area felt quite but totally safe during our stay and we did not encounter any problem even during late evening. The hotel provides secure parking at the ground level but it is not free. Free Wi-Fi is provided and the connection speed was pretty good. We could not find any convenience store nearby and bought our necessities including water from the petrol station next to Renaissance Hotel which is a short walk away. All in all we are very happy with our stay at the Magic Castle hotel and it has remained as one of our favourite during our 16 day vacation even though we stayed with bigger properties and brand names at other cities and will not hesitate to come back at all.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThe reviews are true\u201d", "Author": "Markwoodward", "ReviewID": "UR127301481", "Content": "What a fantastic hotel!

You get free snacks, 24 hours a day!! And they'll come to your room if you're too lazy to go to reception!! Such a cool touch. We always had a pack of oreos, granola bar and a can of Dr Pepper 'just in case we get peckish' on our way out and way back each day! Even when we checked out they encouraged us to get a bag full of snacks for our road trip to San Diego which we did, and that was great! The lobby drinks and snacks are lovely too, they do it every night. I had cucumber water one evening which was yummy! Another was apple cider, also yum! We had a suite and it didn't overlook the pool or have a balcony but that was fine for us as we didn't chill at the hotel during the day. Room was huge with seperate bedroom/living room/bathroom and a small kitchen linked to the living room. To be honest it was a bit wasted on us, the bedroom was so big we just used that! Pool is open 24 hours and is heated to 85 degrees. I was tempted to have a late night swim just for fun but decided against it - wiuld be nice though I imagine.

Why is this nondescript \"garden apartment\" style hotel my favorite? A few reasons: 1) The location can't be beat. You're in the heart of Hollywood with easy access to the major freeways. 2) You get access to the Magic Castle. While the drinks are overpriced and the food is mediocre, it's an experience not to be missed. 3) The rooms at the hotel are HUGE. They are all one bedroom suites and perfect for the visiting family that needs a kitchen and room for kids to relax. 4) The services is fantastic. Unlike the major chains, the Magic Castle doesn't nickle & dime you at every turn. The wi-fi is free, the snacks are free, they even gave us a free postcard stamp! It's the little touches.

Just quickly: We booked for one night because of a meeting on Wednesday evening in LA, less than two miles from the hotel. We drove in six+ hours, and while it wasn't the easiest to find it was found quickly. I'll start with the positives because they started right away! First off, the staff - wow. They are enthusiastic, helpful, friendly - heck, it's like the Boy Scout motto is part of their training! They offered a glass of sparkling lemonade while I was checking in and while I declined, they took it out to the car to give to my wife. They then directed me to the gated, underground (i.e. under the building) parking, which while not free was certainly both reasonable and unbelievably magnificent in Los Angeles. (Small note - the ceiling is not terribly high, therefore the pipes below the floor are fairly low, resulting in hatchback contact. Worth watching out for.) Due to our meeting time, we could only just put our stuff in the room, wash our faces, and head out. It was at this point we noticed the very nice facial soap with an orange citrus scent. We also noticed that due to the design of the entryway, the door to the room does not open completely. There is some sort of weird panel near the floor behind where the door tries to open. There's a very antique wall heater of some kind just inside the door. There is a slightly musty smell. And when washing our faces, we saw the cracked basin in the sink, but with no time to talk to anyone about it we headed out. We got back around 11:30pm, exhausted, and got undressed and into bed. On taking off my shoes and walking through the room, I found an area where it feels like there are cracks or holes, where the carpet sinks in, between the bedroom and the bathroom. On laying down in the bed, I realized the mattress is ... firm, to be kind. It's on a platform. We also took the time to read the small sign on the bed informing us that if we wanted a top sheet between ourselves and our duvet, we needed to have request it. Exhausted, I put my head down. At this point, I noticed the vinyl shutters in the room do not quite completely close. As our room was on the ground floor facing the street, I had to improvise some receipts stuffed underneath to keep them closed. About the street - there is a window-style air conditioner built into the wall facing the street, which I could see to outside through (a small hole, granted, but it is still there). But that was nothing compared to the continuous and rather loud traffic. All ... night ... long! The windows looked to be single-pane and (upon further investigation of the inside of the shutters in the light of day) hardly sealed. In the daylight, I found a few other interesting items. First, the shower - nice, serviceable, old, loads of hot water, and as is typical of someone my height (six foot one) excellent at cleaning my chest hairs. No matter, a great percentage of places are like this for me. But I also saw on the wall between the shower and the bathroom door, which is quite beat up by the way, some sort of yellowish runny stains on it with an exceptionally disturbing (in this day and age) red one on the (also very beat up) floorboard. Now the fact that the door opens physically ON to the toilet may be simply because of the age of the building and the plumbing design, but the oddly placed pedestal on the sink is quite modern. There are two light switches in the bathroom, one for the light and fan and the other for ... well, I couldn't tell what it did. there is a heating element as well on the ceiling, which looks to be from a mid-50's electric stove top, but it never did a thing. And I feel fairly certain the fan was the prop from the airplane in the movie Casablanca, judging by both its age and surprising level of noise. Throughout the room, the painting job is slapdash. The floorboards are really beat up. The clothes rod in the closet is scary looking, either badly painted and worn or honestly I don't know. I'm surprised at how much I found, considering we had just enough time for me to grab some of the (very good and very plentiful) included continental breakfast and take it back to the room before we had to leave. Again, a truly friendly staff, I cannot say enough about them, but I just did not have the time to discuss it with them. I do honestly believe they would have done whatever they could to improve the situation, but this type of trip prevented me from being able to discuss it with them and frankly considering the reports everyone else seems to have made I was caught off guard by all of this stuff. I know things go wrong, but I don't expect a place rated as highly as this to require me to address this many shortcomings. Had I noticed two other items when we arrived we would have been late to our meeting, as they passed beyond unpleasant to dangerous: the first was some sort of power cable coming from the bottom of one of the outlets, down into the carpet. I do not know where it went or what it was for but I cannot believe that type of rigging would pass code. The second was the fact that the smoke alarm had no battery and appeared to be inoperative (no light). I know that wouldn't pass code. In conclusion, this is a very pretty, funky, cool place with excellent on-site underground parking, a heated outdoor pool, a staff that would make any Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons or wherever proud, in a really great location in Hollywood, but with what I found in my room I just can't come to grips with the fact this hotel is (as of 1 March 2012) the #2 rated hotel in Los Angeles on TripAdvisor. My experience really doesn't seem to match others'.

In spite of the quite dated installations, the outstanding service really makes this one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in!

We stayed at a double bedroom apartment, which is really large, more than enough to accommodate 5, even 6 adults. It has its own kitchen, with microwave, coffee maker (complimentary coffee and tea) and full sized oven and refrigerator. The beds were very, very comfortable, just what we needed after a long touring LA. One point that needs to be made is that if you're looking for modern, high tech installations, you should look elsewhere (although they did have an ipod dock and flat screen TV). It's the little touches that really make this hotel, such as being greeted, upon arrival, with sparkling lemonade, then finding a big bag of cheddar popcorn and a large bottle of blueberry juice in our room (both delicious by the way). Or the free danish cookies, apple cider and cucumber water at the lobby. Or the huge list of free snacks, beverages and DVDs. Everything about the hotel shows that the staff goes many extra miles to guarantee that the guests leave the hotel with huge smiles on their faces (which we did).

Entrance to the club is restricted exclusively to members, their guests and guests of the Magic Castle hotel. Although we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not in the field or big aficionados of magic shows, we had read a review about the atmosphere and performances and had wanted to check it out. We had an enjoyable evening at the club and saw some top-notch illusionists, but unfortunately did not see Neil Patrick Harris \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he supposedly is there regularly and is on the Board. I was set to submit my hotel review and decided to read some of the others quickly and glad I did b/c my original review just looks like I plagiarized all the others especially regarding the dominant thought on the service. Rather than mimic the rest, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll just say this is how you run a hotel or any customer service business. From the pre-arrival welcome email to check-out, every person we worked with was exceptional -- friendly, professional and welcoming. The manager/owner must have a talent scout background. The room we had was off the pool and used to be a 1-bedroom apartment (I assume). Furniture is basic and I liked the plantation shutters on all of the windows. The kitchen was equipped with essentials and the bed was comfortable. I especially liked the dual closets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one for each of us. While the hotel room may be rather frill-less, the amenities like the complimentary convenience store (my term b/c they had so many snacks, candy and soda to select from I literally felt like a kid in a candy store) and the pastries and juice in the morning was great.

They were spot on about the excellent location and the wonderful service provided by ALL the hotel employees. From all the rave reviews I was expecting a really beautiful hotel. This hotel seems to actually have been an older apartment complex that was converted to a hotel. The rooms themselves are like a small apartment. The furniture is older and well used, but maintained okay, but seemed kind of bare bones. The sofa was really saggy. There was a small kitchen with dining table and chairs. Bath products were the Taracco brand which is wonderful. We had a room with a balcony, but there is NO privacy. The balcony overhangs the pool and you could have a conversation with your neighbors without shouting because they are so close. It is a small complex of rooms. The hotel seemed pretty secure with access mainly through the garage or the front lobby doors only. The housekeeping service prior to us being checked in was not too great because there were spider webs hanging from the ceiling and on the walls. The garage was great. They charge about $11 per night, but it is steel door gated and accessible only with the insertion of a room key...very safe. The \"mini-bar\" , which is free, is not in the room. I kept looking for it when we arrived. They provide you with a list, you just them what you want and they give it to you at the front desk. The hotel itself is about 2 blocks from Guaiman's Chinese Theater and the Hollywood walk of stars. Be sure to ask the front desk personnel about recommendations for eating, sight-seeing, etc. We were there when there was a movie premiere and Twilight stars putting their hand prints in the cement. Needless to say, there were a lot of Twilight fans during this time, but it did not stop you from getting anywhere UNLESS you wanted to drive down that particular section of the street. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for the wonderful service provided by the friendly staff, security and prime location.

The free ice-lollies by the pool was also a lovely touch.(the staff even insisted on giving us a bag of goodies to take with us for our journey when we checked out!!) There is no restaurant in the hotel however the lady on the front desk provided us with take-out menus and helped us to order food in. The main advice I can give anyone who stays here is to ask the main desk to try to book you for dinner at the exclusive adjoining 'Magic Castle Club' Dinner was slightly pricey however we had a fantastic meal and this also grants you entry to the Magic shows which were out of this world and a definite highlight to our trip.

We can't recommend it more highly. The welcome was first rate - just what was needed after a long haul flight with kids, and this set the tone for the service we received over our 3 day stay. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff and the hotel manager was excellent. He has clearly put his mark on this place and really went the extra mile to make sure we had a memorable stay. He succeeded...we will not forget this place. The hotel itself was really relaxed and had a proper Hollywood feel. It oozes character and comprised a series of rooms set around a pool, and rooms overlooking the adjacent roads. Ask for a pool side room, open your sliding doors and chill out. This is not a modern fanchised hotel, so if you want heated bathroom mirrors, brown suede head boards and the feeling that you could be anywhere in the world, go somewhere else. This place is perfectly clean and has bags of character and charm. The location is great. You can be in the hustle and bustle of Hollywood Boulevard in five minutes and retire to your peaceful bolt hole when you feel a bit tired. Once inside the courtyard, you feel completely relaxed. Breakfast is really good as well. Muffins, coffee, fruit and yoghurt by the pool gets the day off to a good start. Underground parking is also very reasonable. ($10 per night as opposed to $35 in San Fransisco).

The room was a one bed aprartment with a large seating area that went into a functional kitchen. The bedroom had a comfy large bed and decent storage space and the bathroom was of a decent size. Both the lounge and the room had a tv with the lounge having a dvd player should you want to hire a film for the front desk free of charge. Hotel overall was medium in size with with all the rooms surrounding the small pool (small but great for a relaxing dip). Accommodating and cozy, great to come back to at the end of the day. Breakfast was a nice and set you up for the day and the free mini bar was fantastic....crisps, sweets and soft drinks when ever you want! What makes this hotel great is the location. Right on Franklin Avenue behind the Kodak Theatre (home of the Oscars). Walk Left from the hotel across the street onto Orange and within 2 minutes your on the Walk of Fame! Great for walking to everything and safe to do so. Parking at $10 a night! Bargain! Find cheaper in Hollywood (where parking starts at an average $30 a night) I'd be surprised. The hotel team........Never have I come across such commited, friendly hotel staff. Each staff member we spoke with couldnt have done enough. Nothing was to much or little. I'm terrible for remembering names but everyone stood out and is an asset to the hotel. Special mention to Nick. By error and an embarrasing one, I locked the car keys to the rental car in the boot!!! We had to be at LAX in within 3 hours for a flight and all seemed to fall apart. Nick tried calling Alamo with no luck (Sunday hours) to which he said he would call Triple A to have them come out and assist which would be approx $150. Ouch! Nick called them, advised he himself was a Triple A member and could we be assisted under his membership........they said yes, were at the hotel in 15 minutes and had the keys out in seconds.....no missed flight and no $150 fee! :O) Nick.....thanks again so much.

Having located the hotel it proved easy to park in the secure underground car park which the hotel offers. Check-in was very friendly, with loads of great advice offered to maximise our stay, including maps, restaurant tips and advice on how to get to places such as Universal Studios (one stop on the subway) and where best to view the famous Hollywood sign. Our room was next to the pool and was well-equipped with loads of space and a full kitchenette. We didn't use this but appreciated the full size fridge in particular. The bedroom was large and the bathroom was also of a good size, with a good shower. Tea & coffee facilities were available and the wi-fi internet was quick & worked well, which was important to us. A big plus for the Magic Castle is it's location, just one street and a five-minute walk from Hollywood Boulevard and its attractions such as the stars in the pavement and the Kodak theatre. Likewise the subway station for Universal was just ten minutes away and could hardly have been more convenient. The stand-out feature of the hotel though was its people and its service. Bigger and \"better\" hotels should send their managers to stay here to see how it's done! From the personal welcome and tips at check-in through to the free snacks & sodas available from the front desk upon request, the level of helpfulness could not be bettered. Nothing was too much trouble and the free breakfast, including pastries, juice, coffee and fruit typified the standards being achieved. Well done and thank you to everyone involved in running the Magic Castle - great job! In summary, I would recommend the Magic Castle Hotel to anyone wishing to experience a night or two in Hollywood.

However there is no other word to describe the staff at the Magic Castle Hotel. This was our second stay in as many years to celebrate my birthday but this time we were joined by three other couples after having bragged so much about our stay the year before. Since there were so many of us I made the reservations several months in advance and also asked them to make reservations at the Magic Castle Club and Yamishiros Restaurant for us. Prior to our arrival I had to have called at least 5 times with changes or special requests of one sort or another; most of which were pertaining to the restaurant or Magic Castle Club reservations. Not once were my requests met with anything but \"No Problem, we'll take care of that and e-mail you confirmation\" and each time confirmation was waiting by the time I got to my computer. When we arrived the staff immediately remembered us and you would have thought we were part owners. Our friends were in awe and wanted to know how well we had tipped them the last time. (Actually, we had only left a tip for the maid) During check in one of the group mentioned we were celebrating my birthday and all of a sudden everybodys room was available but ours. (Late checkout, the maids would have it ready asap, etc, etc) Some 20 minutes later our room was ready. When we entered, on the dining room table was a fresh baked birthday cake with with my name on it, ballons tied to each of the dining room chairs and a birthday card from the entire staff! How they did that we will never know since we were standing on the paitio not 10 feet from the room the entire 20 minutes we were waiting. What a suprise! Once again our friends were awe struck and wanted to know who we knew. During the entire weekend we were greeted by the most friendly and helpful staff I have ever seen during continental breakfast on the patio (by the way the croissants are to die for), when requesting the shuttle to Magic Castle Club or Yamishiros or returning to find mulled cider and pastries waiting in the reception area each evening. (This was March) Normally I would mention the great location, absolute spotlessness of the rooms and other amenities but many of these things have already been mentioned in other reveiws. Besides, even if the place were a dump (and it is far from it) I would stay there because of the staff! To close, it is September and our trek to the Magic Castle Hotel, Magic Castle Club and Yamashiros for my birthday is now truely become a tradition. As soon as we can all decide on a weekend, I will be making our reservations for next March. Oh, and there will be at least 2 new couple joining us this year.

Walking distance for some. Use car otherwise. Trader Joe's and Ralph's supermarket nearby and can use cooking facitilies in hotel room when needed. Many foreigners, couples and families stayed there.

The rooms were neat, tidy and clean, and the beds were very comfortable!! Also not far to go to Universal Studios and Warner Bros. and you can hop on a tour bus down on Hollywood Bvld to see the main sights!! The best part of this hotel is the staff........they can't do enough for you!! They are always there to help, answer questions etc. The free snacks and drinks all day are a bonus, and the breakfast is light and fresh. Loved the pool, again, always kept clean, and was very relaxing to lay around with soft music playing in the background. Although we arrived quite early in the morning, fully aware that our room would not be ready, the staff immediately welcomed us, looked after our bags, and offered plenty to drink and eat while we waited. We loved our stay at the magic Castle Hotel, and have already reccommended friends to stay there, which some have gone ahead and made bookings, and we will also be back again, hopefully very soon.

Let me just say that I have literally traveled the world and the service at the Magic Castle Hotel is simply unmatched. Now keep in mind that this is not a 5 star pretentious cookie cutter hotel and if that is what you are looking for, this is not the place. But if you are looking for a great location, spacious rooms/suites, unequaled service for families and reasonable rates, look no further than the Magic Castle Hotel. Here are my thoughts: -Suites are large and good for families or others willing to really get the most out of the room. You should note that some rooms are not yet updated so ask for one that is. If you get an older room, know that they are decent but definitely somewhat worn and outdated. However, everything else makes up for it. -Staff couldn't be better. The GM Darren was amazing as was his staff, with white glove popsicle service for the kids, free snacks and smiles and friendliness all around. I can't stress enough that these people make you feel at home and very comfortable. THis comes from the top and Darren does an exceptional job with this very caring staff. It is THE difference maker. -Nice touch with welcome drink, continental breakfast, free snacks, dvd'd and wireless internet. They don't nickel and dime you to death. -Spoke to Darren at the pool area for quite a bit of time and he made many recommendations for us including a great dinner at The Farmers Market in The Grove which was a great experience. -Pool small but decent. Not a luxury resort pool by any means but the pool is enjoyable after a long day of tourism. -Location is superb, just a block from Kodak Theater, Graumanns, Hollywood Blvd and minutes from Beverly Hills, Universal and much more. Very central and convenient. Overall, very impressive. I stayed here before on New year's Eve and it was a different vibe (more of a party atmosphere) but if you are looking for a great place to stay in the LA area, this is the place. It was likely an apartment complex before being a hotel and has a Melrose Place type of feel. As unconventional as it is you simply cannot go wrong with this place. It is almost perfect now and when all the rooms are updated it will be incredible.

It was huge, Obviously at sometime has been an apartment, so we had a bedroom, bathroom, pull out sofa bed, table, microwave, fridge basically everything you could need, It was a bit bit battered around the edges but spotlessly clean, Free shampoo etc and a free safe in the room.

To be honest the place is pretty tired and in need of a refit, whilst the pool is tiny. You know all this when you stay there so it's not so much of an issue. The major issue for us was noise - we had a road facing room (MAKE SURE YOU ASK NOT TO HAVE ONE OF THESE) and the traffic keeps going all night so you can't have the window open. Even if you have the windows closed it remains seriously noisy. The air con units are old and VERY noisy so the only way to get to sleep at all is with earplugs.

Her daughter had a more descriptive definition. We did not report this to the desk as we wanted to get to bed so we could start our Hollywood day early, she sprayed some perfume, we ran the AC , opened the windowsburned some incense and just ignored it instead of going through hassle of changing rooms.

I even got a welcome drink which I've never experienced before, even at the fancy spots in Las Vegas. The room - or apartment rather - was huge and very clean and pleasant. You get a large living room type area, a kitchen with full amenities, even a dining room area, a large bathroom and a tucked away bedroom. You could live in this room for weeks. The hotel offers free (yes, free!) snacks and beverages, delivered to your room if you wish, and I got a free newspaper in the morning as well. There's also complimentary breakfast included, which was a wide selection of quality products, and many in-room amenities such as multiple TVs, microwave, DVD player and so on. Nothing was missing. With a nice pool in the middle, the hotel layout is very nice, and it is adjacent to the Magic Castle Club which you can get access to as a hotel guest (I didn't try it but I hear it's a very cool experience). From the hotel, you're a 2-minute walk from the busiest part of Hollywood Blvd, with the Chinese Theatre, Hollywood & Highland, Kodak Theatre etc. The location is perfect if you want to see the sights in Hollywood. There is not much of a view from the room, but you'll be hard-pressed to find that anywhere in Hollywood.

When we arrived we could check in straight away.

Think Melrose, think retro, think wonderful friendly helpful staff who provide you with a home away from home and you have the Magic Castle summed up. We could not have wished for a better place to stay. We saw the sights all day and Jason told us where a large fresh and very cheap supermarket was (about a 5 min walk). So we cooked everynight in our wonderful kitchen and then sent the kids down with a list for the 24 hour FREE mini bar and free DVD's (where do you ever get that) and sat and ate popcorn, chips, sodas and chocolate whilst watching free movies on our flat screen tv each night (that was a holiday in itself to us). We had one minor issue with a window not closing properly and the maintenance man appeared immediately and fixed it!. The pool was heated, clean with loads of pool toys -the kids had so much fun. A generous breakfast was presented around the pool each morning with delightful pastries and the Darren the owner/Manager was always on hand for a friendly chat. In fact on our last day he let the kids run wild with the mini bar and their backpacks were filled with goodies (thank you for those delightful Hershie Bars that you can't buy in Australia). They even organised to check-us in online on our return flight and print off our boarding passes. I could go on and on about all the positives as I can't find one negative about this wonderful place.

I guess this review is realy a warning for singles because I certainly heard other guests, particularly those with children say how great it was. As I was leaving I heard one kid say it was the best hotel he had ever stayed in. Not so for me. I was in a room at the top of the building well recessed from any natural light, which was quite frankly depressing, especially as I was quite unwell on my second day and had to spend most of the day in bed. As I was climbing the many steps to my room I could sometimes peek into the larger accommodations and they did seem to be very comfortable, and spacious and bright, so it made my room seem more depressing. Breakfasts were ok, location was good. The service well, they tried to be very helpful, but for me it backfired. I wanted to post a parcel back to Australia and I asked at the desk if they were able to arrange it. On the Saturday the person on duty said yes, no problem, so I packed my bag accordingly and made a trip to the post office to get a box to send home. When I took it to reception on the Sunday morning at around 9.30 am the problems started. I wasted around 2 hours while they tried to complete the forms, and eventually decided that they could not arrange to post my parcel. Basically I wasted my entire last morning at the front desk, and then had to return to my room to unpack my box and repack my bags. Of course by then the key was de-activated and so I had to go all the way back to the desk to get it activated and climb back up to my room (I mentioned earlier that it was at the top of the building). I could not fit all of my clothes into my bags and had to leave some items behind (I had been shopping on the previous day on the strength of the earlier advice, so I was not happy.) The hotel knocked $50 off my bill but it did not compensate for the loss of my last morning in Los Angeles.

This kind of service is what you get all the time. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. I would say my one complaint about the staff would be that they weren't as knowledgable as I would have liked about local family-friendly restaurants and attractions outside of the norm. We loved the free snacks and drinks available at the desk ( a wide variety of candy, chips, sodas, etc.) and the free continental breakfast was tasty, with yummy scones and croissants, cereals, fresh fruit (mangos!!), juices, very tasty coffee, granola and yogurt, etc. We also loved being to walk one block to Grauman's, the Walk of Fame, Disney's El Capitan Theater, etc. The parking is good in that it is underground, so covered, with a key-access gate, so secure. However, it is small and difficult to maneuver with a larger vehicle. The laundry facilities are clean and reasonably priced.

We werent too bothered sat around pool after driving for most part of day and the staff raced to help take bags to room for us. My 8 year old daughter was a tad disappointed the hotel was not part of the castle and we did get a tad confused when we arrived parking at the castle not the hotel. Parking was $10 a day bargain. ROOMS- we had a two room unit, older but refurbished. Massive fridge, full kitchen, large tv. one king and one queen bed couch and chair coffee table desk lamps. Clean tidy. Bathroom had sep bath and shower not anywhere to put your toilet bag but there is a bench outside door with a mirror. The best smelling soap youll ever smell. The beds are so comfy I have two negatives- 1- the noise coming from the road was very loud. Busy most part of the night and i was super thankful i had ear plugs. I dont think you would get this from all the other rooms, ours just was directly onto front. 2- our room was not inside the unit complex but on the outside which did concern me that anyone can just walk up to the door and windows. Most of the windows are second story but the one near the front door did not have a lock we realised when going to bed however the second wed mentioned it the next day staff had fixed it within 30 mins. I would have still felt safer inside the complex as everyone has to walk through the office to get inside. FREE SNACKS - surprised they still offer this after our three kids kept them busy. Not once did the staff blink an eye at the amount of snickers and cokes my teen sons requested. They even sent my husband out with some to the car for our plane ride home on checkout.

Magic Castle Hotel is a slightly unconventional establishment, extending from a very curious private magic club next door - housed in a fantasy-like early century victorian mansion. The hotel itself lies adjacent and is typically californian in an unpretentious relaxed way. The accommodation does not follow the formula of the big chains. The rooms are spacious and flow nicely without being up-tight. It's no criticism that the rooms are not as slick and shiny as some of the luxury chains and you might notice an endearing squeak in the floor or that the windows actually open. This all enhances the relaxed feel of the place. Service is outstanding. Nick, you will go a long way in life - don't lose your enthusiasm and willingness to help. I need people like you at my work! Caren, you took complete ownership of our needs and we appreciate this. Darren, is the manager. He made sure to introduce himself, to listen to what the guests thought about the hotel and went out of his way to help us. Thank you so much in particular for your help on our final day when we were waiting for our late night flight. You know what you did for us, and we are forever grateful. The convenient location worked very well as a springboard to the attractions of LA and Hollywood. Finally, Magic Castle can't be beaten from a value point of view.

The hotel allowed a early checkin for my friends on our request. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Bathroom was clean and looked new. I had some doubts since some folks had given a review on ageing bathrooms. It had a cooking range with all the necessary utensils, fridge. Towards the end of our stay we used their facilities to cook. Breakfast was complimentary, it was adequate. Wireless was free. unlimited snacks and beverages at the minibar counter in the reservation desk. But i guess the best asset or quality of the hotel is the staff. They are extremely courteous and tried to accomodate our requests. example- when I asked for directions to some stores, the receptionist (jason) printed out the directions from Google Maps.

The weaknesses: Unfortunately service alone cannot drive a hotel stay. What is also equally important is how good the room and the amenities are. In our room, the main bed was ok, but the sofa bed sagged a lot, and my son could not sleep. The bathroom door could not be locked. The microwave was not cleaned, there were coffee stains. The amenities are all very old, and need a desperate upgradation. The area where the washing machines are kept was filthy (Management - have you even looked behind the machines, ever?). The hotel(?) is an old apartment complex with paper thin walls. I could not sleep the whole night because of the sound. The hotel cannot control the road noise, but it does have the option of investing in insulation. The breakfast is a nice touch, but we could not find butter. The \"free\" internet did not work.

Normally I would have booked us adjacent to the LACC, but when my husband insisted that we book the MCH instead, I read the TA postings and made the booking. After only two days, I am hooked. All the details of the reviews below are dead on: excellent staff, free goodies, heated pool, free LA Times,free shuttles to MC or the spectacular views from the Japanese restaurant on the hill above, quiet complex (we are in 211 - the top center one bedroom, so no noisy upstairs neighbor issues, but an occasional car or truck in the middle of the night on the road behind the bedroom - what do you expect? You are IN a city). And yes, the kitchen stove should eventually be replaced along with the rolled linoleum in the bathroom, but everything is spotless. They offer turn-down service with a mint and the next day's weather forecast - a LOVELY touch that I have only experienced at 5 star boutique hotel in Paris and Quebec City. Match that with a glass of cold, sparkling, Italian lemon soda served in a champagne flute to welcome you at the check-in desk to sip while completing the normal boring paperwork and I daresay, even the road warriors among us will soften. Now, DO make reservations for the Magic Castle. As anyone who knows me well, as a 20 year veteran, former Lincoln Center opera and ballet production stage manager and personal assistant for years to a multi-Tony award winning director: I don't \"do\" bad theatre - or theme parks. That said, our Magic Castle adventure was top notch - ok, I agree that the food could have been better, but not the experience. Here is my top advice: arrive before your dinner reservation so you can see the two smaller venue shows before dinner or the main hall attraction. Once you get into the castle (yes, you get to whisper, \"Open, Simsim\" to get through the library \"door\" ) send your partner to the bar directly in front of you for drinks and walk your own feet directly to the left (stageright) and get in line for the Close-Up Gallery. There you will be only one of about 20 audience members, in the tiniest venue I have ever experienced, to watch - and participate if you are picked from the 1st or 3rd rows in what I can only express as a private magic show. A delightful start. This review is getting too off track from the MCH, so...

Hotel guests have guest privileges at the Magic Castle which is up the hill about 100 yards - the hotel offers a free shuttle service to and from the Magic Castle which is good for ladies wearing high heels who don't want to risk the uphill climb. The room was \"vintage\" but clean, large bed, nice TV, amenities. This is a great way to get into the Magic Castle for dinner - the food was gourmet in description but not as tasty as the description suggested. It's good, not great, but then this is a club, not a restaurant, and the value of the night is not the food but the ambience which is SUPERB. There are several magic rooms with magicians doing performances or closeup magic for small groups - and nightly shows which during our trip included \"Mr. Dead\" with a tap dancing schtick by the world's oldest showgirl (87 years old and taps faster than a 20 year old!!). Drinks are served everywhere, there are 2 or 3 bars and a room where an invisible ghostly pianist named Irma plays anything you suggest - while we were there, Irma played a sophisticated opera tune, a classical fugue (very spooky), lots of pop tunes - and answered questions with songs/lyrics. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We drove a rental car and there is secure parking underneath the hotel - the next day we drove to Beverly Hills and had lunch, then drove up the coast to walk on a secluded beach north of Malibu. We also could have walked down Hollywood Boulevard with is also walking distance. It's a really nice \"Hollywood experience.\" A lot of people asked me, \"How did you get into the Magic Castle - I thought it's a Magicians-only club!\" - and I just said, \"I stayed at the Magic Castle Hotel\" - that's the secret.", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cFAB FAB FAB - Must stay here\u201d", "Author": "birdyLondon", "ReviewID": "UR85995926", "Content": "I can say nothing but positive things to say about this hotel...

It was great to stay somewhere where you can do a load of washing for $1 instead of paying high rates in 4-5 star hotels. The kids loved the hotel. They had their free snacks, free DVD, and swam in the heated pool. Our room had a lovely king size bed and the kids slept on a queen sofa bed. Yes, the room did smell a bit and the walls are thin but it wouldn't put me off staying there a second time- the rest of it was great. The location is wonderful. One stop on the metro to Universal- too easy. I was thinking originally that we'd stay in pasadena or Santa Monica but so glad we didn't as we had limited time. One day we returned to The Magic Castle from Universal and were pretty tired as we had just done open to close at Disneyland the 2 days previously, and we just wanted to have a wine and relax but didn't know were we could buy some so asked the staff.

The room was clean and neat. However I think the bathrooms though clean are due a renovation. The rooms were cleaned every day with any change of sheets and towels promptly carried out. The reception also printed me my boarding passes on my date of return. Only service lacking was I had to struggle to carry all luggage up a floor from my car on arrival. I thought that the effort that the hotel spends to welcome the guests- drink, candies etc was spoiled by lack of effort to take the guests to the room. Good spread of morning breakfast and fruits all day at the lobby. Would defiinitely recommend to all families for the rooms that we were allocated.", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, NV", "Title": "\u201cDitto to all the positive reviews!\u201d", "Author": "JupiterTwo", "ReviewID": "UR75987501", "Content": "Just wrapped up a 3-day stay here and will echo what has already been said ~ great value, really genuinely nice staff, great free breakfast (the raisin scones are seriously amazing!), large quarters and super Hollywood location.

The beauty is that it's only a short walk away as is the metro. We travelled around on the metro which was easy and cheap. Pleaces to visit near by are Graumanns Chinese Theatre, The Kodak Theatre, Guiness Book of Records and the Hollywood Bowl is within walking distance. Not far away is a small supermarket so self catering is easy. To eat I reccommend Mel's Diner and Shelley's for breakfast.

Our room was absolutely spotless and lovely touches like the had set the bed side radios to be playing gentle classy music when you went in, and we also had a chocolate cake because we'd let them know it was my birthday trip. Staff were the most helpful I have ever come across - everyone from the porter, the reception staff, the maids were falling over themselves to help. Complementary breakfast which you could eat by the nice sunny pool, or take back to your room - great choice of fresh baked pastries, cereals and fruit. An added bonus was the guest laundry - really cheap $3 I think - and so necessary when travelllng with kids. The location was great too - only 5 minutes from the madness of Hollywood Boulevard - but 5 minutes from Runyon Canyon where you could hike or jog.

However, before you even get to that point you are greeted by enthusiastic, friendly staff who welcome very new guest with a champagne flute of sparkling lemon drink while you are registering. If that is not enough, there is a cucumber water dispenser and bowls of fruit in the lobby for your enjoyment. Then, as you register they give you a list of DVDs you can borrow free of charge together with what they call the 'minibar', sweets and snacks and cans of soft drink which you can ask for at any time, again completely free of charge. While sitting relaxing by the pool one afternoon a receptionist came round with a box, asking if we would like a 'popsicle' - fruit iced lollies distributed to guests around the pool. The breakfast in the lobby can be eaten in the pool area in the morning, or else taken back to the fully equipped room, with a microwave, cooker, fridge and coffee maker. We had a separate bedroom and sofabed in the living room so our daughter had her own space. A full sized dining table was useful for takeaways. Every time we needed technical help a handyman appeared straight away, even to show us how to tune the TV to run the DVD player. This is the second time we have stayed here, and since our last visit the rooms have been refurbished. We had a problem with ants in the bathroom, and they were eradicated within fifteen minutes. The location is excellent, cross the road, take the first turning on the left and go into the Kodak Theatre via the rear entrance (where the Oscars take place), then go through the shopping centre to the Walk of Fame, Graumans Chinese theatre and a Metro station. The Magic Castle , next door, is a club for magicians where high profile international magicians come to stay and perform for each other. They hold formal dinners during the week for over 21s only, but on Sundays there is a champagne brunch which allows children, and has a (slightly) more relaxed dress code. Before and after lunch you can attend the various rooms to see magic shows, or explore the quirky building.

Don't know who it was, but there are homeless people camped out right across the street from the hotel. The suite was roomy but old and surely did not look as new/modern as some of the pictures taken by previous visitors, which could only mean that some suites have been renovated more recently. If we had only known... Other cons with the room included an ant problem in the bathroom (when we brought attention to it at the front desk, the lady there acted like it was the first time she had ever heard of such a thing, even though other reviewers have spoken of a similar problem), which they attempted to correct with ant spray, but the smell lingered and the ants came back intermittently. Also, the bathroom was small, the paint was chipping off of the bathtub, and the bathtub drain would back up if you showered for too long. The DVD player could not be connected to the TV in the living room (even the maintenance guy couldn't fix it), so the kids could only watch their DVDs in the bedroom (that was a bit inconvenient). The wi-fi connection was spotty, and there was surprisingly a lack of utensils in the kitchen (only provided 2 forks and 2 spoons) for a family suite. Also, for those who aren't aware, there is a daily parking fee of $10. Otherwise, the staff was friendly and responded quickly to any problems. The free minibar was a real plus for everyone, and the staff was always generous in asking if we needed any more for our excursions. Location is great, as it is just a couple of blocks to the walk of fame, mann's chinese theater, kodak theater, etc. Also, it's just a couple of miles from Universal and the Hollywood sign.

So yes, the service is more personable that any other hotel I have stayed in. Although the overall hotel needs a revamp...and quick! When I walked into my room I was a little shocked... outdated, dirty furniture and scuffs all over the walls. The kitchen and bathroom were worse - peeling paint and begging for a bulldoze. As we got in very late in the evening, I decided to stay in and check my email. I connected quickly to the free wi-fi, although found over the course of my stay that it was an unreliable connection that dropped out every 10 minutes or so and one evening would not connect at all! None of the TV remotes worked...I suppose it is a little too much to check the batteries every now and then? And the lounge room was infested with ants...they proceeded to crawl all over me whenever I sat on the couch. Oh and a moth was flying around in the bedroom when we went to bed. The whole place just felt dirty, like you needed to give the chair a wipe before you sat on it. I was glad to have brought my disinfectant wipes - they came in handy! Stains all over the furniture, from the couch to the footstools and carpet too. The linens on the bed also had stains on them, and we had to request they be changed. The air-conditioning units rattled and rolled all night long. The hotel was quite noisy overall...from the pool area, to the slamming doors, the thin walls of the room which meant you could hear everything! I was even kept awake all night listening to the loud snoring coming from the next room. And don't be fooled by the free mini-bar...you have to ask every time you want something, which really defeats the purpose of a 'free mini-bar'. The breakfast was average, given you had to get up very early or miss out. The highlights - the staff! Absolutely the nicest and friendliest bunch of people. The breakfast scones were delicious too, and we also loved the 'turn down service' of mint chocolates with a note on the follwoing day's weather. You could not request for a better location...very close to the famous Hollywood Boulevard and public transport of the red metro line. It is such a shame that a place with such excellent customer service falls short on the rest. The Magic Castle Hotel needs a revamp of the decor and interiors...from the outside it can look like Melrose Place but peer in a little closer and you feel like you have ventured into the Bates Motel.

This time we spent 8 nights at the property and stayed in a 2 bed suite. There is still much to like; the location is great for all the LA attractions and the staff are still really amazing and very helpful. However, our 2 bed suite was a disappointment. Many of the cheaper 1 bed suites have balconies, the more expensive ($350 per night!) 2 beds don't. As a result of its position the suite was always dark and never got direct sunlight. And while the public areas (and in particular the pool and lobby) remain in good condition it just felt like it was getting shabby. There were signs of shabbiness in all the rooms but the large bedroom in particular where my wife and I slept just had an unacceptable amount of knocks and scuff marks everywhere. A bodged repair paint job on the AC unit had been done which looked horrible and there were some (minor) stains on the door (see photos). Obviously it is not realistic to expect a hotel to repaint walls every time a guest scuffs the walls, but this room was WAY overdue for redecoration. At the very least, a member of staff should have been in the room wiping down the walls with a bucket and sponge to clean the doors/walls to make it look less grubby. I did mention this (twice) to the front desk and they promised to pass it on to maintenance but they did not want to come see the issues for themselves (it felt like my complaint was not news to them) and nothing improved in my remaining 6 nights in the hotel. I hope the hotel are not trying to milk their reputation by under investing in upkeep of the rooms. I can't recommend the 2 bed suites, particularly at the price Magic Castle now charge, and I would be cautious about going back to any of their rooms unless I had confidence that the room was in good decorative order.

No disrespect to Trip Adv as the rest of my USA holiday was based from its reviews on accommodation and local attractions were spot on, but this place left a very sour taste in our mouths in an otherwise great overseas holiday. We holidayed in Vegas, NYC, Tennessee, and (in the end, alternate LA accommodation) and this place was a disgrace!. We arrived at about 3.30-4pm in the afternoon and (after struggling by ourselves with about 6 bags of our luggage up the stairs) were greeted by a polite young man and woman who greeted us with a glass of soda squash each. We were informed that the room we requested with a roll away wasn't available, but they had organized a room with all our bedding requirements in their \"sister apartments above the current hotel next to a Japanese restaurant\". I asked if the rooms were of the same standards as the original rooms I viewed on the net, and she replied \"oh yes but with a much more fantastic view\". I thought OK until she said' and we will also drop your room rate back to $99 a night\". And that's when the alarm bell started. We were shuttled up the hill by the young man Marcus(who always I must say was polite through this) to a what looked liked a 'hostel\" complex. He unloaded our luggage and pointed to a hallway which was partially blocked by bags of rubbish to venture down to find our room. By this time my family and I were extremely concerned, but after Marcus opened the door ushered us in and quickly departed we noticed our concern was more than warranted. This place was a disgrace. The tiles were chipped, stained, and where the tiles met the fridge there was a 1-2 inch gap full of dirt and grit. And this was at the kitchen near the entrance. The blinds were falling off the ceiling, paint peeling off the walls and veranda and numerous stains everywhere. I sat stunned, and I never complain as a rule but i was really ##** off at this point, and so I rang reception and said to Marcus, this room was not up to my expectations of this hotel and could I be moved back to my original booking at the previous hotel. He said\"oh, i will ring you back\". He then rang back and said\" we have had some flooding in your original room that was booked and it is undergoing repairs, and if this current room isn't adequate I will give you assistance in finding another room at another hotel\". I replied to Marcus, if this was the case why wasn't I contacted by phone or email, and sensing his nervousness, I asked when the flooding occurred, and his response was \"I don't know\". I then informed him that I had only booked this room from the reviews on Trip Advisor and only then he informed me he would ring and talk to his manager. He rang me back about five minutes later and said I could have a room in the original hotel the next night and they would comp my current room for that nights stay. I declined and asked him to find me alternate accommodation elsewhere. He could find nothing to my liking so a found accommodation elsewhere myself. All up I felt humiliated that I was, I think duped of my original room, and told a falsity about the flooding, due to the fact that if a flooding had occurred that someone would have known when. Every other hotel I stayed in the states including my final hotel in LA was above my expectations of room and service. This place was disgrace! AND SO WERE THE ROOMS.

Positives: From the outside, this hotel looks like most others. But once you get inside, you quickly notice the difference \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the service and attitude of all staff. Staff were friendly and helpful at all times, happy to chat and offer advice on things to see and do, and the best way to get there. Upon checking in, we were provided with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153welcoming\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 glass of bubbly, which set the scene for the outstanding service we experienced throughout our stay at Magic Castle. This trip was to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary, so when we arrived at the room, we were met with a chocolate cake and bottle of wine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c another nice touch. The 2 bedroom suite was very spacious, containing a queen bed in each of the 2 large bedrooms, as well as a double sofa-bed in the (large) living room. There was a fully equipped kitchen, a dining table that seated 6 comfortably, and generally plenty of space in which to make ourselves at home. Location is superb - a block from Hollywood Blvd, the Kodak Theatre, buses and other attractions. A 5 minute walk to the grocery store, less than 10 minutes to the Hollywood Highland shopping centre and metro station (2 stops to Universal Studios on the metro). But it was the little extras that sets the Magic Castle apart. As mentioned, all staff were friendly, helpful and looked like they actually enjoyed their jobs. On tops of this, free snacks and soda/juices are available from reception, and at night there was a warm cider on offer in the lobby. The hotel offers free DVDs (great for kids after a busy day in LA), free pool-side continental breakfast with a great selection of hot and cold food and drinks, heated swimming pool. And each night, a weather card would be left on our beds (accompanied by mint chocolates) outlining tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weather forecast. And each morning, we woke to a newspaper at our door. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s these nice touches that you just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get from most hotels that sets the Magic Castle apart. Sparkling wine on arrival, free snacks from reception, heated pool, free DVDs, lovely pool-side breakfast, weather cards every evening and newspapers every morning, nothing too much trouble for staff, cake and wine on arrival, papers and weather Rooms are spacious, with a full kitchen, large dining and living area, though furniture is a little outdated and worn. But more than made up for by the service and location (2 stops to Universal Studios on the metro) Negatives: Some of the furniture is a little outdated, but certainly adequate and clean. Guests have to pay for computer access (though free wi-fi is available for those with a laptop), which was outside and poorly lit at night. Parking is $10/day (though is undercover and secure). We were fortunate (unfortunate) to be in LA on Oscars night 2010, and the room price went up by 60% for that night in comparison to the other nights of our stay. Summary: Next time I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in LA, I would not hesitate to stay at the Magic Castle. The 2 bedroom suite is spacious and perfect for families. But it is the service that won me over \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the attitude of the staff and the little extras offered to guests make you feel very welcome.", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakland, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for family trip to L.A.\u201d", "Author": "ashear", "ReviewID": "UR60608199", "Content": "We spent three nights at The Magic Castle with our kids, who are 8 and 11, and it was a perfect place to stay in L.A. with our kids.

We didn't mind the 10 minute walk at all. We had no problems checking in; we were there early but there was a room available for us. The room was quaint. I don't have high expectations. As long as the room was clean, I was happy. We only stayed for 3 nights but it was very enjoyable and very worth it. There was unlimited candies, chocolates and snacks (though you do have to ask).

Our stay was truly amazing, and I would certainly visit again on my next trip to the States! Initial impressions are great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the outside of the building looks like a castle right in Los Angeles! We were greeted by a very friendly staff member and checked-in swiftly, he even provided some complimentary lemonade and the icing on the cake was a free room upgrade to a suite! The suite we stayed in was huge, very clean and modern. We were provided with a well sized kitchen, lounge area with television, bathroom, balcony and a bedroom with plenty of storage space. The quality of furnishing was very good, the only fault I could find with the room was the lack of a bar of soap but all the other complementary products were provided (so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t smell ;-)) The maid service is highly efficient and seems to be a round the clock service. The rooms are cleaned very well; the maids also clear the tables in public areas and the poolside. I was also impressed with the turn down service in the evening, the knock at the door in the evening was a nice surprise. The staff were very friendly and helpful, continually offering us complimentary beverages and snacks, whilst swimming in the pool I was offered an Ice Lolly from a cheery staff member! The continental breakfast service is also a nice light start to the day. Cereals, croissants, fruit, coffee and juice are all laid on in the morning around the pool area. Further to this, we were told that we could request free beverages and snacks anytime from the front desk. Another demonstration of the high level of customer care. Finally, the location was amazing for sigh seeing. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re literally a block away from the walk of fame and unlike a fair amount of L.A., the surrounding area feels safe and comfortable. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a comfortable place to stay and do some sightseeing and relaxing.

We'd originally planned to stay just one night, as LA was our halfway point in a long road trip. But we were having so much fun we decided to extend our stay by a day. Luckily another room was available. It's a great place for somewhat older kids. I don't think I'd want to be here with really young kids. There are a *lot* of stairs and an unsupervised swimming pool. The first one-bedroom suite we had (I think it was Room #313) had a king-size bed in the bedroom & a sofa bed in the living room. It was away from the street & its noise, but the room was a little musty. Something about it really aggravated my husband's allergies. The second suite we moved into (#303, I think) had two full-size beds in the bedroom and faced the street. The beds felt crowded, but we still had the sofa bed in the living room as an extra place to sleep, and the street noise wasn't too bad. This room didn't bother my husband at all. The hotel is on the older side, and could probably use some renovation. Do note that the kitchens aren't really equipped. You can't really cook here. They didn't really even have enough silverware or glasses for four people, although I'm sure the front desk staff would have given us more if we'd asked for it. It was perfect for serving take-out, however. The breakfasts they provide are great and bountiful. Get there on the early side (before 8:30) to avoid the rush. The best thing about this place is the staff. Everyone we encountered was really friendly and helpful. The free snacks from the front desk were a huge hit with my kids, as were the free DVD rentals. I was grateful for the laundry facilities. (Bring quarters for the machines.) It's an easy walk to Hollywood Blvd & the famous stuff there, although frankly, one venture down that street was enough for us. It was a bit of a mob scene, and the street itself is not that nice. A nicer walk was behind the hotel, up the steep road that leads to Yamashiro, the pricey Japanese restaurant housed in the faux Japanese castle at the top of the hill. We didn't go to the restaurant, but my son & I had fun exploring the grounds. Great views from the top. As for food, we recommend 25 Degrees, the burger place right nearby. Good fries, good burgers; good beer; friendly wait staff (only the shakes seemed overpriced & underwhelming). I would *not* recommend Kung Pao Kitty, the Chinese restaurant on Hollywood Blvd. The blandest Chinese I've ever had.

The apartment had 2 double bedrooms one larger than the other but both adequate, a good size kitchen which had a table that you could eat at and a bathroom with a bath and separate shower. The kitchen & bathroom are what my sister referred to as retro! The paint was pealing off the bathroom walls but the apartment was very clean so this was not really an issue. The free WiFi was handy but signal was weak in our apartment The pool was great open 24hrs, breakfast was included in the room price and was laid out in reception and eaten by the pool. There was a wide selection of small boxed cereals, pastries and breads, no cooked food. The location was great just one street back from Hollywood boulevard which was also good for public transport. Although there was trafic noise most of the time. The only problem we had was that there was only one mirror in the whole apartment in the bathroom with 4 adults trying to get ready for a night out we ran into some problems.", "Date": "April 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel !!!\u201d", "Author": "FriszFamily", "ReviewID": "UR26621817", "Content": "We spent 4 nights at the Magic Castle Hotel in Hollywood.

Chose the location for the purpose of attending the R.E.M. concert at the Hollywood Bowl (wanted a hotel not far from the venue). We had also stayed here in October 2004 and loved it then so we knew what to expect. Stayed in a 1 bedroom suite at the back of the hotel up a few flights of stairs. We had some heavy suitcases and the staff was quick to help us with the bags. In fact all the staff were amazing, everyone was pleasant, friendly and willing to help at all times. One feature we loved which wasn't there in 2004 was the free soda/water/snacks available any time from the front desk. A fantastic feature and makes you feel so much more welcome than having a weight sensor in a mini bar that charges you a fortune for just lifting an item! Free wi-fi is also provided. The room was fantastic, as good as it was the first time we stayed. It's really like staying in an apartment it's that big, living room, dvd player, kitchen (full size fridge as well) and separate bedroom and bathroom, it was a fantastic suite. The only downside was the tv was still an old analog tube one that had average fuzzy picture quality. Maybe by now with digital tv here they have been replaced? A really nice pool was in the center of the hotel with the rooms around it. Breakfast was provided and really nice, cereal, toast, bagels, muffins etc., a great start to the day. When it's busy though there's not enough chairs and tables for everyone unless you take it back to your room. We did some washing in the laundry room, free washing liquid was provided, another little way you feel like you're not getting squeezed for every dollar like a lot of hotels these days. The location is fantastic for exploring Hollywood. Short walk to Hollywood and Highland and main Hollywood area. First time we stayed here we used the subway to get to Universal Studios which is extremely convenient and cheaper than a taxi or paying for parking. It's main benefit though this time was for the short distance to Hollywood Bowl, which is not too far away (we caught the bus from Hollywood and Highland to get there, but you could easily walk). Hollywood still felt like a rough area, particularly at night, it's not an area we felt safe walking in, particularly away from the Hollywood and Highland shopping area.

All of the staff was friendly, helpful, ready with great suggestions for dinner, always offering free snacks and sodas. I can't say enough good things about them. That said, this isn't a five-star resort, so don't expect the rooms to be elegant. They're basically a converted apartment -- living room, dining area, kitchen, bathroom and separate bedroom. We loved that one of us could be watcing tv in the living room while the other slept late and since the bedroom had a door, there was no noise. It was great to have a fridge and a stove/oven, too so we could heat up leftovers and chill a bottle of wine. The rooms could use a little updating, though, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. Everything was extremely clean, but definitely some wear-and-tear -- old paint on the tiles in the bathroom, cracks on the concrete walkways to the rooms, and wall units for air conditioners (which worked extremely well but were a little noisy). It didn't bother us in the least, but if you're used to everything being modern and perfectly maintained, this might not be the hotel for you. The location was great -- 1 block walk from Kodak Theatre and Mann's Chinese, a few more blocks walk for shopping, restaurants and pubs (we liked Happy Ending for a beer -- definitely try the andouille corn dogs, the food was incredible for a pub). We felt safe walking in the neighborhood, even at night. One more thing to mention about the hotel -- you can go to Magic Castle if you're staying here. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience (a private members-only club) to see magicians perform up close. We probably saw 8 different shows + dinner over about 5 hours and the magicians were incredible. Make sure you go early, when it opens, so you can get in line for the best shows -- and prepare to wait -- we went on a Saturday night and had to wait 1 hour+ for the best shows (there were at least 250 people there). Dinner was good but pricey - $135 for two with one glass of wine each. And you do have to wear jackets and ties for men, very dressy dresses for women, we saw lots of people in black tie.

That was quite a pleasant surprise, but I guess after reading all the plaudits here for their service, it shouldn't be so suprising at all. The suite was obviously an old 1930's apartment, with some great architectual details - a living room, kitchen, huge bathroom, and two big bedrooms. Closets galore, and some really great toiletries. The furnishings, paint, etc. could use an upgrade, they were a bit shabby, and there was an odd smell in the entire suite. Several of the obviously new plantation shutters had some damage, which was a shame, as they looked great. The continental breakfast in the morning was much appreciated - nothing special, but very convenient. And the free snacks, soda, water, etc. at any time are a great plus.

There was good parking with underground facilities, but a charge of $10 per night, which I hadn't noticed when we booked. Lots of nice touches - a huge bottle of iced water with cucumber in the lobby to refresh guests, which was great, as well as a free \"mini bar\" facility. You just had to ask at reception for any drinks, chips, chocolate etc, plus they supplied DVDs free of charge to watch in your room. The staff were very friendly and there were always enough on duty at reception to deal with guests with promptly. The complimentary breakfast by the pool was good. Not a massive selection, but enough to choose from by way of fresh fruit, yoghurt, granola, cereals, toast and cakes, as well as coffee and tea. Get up early to get a table by the pool though! The hotel isn't licenced, which was a bit disappointing when we arrived after a very long flight, desperate for a nice cold beer.

We checked right in (did not get the welcome drink everyone talks about and I saw others get when they checked in) to a bottom floor room facing the pool that I had requested when I booked directly with the hotel. We like the room right away because of the size ( we just came from a much smaller room in san fran.) My son was in his glory with the free snacks that were given to him with a smile every time. I also made use of this feature on beach days and we must of saved a good one hundred bucks overall getting snacks before we left for the day. We swam one night the pool was clean and heated with nice music playing. We loved the baked goods in the morning the best of any continental breakfast we ever had. Another great feature of the hotel is they have washer and dryers. we were on vacation for two weeks so we need to do some wash. washer was one dollar per load and dryer around seventy five cents. They give you free laundry detergent. This hotel is everything this web site claims it to be. Friendly hard working staff, clean, great location , and with All the freebies its a good value for families. I have to give a shout out to the housekeeping staff. perfect service never knocking on door when we slept in and room always spotless when we returned with the extra turn down service you don't see much any more in this class hotel. Now I do have one complaint and its pretty significant. the air conditioning system is old and very loud which made it hard for me to get a good nights rest. Besides the noise the room temp changed from hot to cold all night long blankets on blankets off. I was unable to get up as early as I usually do making my mornings a little rushed. I never complained about this to management because moving rooms was not an option for me ( I hate doing that more then anything) and I read that was a problem so I suspected all the rooms were like that.

We, a family of four, stayed in a 1 bedroomed apartment for four days in mid July and we were allocated room 210 which is located at the back of the hotel with a balcony with a view over the pool. There was plenty of space for us all, and plenty of cupboard space as well. For your dollar you get a large double bedroom, a large living room with sofa bed, a kitchenette with space for four people to sit and eat and a bathroom with all the nececessaries. Continental breakfast, which you collect in reception and eat either in your room, balcony or beside the pool, is included in the price, there is covered car parking available at $10 per day, a very cosy pool/courtyard area and free snacks and soft drinks all day. If you want to stay in the middle of the Hollywood action, the location is perfect, just a few minutes walk from Hollywood/Highland. There are drawbacks, however. There is no lift and we saw plenty of people struggling with their cases up and down the stairs, although we were lucky enough to have a staff member help us on checking in. Do NOT expect luxury furniture and fittings - our bathroom had screw holes in the wall and mould around the bath partition. Finally, the outdoor walkways to and between the rooms are dimly lit and not particularly clean - although the rooms themselves are absolutely fine. What makes this place the top rated hotel in LA is the service. I have stayed in many hotels in many countires and I have never experienced a better standard of service. All the staff managed to hit exactly the right combination of friendliness and efficiency. Nothing was too much trouble. We were given directions to the subway, recommendations of where to eat, what to see and even how to tip.They gave us free passes to the nearby LA Fitness facility and a lift up to the wonderful Yamashiro restaurant further up the hill. They booked us tickets for the Magic Castle and insisted on driving us the 100 meters to the front door because my wife was wearing high heels. All the staff deserve the high praise you can read in these reviews. Truely exceptional.

If you are a family with lots of kids who would sacrifice room quality for quantity (size), the Magic Castle is perfect for you. If you don't have kids, you may be disappointed in the quality of the rooms. The staff at the Magic Castle is the best I have ever seen in the US. They go out of their way to smile, assist, and otherwise be polite. As an example, I asked for directions to NBC studios, and they promptly looked up the best route on mapquest.com, and gave me the printout, while concurrently advising me of the best / worst times to drive. Unlike other hotels that have a good staff, at the Magic Castle they seem very sincere. They deserve the oft-mentioned recognition. However, there is one downside: the check-in counter is very narrow (as is the front entrance), so they can only serve one person at a time...when they try to accommodate 2 guests, it becomes quite chaotic. The location is also excellent. Its one long block off of Hollywood Blvd, so its easy to walk there. The room comes with free WiFi and the 'free mini-bar' was also a nice touch. The breakfast may not fill up some people, but I was personally happy with it. I had a suite and the room was huge--much more than my wife and I needed. It would be great for kids. Unfortunately, the bathroom was very small, with peeling paint and tiles and an unintentional retro look of the 70's. The beds, carpeting, and furniture looked like it was several decades old, though the bedding was excellent and the downturn service--complete with tomorrow's temperature and soft music on the new stereo--was very nice. Sadly, it seems lost on the tiny TV and cheap (thin and harsh) towels...the plusses and the minuses cancel each other out. There was one other major disappointment with this room. The first was noise. It may be far enough from Hollywood Blvd to not hear anything there, but if you're on the ground floor with a room on Franklin Ave, good luck trying to sleep unless you turn up the tiny AC unit and drown everything out with white noise. Trucks seem to rumble on Franklin all night long, and you can hear every footstep in the room above you. I would have switched rooms but I also knew the hotel was full during my stay, so I didn't bother. As comfortable as the bedding was, it was hard to sleep with all the racket. If my wife and I return with our kids, we would definitely stay here again--there's lots of room for them to run around, and the cheapness of the room will alleviate any fears of their misbehavior. Based on this scenario, I could see them as being the best that LA has to offer. But would I return without them? I am sorry, but I could not recommend it.

The front desk called within an hour to tell us the room was ready. I had asked to be put on a waiting list for a 2 bedroom but there weren't any available. They offered to move us if we wanted the next day when one became available. The thought of packing up again didn't appeal to us so we stayed put! The room was fine- very clean and spacious with plenty of space to have 4 people spread out. We had 2 yound adult kids with us- 18 & 20. The 20 yr old got the sleeper sofa and the daughter shared the 2 queen beds with us in the bedroom. The bathroom was small but certainly adequate and it was nice to be able to open the window as there wasn't a fan.

The parking garage is really different- you need 2 people to operate the entry system and it is very tight quarters. We never used the pool- it was closed the day we arrived -very milky white.

My only concern was when we checked out there were 2 calls from our room which we never made. We had cell phones and honestly never even saw the room phone. Also- there was no one in LA for us to call! It was a local # and I would bet that housekeeping probably used the phone. That was the day we were at the beach the whole day. We paid the $2 fee and that was the end of it. It could use a coat of paint to spruce things up but other than that- it was great and we would return.

There is an adjacent restaurant and from the street it appears that the doors for the hotel lobby are actually the restaurant entrance.

The check in was a very friendly and welcoming experience; I was given a glass of complimentary lemonade and also an overview to the local area. I was also informed of the complimentary 24/7 mini bar! My initial impressions after the check in were very positive. Hotel The room itself was not a suite, but a king bed. The bed was very comfortable and it actually has a proper duvet as opposed to a single sheet that is very common in hotels. The bathroom was also nice, particularly the shower which was a large walk in style with sliding doors. The stairway leading up to our hotel could have done with a paint job and a bit of an update, but a minor complaint in such a fantastic place. Also provided was a large LCD and DVD player. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to ask for a free DVD rental at reception! They have a large selection of complimentary DVD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that you can watch in your room. Overall the room was average looking and could probably do with an update, but it was adequate for our needs and we felt very comfortable. Glancing round the hotel, the suites look very cool! We also had a fridge freezer in our room, but no other kitchen facilities, useful for keeping our drinks in and that was about it. There is a well sized heated swimming pool in the centre of the hotel, which is an attractive feature to glance at when you walk through the reception area. The rooms are kind of built surrounding it and if you are lucky you will have a balcony overlooking the pool. The hotel also has a very secure and cosy feeling to it when you are roaming about. Breakfast is also included and is a very relaxing and fulfilling experience. They have a continental breakfast on display which was very satisfying. We relaxed by the pool enjoying our food with other guests, everyone seemed to be very happy and this created a positive atmosphere for your morning meal. A great start to the day! Another thing worth mentioning is the free mini bar they offer. You can go to the front desk and ask for anything off the menu for free. It is a good selection of snacks and drinks, very impressive and served to you with a smile always. The free wireless internet access was the only real upset here. It was a working service, but was very slow pretty much every day. It was useable, but not as fast as other hotels I have stayed in. It is also worth mentioning that as the hotel is small and cosy, the noise can sometimes be a bit frustrating. The main thing is slamming doors. Pretty much every morning I could hear doors slamming at early hours, I guess some people are just inconsiderate to others. Some hotel have devices on the doors to prevent them slamming, something the Magic Castle may want to invest in perhaps. Staff 100 percent the best hotel staff I have ever experienced. All of the staff at the Magic Castle are exceptional and provide the best service in any hotel I have stayed in. They all deserve a pay rise and are the backbone to this hotel. Every single person I spoke to was extremely helpful and also happy to listen to what I had to say. They also demonstrated going that extra mile on many occasions, Example 1: Myself and my partner were relaxing by the pool when one of the staff approached us offering us bottled water or a popsicle!, perfect to quench us whilst bathing in the hot sun. Example 2: I went to the front desk and asked for a DVD for the evening, the lady then said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchow about some popcorn to go with that?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 I actually didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a microwave in my room, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry they then offered to microwave it for me and bring it to our room! 2 minutes later there was a knock on the door and we had our delicious popcorn ready to eat. Outstanding customer service and what was more impressive was the fact we never actually had to request any of this, it was simply offered to us. If you want to feel welcome in a hotel this is the place to come! Another thing I found quite nice was a knock on the door each night with a card detailing the weather for the next day and also some free chocolate! Location We arrived at Union Station by Amtrak rail and the cab was 25 bucks to the hotel. About 8 miles I believe. Not too bad! The good thing is that this hotel is just round the corner from the main walk of fame strip in Hollywood. It was very convenient to go back and forth from the hotel to the local attractions on offer at Hollywood Blvd. Perfect location for what we wanted. Overall This has to be the best overall hotel experience of my life. Whilst not necessarily being the best hotel in the world, The Magic Castle compensates by offering exceptional service and value for money, whilst also providing a location 2 minutes from the main features Hollywood has to offer. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Hollywood and I most certainly will return here if I am ever in the area.

The best asset that this hotel has is the staff - they truly are the most accommodating group of hotel staff that I have ever come across. I received the warmest, friendliest check in that I have ever had in my life. To me, the little touches is what differentiates good service from exceptional. To the welcome glass of lemonade, to the unlimited complimentary mini bar and the attitude that nothing you asked was any trouble - the service was first class. They make you feel like they are truly glad that you are their guest. I can only imagine that the owners must treat their staff well for all of them to be so happy. The worst asset of this hotel is the hotel itself. When I entered my room there was a very unusual and unpleasant odor in my room. I was only there for one night and was going to see 'Wicked' that evening so I didn't bother about asking to move rooms. However I got the feeling that the same smell would possibly be in the next room anyway. It was a mix of mustiness and cleaning product. It didn't go and was still there the next morning. The hotel room was extremely generous in size, especially for one person, however it was in bad shape. The kitchen and bathroom felt dirty; they weren't but they seemed like they were because they are so old. The security did not feel that great. From what I could see (and I could be wrong) there was only one door separating the guest rooms from the reception area (which anyone can walk into). I walked straight into the reception area and to my hotel room without anyone seeing me and as all the rooms have an outside entrance it kind of felt a little unsafe to me. It is close to Hollywood Boulevard however for those people visiting LA for the first time, I think it is better to stay in an area like West Hollywood or Beverly Hills. I spent one night at Magic Castle and another two at the Chamberlain in West Hollywood (I had always planned it this way), I felt so relieved when I got to the Chamberlain - I could just relax and not feel so on edge. Very long story short - the Magic Castle is conveniently located, has wonderful accommodating staff and offers a very good rate. However, when I visit LA I go there to relax by the pool and chill out. I think you can do this much better and in much more style at the Chamberlain (which charges a higher rate however).", "Date": "June 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - Needs updating\u201d", "Author": "Marcus_Garvey", "ReviewID": "UR16692196", "Content": "Great Location but needs updating.

The kitchen facilities were adequate although we didn't make full use of them. We got some takeout from a good local convenience store on Hollywood Blvd., about 10 minutes walk away, with a nice variety of prepared asian & western foods, but the oven, microwave, etc. in the kitchen were very handy. The room wasn't as modern as some generic hotel rooms, but it had a 40's/50's charm that you can't get in a modern hotel room, and certainly the rooms and bathrooms were clean. The staff was wonderful, even offered to drive us to the top of the hill to the Japanese restaurant, for us to admire the amazing view of Hollywood and L.A. We walked back down again, but I'm sure they would have picked us up had we requested it. Snacks were free upon request, as were DVD's from their extensive video library. The staff was always cheerful and friendly, and seem to enjoy working there! The location is great, about 2 blocks from the Chinese theater and Hollywood Blvd., but far enough away that noise was not really an issue, despite the hotel's location on a fairly busy street (although not a major boulevard). We didn't use the pool, but we did see a number of families using it. The nice breakfast buffet (included in the price) was a real plus; guests can either take their trays and sit by the pool, or bring them to their rooms to eat there.

The location was ideal for us, but the hotel left much to be desired. It's not that the accommodations themselves were bad, but that you feel like second class citizens when you stay in one of those trendy places. We had to show our room keys in order to get into the pool, only to find that many of the poolside seats were reserved for people who were apparently more important than we. And who, most days, didn't even seem to show. Not to mention the fact that if you wanted to enjoy the pool you had better do it early, because it was off limits at night, as this is where the trendy outdoor bar is located. Which we didn't even try to get into. For our second trip to Hollywood, we were to have more people with us, requiring an additional room. With the Roosevelt out of the equation, our only reasonable options seemed to be the Hollywood Renaissance and the Magic Castle. And by reasonable, I mean somewhere you'd want to stay. Because there is nothing reasonable about the prices at the Renaissance. The fact that the Magic Castle offered two bedroom suites with full kitchen for the price of one room at the Renaissance is what really sealed the deal for us. Though I did have my concerns after reading some of the reviews on here. Those concerns were largely unfounded. Upon arrival we were greeted with sparkling lemonade and a menu for the free mini bar, offering everything from sodas and candy to chips and granola bars. We made good use of the mini bar during our stay, even receiving more of the sparkling lemonade as requested. And, although we did not end up using the in-room DVD player, I could see that they had a healthy selection of free rentals on hand behind the front desk, even such recent releases as The Simpsons Movie. Unlike our experience at the Roosevelt, seating at the pool was first come first served. And the pool did not close at dusk, or even at all. Which proved to be a bad thing a few nights into our trip as the rowdy group of twenty-somethings who had checked in next door to us engaged in a late night (3:00 AM) swim with no regard for their fellow guests. But after a call to the front desk, the woman on duty sent for security (I don't blame her for not wanting to handle it herself) and shortly thereafter we were able to get back to sleep. With the Magic Castle, we were able to stay in the same location as the Roosevelt, but with much better service for the common man. The rooms were nice and clean, if a bit dated. And though I'm no interior designer, there seemed to be more they could do with the space. But that didn't really matter. What did matter was we had more than enough room to accommodate our party and were treated as well as you could ask. Other nice touches you won't find most other places; the poolside popsicles provided by the staff, the free continental breakfast, and the nightly mints and weather forecast card for the following day. And, though the room description indicated that only one of the bedrooms would have a TV (in addition to the one in the living room), we actually had one in each room.

The staff was welcoming, and the hotel had lots of perks included. They gave us a welcome glass of lemonade and a list of DVDs you can borrow for free. The staff really went out of their way to provide excellent customer service. At least, that's how it seemed. THEN...We borrowed a DVD from the front desk. We went into the room and saw that the DVD player was missing. We went ahead and asked the girl at the front desk about it. She seemed very surprised and said there would be one in the room when we got back that evening. We got back to our room at about 10 pm, ready to settle into our movie. We were stopped by the guy at the front desk and told that they couldn't get the color to work on the DVD player, so we'd have to watch it in black and white. (Seriously?) This is when we realized that the customer service during our arrival was just an act. We thought, ok, that's ridiculous, but we'll suck it up and watch black and white. We turn on the system and realize the DVD player not only has no color but no sound. Additionally, the picture looked so pixelated, it was basically unwatchable. I called the front desk to ask how they could resolve this situation. The girl told me she'd have to call me back in 5 minutes so she could talk to the manager. Fine. 10 minutes later, she called to tell me that the room description did not guarantee a DVD player, so we were out of luck. Now I started getting upset. Most hotels would offer to move you to a different room or comp you in some way. NOT THE MAGIC CASTLE. I asked to be moved. She said she couldn't do that, so I asked to speak to the manager. Coincidentally, she had left 5 minutes before. She would talk to the supervisor, who was on his break. He'd call back in 5 minutes. 15 minutes later, she called back to say that the only room they had was a suite. If we wanted to move, we'd have to pay an extra $30 for the \"upgrade.\" Now I was getting really upset at the horrible service. I asked her if she would rather have an empty room and an upset customer. \"There's nothing I can do unless you want to pay the extra money.\" I told her there was no way I was paying extra to get the services that they had promised me when I checked in. 20 minutes go by, and she calls back to offer a complimentary move to the suite. It is now 11 pm! When we checked out, the girl at the front desk asked how our stay was. I told her we had some problems. Her response: \"I'm sorry to hear that.\" Seriously, that was it! No follow-up. No offers to make things right. Nothing. And the last straw was that when we got our bill, there was a $10 parking charge that is neither listed on their website nor mentioned when they give you the parking permit. Lastly, these rooms are renovated in the cheapest way I have ever seen. Door jams look like they've been broken into. The tubs were resurfaced and are now peeling.

I am a light sleeper and heard NOTHING. We enjoyed the free snacks, excellent location, reasonable parking ($10) and friendly staff. The free breakfast was great and the rooms were clean.

We didn't use the pool but some kids used it whilst we were there and seemed to be having a ball. Now for the not so great:- We (or I should say my husband) had to struggle up the stairs with our cases without any assistance The bath had a little bit of mould around the grouting but the bathroom itself was otherwise clean they alos provided fluffy robes The furniture was a little scruffy in places and could do with being updated. This was true of the hotel in general, it is in need of an upgrade especially the main reception, walkways and stairs. All in all these things were not a big deal and really didn't spoil our stay. The suite we stayed in had a fully equiped kitchen: microwave cooker, fridge freezer with ice tray coffee maker. The living area was spacious with generous seating a tv and satelite and DVD player. The bedroom was very comfortable with a king size bed lovely! it also had ample wardrobe space and tv and satelite and lovely lighting. We could not hear much road noise as we were at the back but I have to say that the walls are very thin and could almost make out the conversation the people below us were having. But that said, luckily we did not have any noisy neighbours during our stay. The hotel is in a great location within walking distance to the Kodak Theatre and other attractions, most tours pick up from this hotel too. Most attractions were no more than 20 mins drive away. I think it's fair to say that what made the stay good for us was the amazing staff (we have stayed at some top hotels but I have to say that the staff here rival those) who were more that happy to help with anything from turning on the heating system almost immediately when asked and booking our tour which was brill!!. Oh and not to forget the free mini bar snacks and drinks that were availiable 24hrs and DVD supplies. If it's luxury you're after then this is not the place for you.

The Magic Castle Club adjoining the hotel gives membership to hotel guests but bear in mind if you have children you will only be allowed to take them in for Sunday Brunch, all other times is Adult only. Having said that the Brunch was excellent and great magic shows to accompany it. There is a strict dress code but relaxed a little for the Brunch. So why only the average rating ? Safe parking in underground car park but $10 per day and we were charged for all 16 nights although we only parked in the garage on 13 of the 16 days being away in San Diego and Las Vegas for a few days. Our big dissapointment was our room, room 108 which was a suite but in a bad position being on the gorund floor the view from the windows was a derelict falling down fence at the back of the hotel. The suite was also in bad need of decoration and refurbishment, no handles on the wardrobe doors, loose electrical sockets, the fridge wasn't working although was quickly replaced. The bathroom was the worst being in a very poor state of repair, although clean. The Plumbing system was very noisy so if anyone in an adjoining room decide to have a shower in the early hours you could not fail to wake up.

The continental breakfast wasn't really gourmet, but certainly there were some nice pastries and hey - it's free! On the downside our room was barely big enough for cat swinging and the recent renovations themselves look like they need some renovating. Our main complaint was that our room was really noisy. The walls are paper thin and, apparently unlike the other guests, we are in the minority as we like to sleep until 9.30am or so when we are on vacation. Sadly we were woken daily at 7am by stomping up and down stairs outside, doors slamming and whoever happened to be in the room next door - thanks to an adjoining door they literally sounded as though they were in the same room as us. Also slightly off-putting - the ashtray for our floor was right outside our window and by our air conditioning unit so a few times we had the A/C on only to find moments later our room smelling of smoke. Also pretty annoying was the lack of regulation of hot water in the shower - every day there was leaping in and out of the stream of water from either being scalded or frozen. It's a sad indictment of LA hotels that this is ranked the best hotel - it is not the worst I have ever stayed in, but it's no star.

We were able to walk with a 7 year old child to the El Capitan and watch a Film, great fun as they still have an Organist playing in the cinema before the film starts.

It's not fancy or luxurious, but it's clean, bright, the rooms are large, and the staff is absolutely wonderful. The hotel has a \"family\" feel to it, although there were singles there as well. The pool was great, right in the middle of the courtyard. And, late in the afternoon, a staff member comes and offers lemonade and popsicles to the people in and around the pool - free of charge! Upon arrival to Magic Castle, the reception staff offer champagne flutes with lemonade in them. Breakfast is complimentary and quite adequate - cereals, fruit, pastries, bread, spreads, coffee, juice, etc. Soft drinks and snacks are available at the front desk, any time of day, and are also complimentary! We could walk to Hollywood Blvd. in 5 minutes, where we visited Graumann's Theater, the Walk of Fame, the Kodak Theater and lots of interesting shops. There is also a Metro stop right there, so you can take the subway wherever you need to go. What made the Magic Castle Hotel so special to us was the staff. On our second last day, we found out that our pet cat (we've had her 12 years) was very ill and would probably pass away at any moment. I informed the front desk staff that we would have to check out a day early and they were very understanding. A few minutes after I had gone back to my room, one of the staff knocked on the door and gave us a little card they had made for us, saying they hoped our cat would be alright. They also gave us a little stuffed mouse for her to play with. So to Gretchen, Adam, Shawn and (I think) Daphne, thank you so much for your kindness and hospitality. We will definitely return!! And to anyone considering staying at the Magic Castle, go for it. We've never experienced such helpful and friendly people as we did there.

We had a small balcony overlooking the pool area which was also lovely. Of course as has been said may times the service is second to none. It more than makes up for any shortcomings that the property may have ( although I cant find any!). Gretchens team are the most helpful and friendly reception staff I have ever come across. Advice on sightseeing, directions, restaurants were all willingly provided. Complimentary mini bar went down well with the kids. The breakfast was excellent, providing fresh pastries/scones/muffins etc. We were also delighted to recieve a tasty calamari appetizer compliments of the hotel when we visited the Asian restaurant situated above the hotel( fantastic food and views). The location of the hotel was also perfect, a short 5 min walk taking us into centre of Hollywood and Highland. We had a fabulous time in LA, partly due to the MCH.

I know people don't like it when people give bad reviews. If you read my review you will probably think \"well that guy is picky or a snob\" or \"this guy is an idiot that has never travelled because look at all the positive reviews\". Just so you know where I am coming from and can better judge whether or not you believe my bad review. I'm a 30 year old professional and have done a lot of travelling - some for business and a lot for fun. I'm from Toronto. I've travelled extensively in the United States. I know that this place is a 3 star hotel and not a 5 star hotel. I understand that in a major North American city that $180 is not a lot to spend for a nights stay in a downtown location. All I expect from a 3 star hotel is: clean and current decor in the lobby and rooms but nothing flashy, basic amenities like internet and a desk to do some work on, and reasonable staff that are polite and moderately helpful. If this place had all of these things I would have given it a 5 rating or said it was excellent. I was on my honeymoon and I would not come back to this hotel. My main complaint is the rooms. I'd rather just spend an extra $75 or $100 a night to stay somewhere decent. If I had known what this hotel was really like I would have gladly dropped the extra cash somewhere else. I paid about $180 bucks for a Thursday night stay - too expensive for what it was. - Cons - The pictures on the website are misleading because they don't show you the grungy bathrooms, noisy window unit air-conditioners, or stained carpets. The room also had a musty smell which I might expect in Mexico or South America but not in the United States. I was pretty disgusted with our first room and asked to be moved. The next room was still grungy but slightly better. Honestly, this place needs to change the carpets in the rooms. It could use a complete overhaul, however, it definitely needs new carpets. I know that the rooms are probably just as clean or dirty as any other hotel but when the carpets are beat up and stained it just makes you feel like you need to wear shoes in the room at all times. Both the rooms had a dirty $30 a night motel feel about them. - Pros - Good location to do all the tacky Hollywood stuff (visit Mann's theatre, the walk of fame, etc.). Friendly and helpful staff during the day time. The night time staff llooked like they were into goth, demons and depression. Maybe I'm getting old but I'm not into hotel staff having lip rings and blue hair (I don't know if they were friendly or helpful because I didn't bother talking to them). The pool was open 24 hours (but looked pretty nasty and was more of kids urinal than a pool). Free WiFi for your laptop. Nice soaps, creams, and stuff. Pretty comfortable bed and bedding. Free snacks and DVDs that are available in the lobby. - How is this #2 on TripAdvisor???? - Because of this hotel and it's #2 rating in Los Angeles, I don't know whether I will ever trust TripAdvisor ratings again. Are travellers so enamoured by friendly staff and free candy bars that they overlook the rooms being disgusting and in drastic need of renovation. The only thing magical about this place is that it somehow got a #2 rating on TripAdvisor. Don't stay here if you want to spend anytime at all in your room or at the hotel. This place is NOT romantic. It might be okay for famillies with kids because you can get rooms with kitchenettes to save on dining costs. We just had a room without the kitchen.

This is a hotel with history and personality. It's not another Holiday Inn Express or whatever. It is also in the city, folks - yes, you will see homeless people, and yes, you will see interesting street life on Hollywood Boulevard. If that scares or upsets you, I would advise picking another area in which to sightsee. Hollywood may be undergoing some gentrification but it is not Disneyland. As everyone says, the front desk staff members go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied. I saw the manager all over the place all the time, not hiding back in an office. We had a king bed suite and the space was just huge. The kitchen and bathroom were very clean; I had no problem at all there. My favorite spot was the balcony over the pool, where you could sit and read the newspaper, watch the kids in the pool, or just drink your morning coffee before another day of sightseeing. Breakfast included the yummiest scones ever and top-notch coffee. Now, on the other hand, it is a remodeled older former apartment building and there are some irritants. The stairs and railings need paint, and some coverings on the stairs are coming loose. The carpet in the hallways is getting worn. There was a crack in the paint on one wall in our kitchen, and a small hole in a window. The stopper in the bathroom sink didn't work. Some of the housekeeping was a little spacey - plenty of forks and knives in the utensil drawer but no spoons, no glasses replaced one day, no bath mat another day. But if it really deeply mattered to me I am sure the desk would have sent up more spoons or another bath mat immediately. I think this is a great little hotel, and I'll be sad if it gets sold and turned into yet another condo development or generic hotel. The best option would be new owners who could spruce it up without raising the prices too much or losing the great staff members.

It seemed huge!!! Fresh towels were provided everyday, if we so wished, and the shower was so powerful that it certainly woke us up in a morning. There is a complimentary breakfast every morning in the courtyard. The scones are wonderful and the coffee was always hot, fresh and abundent. The pool is attractive, clean and heated.

Very rarely do you find this prevailing attitude among staff in American hotels.

They also let the Magic Castle know that it was my birthday and they made me feel special for Sunday brunch! Overall, service is quite nice; and it is very personalized touch. Enjoyable. One major note about the hotel - you need to be comfortable climbing stairs for almost all the rooms. We were on the 2nd floor and soon got used to climbing the 3 sets of stairs to reach our room. The rooms are large for families....and nice for young families...some have balconies....however do take note about the stairs. In general, the hotel knows where it needs to please its customers. It also seems to know its downsides and compensates by very personal and nice service. Its not the best in the area - but is a comfortable - and enjoyable stay.", "Date": "July 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "giantburrito", "Title": "\u201cVery nice ...

Our main man Shawn gave us the hook up with Snickers, Doritos, and M&M (yum!) for free at the front desk. For breakfast they had a spread of cereals, muffins, and \"scones\". To me, the scones were nothing more than a cookie in a funny shape. But I wasn't complaining - who doesn't love a cookie? In fact, I would eat cookies at every meal if I could. They're delicious. Anyway, the location is great. We walked over to the Chinese theatre place and saw Chewbacca (the REAL Chewbacca) walking around. Crazy. It was also easy to get over to West Hollywood for some all-you-can-eat tacos at Hamburger Mary's. They also have burgers and a whole lot of sausages available. The room was in good shape, particularly if you enjoy a jungle environment. One of the rooms did not have a working AC. They offered to give us another room, but we chose to stay. The way we saw it, it was like getting a free trip to the Rainforest Cafe every night. My only real issue with the place was the client\u00c3\u00a8le. On the 4th, a bunch of rabble rousing kids went into the pool. They were being a little loud and partying (one of them even doing a stripper pole dance in the pool) but who can blame them - it's the 4th of July! They all seemed really thirsty as well.

We reserved a one-bedroom suite and it included a living room with a pull-out sofa, a dining area, a full kitchen, patio with table and chairs, small bathroom and a separate bedroom with a king bed. One sign of their excellent customer service was that they had already placed a rollaway in the living room for my son before we arrived. The room had almost more closet space than my own house! The morning breakfast was adequate with offerings of delicious scones and assorted pastries, yogurt, fresh fruit, cereal and milk, juices and coffee. Our children enjoyed the heated swimming pool in the courtyard. The room itself needed some updating. The telephones, furnishings (bed and dresser, sofa bed) and the bathroom were very outdated. The A/C in the bedroom also was not sufficient to cool the room. My in-laws had a studio room which was more updated than ours and they were quite pleased with my choice of hotels!

The staff were ALL very customer-friendly. \"Service with a smile\" must be their motto.

This is the only property I've stayed at in the Hollywood area so I can't compare it to other nearby properties but feel that would be the fairest way to evaluate this property. I research my vacations to death and hadn't run across many properties that had such a uniform, overwhelming positive response so I felt this was a no-brainer. Three words best decribe this place: Location, Staff, and Location. Did I say location? As far as I can tell, if you want to be within walking distance of the center of the Hollywood Universe, this is a superb choice (although there is really not much to see besides the Walk of Fame, Chinese Theater, and the new Mall at Hollywood & Highland - otherwise this area is pretty cheesy/touristy definitely something you can see in a half day.) Nevertheless it is a good base from which to explore other surrounding areas. I'd say the reviews in general overhype this place a tad too much. The staff is on the ball and provide little 'extras' here and there like the champagne glass of lime pop when you check in, popsicles at the pool, the chocolates and weather report card in the evening. I guess these little things really impress people as many other properties don't make the small effort to do similar things. As a result, these little things they do help to give the illusion (yes pun intended) that this property is something very special. The reality is the rooms (at least ours and from reading some of the other reviews) are spacious and clean, but bit run-down and apparently have probably had only minor cosmetic rennovations in recent years such as a coat of paint and maybe some new carpet. Most (not all) of the furnishings are sparse, cheap, dated, and in some cases tired looking. There are many small aspects (although minor) of the room which were in disrepair such as peeling paint on the bathroom ceiling, linoleum coming up around the tub, slidding shudder off it's hinges (which maintenance didn't fix properly), etc. The bathroom is small, basic, and very dated with very old fixtures. It appears the only thing they've done recently to the bathroom is slap some cheap, ugly Corian on the countertop. Water pressure is good and hot water doesn't run out. A big plus. Bedroom bed was comfortable, although a little on the firm side, too firm for my wife. The mattress on the pull-out was a joke. No way anyone over 50 pounds could get a good night's rest on it. Definitely need a new pullout mattress. The rooms have a very (I'm guessing) 1950's feel so don't book here expecting to get something newly renovated with latest furnishing and appliances. I didn't really expect this anyway but you get the feeling the owner is trying to maximize profits instead of reinvesting back into the rooms and the staff is trying to do these little extra things to make up for it. (You can rennovate while still retaining that old-school charm.) Many may characterize the rooms as having a nostalgic feel and the overall hotel having a boutique feel, which it does, and we liked that feel. The pool is small, but adequate. There is no Jacuzzi (a big minus). The layout of the hotel against the side of a hill with a U shape is great as it makes the inner courtyard/pool area shielded from the loud traffic of the busy street out front. Housekeeping service is excellent. I'd recommend staying here but don't go here with high expectations like you'll being staying at a small, boutique version of the Beverly Hills Hotel. I'm guessing that this place receives very high marks partially because comparatively it offers an excellent value for it's location and especially for those that prefer an alternative to the high-rise hotel experience.", "Date": "April 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bavaria", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay for exploring Hollywood and L.A.\u201d", "Author": "Wicki", "ReviewID": "UR7349701", "Content": "We are a family of 4 from Germany and just returned from a great stay at the Magic Castle Hotel in Hollywood.

I'd requested the same 1-bdrm I'd had the last time, but they put me in a room that was actually bigger and nicer than the first one! (The bathroom in this one was especially roomy.) Reception was great about getting me checked in quickly since I was exhausted and needed a nap! Again, the sound of soft music was playing as I first entered the room. I should say apartment instead of room since the suite is enormous, with a hallway leading from the large living room to the bathroom, and then another to the bedroom. Just incredibly big for a hotel room! I was going to a comedy club on Hollywood Blvd, and instead of calling a cab in the nightmare Saturday night traffic I was advised by the hotel staff to walk where I was going instead, so I did. That was just perfect. I walked up the bustling boulevard over all the stars on the sidewalk and watched the tourists gawk at the familiar Hollywood landmarks and street performers. It was about a 10 minute brisk walk and well worth it. I got back to the hotel earlier than I'd expected that night, so I went down to the desk for snacks (complimentary) like candy bars and microwave popcorn. I was even able to check out a DVD for the night, free. (There's a DVD player in the full entertainment center in the large living room.) Since it was still fairly early and the hotel shuttle driver was on the site I asked if they could take me up the hill to their sister property, the Hollywood Hills Hotel. (It's on the grounds of the restaurant Yamashiro.) The view of all of Los Angeles and Hollywood from up there was just phenomenal. Evidently, the rooms aren't as nice as in the Magic Castle Hotel, but the views more than make up for it. (No views from the Magic Castle Hotel down the hill.) Afterward, I made my microwave popcorn and a cup of tea in my large full kitchen, and sat out on my big balcony overlooking the pool and just enjoyed the quiet night and the great weather. Overall, another great stay. Management and all the front desk employees went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable and get me everything I needed.

We have enjoyed staying in many 5 star hotels around the world and have experienced very good service. I have to say that the Magic Castle Hotel can stand with the best when it comes to friendly staff, great service, and cleanliness. Arrival: The hotel is centrally located in Hollywood and was easy to find. The lobby is not large but is very accommodating, welcoming and tastefully decorated. The staff greeted us warmly and seemed genuinely friendly. On one side of the lobby there was a large arrangement of cookies, an assortment of teas, spiced cider, and packets for hot chocolate. There was also cool water containing sliced cucumbers. A delicious continental breakfast is served every morning from 7- 10AM. The food is arranged in the lobby and can be enjoyed out by the pool or you can take it to your room. Checking in was quick and the staff carried our luggage to our room which was on the second level. There are no elevators but there are rooms on the ground level if stairs are a challenge. There are also a few steps to the front entrance of the hotel. The rooms surround a large, lovely courtyard. Many of the rooms on the second and third levels have balconys overlooking the courtyard. Ours did not but I will know to ask ahead for one next time we visit. In the center of the courtyard is a 'splash pool'. If you want Olympic laps this is not the pool for you. It is just the right size for a refreshing dip and floating around. My kids loved it. Our room: We had the junior suite and found it to be fairly large and very clean. The carpeting looked new. In addition to the TV there was a DVD player and CD player. My kids brought their laptops and there was wirless internet for them. The hotel has a nice complimentay DVD library. When my kids went to select DVDs they were surprised with a complimentary bucket of microwave popcorn packets and an assortment of candy. The beds have down comforters and the mattresses were firm and comfortable. Turndown service is provided every evening along with chocolate mints. Location: The hotel is located at the foot of a hill within 2 blocks of busy Hollywood Blvd. Once you turn off of Hollywood Blvd the crowds and noise seem to thin out appreciably. The subway is about 3 blocks from the hotel on Hollywood Blvd and we used it to get to Universal Studios. The city was in preparation for the Oscars while we were there. All of these preparations take place in the 2 block area close to the hotel. The Hollywood/ Highland subway stop is closed on the day of the Oscars. Metro and auto traffic is detoured as well beginning several days before the Oscar presentations. Pedestrian traffic is also detoured on Hollywood Blvd beginning several days prior to Oscar day but all the major sights are still accessible such as the Kodak theater, walk of fame, and Chinese theater. I was told that this inconvenience only happens during the week of Oscar preparations every year. We found it fun and exciting to watch the city get ready for the Oscars day by day despite the inconvenience of the detours. Staff: I have never been treated better at any hotel that I have ever stayed at. The staff just go out of their way to make your stay pleasant and enjoyable. They are friendly, courteous and they let you know that they are there for you. When my kids were up into the night with jet lag I spent lots of time going to the lobby for DVD's and snacks and Marzia on the night shift was so patient and helpful. All the staff should be commended. They give you 5 star service and 5 star treatment. There are lots of bigger, grander, more luxurious hotels in L.A. but the staff at the Magic Castle make it stand along side any of them. In my opinion, there is none better.

My daughter became ill during our trip, and the front desk was quick to help with names and phone numbers of the local pharmacies in the area. They later asked about her and how she was feeling. They also wanted to know how we liked their suggestions for dinner. This staff is the friendliest, most courteous staff I've ever seen.

The hotel is small but in a great location, just two blocks from Hollywood Blvd. One of the best parts was its association with the Magic Castle. Minors can't get into the Castle to see the performances except on weekend brunches and unless you are with a member. The only exception is for those staying at the hotel. Since my son is a magic buff, that was a big attraction of staying there. However, we were pleasantly surprised with just about everything. Most impressive was the staff which was so incredibly friendly and helpful. They were never overbearing but always willing to help out. The rooms were decent, but not overly impressive. They had everything we needed. I was a little taken aback by the carpets, which looked a little worn, but half-way through our stay, they were being replaced. The beds were very comfy while the bathrooms were a little tired, but still very functional and clean. Every morning there was a continental breakfast served in the small lobby. I ususally took my food out to the pool-side tables and sat there. The pool was a great feature; it wasn't too big but was great for cooling off. My only complaint was one night, at about 2 a.m., some drunks jumped in and were a little noisy. But that was an isolated occurence. If you're there on vacation, you can easily walk to Hollywood Blvd and all the attractions there. As well, the hotel next door -- which I wouldn't suggest you stay at -- is where Janis Joplin was found dead. Overall, I'd go back to this hotel in a minute, based largely on the staff.

Decidimos escoger este hotel por las buenas cr\u00c3\u00adticas de esta web y por un precio asumible y realmente no nos defraud\u00c3\u00b3. La localizaci\u00c3\u00b3n es ideal para los que viajen por primera vez a L.A. El hotel est\u00c3\u00a1 justo detr\u00c3\u00a1s de Hollywood Blvd. y del Chinese Theatre. En 3 minutos est\u00c3\u00a1s paseando por el Walk of Fame (Paseo de la Fama, con las estrellitas de los famosos). Adem\u00c3\u00a1s est\u00c3\u00a1 muy, muy cerca de una salida de la 101 HWY as\u00c3\u00ad que cuando coges el coche, vayas donde vayas, tienes f\u00c3\u00a1cil acceso y no tienes que ir dando vueltas por dentro de la ciudad. Tambi\u00c3\u00a9n est\u00c3\u00a1 muy cerca de los Estudios Universal. Nosotros fuimos en coche pero est\u00c3\u00a1 a una parada de metro, y el metro se coge en Hollywood Blvd. Bueno, resumiendo, de localizaci\u00c3\u00b3n un 10!! Luego est\u00c3\u00a1n las instalaciones. Es un hotel tipo apartamentos. Yo no s\u00c3\u00a9 si hab\u00c3\u00a9is visto la serie Melrose Place, pues se parece mucho a donde viv\u00c3\u00adan los protagonistas. Son apartamentos independientes, a los cuales se accede desde una zona com\u00c3\u00ban que es donde est\u00c3\u00a1 la piscina, que no es muy grande, pero en la que tranquilamente te puedes ba\u00c3\u00b1ar despu\u00c3\u00a9s de un d\u00c3\u00ada de caminar sin parar. Los apartamentos, el nuestro era de dos habitaciones, est\u00c3\u00a1n bastante bien. Hay que tener en cuenta que no estamos hablando de un hotel de 5 estrellas con todas esas pijadas... pero yo creo que est\u00c3\u00a1 muy por encima de las 2 estrellas que pone en la web. Para que os hag\u00c3\u00a1is una idea: nuestro apartamento ten\u00c3\u00ada una sala de estar bastante grande equipada con un televisor grande, equipo de m\u00c3\u00basica, un sof\u00c3\u00a1 c\u00c3\u00b3modo y una butaca. Tambi\u00c3\u00a9n hab\u00c3\u00ada un escritorio con su silla y unas l\u00c3\u00a1mparas que daban una sensaci\u00c3\u00b3n muy acogedora. Luego, al final de la sala, estaba la cocina, equipada con nevera con congelador, microondas, horno, etc... Tambi\u00c3\u00a9n hab\u00c3\u00ada un cuarto de ba\u00c3\u00b1o correcto, el esmalte de la ba\u00c3\u00b1era estaba un poco viejo y hab\u00c3\u00ada alg\u00c3\u00ban azulejo un poco roto, pero por lo dem\u00c3\u00a1s estaba limpio y con los jaboncitos y cremitas que te dan en los hoteles. Y luego estaban los dos dormitorios. La verdad es que con un s\u00c3\u00b3lo ja nos hubiera bastado pero cuando le\u00c3\u00ad en esta web que las habitaciones individuales eran muy peque\u00c3\u00b1as tuve miedo de pasar parte de mi luna de miel en un zulo ;-) Al apartamento le doy un 7 y medio. Luego est\u00c3\u00a1n las instalaciones propiamente del hotel. Lo peor que encontramos fue que no hay ascensor. Y si no te dan una habitaci\u00c3\u00b3n del nivel inferior pues te toca subir maletas aunque, en nuestro caso, el personal de recepci\u00c3\u00b3n nos ayud\u00c3\u00b3 mucho con nuestras pesadas maletas. Genial si vais en coche ya que disponen de garaje en mismo hotel y el precio est\u00c3\u00a1 realmente bien, si no recuerdo mal 8 o 9 d\u00c3\u00b3lares por noche. Al parking se accede con la misma tarjeta de la habitaci\u00c3\u00b3n y tambi\u00c3\u00a9n desde la zona de la piscina. Otra cosa que nos fue genial fue la habitaci\u00c3\u00b3n de la colada. Hay lavadoras y secadoras por 75 centavos el ciclo. Nos vino muy bien para ponernos al d\u00c3\u00ada en ropa limpia despu\u00c3\u00a9s de 2 semanas de viaje y con todav\u00c3\u00ada 2 m\u00c3\u00a1s por delante. As\u00c3\u00ad que la valoraci\u00c3\u00b3n de las instalaciones, un 9. Y por \u00c3\u00baltimo el personal del hotel. Os tengo que decir que todos los comentarios que hay en la web son ciertos. El personal se desvive por los clientes. Tiene un detalles que te quedas alucinando. A veces hasta por demasiado. Os pongo un par de ejemplos: Cuando hice la reserva coment\u00c3\u00a9 que \u00c3\u00adbamos en nuestra luna de miel pues bien, al entrar en el apartamento estaba el equipo de m\u00c3\u00basica sonando con unos temas muuyyy rom\u00c3\u00a1nticos. Yo me fui directamente a la habitaci\u00c3\u00b3n porque nos hab\u00c3\u00adan dicho que hab\u00c3\u00adan dejado un detallito, y all\u00c3\u00ad hab\u00c3\u00ada una botella de vino de vi\u00c3\u00b1as californianas con sus respectivas copas. Despu\u00c3\u00a9s, cada anochecer, pasaba una mujer repartiendo bombones y nos informaba de la previsi\u00c3\u00b3n meteorol\u00c3\u00b3gica del d\u00c3\u00ada siguiente. Adem\u00c3\u00a1s, m\u00c3\u00a1s de un d\u00c3\u00ada que hicimos la siesta, vinieron por la tarde a volvernos a hacer la cama que, por supuesto, ya hab\u00c3\u00adan hecho puntualmente por la ma\u00c3\u00b1ana. \u00c2\u00a1Me sab\u00c3\u00ada hasta mal tantos detalles!

When we returned that evening, the toilet wouldn't flush at all - they had broken the chain and left. Another call and the team returned and within the hour, we could flush. Sort of.

Some of the pictures showed the motel with very contemporary rooms. However, when I arrived at the hotel I was less than impressed. It must be said that there are two sides to this hotel. On the one side, you have what are called \"one/two bedroom suites\". These are the the rooms you are going to see in the pictures when you are booking. However, the room I got was a \"deluxe queen\" I believe. These rooms it seems are not yet renovated, and not at all up to the standards of what you pay for. My girlfriend and I checked in to what looked like a rennovated apartment building next to the magic castle. Not met by sparkling cider and not shown to our room as the other guests were when checking in. The first room we went to had a broken lock to its connecting room which made it free for me or my neighbors to open up our doors and enter each others rooms. So, the hotel decided to place a small table in front of the door to make all well. Beyond that, the room was sitting well in the 90 degree range. So...we asked for another room. No problem there...and we were given another unimpressive, unrennovated room. The room was steaming again and until we left we had to run the air conditioning unit on high to stay at all comfortable. After complaining about our first room and expressing our concern that we didnt get what we paid for, nick at the front desk said he would try and get us in to a nicer room the following day. Next day....back down to the front desk to ask about a new room (and to ask why the wireless internet wasnt working, which we were directed to a 1-800 number for tech support). We were told by one of the ladies that since we didnt come to the front desk by 11am someone was already booked in the nicer room. So were they willing to give us some kind of discount or do anything for us? Nope. She said she tried to contact us, even though our phone never rang and we were only about 30 feet away for her to walk and knock on our door. So following that...we decided to check out early. We had already walked along the strip the previous day and didnt mind moving a little bit further away. During our complaining and early departure, not once did we talk to Mike, the front end manager who sat just behind the glass at the front desk, or did we talk to darren, the hotel manager who was onsite as well and who also knew of the situation. On the positive, this motel is extremely close to the Chinese theater and if you get a rennovated room, your stay will probably be quite nice. However, while I stood at the front desk to check out I called Comfort Inn and Suites and got an exceptionally nicer room for about $40+ cheaper, but it was just a little futher off the strip. Basically, only stay here if your going to pay the extra for the larger rooms, and that is if you really want to pay that much. If your just looking for a room close to the strip, there are more than enough close to hollywood blvd or sunset that are quite cheaper and much nicer. On a side note of the staff at the Magic Castle, Nick was professional and nice enough as was one of the other gentleman we were helped by on our first day there. However, the two ladies we ran in two at the front desk on the next day seemed to possess little knowledge and even less tact. But, most of all the management was not at all up to calibur. Providing no contact giving us no explanation and no apology.

It was dingy, had only 1 of the 2 promised bathrooms, offered closets so musty that I immediately re-closed the doors, and a shower the size of a coffin. But the real horrible twist was the paper-thin walls and the loud noise from the street. I immediately requested a room change but none was available and the newbie clerk said \"just close the windows\". With all windows closed, this heavy sleeper was awoken multiple times and finally crawled into bed with her children in an inner room where noise was still heard. I went to the clerk the next morning almost in tears: for $250 a night, I expected more, at least a decent night of sleep. She ended up refunding the night's charge, assigning us to a new room (switching us with new unfortunate guests), and treated us to a box of treats. Very pleasant.

Yamashiro's, the famous upscale restaurant in the gorgeously historic building overlooking the city, is part of the business, so they booked our dinner reservation and drove us up to the restaurant. Best part is that the hotel stay allows us entry into the Members Only Magic Castle. We had Sunday brunch there with our kids and saw 3 shows. Very fun afternoon that lasts 3 hours. The price is a real bargain for what you get. Don't expect a physically sparkling site - it's an older building that's been remodeled nicely but not extravagently. The only downside is the noise. Pretty noisy, especially with the cheerleading team that was in town for a competition.

This was our third time in LA, and on my previous two visits, we stayed at the five-star Park Hotel. This time we were traveling with children, and I was a little leary because I made my seven day reservation based soley on the reviews on this site. Turns out, I enjoyed the Magic Castle above the five star hotel. First and foremost, the staff is exceptional, from the front desk to the maintenance staff. Anytime we needed anything, we simply picked up the phone and it was delievered immediately to our door: extra pillows and towels, DVD's, even take-out menus when we inquired about suggestions for the best Asian take out. One morning we decided to drive to Malibu, and I stopped by the front desk to ask for directions. I was provided with several maps, driving directions, and even great recommendations for the best restaurants along the way. We were even told which beaches were the most scenic/ secluded. We all loved the daily breakfast, which is not your typical run-of-the-mill continental breakfast. The coffee, scones, and croissants were fabulous. My son loved the chocolate chip scones. The woman who assisted with breakfast remembered my son every morning, and would save his favorite scones for him. In fact, on the morning we checked out, she sent us off with a couple of scones for a snack on the plane. In addition, we would return every evening after a long day of amusement parks, tours, or shopping to the turn down service. Not only were our beds turned down and candy left by the bedside, but also the CD player was on and tuned to classical music and tomorrow's weather forecast was left on our bed table. Second, our room offered plenty of space. We stayed in a two-bedroom for 7 days. The was plenty of room for myself and my husband, my parents, and my two children, ages 7 and 9. Each of the two bedrooms housed a king-size bed with a down comforter, mirror closet doors, beautiful lamps, bed side tables, and a large dresser. The children slept on a comfortable queen-size pull out sofa in the living room. The entire apartment appeared to be newly renovated, with whimsical modern furniture (very IKEA). The bathroom was completely new, with a beautiful glass shower, plenty of mirrors, and track lights above the vanity. There was also tons of closet space, with large closets in both bedrooms and another large sliding door closet (see picture) and additional drawers/ shelves to store the kids stuff in the hallway. We enjoyed afternoons at the pool, with frequent popsicles and spa-like facial cloths. There is also an inexpensive laundry right on site. I used the free pass to the full size gym 4 or 5 times. The gym is a short walk away (about 3 blocks) and they have great music, plenty of machines and TV's, and free parking. The gym was never crowded, which surprised me for LA! Furthermore, the hotel is close to everything in Hollywood. It is a two block walk from Hollywood & Highland, where you can find the Kodak Theatre (where the Grammys are held), the Chinese Theatre, the Hollywood mall (Starbucks, Lucky Brand, Victoria's Secret, Build a Bear, and tons of other stores and restaurants), and Hollywood tours depart all day. The subway also stops at Hollywood and Highland, and you can take it 1 or 2 stops to Universal Studios. If you are considering renting a car, you honestly will not need it for everyday of your trip if you plan to do the Hollywood thing. You will only need it for longer drives, like up the coast or driving through West Hollywood/ Beverly Hills. Finally, we did experience a minor issue with our accomodations, and when we brought it to the attention of the manager, he was most apologetic and gracious, and addressed the situation beyond our expectations. All in all, this is a great place to stay, particularly with children or a group. When I return to LA, this is the only place I would consider staying. Thanks again.

Despite asking lots of questions about how to go about this, the staff were always pleased to give advice and offer us menus to look at. I have to say that both meals were absolutely wonderful. I was a bit disappointed with the room I guess as it had no bedside lamps which meant that you had to get out of bed to turn the light off and also despite having items to make coffee, no coffee machine??? The thing which I found most difficult however was the noise. I am from the country in Lincolnshire and am used to quiet at night but there was a constant hum all of the time - we guessed from the pool. But on top of this, the fridge was also very loud and our neighbours decided it was a good idea to play their TV very loud until about 3 in the morning not considering other guests at all.

After some hesitancy, we decided that management should know that our experience was not consistent with the reviews that we had read. After all, we were going to be there for three more nights. We started wondering whether the reviews were written by real guests of the hotel. We addressed the carpet problem with the person at the front desk. She was very understanding and offered to place us in another comparable room. However, this room was near the street, and we did not want to risk the possible noise. So we decided to stay put and thought that was the end of it. As we were enjoying our breakfast at poolside, we were approached by the general manager. He apologized and offered us further assistance. He indicated that another room was opening up that morning. A little later that morning he gave us the key for this newly vacated room. Were we surprised! The room was enormous with a full kitchen, dining area, living room, etc. Besides this free upgrade, he advised us that the first night would be deducted from our bill. With large smiles upon our faces, we promptly moved over our luggage to our new luxury suite. We then went back to the pool for swimming and sunbathing. Upon our return to the suite, we found a beautiful bouquet of flowers from a florest with a note apologizing for the inconvenience from the general manager. This was astonishing!

I was leery booking a hotel for a week which AAA rated only two diamonds but after reading the reviews by the \"folks\" on Trip Advisor, I decided to ignore the pros. Wise choice. The hotel is in an excellent location for tourist yet quiet. We did not want to rent a car as my husband had already driven 1,200 miles on the first leg of the trip. This hotel is close to all forms of public transportation and sightseeing venues. We arrived three hours before check-in time in hopes of storing our luggage. To our shock, the staff said our room was ready and we had been given a complimentary upgrade to a suite!!! The suite was immaculate. The staff recommended which tours were worthwhile, what to see on our own and how to get there and advised us what we should NOT do via public transportation. I had wanted to take the transit system to Long Beach to tour the Queen Mary. They were adamant it would not be safe to do so. Only my mother has ever been this concerned for my well-being. The staff even went so far as to call taxi services on my behalf (without my asking) to check rates to Long Beach. They advised public transportation to The Reagan Library in one day was not do-able either....too many stops thus not enough time to tour the Library. The staff booked tours for us, which when we tried to book ourselves, were told there were no openings....hence the name Magic! The heated outdoor pool in the courtyard is open 24/7. They just ask you keep the noise level reasonable after 9pm. The on-site laundry facility is suppose to close at 9pm but when I was doing laundry after that hour, they said \"no problem\". When I inquired as to why AAA only rated the hotel two diamonds, they explained that several factors are considered by AAA in their assessment which they don't tell the reader. 1. There is no bathroom in the lobby. This is silly as all 39 guestrooms are a short walk from the lobby. 2. There is no elevator. Another stupidity as there are only two floors. 3.

So, with that assurance, here's my review of the Magic Castle Hotel. What I loved most about the Magic Castle: it's quaint, it has character, it has charm, it has personality, and it's in a fabulous location (off the beaten path but close to the Hollywood strip). I also loved that it's in a safe location. The housekeeper even stopped up to our room a few times to see if my son was doing okay -- and offered him chocolates! The staff -- Ashley, Gretchen, and Shawn -- couldn't have been more helpful and polite. They *all* treated me like royalty, despite the thousands of questions I asked as I finagled LA and the metro bus system (I didn't rent a car but managed to get along just fine.) I couldn't take home their Egyptian robes, their goose down comforter or their nummy blueberry muffins -- but I could, and will, take home the memories of our delightful stay at the Magic Castle Hotel. I'll also take with me the wonderful memories of our last night's dinner at the spectacular Yamashiro restaurant, and the lasting memory of the Sunday branch and magic show at the exclusive Magic Castle club attached to the hotel. Also, I'll always remember how thrilled I was when I learned, as I was checking in, that they had upgraded our room! My kids were so excited too, especially when they saw the awesome huge rooms. This was a special trip for my two children and me. I booked my room nine months ago, and have been planning this vacation for nearly a year. Now that I'm back in Minnesota, I realize I couldn't have made a more perfect choice. All the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor are \"right on.\" Thank you to all the accommodating staff, and thank you once again to Mike, the front office manager. As I departed from the hotel, I gave Mike three hugs. That's something I must say I've never done before, but I was so happy with our stay; we all had such a great time on our vacation. Looking back, I wish I would have him yet another hug.

Our itinerary included a number of hotels in the $US150-$200 range across the globe and we would have to say that the Magic Castle was by far our best hotel experience. The friendliness of the staff is exceptional and extends way beyond the shallow \"have a nice day\" that often passes for good service in the US. The staff and management appeared genuinely eager to assist in any way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible - (well done guys!). The hotel itself is ideally located in the heart of the resurgent Hollywood district and for a tourist has that quintessential \"Hollywood feel\". This was aided by the hotel's apparent appeal to out-of-town creative types who stay there for a day or two to pitch their film scripts - so wireless laptops and movie talk by the pool. The hotel is actually split in two, with the main building down the bottom of the hill and another one up the top. We initially booked a room up the hill and although the LA views are good, these rooms had not been renovated (Jan 2005) and were rundown. Guests are also required to walk up and down the hill for breakfast and any other concierge needs. After a couple of days, we decided to move into the main building and were put in a much nicer, larger and newly renovated room that was surprisingly at a lower price. The Magic Castle is not an international luxury business hotel (and hence lacks some of the trimmings), but is excellent value for those seeking an LA experience at a reasonable price. (Note we have also stayed at the similarly priced LAX Airport Sheraton, which is a good hotel too, but has no atmosphere) Some tips: To avoid disappointment, we suggest that you ask for an upstairs renovated room in the main building that faces the pool and is not on the main road. Guests at the Magic Castle Hotel are given the privilege of being able to visit the Magic Castle club next door to watch some of the top magicians in the world perform in a range of atmospheric theatres in a big Victorian house. Even if you stay for one night at the hotel, definitely take up this offer (and book ahead) as it is a genuinely unique LA experience that is not open to the general public. Visit the Japanese restaurant at the top of the hill (behind the hotel) for either dinner or a late night drink as it has some of the best views in LA. We were lucky enough to be there after heavy rain and the views were exceptional.", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Magic Castle\u201d", "Author": "Vicky22", "ReviewID": "UR3700869", "Content": "This hotel is wonderful.

The full kitchen was a great way to not have to eat out every night, and it was great to eat breakfast in before heading out for the day. The beds were comfortable and there was a ton of closet space. One note: While the suite had window AC units, the bedroom my husband and I stayed in had a sub-par non-window AC. It didn't matter so much because the weather was perfect, but I wouldn't have been so happy in mid-July. However, the rest of the place was so nice it didn't really hurt our stay.

We all had suite rooms so the students felt more like they were in apartments rather than hotel rooms. The beds were all queen and king size so everyone was comfortable. The bedding is new, fresh and so comfortable you could melt into it. Each room had a kitchen, so the students could make snacks for themselves. Each morning a continental breakfast is provided, but not like at most places. The Magic Castle has fresh baked goods from a bakery and gourmet coffee. The juices and milk were quickly refilled, and the cereals and fruit bountiful. The morning we left at 5:00a.m. the hotel had an individual breakfast bag for each student as they boarded the bus!! How thoughtful can you be!?!?!? The location on this property is amazing. It is one block from the Kodak theater area. So it is in walking distance of many area attractions, shopping, restaurants, and the Metro. There was also a guard on the property to ensure safety, although we never felt unsafe. Because this hotel is associated with the Magic Castle itself any guest has the ability to go to this exclusive magic mecca. The Sunday brunch admits children and has shows that are age appropriate....and the buffet was out of this world. yum! The best part about the Magic Castle Hotel is the staff itself. They call themselves the \"yes\" hotel, and they live up to it. When we arrived they served popsicles! When the students needed anything they felt comfortable going to the front desk and asking for everything from paper/pen to milk for scrambling eggs. A lot of the front desk workers are young working actors and are happy to share their stories. Every single employee was a delight and so willing to be of service.

Honestly, I was skeptical... I mean, it was only a one star hotel, and the price seemed a little high for the rating. First off, when we drove up, we went to the club, not the hotel. The pictures on the web-site gave the impression that the club (which has a fantastic, victorian exterior) was the Hotel. So, when we tried to valet the car, we were sorely dissappointed when we were directed down the street. When we pulled up, we were unimpressed. Not dirty or anything, just plain. But when we entered the lobby, and then went to the courtyard, we were very impressed, especially with the multi-levels at the courtyard. Shawn, the guy who helped us, was SO NICE!!! Come to think of it, everyone we encountered at the hotel was incredibly pleasant, not in a fake way, but in a way that made you feel right at home. Since it was dark when we arrived, I was nervous about walking to downtown. Being from a small town, I asked Shawn if it was safe to walk the block to Hollywood Blvd. He assured us that it was, and that if we needed anything, to call him and he would have some one pick us up. He gave us a personalized map, a business card with numbers, a recommendation for dinner, and sent us on our merry way... Ok, now for the part that I guess is more relevant... The room... We got a small room with a king-sized bed. When we opened the door, the first impression was how great it smelled. I know that may sound odd, but it was a great, clean, fresh fragrence. The bed was SUPER comfy (pillow top) and the duvet was nice and fluffy. The bathroom was all new with a pedestal sink and cool track lighting. The plantation blinds were great at blocking out light too. The room itself was pretty small, but we were blown away with just how nice everything was in it (from the bed-side lamps, which doubled as night lights to the big tv).

We stayed there for 5 nights, and we had no problems. This hotel is definitely one of the better places I've stayed. This was my first trip to Los Angeles. The people at the front desk were very friendly and helpful, giving us accurate directions to wherever we wanted to go. This building was an old apartment building, and it doesn't have any elevators. There are plenty of stairs to climb, so if you're physically disabled or have problems walking, this may not be the place for you. The rooms, however, are fantastic! If you get a suite (which I thought were reasonably priced), you will get a bedroom, a bathroom, a living room (with couch and coffee table, not to mention the DVD player and television), and a kitchen. The beds were very comfortable, and there are air conditioning units in the rooms. The Magic Castle Hotel has a private garage, which you will receive a key for when you receive your room key. I found this very comforting, as it is a small garage, and no one else has access to it besides the hotel guests. There is a nice pool at the center of the hotel, and also a continental breakfast every morning, which includes pastries, toast, cereal, fresh fruit, coffee, milk, and juices. It's not a large breakfast, but it's sufficient to get you through the day. Uphill from the hotel is the Magic Castle Club (you must be 21 to enter). It is located in a Victoria-era house, complete with some secret passageways and a piano-playing ghost. The club is exclusive, and you can only be allowed in by a member of the club or by making reservations at the front desk. I had a very good time going and watching the magic shows there.

The room (really a 1 bedroom apt) was huge with so much storage space we couldn't use all the closets! Yes the apartment was older but ours was clean and everyone was so very nice and helpful that any wear and tear should just be considered \"shabby chic\". The breakfast was great. The best croissants ever (Sat AM we had pain au chocolat better than Paris). We had the fortune/misfortune to be in Hollywood for the Oscars. The traffic was horrendous (Hollywood Blvd was blocked off due to security which made driving a challenge but the front desk staff helped me plot different routes to accommodate my mom visiting relatives by car. Most importantly for me as a woman travelling alone with kids and elderly person I felt very safe and completely at ease at this little gem of a hotel. Others have said it many times before but you just cannot beat the location of this hotel. It is close to all the touristy things and so easy to catch tours around town or do the funky museums around Hollywood Blvd. The Hollywood/Highland complex has lots of eating places and there are loads of places to go within walking distance. I am not sure if the staff reads these reports but a special thank you to Shawn at the front desk, I hope they pay you well because you really are an asset to Magic Castle!

First of all, I must say that the hotel was really conveniently located to most of all the attractions. Barely 1 block from Hollywood Boulevard, 5 minutes drive from Universal Studio, 15-20 min drive to downtown and close to Getty Center. Since it was our first time in LA, and I'm usually not too good with car rides, it was really great that everything was close in proximity. The hotel room was alright. It was clean, but the house cleaning wasn't too thorough. Shampoo supplies were never replenished during the 5 night stay we were there. Cups that we used to make hot drinks were never washed. The room wasn't the newest, but it was clean. Not that big, but considering the terrific location, it was great. If you are planning on staying at the Magic Castle, I would strongly recommend spending an additional $20 for a one bedroom apartment. I caught a glimpse of the apartment from time to time, and it seemed so much newer and spacious, and more inviting. We were trying to save some money, but kinda wished we had spent that additional $20/night. Apart from that, hotel staff were really friendly and helpful. Continental Breakfast (Croissants, muffins, scones, toast from a local bakery) is actually self service, available in the small lobby.

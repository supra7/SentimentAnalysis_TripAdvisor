Everything for my stay was perfect. At check in, a young woman named Tara was fast, friendly, and efficient. Even though there was a long line, she was patient and notably pleasant. I requested an upper floor and was given a top floor room with views of the entire region. The entire hotel is beautifully designed, but a few amenities are really worth note: The fitness center is an actual fitness center! It has more machines and weight equipment than most health clubs. A great change from the usual hotel \"fitness center\" which is two treadmills and a blaring television. The pool! Wow. There is a main pool area that is very kid and family friendly, with zero-depth entry and waterfalls, etc. It's welcoming and fun but also sophisticated somehow and not to disney-fied like many Orlando places. Then, there's a separate lap pool on another level that is more adult and fitness centered, and it is incredible. I swam a mile there in the lap pool and it was the best time of my entire business trip. The restaurants (Napa and something like Capriccio) were perfect. Convenient, quality food, great atmosphere. The exhibition space is huge and high-quality. Our group attended a convention in several rooms and there were no complaints. Overall this hotel is fantastic.

My husband and I wanted to get away for a few days with our 14 month old son. We booked 2 adjoining rooms (because our son is a very light sleeper.) One room smelled like cigarette smoke, but only after the first day. It was very odd -- I didn't notice the odor when we first checked-in. It was only after the first morning (and each day after that) that I noticed the smell. Usually I would ask for another room, but we had already un-packed everything, and we didn't spend much time in the room anyway, so we left it. Anyway, the hotel itself is nice and well laid out. We were in the new tower. All guest rooms come with coolers -- not refridgerators, it turns out. It never got very cold, so I called down to the front desk to ask about the settings for the fridge, and was quickly corrected that it was a cooler, not a fridge, so it will not be as cold as a fridge. (Even though the slogan on the cooler door reads: Feed the Fridge.) The pool area is great, although they don't have umbrellas. (At least not in March.) I can't imagine hanging out by the pool in the summer without some relief of shade, but they do have cabanas you can rent. Pool bar is over-priced, as all pool-bars are. Service from waiters in the pool area is spotty. This is a large convention hotel, but we did see a lot of other families traveling with kids of all ages. Self parking is $16, plus tax. Be sure to tell the front desk at check in if you want to self park -- they have to activate your room key so you get in/out priviledges. We didn't eat onsite, so can't comment on the food, but they do have lots of choices. Pointe Orlando is an entertainment complex next door, and is walkable, but The Peabody is a large property, so it is a bit of a walk. Definitely doable, but not just a \"block\" away. (Think \"walkable\" in Vegas, only not that spread-out.) Lots of dining options there, but everything on or around I-Drive is a chain restaurant, so manage expectations. Ale House has a great, big Cobb salad for a reasonable price (not in Pointe Orlando, but just up I Drive a bit.) IHOP and Dennys are on I-Drive for a nice, cheap breakfast. (Don't go to the IHOP attached to the Days Inn Hotel on I-Drive. It's tiny and has bad service.) Overall the Peabody is perfectly situated on I-Drive, a short drive to all the attractions. Orlando is a very easy town to navigate.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201c5 Star Property, 2 Star Service\u201d", "Author": "aliwat", "ReviewID": "UR126700184", "Content": "Our experience at The Peabody Orlando was very mixed - some things were excellent and some things were terrible. I'll start with the good things - the property itself is GORGEOUS. The hotel is beautiful, well-decorated and feels incredibly luxurious from the moment you walk in. The rooms are great, ours was a little on the small side (my mom was staying in the room next door and hers was SIGNIFICANTLY larger even though we paid the same price for the rooms.) The bed is super comfortable, the bathroom is perfect (loved the TV in the bathroom mirror and the duck soap!) Housekeeping came twice a day and did a wonderful job (although one night they woke us up at 10PM for turn down service, which I thought was a really odd hour to come, especially since they knew we were a family with a small child.) And, of course, the duck march was adorable! We ate in two restaurants (the B-line Diner and the Mallard Bar) and both were great - no complaints there! Now, on to the bad: First, the pool. It is a BEAUTIFUL pool, well designed and we loved the water slide and the kids area but there were a couple of major problems. First, there are only 3 trash cans in the whole GIANT pool area and the staff did a TERRIBLE job bussing tables. Every table around us was full of empty cups, trash and ashtrays EVERY TIME we went to the pool. I never saw a staff member pick up even one dirty cup wile we were there. What a shame! Also, the pool does not get sunny until noon and so it's very chilly and windy there in the morning. Next, the rooms are oddly lacking in basic amenities. There are no microwaves. You can request one for $20 a day (but you can also BUY one for $40) so that seems incredibly wasteful if you are staying there for a week to pay $140 (which we were.) I called the concierge to see if we could borrow one to heat up my son's lunch and the concierge was stumped as to how to help us. They finally said they would send a microwave up to our room for us to heat up his lunch and then take it back, but they never sent one. The shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom are terrible. Most nice hotels have a company sponsor their bathroom products and I am wondering why they don't do the same to get higher quality bath products? There is no coffee or coffee makers in the rooms. They do have a coffee service downstairs from 5:30-8:30 in the Mallard Tower but when my husband went down one morning to find it, the Concierge told him it ended at 7AM and so he came back up empty0handed. If you want to buy coffee, it's $4.50. Seems pricey for something that is generally included at a nice hotel. The concierges we spoke to were all very pleasant but very untrained. Maybe there's a barrage of new staff members or something right now? One concierge I spoke with about Disney discounts told me she couldn't tell me what the Disney discounts were, it was all very secret and varied depending on what conference you were with. The woman at the ticket center in the hotel was VERY helpful and gave us the exact breakdown of ticket costs (it was a standard discount and DID NOT vary.) I called one morning to get advice on finding a local orange grove and was transferred to the concierge and promptly hung up on...THREE TIMES IN A ROW. So I gave up and found the information elsewhere. Also, their wifi is spotty and tends to just bounce you back to the Peabody home page. I actually had to turn it off to get my iphone to work properly. So, overall, I would give this hotel 5 stars for the actual property and 2 stars for the terrible service and lack of amenities. I have stayed at several true five star hotels and this one has a LONG way to go. We stayed at the Hilton Orlando last year and LOVED that one (but it was all booked up this year.) Next year I'll be booking again (but earlier!) at the Hilton Orlando.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Katy, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNice business hotel\u201d", "Author": "DGR1968", "ReviewID": "UR126609930", "Content": "Very modern, great bed, free WiFi in rooms.

Arrived around 830pm on a Thursday night and waited in line for 30 minutes before being helped.... they only had 2 girls working the desk, and a third arrived, but with the convention traffic coming in it didn't help much. They were courteous and polite, I was upgraded to a mini-suite at no cost because they had overbooked their king rooms. Okay I thought this is good. They did book me in the tower close to the convention center since I was attending a conference there.. this is a must.. I had colleagues that was in the opposite tower and they were really in for a work out getting to the convention hall. The room was nice, a TV in the bathroom mirror was both creepy and useful!! The bed however was a bed that pulls out of the wall and about 14 inches off the ground, not great for getting up in the morning with stiff hips! Overall the room was clean, fresh, and very nice. The kid pool area is huge and perfect for families. There is a quieter pool on the recreation floor that is almost olympic length and I took advantage of the atmosphere and swam there often. Service there however only starts after 5pm. There is no food or drinks at the rec floor pool during the day. This was disappointing. Getting into any of the nicer restaurants was near impossible.. as they opened at 6pm and closed at 10pm and with the size of the hotel they were booked solid. Another disappointment. The diner was open 24x7 and had good food just slightly overpriced, but when you went there to eat, there was a line going out the door, because of the limited seating capacity.. there was no place else to grab breakfast... unless you count the grab and go which had old looking bagels and coffee... not my idea of breakfast. Service was great in the bar areas, spent 2 nights in the piano bar area, and the food was good and the service exceptional. Its a very quiet hotel, never heard any neighbors, the mattresses are comfortable, and there are lots of pillows.

When we arrived to check in everything was great included the front desk staff yet when we were shown our room, we were terribly disappointed! We reserved a suite but that is not what we got. We then called back down to speak to a manager but after waiting in our room for over 30 minutes, we decided to go down and just check out. Once we got down stairs and spoke to someone we were told to wait a few minutes more because the manager wanted to speak to us.... Well, another 15 and we are still ready to leave the hotel but just as we get up to leave, the manager finally decided to make an appearance. We were told they made a mistake and were sorry for the wrong room so then gave us the right one. Our luggage was then brought up to our new room, which was okay, but not worth the price. We had a nice time that day at the pool but need better service down there because there are not enough chairs and when we did get a place we were stuck with our empty drink glasses and food trays for the rest of the day. Anyways, later that night around 11 pm, we returned back to the room from Howl at the Moon with some friends, who were also staying at the hotel. From then on we had 3 different meets with the \"Security Officer\" who kept saying we were being too \"loud\"! I called down to the desk to speak with a manager but of course no one was available, about 10 minutes later we got a call back from one but did nothing to recitify the situation. Once again I informed then we will be more than happy to check out and never come back because I didnt know it was against the rules to have people in our sitting room that late at night just talking. There was no music on, no tv, and no loud noises, so I'm really unsure where this loud noise from our room was coming from.

We booked a couple of rooms and the occupany of the other room arrived around 10PM from her flight only to be told there was no room available.

We were in the older tower this time and the room was nicely refurbished to make it match the newer rooms, but the bathroom door opens right into the toilet. There is no clearance under the door to allow for the floormat that they have in the bathroom, as it bunches up under the door when you open it. We also had to call to get our room made around 5PM on our first day since it was never made, after we had been out all day. This was a sold out convention that we were there for. Also, we hosted a bar meet & greet in the Mallard bar area and got horrible service from a younger bar tender who wouldn't serve us without having to go through the lady who was serving the area we were standing. The problem with that was she was too busy to keep up with everyone we had and so we went directly to him to get better service for our business guests, only to be told to order through her. It was embarassing to have this transaction occur in front of our clients. We ended up only spending a few hundred dollars in the bar, but would've spent more had we had better service! Anyway...

Probably the biggest hotel I've seen or had the pleasure of staying in. I had an awesome stay here while on vacation with my wife. So here are a few tips that will help all of you who are planning on taking a vacation here. I'm a little bit of a \"cheapo\" and the rooms here are not cheap so here is how I justified it. The hotel gave me free wi-fi which is a $13/day savings. The pool area looks like a water park so that could take a day of vacation in itself free of charge. Pools is complete with spa, jacuzzi's, water fountains and a slide. Walking distance from the hotel are some cheap eats like Denny's, Ihop, McDonalds, Ben & Jerrys and a Walgreens for anything els. The hotel offers free unlimited trolly tickets that will take you to many different places around the area. Sea World is a 4 minute drive, Disney World is a 7 minute drive, and Universal Studios is a 8 minute drive. All three locations are reachable by trolly which was free for Peabody guests! With all of this offered by the hotel, I was able to save a lot of money. Inside the Peabody they have a few bars that are always packed with people having a good time and live music. You know the bar is good when non guests come to a hotel for the bar scene. Restaurants are very good as well but a little pricey. I would recommend eating off site.The Gym is really spacious and clean, which is a big plus in my book. It is separated into 4 different rooms and has a luxury locker room complete with showers. Located next to the convention center ($35 cab from Orlando airport), the Peabody actually has it's own mini convention center. They were holding some sort of conference while we were staying here and there must have been 700-800 people. The meeting rooms here are huge. I was amazed to see how many people were attending the conference, yet the hotel still did not seem crowded due to its massive size and space. Rooms are very nice and have a lot of special features that you don't see very often in hotels. Underneath the nightstands are motion censured lights that work as night lights when it detects motion in the dark. Perfect for those middle of the night runs to the restroom. In the bathroom you will find a television in the mirror (Awesome!). 2 person bathtubs if you like that type of thing. Families should check out WonderWorks which is kinda like a family fun center. My wife and I had a great time there. It had tons of wonderful, affordable, family entertainment. Overall, very nice hotel that is worth the money.

As a Meeting Planner, I am pretty picky about hotels, especially when it comes to service. I was never disappointed and actually had a great time! Rooms: I was in a Standard King room and it was really nice. The bathroom was more than enough room for me, and I tend to spread my things out when I'm getting ready. I loved the TV in the mirror - unnecessary, but cool. The bed was super comfy and I had no trouble sleeping. Service: The staff and service was great for the most part. I did have one frustrating experience while ordering food from Napa. I was over at the convention center and wanted to order the fish tacos for lunch. I called over and was transferred to Napa by the hotel Operator. I spoke with the Hostess and told her I wanted to order food to-go. She told me the bartender took to-go orders and transferred my call to the bar. Bartender never answered, but my call was picked up by the kitchen staff, who transferred me back to the bar, but somehow my call was picked up by the IT Dept. (Seriously, no joke.) Eventually I was transferred back to the bartender and he took my order. I went to pick it up without issue, but no one seemed sympathetic to my frustration of getting the run around. Anyways, by the time I got back to the CC with my food, I realized they forgot to add the salsa. Tacos were bland and sub-par. Not worth the hassle. I understand they don't usually do take out, so maybe try it out..? Food and Bev. Outlets: I ate mostly at the B-Line Diner, since it was fast and I was working. I have at least 5 meals there and everything was really tasty. The bar, Rocks, was fun and had live music. I really liked the atmosphere there and it was nice to meet up with friends and colleagues.

Went for business that took place in the adjacent/attached convention center so I'll let others comment on location and proximity to local attractions. The hotel however was quite large - almost Vegas style in dimension and presence. The public areas were very well appointed, contemporarily done, and quite comfortable. My assessments. Lobby/Check-In/Out: A- Very nice, spacious area with marble flooring. The folks at the counter were very helpful, friendly and quick to address your needs. Rooms: B- but might be an B+/A- if I were in a King. The room overall was a bit cramped but again, with double beds that's often the case. The bed itself was very comfortable, plenty of pillows. Nice flat screen TV and free wireless access. On the downside no drinks in the fridge. Typically I couldn't care less about this but in this case I came in late (midnight) and wanted to grab a beer while I was unpacking. You can order things to to room but would have been good to have something readily available. Secondly, the door to the bathroom was situated that getting around it when gaining access to the toilet wasn't a natural move. Again, not a big deal but would expect this to be a non-issue in an A rated room. The shower/tub was large but just above average - not \"excellent\". The room decor was nice, and well taken care of. Thus the overall rating. On site Dining - A-: I ate primarily at the B-Line which was quick, efficient, and the staff was very friendly. Food was good however the selection was a bit limited. That however isn't a problem since they'll make you pretty much what you ask for. Loved the traditional Lobby bar - adjacent to the light and airy lobby bar. I believe it only opens at night. Was very relaxing. Downside is again a very limited snack menu. Gym B+/A-: Great equipment (If memory serves Cybex), free weights and practically new. The cardio area was in a different room. Again near new equipment and plenty of treadmills for the times I went in. I did hear stories of a line forming in the morning. The gym opens at 6;00 a.m. and closes at 10:00 or 11:00 thus the queue in the morning. They also had a separate area to stretch and mens and women's locker/shower rooms. By most hotel standards this was well above average but the separate rooms and lack of 24 hour availability knocked down my rating a bit. Great place overall.

Gym was clean with plenty of machines and weights available for use and an extremely helpful staff. The Peabody ducks were also adorable and put on quite the show...do not miss this if you go!

We were there to enjoy each other and the FL weather. I have no idea about convenience to parks and attractions, so if that's what you're looking for, this review won't be of much help. We had a basic room in the older tower of the hotel. Rooms: Our room was spacious, comfortable and nicely appointed. The beds were very comfortable. There are automatic lights under nightstands and in the bathroom which are incredibly helpful at night. The shower was also large with good water pressure. The view was overlooking the \"normal\" pool. Restaurants: We ate at the B-line diner. The Cobb salad is awesome. The burger was a frozen meat patty, overcooked and had no flavor. I did like the fries though. We also ate at Napa and were underwhelmed. Finally, we ate at the Italian steakhouse and were also underwhelmed. In fact, at the steakhouse, our waitress was lucky. She said hello and then we never saw her again. Others took up her slack and took care of us. Pool: We went to the pool right outside our tower. There were plenty of seats and it was quiet. A nice place to read a book. They could do with some service out by the pool. It would have made it a nicer experience, but it didn't detract from my relaxation. The bar there, which opens at 5pm, was a good place to sit and enjoy a really good beer. They have a good selection and the bartenders were very nice. Other - Our check in went very smoothly. There was no line and we were checked in quickly. We stopped at the concierge and he was useless. Absolutely useless. We tried to book appointments at the spa, but they didn't answer the phone. The store in the hotel is well stocked, but it's sooooo overpriced. There's a Walgreens right down International drive. Go there to get your sodas or water. I felt violated. The wifi was spotty. Be prepared. GO - to Oceanaire restaurant. It was great. Good service, amazing and fresh seafood and Scallops that made me want to cry.

This is an exquisite hotel with all of the bells and whistles--gorgeous gym, lovely spa including the retail section, wonderful, helpful staff, lots of restaurants, a beautifully landscaped pool with a jacuzzi, kiddie pool and slide, and towel hut with a pool restaurant. The hotel stores are very reasonable and have beautiful merchandise. They offer a reasonably priced shuttle service that they use to go to the parks and this gorgeous hotel is well- organized, and totally professional. There is a trolley line right outside the hotel that goes up and down International Drive and for $1.25 one way (free for children with one paying adult), you can't beat the prices. The hotel parking is reasonable. This hotel offers incredible value for what you get. The beds were incredibly comfortable, with a pillow top mattress and great pillows. If you need a very firm mattress, you may not like the bed. The sheets were clean and crisp. This is a non-smoking hotel, so there were no unpleasant smells (I detest cigarette and cigar smoke) except in the outdoor pool area and when you walk outside of the hotel. I think the hotel should have a strict policy about smoking outside on the premises. The chain smokers make it smell like stinky bars and nightclubs. I had a salad at the pool restaurant and it was huge and delicious and not unreasonably priced, considering the ingredients. The bathrooms were spacious. I had a regular room with two queen beds in the newest part of the hotel, and the towels were of very good quality, but nevertheless, the exfoliating kind. Ha! Ha! The bathroom amenities were Gilchrist and Soames lotion, shampoo and conditioner and the trademark duck soap for the bathtub. The bathtub was double wide, the hot water was always available and the water pressure was perfect. The bathroom fixtures were Kholer, with granite counter tops, a lighted make up mirror and great lighting. The toilet was very quiet. We never heard any noises from other guests except through the walls of the bathroom--the guest next door was a very loud talker. The remote-controlled tv in the mirror in the bathroom was funny. It always worked and my child enjoyed watching cartoons in there. The shower curtain was great, it was clean and I really wanted to buy one to take home. The cleanliness of the room was above average but not immaculate, as others have stated. There was dust on the back of the base of the table lamp on the nightstand and behind the nightstand mainly, but the bathroom always appeared to be spotless (my main concern) as well as the counter surfaces of the room. The floor to ceiling window was spotless. The refrigerator was stocked daily with two bottles of water that were paid for with the resort fee. I really loved this hotel and won't stay anywhere else when visiting Orlando. It was convenient to the parks, quiet and luxurious without breaking the bank. Also, my husband left his prescription glasses and they have an amazing lost and found service that fed ex'd them to our house. I called the day that we left the hotel when my husband discovered them missing and the hotel worked it all out quickly and efficiently.

Unfortunately, the staff is not up to the challenge of running a quality hotel. For a hotel that advertises itself as perfect for special events, meetings, and conventions, the Peabody Orlando\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff was ill-prepared to handle the Holiday crowd at the end of 2011. Upon arriving at the Peabody on December 29th, we found that the staff had allowed 500 guests to check out late that day. This created a wait for in-coming guests, and despite the fact that we arrived at after 6:00 PM, our room was not ready. We were not the only party with this problem, and dozens of travel weary guests dotted the lobby waiting for their rooms. This issue continued during the next few days and I spoke to many guests who had to wait for their rooms as they attempted to check-in. The next morning we left to visit the theme parks at 7:00 AM. When we arrived at our room at 6:00 PM that night we found that housekeeping had neglected to visit the room. Tired, and needing to hurry to make our 8:00 PM dinner reservations, I was made to wait at the front desk for twenty minutes to speak to a manger. The room was finally cleaned, and after some discussion a credit courtesy was extended, but the inconvenience was suffered. I was assured by the manager that this mistake would not be repeated. The next day we left our room at 11:00 AM. The housekeeping staff was in the room next door and we bid them good morning as we departed. Upon our return at 5:00 PM\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 you guessed it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 no housekeeping staff had visited our room. This time I was made to wait at the front desk for twenty-five minutes as the stupefied front desk person called the housekeeping manager. As I stood there, I spoke to a poor woman who had been waiting in the lobby for her room which was not ready, in spite of the fact that it was well past check-in time. The housekeeping manger was very nice, and very apologetic, but she had no idea why the room had not been visited by her staff. After demanding a straight answer she simply advised that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are very busy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Again, my family had to leave the room as the staff hurried to correct their mistake. Another courtesy was extended, and another inconvenience was endured. As I mentioned at the top of the review, this hotel is beautiful. The rooms, lobby area, pools, and restaurants are very nice, and I have no issues with the property itself. If the staff ever gets it's act together and learns how to handle their establishment during peak periods the Peabody will be an exceptional destination.

The room was well spaced and although furniture was adequate and appropriate in size style and comfort (very comfortable/clean beds and comforters), it did lack a few things (IMHO). First, there was no coffee maker, and considering the inclusion of Hotel breakfast would have added $90/day, an avid morning coffee drinker (myself included) who does not want to overspend for breakfast in a town were most Hotels include it in the rates, would have to dart and sprint to the coffee shop past the lobby for the morning Joe. Secondly, the toiletries were very basic (only shampoo/conditioner, soap and lotion offered) in the otherwise VERY IMPRESSIVE bathroom (automatic motion-detecting night lights, IN MIRROR TV and over sized soaking tub in shower). Thermostat was stuck on AC but was fixed w/in 15 min. after a maintenance call at midnight. Pool area appeared fantastic! Wished we had time to indulge :(.

Seems like a downgrade from \"luxury\" to \"business class\" and slightly dysfunctional at that. Last time, I was in the original hotel and this time in Tower 2, so that might make a difference, but last time, it seemed MUCH more luxurious than this time around. I had trouble with my in-room safe upon arrival (promptly fixed) and didn't get a WiFi signal at all the first night, then a weak one on subsequent nights (I was there for 4.. for a conference). In the renovation, they did away with in-room coffeemakers and put in empty refrigerators (except for a couple bottles of water), with \"feed the fridge\" option from room service (overpriced and not too varied). They also added \"electric mirrors\" in the bathrooms.... mirrors with TVs embedded. Big whoop. The one in my room picked up about 5 channels. The room TV was better, but not by a landslide... very limited cable options, plus overpriced movies. Although I'm not a coffee drinker, I'd have preferred a coffeemaker to the newer amenities, as I'd have had the option to brew some tea without having to get dressed and go down to the lobby to get it. Heard the same complaint (only louder) from the coffee drinkers. Very dumb idea, they said... plus there's a surcharge to get the lobby coffee anyway. Really dumb. It's a huge hotel and connected to the convention center across the street, so one can walk to that without going outside, if desired. Their conference center facilities is what my group used. Nice, but nothing special, really. They placed glasses and water urns at the back of the rooms instead of having pitchers on the tables with glasses, as most other conference centers do. Same with pens and \"paper\" (actually little note cards). For the price, it was, again, disappointing. The first glass of water I got tasted like the urn had been used for coffee in the recent past, also... blech! Apparently, not well cleaned.. blech again! All in all, it's still a very nice hotel. The ducks are fun to watch. The restaurants in it have good food and service. The staff is friendly. The rooms are nice, clean and well kept. However, as I said earlier, I'd call it overpriced business class now instead of luxury...for Tower 2, at least. Probably won't return, unless a conference is there again and the boss picks up the tab. Maybe not even then. A colleague from another company stayed a mile away, took a taxi daily and still saved her boss over $125 daily... plus had a coffeemaker. I may do likewise in the future and would've done this time, if I had known what I now know. One item there I'd rate as excellent was room service breakfast.

We had a fantastic time and have only the best things to say about the property and its staff. Location is great, easy to walk to lots of restaurants and shops. The pool was lovely. Of course, it poured most of the time we were there. We did manage to find a nook by the hot tub that protected us from the wind one afternoon. And the time it was sunny, we really enjoyed the pool. Lots of lounge chairs and spots to choose from. The bar staff came around for drink orders. They were super friendly and the drinks were very good. We spent one day at the spa. The staff there are just awesome! I've been to many spas througout the country and Carribbean and these folks were the nicest I've experienced. We had the couples massage with the bath ritual. The bath was so beautiful...candles and flower petals. I just wish the staff would have mentioned we should bring our camera in to take a picture...it was very romantic and the massages were great. We spent the day being lazy in the lounge area, reading books and sipping tea. The room was fabulous, very comfy bed and sheets. We asked for a high floor and they were happy to accommodate. We just had to wait a bit longer and they called us when it was ready. Gave us time to take a walk and have lunch. Yes, the ducks are a riot! People start lining up around the red carpet 30 minutes before the march. The ducks waddled alot faster to get into the fountain than leaving the fountain, we noticed. The staff take a lot of pride in this tradition. We had several corporate events during our stay and all were amazing. I was impressed with their service and quality of food when catering to over 2,000!!! Big shout out to Oseas, who was our server at brunch on Monday morning. He was the best...friendly and attentive. Our last morning I was wearing a Peabody Orlando shirt I bought in the gift store and numerous employees commented that they liked my shirt. I think you can tell alot about how an organization treats its employees by their attitude and enthusiasm for their own brand. It seems the Peabody Orlando staff are proud of their work and employer and it shows in their attention to detail and interactions with guests.

The pool was gorgeous with waterfalls and a slide for the kids, even a kiddie pool if you have really small children. The gift shop and lobby cafe were wonderful.

As he squeezed between patrons and tables, he would say \"Human car wash!\" As lovely--and as large--as the Peabody is, I often felt that my journey along the main floor was indeed a human car wash. With its huge conference spaces and proximity to the Orange County Convention Center, the hotel draws busfuls of conventioneers. And they seem to all converge along the length of the main floor, stretching from Napa/Rocks restaurant/bar on one end to the B-Line Diner on the other. It made moving quickly, or even at a normal pace, very difficult. Also, the mass of taxis, limos, cars, buses, etc at the various entrances made it difficult to unload luggage. The valets acted more like traffic cops, helping cars navigate the tangle of vehicles. My visit happened to coincide with the Republican Presidential nominee debates at the convention center and the Florida Republican straw poll. At one point when I needed to discuss something with a front-desk clerk, I encountered a line of at least 75 people trying to check into the hotel for the political festivities. Granted, it was probably an aberration, but it was inconvenient nonetheless. The only other real problem was that the concierge desk was understaffed in the morning. I waited 15 minutes just to be able to ask a simple yes-or-no question. In all fairness, I did notice 3 or 4 concierges at the desk in the evenings. Now that I've dispensed with the negatives, there is much to like about this property. I won't go into detail about things that have been discussed frequently on Trip Advisor, but I agree that the rooms were very nice and comfortable, the food was good, and the temperature in the hotel was easy to control. For me, the hotel stood out in two areas: the fitness facility and the pool. The surcharge for gym/coffee/newspaper is well worth it for the health club alone. It features a room with weight machines, an attached room with free weights, and a third \"core\" room, with bosus, balls, a stretching \"cage,\" mats, and similar equipment. There is also a large cardio area with treadmills, bikes, etc. There are also a spin room and two exercise studios, though I never saw those in use. As for the pool area, it is vast, as befits this behemoth of a hotel. For kids, there is a twisting water slide that was very popular. The pool itself is large but shallow--more for wading and milling around in. There also is a separate kids' pool. In addition, I noticed out my window that there is a nice lap pool somewhere else on the property, but I never got there. Finally, if you park in the hotel's garage, take a ride back to the hotel with Carmelo in the golf cart.

Inside the ample mirror in the bathroom that does not fog-up is another flat screen T.V. (my Wife Loved). The drawers close themselves. Each of these were practical luxuries we appreciated.

The \"Continental Breakfast\" was great , if fresh smoked Lox and Smoked Salmon with all the fixings with Fruit and assorted other wonderful cheeses and meats are included in your hotels continental Breakfast then I've been being robbed at other fine establishments . The evening was similar with many Tapas type appetizers and desserts to enjoy. Did I mention drinks? The famous Duck walk at 11AM was fun and the many pools, restaurants, art and elegance that is usually reserved for a snobby atmosphere, but it just does not happen here. Its the single most friendly place we've stayed, ever. Story: We were in need of a little get away, Labor Day was starting on Friday, it was Thursday night at Eleven PM and my wife and I were still working at the office. I checked our favorite haunts but none met our budget or liking. It occurred to my wife to go ninety miles to Orlando for our old and all-time favorite place were stayed many times, years before. The Peabody Hotel. We made our Reservations late at night and were on our way by noon the next day, I was a little concerned that Expedia, Oyster or Bookit (Idid not remember who we dealt with) had confirmed my reservation. I called the Peabody, Cheameil in reservations, who confirmed our stay and asked if this was our first time. I explained that it had be a while but we love the Peabody, however this was my nine month old granddaughters first trip. She asked if I could hold for a moment, came back and said that she had received authorization to upgrade our rooms and would see to it that a Baby Bed, full size Microwave and extra refrigerator were in the room. When we arrived we discovered that we also were given Valle parking and Club Level Rooms overlooking their new many acre new pool resort. The staff, from Jason at the front desk, Delores at the B-Line Diner, the Bellman who has been there for twenty four years were all exceptional at making you realize that you were important to them. Again and again they were so helpful and I would ask why they were so \"over the top\"? It was Kelly or Megan in the Club Lounge who when I asked that question; what was the Peabody difference?

Another Orlando hotel scam practised by the majority of hotels. 3) There is a $15 daily charge for rollaway bed. We were aware of all of these charges before we travelled. 4) We arranged prior to arrival for all our kids to be duckmasters for the day. The Duckmaster contacted us via Email and arranged it all. The kids had a brilliant time and loved it. Quite nerve racking for them as there are a lot of people watching. Duckmaster was superb, a lovely man, who thoroughly enjoyed his job ( Management if you read this I hope you take note!!!) Negatives Only one which didn't affact the experience.

Upon our arrival, it is incredibly impressive with a separate multi storey car park and amazing swimming pools. The young lady who dealt with us at the desk was hardly a bundle of personality but was efficient and fairly quick. Any of six gleaming lifts took us to our room on floor six and they proved to be so available for the duration of our stay. The bedroom itself was spacious and well appointed. The TV in the bathroom mirror was a novelty with our son! From my point of view, the biggest plus point was the quality of the bed and of course the pillows. It was a pleasure to sleep on them! The (family) pool was just so relaxing with its beach side area. Just no need to worry about kids falling into deep water here. Perhaps being August, there may not have been a big conference on, but sun loungers were plentiful, along with towels and cold towels served pool side! I had a couple of cocktails and they were magic also. Whilst leaving the hotel ( to get to my hire car), the staff seemed rather perplexed that we should choose to walk the 200 metres or so in the heat, when for the price of a tip they would talk you there in a golf buggy. Those people that were driven, looked like they could have done with the exercise! The Multi storey car park was really clean and not threatening like some back home. I did sample the internet via the business centre one night, and also had dealings with the Consierge desk - both were first class. One night we wandered into the Conference area and it was truly amazing. The size of it, and the quality! I've struggled to find any negatives about our 10 day experience at the Peabody Hotel. The daily charge administered seems a bit bizarre when we really didnt experience any business like functions such as wifi or read the New York Times provided,etc. Oh yes, the toilet tissue (roll) did seem rather flimsy considering the status of the Hotel, but I may just be splitting hairs on this point.

We received an astounding rate through AAA and booked a 3 night stay at the Peabody Orlando. I'm a frequent Orlando tourist and have read several reviews of this property over the years. Our stay met and exceeded all expectations. The valets and bellhoppers greeted me and my wife with a pleasant attitude. I opted for self-parking, so our bags were securely taken to the front desk area. The lobby was exquisite; more importantly, there were plenty of agents available, and check-in was efficient. The room was finely equipped with an I-pod deck/alarm clock radio, wired/wireless internet access, telephone, mini-fridge, complimentary peabody bath robes, ironing board w/iron, and a safe. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were changed consistently. The bathroom was marbleous, with a mini-tv inside a mirror. The shower/tub was large and the toiletries and towels were replaced daily, although they ask that you conserve, if possible. I toured a good portion of the hotel, including some of the conference rooms. It's consistently neat and clean throughout the various sections. There are several dining options and we chose to eat at the B-line Diner for breakfast. The food was very good; however, as other reviews have noted, it is costly. My wife loves nature, and she insisted on seeing the ducks marching. While we missed their entrance, we did get to see them in their pond. The Duckmaster was friendly and extremely knowledgable. He angaged me and my wife for 15 minutes, while children and others were taking pictures. This definitely was the highlight of our stay. The pool, spa, and fitness centers were thoroughly equipped and had friendly staff. It was refreshing to note that the Peabody takes pool safety seriously, as there was always someone monitoring the pool slide. You could not go down until the other person cleared the immediate area. In summation, the Peabody was one of the finest hotels that I've stayed in. It's family friendly, an intimate place for couples, and ideal for business travelers. This is a hard combination to pull off, but the Peabody does it. I'm not sure how it was previously, but the renovations look incredible. The people are helpful and friendly. There are some things to know: there is a daily parking and hotel fee, dining at the hotel is expensive, the parking garage is separate from the hotel, but there are always shuttles running to accommodate guests and their luggage. Several hotels and shopping centers are within walking distance, and there are quite a few \"entrances\" into the hotel. Make sure you see valets and bellhops, otherwise you're at the convention side of the hotel, and a long way from check in.

At the south end of International Drive, across the road from Pointe Orlando, bars, restaurants, cinema, shops etc. Am I allowed to say \"the nice end\" of International Drive. The hotel oozes professionalism and class. From pulling up on our airport transfer coach - more on that later - and being met by a group of bell hops/valet chaps for our luggage. Check in was a breeze. After a 6 hour delay at Gatwick, our arrival was 11.30pm. It may as well have been 1pm in the afternoon given the welcome we were given and the smoothness of the booking in process. Yes - there is a $9 a night hotel charge payable on book in. Get over it those who complain about this. Every hotel now has some kind of charge. For this you get your daily paper, 2 bottles of water, free internet (I checked into work regularly from our room with no performance issues) and i-Trolley tickets free daily. (Free shuttling up and down International Drive - a must do even if you have a car. You see so much more.) We were also given a free upgrade - nice. We were in tower 2 on 15th Floor. The room was gorgeous. Still a hotel room but spotless, up to date (others have mention tv and bathroom mirror tv) and roomy. 6 lifts to each floor, no waiting, express lifts meant you may have been on 4th floor. Free safe in each room is nice to have. Fridge is roomy - our always had a few beers, coke, powerade type drinks and chocolate - hey, it was 95 degrees most days at the parks... you needed to have energy. Room service were great. We had no complaints on the service on any day. Even if we left the room at midday. Do not disturb was always respected. Rest of the hotel. HUGE. Few key points. The shop in-hotel is beyond ridiculous on it's pricing - geared at business people with expense accounts I think. An example, a pack of 2 AA batteries - $6.99. In the theme parks they were only $6 for a pack of 4. $4 for a bottle of water. $6 for a small bar of chocolate...it was endlessly too expensive. The steak house restaurant in house was an average of $40 for an entree. No need when the very best steak houses outside the hotel were $30 for the most expensive steaks (16oz New York Strip at Cattlemans - oh my word....died and gone to heaven). B-Line Diner has been mentioned several times. Not cheap, not expensive. A lovely experience whether breakfast or a late night meal. Staff are great - we turned up needing breakfast at 11.30am when they stopped at 11am. Not a problem - breakfast menu re-appeared in a flash. B-Line is a great option when you literally crawl back into the hotel in the evening after a park knowing you will not make it back out. It is also good for take away should you want to be by the pools some day to recover (nice link eh!). We visited two pools. The ground floor pools, the curvy/water slides kind of pool was ok. Too shallow for swimming - great for kids. Coconut Shack for food and drinks was reasonable. We only went their once, no complaints - just too manic for a relaxing day. The terrace pool is fantastic. For adults peace time. No thrills, about 5ft 6\" in the deep bit, 25m long. Great for throwing a ball, lane swimming, or just lazing around. Kind of hidden away so it was never crowded. I was in there on my own one day and a company had a \"team building\" day basically around it - very amusing to watch people suffering what I had many times. The Ducks.... well - you think \"how silly I'll not bother\". We caught it by accident and it was sweet/funny and very glad we made it. Disney Shuttles. There is a transfer/ticket desk. Not the friendliest of people but know their stuff. Cost $10 each way to any Disney park - compared to taxi's an absolute bargain. You're looking at $50 each way to Magic Kingdom. Buy your Disney tickets before you go to Orlando - tip if you know you'll only go to each park once - look for the Disney Base Tickets... you save about \u00c2\u00a380 a ticket. Oh yes - the Airport shuttle. We booked through Travel Republic - no complaints there. The actual shuttle was American Coach. Rubbish. We waited an hour at the airport for their minibus to fill up - and then a further 30 mins for the driver to then move. After a 6 hour delay, you don't need that. Worse than that was the return trip. We confirmed 24 hours in advance as instructed and were waiting to be picked up 15 minutes before. 15 mins after the pickup time we phoned and were told 15mins. Then phoned again - 20 mins. Then again. 15 mins. Then 10. etc etc. It was 1 1/2 hours late - obviously they shunted people to fill the mini bus. Not to be recommended - but then you may not have a choice. Tip would be to phone the confirmation number again 15 minutes before pickup time - that way they know you'll hassle them. If you're like me and have speed read the above, then take note that to us, The Peabody was the best hotel on the \"Drive\". By a country mile. Oh - and a lot of other hotels we looked like Doubletree were nice ...but nothing around them! You'd need a car. We most definitely did not.

It is however a short 5 minute walk to Pointe Orlando which is shopping, dining and nightlife in one convenient location. The room was nice and had some nice features you expect in a luxury hotel (motion sensored night lights,tv in bathroom mirror, spa robes, 24 hour room service, comfortable beds). We did not eat at the restaurants but they all looked nice and had great sounding menus. There are multiple pools, slides, a children's \"beach\" area, pool bars and restaurant. It's nice that the pool is open until 11 pm. There is a spa in the hotel, however we did not have any services done due to our limited time. The hotel bars are open until 1:30 am. The check-in was quick and simple. As was the checkout. My only complaints were that valet is $20 per day, self parking is $15 but quite a long walk. Also, my room was obviously not dusted when cleaned, and the tv in the bathroom mirror almost never worked. There is also a resort fee of $10 per day they inform you of upon check-in. We were told this covers the Trolley passes, high-speed Internet, waters daily in your fridge and a New York Times paper every morning at your door. But at least they tell you what the fee is for, a lot of hotels just charge you and give no explanation. Overall we were happy with our stay at the Peabody. The ducks marching to the fountain on the red carpet in the morning and evenings is always entertaining. There is always somewhere to get something to eat or drink 24hours. Your car is always ready for you if you call valet before you leave your room. There are also shops, fitness center, tennis courts, etc to keep you entertained.

The only opportunity with this hotel is the walk from the self park to the entrance of the hotel, and there was a fee for parking. The hotel needs more directions on arrival to get you from the self park to the lobby; however, once we got the lay of the land everything was good. A nice little tram transports you from the parking lot to the hotel. I'm assuming that's due to the proximity of the conference center.

The reason I chose this hotel (and I did alot of research online) was for the \"Grotto\" pool area beacause of our two young children. The first day we got there the pool was very,very crowed due to a Zumba convention. Ok, that is understandable and we were fine with that knowing this is a hotel next to the convention center. I asked someone when the convention would be over and found out that was the last day. We were happy with that knowing we could enjoy the main reason we came and could enjoy the Grotto pool tomorrow. The next day we made our way to the Grotto pool with our two excited children! The Grotto pool was CLOSED! Not just for a day but for a whole week! How disappointing! And my husband and I are coming back to stay for our anniversary in three days! We booked these two getaways a month ago to have a relaxing weekend away. One with our children and one without. We did not come to use the older lap pool! The Grotto pool area is lush and tropical! You feel that you have escaped to a tropical island when your there. Would not have booked if I knew the Grotto pool was going to be closed for a whole week! Other than that it is a beautiful property!

The hotel is amazing with top facilities. Our stay started of perfectly with Chocolate Strawberries and a welcome note in our room from the manager (Thanks Mr K). The pool area is large with additional kids pool & slide / grotto pool with waterfall & hot tub. The sun loungers are tops, not some plastic thing but proper canvas loungers - all towels are provided at the pool also ! There are various restaurants in the Hotel but we only went once to the B-Line Diner which was nice although a tad expensive. Other restaurants nearby are TGI Fridays / Olive Garden / Johnny Rockets & McD's (for the kids if needed !) We were in the New Tower (2) on the 23rd floor with a great view overlooking the pool area and most of Orlando - amazing at night - you can even see the fireworks from Disney ! The beds were just the most comfy bed you'll ever sleep in - huge bathroom with TV in the mirror ! + mini fridge & large LCD TV. You get 2 bottles of water everyday in your room + newspaper + I-Ride trolley tickets although you may have to ask at the desk for these but given gladly. The I-Ride trolley (Stop 26) is right outside the Hotel - perfect for going to either Outlet for shopping. (there are outlets both North & South using the RED LINE trolley). The only thing to keep in mind is this Hotel is adjacent to the Convention Centre and therefore can be busy with people staying for these conventions. We encountered a lot of kids who were staying due to some dance comp - then as we were leaving a Zumba convention was checking in - 500 of them !! but this hotel can cope no problem at all !!

We arrived around 12 AM this past Friday and were warmly greeted by the Front Desk. After check-in, we ate at the B-Line Diner (open 24 hours), which was delicious and very reasonable. The parking is said to be far from the hotel. It is not a bad walk at all (3-5 minutes) if you are staying in the Main Tower (new tower). The new pool area grotto is beautiful and it has a slide. The poolside staff was extremely attentive. It got windy one evening at the pool grotto so we switched pools because we noticed that it was much warmer up by the Mallard Tower pool (old tower 6th floor). It was nice for evening/night swimming. The rooms in the new tower are extremely clean. There's a TV, weighing scale and floor sensor lights in the bathroom. The toiletries are Gilchrist & Soames. The beds are very comfortable. We didn't get to visit the fitness room or unfortunately the spa. All the walking at the parks in the hot sun was a work out in itself! Driving to Sea World or Universal Studios (for Harry Potter Wizarding World!) is very easy (5-10 minute drive). We walked from the hotel to The Pointe shops for dinner at Cuba Libre (yummy). We noticed hotel golf carts offering rides but, the walk is very doable. To celebrate our anniversary we wanted to have a nice seafood dinner in the Disney area. The concierge recommended Todd English Blue Zoo at the Disney Dolphin Resort. What a great recommendation. The food was delicious and they greeted us with dessert champagne and strawberries. All in all the Peabody was the way to go! I'm glad I researched this property via Trip Advisor before going to Orlando.

The hotel and grounds are immaculate. New pool is fantastic. Service is top notch. Housekeeping does a great job. Self-parking is $12 and the resort fee is $9. The resort fee provides you with wireless Internet, two bottles of water daily, two I-Ride trolley tickets, coffee, and use of the fitness center. Not a bad value for $9, although, these fees are a joke at any hotel. I-Ride tickets are $2.50 RT per person. Use the water, and they replace them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they do not stockpile the water in your room. The coffee provided is okay. I am not an Orlando hotel pool expert, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to guess that the new Peabody pool is one of the best in the area. The fitness center may be the best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen at a hotel anywhere. We took the I-Ride trolley to Sea World and it was great. Did not take long at all, and it drops passengers at the side of the front entrance. The rooms are very clean, and the beds/pillows are comfortable. Soaps are Gilchrist & Soames. We are staying in one of the original towers, and I was told the rooms were recently renovated. If you self-park, the garage is a short walk, or you can get a ride on a golf cart to the garage by asking a hotel bellman out front. If you are looking for a cheaper option to the Ritz or JW Marriott, then give this place a shot. We booked through a third party site that provided the name of the hotel after purchase. Our nightly base rate is $78/night. Our room overlooks the roof of the convention area, and two men painting the side of the hotel. I was told by an employee the hotel is at 30-40% capacity for most of the week. Our floor is very quiet, and uneventful, which is nice. Who would not want a better view? However, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never been one to sit in my room and look out the window on vacation, especially one in this area. It is a convention hotel, and there were two going on when we arrived. The hotel is right next to the Orange County Convention Center, however there is nothing currently happening there now (holiday week). Convention goers usually don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take up space at a pool all day anyway. My only complaint is that when I originally called the hotel to check my reservation I was told that the resort fee was optional. At check-in I was told that he resort fee was a mandate. When I spoke to a concierge I was asked if I opted into the resort fee, and then when I asked a customer service rep on the phone later about this, I was told it was a mandate. That is very annoying. I would have opted out as I already have wireless Internet with me on the trip. if you are paying top dollar to stay here, then get to the bottom of this \"option\".

The soundproofing is poor, so you can hear people in the hallway and next door yelling/talking. We were put in the room at the end of the hall next to the Ice Machine so I could hear that noise all night long. The layout of the bathroom was cramped, but the worse part was our tub was CLOGGED when I went to take a shower. Gross. The metal cap underneath the tub faucet/spout was also broken and falling off. I would see the rusting and mildew inside. Worst of all, Housekeeping refused to change my bed linens even though I placed the \"Please Change Bed Linens\" card clearly and plainly on my pillow. The bed was re-made by housekeeping, but the linens were not changed and I could tell because my daughter had been eating crackers the day before and there were cracker crumbs on the INSIDE part of the sheets. Basically, housekeeping remade the bed and replaced the bed linen card so that I would think the sheets were changed. THEY WERE NOT. With so many families staying in Orlando---why is the smoking section outside the front doors of the hotel? Many families stand at the Valet turn around to wait for their rental cars. It is idiotic to put the smoking section near this area, where many kids sit and wait for cars. With so many hotel options in Orlando, you should look elsewhere.

( the protein drink my husband bought there was $5 though...who got the better deal? HAH!) Valet parking was $20 per day plus tax. Service was quick and friendly for it. There is a \"resort fee\" at this hotel, which is pretty darn typical for the nicer hotels in Orlando, so it was to be expected. It was nice though that this meant internet was available. This was invaluable to us when we found out that tornadoes had hit our home town while we were gone! Would have loved to stay longer and try out the fitness center, perhaps the spa, and some of the other restaurants. Rocks Lounge had live music Friday night when we checked in, but we were too tired to go enjoy it. We spent two whole days in parks, so we spent way less time than we would have liked in the hotel itself. I might add that we are not pool people, but seeing the pool from the hall window near the elevators from our 13th floor made us want to be pool people and have the time to experience it. Water-slide included! The ONLY thing we disliked about The Peabody was that we only had 3 nights there! Now please excuse me while I go check our lottery ticket to see if we can go back tomorrow!", "Date": "April 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cFab Hotel\u201d", "Author": "roundtheworld53", "ReviewID": "UR106274804", "Content": "We stayed here for a week.

They have a 9 dollar a day resort fee but its worth it because you get the paper every morning, bottles of water in your fridge and wifi which is excellent.

There is a nice fitness centre there with facilities to shower and freshen up if you have a late flight and have already checked out.

I managed to get a fantasic rate and called reservations before actually booking to make sure I would not encounter the same issues like the previous hotel. I called reservations and was helped by two exceptional ladies call Stephanie and Diana, I can not praise these ladies enough, excellent in every way and more importantly very understanding to my needs. So off I went kids in tow for my 10 days, now this hotel is as beautiful as the website pictures show, infact I dont think the website pictures do it justice as it really is nice and modern (even the older part looks good for its age) Check in was ok, although reception need to tell guests upon check in what ammeneties are included, I booked very last minute and I forgot it was only until I got up to the room after some hours and I read the in room info that I remembered that the trolley pass, local calls, ect..are included, but if you dont read the info in room or booked way ahead so not likely to remember you will never know this due to recepion not telling you and if you booked via a 3rd party like expedia then you are really stuffed as that info is not always in the description. I am a creature of modern comforts and this hotel, especially the rooms has it all, the bathroom TV was a delight, the bed super comfy, lots of space, nice decor...however I stay in an awful lot of hotels and most of them are 4-5 star, so seeing a glitzy room can no longer cloud my judgement and I base a lot of my opinions of a hotel on service rather than style and this is where this hotel falls short. Concierge : Pretentious and snooty are the best words to describe them, the Peabody needs to figure out if they want to be a business or family hotel, I was speaking with a staff member who explained for many years they were more more a business client hotel which would explain the \"professionalisim\" to the point of frosty and cold from nearly all the concerige staff, but if they are trying to pull familes in they really need to drop the attitude. I asked \"Nathan\" on concerige if they had an ice machine, I was told \"Well of course\" with a tone that suggested I was some kind of hill-billy for even asking, now bearing in mind there is nothing I could find in the room to tell you where the ice machine was located I just assumed like some 4* deluxe and 5* hotels in the UK, they did not have a ice machine because it is usually sent up to you free of charge through room service. That was just one of many attitude issues I had with concierge,I also had an issue with being given wrong information by another lady on concerige who equally had a stinking attitude, and ended up speaking with Marlina the duty manager, who was a total delight, professional, friendly, bent over backwards to help sort things out. I think the majority of the concerige staff are straight out of college as they all seemed a bit young and inexperienced and you could see hints of attitude and diva strops coming through if things got a bit tough for them. Housekeeping: I am still unsure if I just got the short straw in the housekeeping department or if this is how the whole HK team operate. The first 4-5 days were ok, but by day 5 I realised that the room had not been hoovered (1 adult and 2 children with one being a toddler the room by the way) or if it had been it was a very bad job, lots of smear marks still left on tables, thick dust around bedside lamp, ipod stereo and TV and also on the shelves where they fold and put the towels, bathroom not being mopped (my toddler cant quite aim well so lets just say when he misses you know about it after some days if not cleaned properly) fridge not shut properly after refilling with water (they did this 3 times by the way) which caused my sons milk to go off as the cupboard the fridge is located is very warm, some days I got shower gel, some days didn't, this kind of stuff should not be occuring in this level of hotel, how can you have a guest stay for 10 days and midway through their stay not give the room a deep clean?!? Clearly they do not have many long stay guests as I had to call up housekeeping twice about this as the room was getting pretty dirty (the first time fell on deaf ears) but in fairness I blame the supervisors, they are the ones who are supposed to inspect the rooms and they are the ones who are allowing this poor standard of cleaning to go on. Bell Hop: Overall they were pretty friendly, but upon check in not one of them even bothered to try and help me (and one guy actually looked over at me) with my 2 large suitcases, pram and kids, so was left to struggle with this up to me room on my own and neither did the lady at reception ask if I needed help, but at that stage I was just happy to be out fo the other hotel. Reception: Other than chek in and check out I did not have much contact with reception, I have mentioned about check in, not the best as they lady who check me in could have been more informative but nothing could prepare me for the receptionist named \"Britney\" She has no business working front of house, and she should be kept on switchboard back of house! the most sour faced, miserable rude receptionist I have had the misfortune of encountering, she gave my son a scornful look becasue he was making some noise, she asked to see my ID as they was some credit on my account and she inspected my ID more than immigration did upon enty to the USA, I understand the need to do this, but you really had to be there to see how far she took this as if I was some kind of criminal..yes Britney, that kind of behaviour is going to really want guests to back to the Peabody!?! There was no \"how was your stay\" no \"goodbye\" nothing, just processed me out in silence...total utter disgrace of a receptionist and whoever hired her ought to be ashmed to have her there! On a postive, the pool guys were all really nice, Britney who worked in the B-line was lovely and always friendly and helpful and as I mentioned for the most part the bell hop guys were usually happy and polite, the guys who worked in the coffee shop next to the main hotel shop were all nice also so there are the odd diamonds in the rough at the Peabody, but the really good staff who truly understand customer service are all sadly back of house for the most part, but if all the staff had the attitude of the likes of Marlina, Stephanie and Diana, I see no reason why the Peabody can not be one of the top 10 hotels in Orlando. Would I stay again? I am still unsure, but one thing is for certain is if I do, it will be 7 days or less as housekeeping seem to just give up after day 5!", "Date": "April 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, NH", "Title": "\u201cA very pleasant surprise.\u201d", "Author": "RJAllard", "ReviewID": "UR105866441", "Content": "Stayed here while in the area visiting colleges with my son.

My husband surprised our family with a last minute trip for a little R&R.

The staff including the bell hops, waiter/waitresses, housekeeping, cashiers, front desk attendance and even room service answering line were AMAZINGly cordial and compleltely professional. The food was top notch at all venues EXCEPT Napa resturant (which I will touch upon after the positives!) We are true foodies-infact we spent a few hours each day at Sea World and Aquatica and made it a point to round out our days by @Noon so we could have lunch at the Peabody. Not to be missed are the Coconut Shrimp with a peanut Thai salad, Beef Empanadas with homemade salsa, Chicken Quesadillas (which are made with fresh grilled chicken on a spinach tortilla) served with homemade mango salsa all poolside at the Coconut Grill. Room service was also terrific with a Orange infused brioche french toast. Breakfast and lunch at the B Line Diner were equally delic as well. Our dinner at the Cipriccio Grill was one of the best of my times with Kobe beef and a Filet with blue cheese that would knock your socks off. Our waiter there-Luis was fabulous and made our experience just a really special night!! Now I want to warn patrons of the Napa resturant which is seems is tauted as a \"high\" end venue at the Peabody. I only write this now, so that you do not spend $250 on a meal that is below acceptable. We do not mind spending twice as much as that on a meal that is superior-but ours was far from it. We ordered Mussels as one of the appetizers, they were not only cold but the broth they were served in was a bland red tomato sauce perhaps out of a can? One person is our party ordered \"Halibut\" and as avid fishermen, we knew that this was stripped bass at first taste. We guessed correct when our bill came it listed not Halibut but Stripped Bass-go figure. Two people in our party ordered the Ahi Tuna-terrible as well and served with I believe white minute rice??? We walked away hungry-and dissappointed. The next day upon checking out we just gave an FYI to the Front desk when we were asked about our stay-lovely except for the meal at Napa-I believe my husband is writing a letter to the manager so he/she could perhaps experience a meal at Napa \"undercover\" so that the could rectify the chefs short comings???

The food in both restaurants B-line and Napa were to die for, however breakfast ran 95 bucks with tip, so it was very expensive for our family.

We had just spent a few days at Disney's Beach Club. While the Peabody is a nicer hotel with much nicer rooms, the service pales in comparison to what we received at Disney. Our first issue came right away when we tried to find the entrance. With no signs indicating that there were two entrances to the hotel, we took the first one. There were bell hops outside of this entrance so it looked valid. Stepping inside there was no check-in desk and no one around to ask (and again no signs pointing the way). After wandering around I found a concierge who was entirely unimpressed at having to answer my simple question as to the location of the check-in desk. Turns out there was a new entrance... quite a ways from where we had came in. The bell hops that we had first seen had not mentioned anything, they had not bothered to greet us and had in no way indicated that we should be going further down to check in. Check-in at 8pm took 45min. For that time of day the length of time is absolutely ridiculous! When we found the new entrance the bell hops did not offer to help us with luggage but rather were more concerned with talking among themselves and acted as if they were too good for any of the guests at the hotel. The room (in the new tower) was very spacious, very comfortable and well appointed. The bathroom was the largest that I have seen at a hotel. Overall, very, very nice rooms. Unfortunately, that's the best thing that I can say about this hotel. Maid service during the day cleaned the room around 3-4pm. I've never had maid service come that late anywhere that I have stayed before. Food at the hotel is outrageous - $8 for a large latte, it's not gold and the people making it are certainly not skilled barristas since I can make a better latte. Luckily there are plenty of restaurants on International Dr that are a short walk away. Perhaps I would not have been so disappointed if I had not just come from Disney (where my room was cheaper than at the Peabody at one of the Deluxe resorts) but I was completely underwhelmed by the service here. I found that the employees were very rude, had no concept of service and really did not want to be there. If you only want a great room and don't care about rude service (or none at all) then this would be a great place for you.

Upon check-in I was told that the room class I had reserved, a regular king, was unavailable, but the desk clerk offered to upgrade me to an \"executive\" king at no additional cost. He told me the bed in the room was different in that it was \"low,\" which sounded OK. In reality the bed was a pull-down, Murphy-style bed, which seemed odd and not really accurately described. The bed was comfortable, though, and the room was HUGE--much larger than a typical studio apartment. It was a nice room, though somwhat soulless and boring.. One thing that displeased me was that the desk clerk \"upsold\" me into paying an extra $10/day \"service fee\" which he said included a couple of bottles of water per day, two all-day passes for the International Drive trolley, and high-speed wi-fi internet. I figured that was worth it for the wi-fi along, but actually, the internet would've been free even if I hadn't opted for the \"upgrade;\" housekeeping kept forgetting to leave me the bottles of water so I got them only one day of the three (when I spotted a maid in the hallway and asked for them); and the trolly passes are only worth $1.50 each--and for this I paid an extra $30 over the 3-day stay. This is an ENORMOUS hotel, with a property comparable in size to the large Las Vegas resorts. I didn't get to take advantage of the hotel amenities such as pool, because the weather was bad during my stay. I did eat at a couple of the restaurants, the \"B Line\" (which the desk clerk dismissively but accurately described as \"an upgraded Denny's sort of place,\" which was true because the food was completely forgettable) and Napa (which aims at a \"California Wine Country\" sort of menu but, to a Californian at least, misses that target pretty badly, though the prices are compable to or higher than what one would pay at most genuine upscale Napa Valley restaurants). There are some nice bars and lounges, though the prices are fairly absurd ($8 for a domestic beer, for example). The location is on a busy major thoroughfare with nothing nearby except the convention center, other large hotels, and some strip malls. Unless you have a car or feel like taking a taxi somewhere, you will feel relatively stranded there. Nothing of interest is within walking distance.

The convention center space was very nice, and I enjoyed speaking at the conference. Unfortunately, it was nearly impossible to sleep in this hotel. The first room I started in was extremely hot and stuffy. I called the front desk and they sent a maintenance person to the room. He took a needle nose plier to the air vents wiggling each one, telling me he needed to re-direct the air. He then replaced the air filter, which did seem to increase air flow, but did nothing to cool or de-humidify the air. A few hours later, around 10pm, I called down to the front desk and asked to be moved to another room. The front desk sent up a bellman with keys to a new room. We went to the new room, and he admitted that our choices were limited because the hotel was nearly full. He conceded that the new room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much cooler. I decided to gamble and make the switch. The new room was slightly cooler, but still unacceptable. I woke up the first night sweating. I was confused because during the night the room became much hotter than it was before I went to sleep. After a little internet research, at 2AM, I was able to determine this was because the thermostats are controlled by motion sensors. If there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough movement, the system shuts off. Fortunately, I was able to figure out the sensor override code. If you search the interne t using the name on the control panel you should be able to find it without much effort. This at least keeps the air on, but still didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t adequately cool the room. I called the front desk the next day to complain about the room temperature again, hoping that there was something that could be done. They sent another bellman up to the room, the front desk had claimed that he could help me out. When the bellman got to the room he said this was the second room he had been to that shift which was set to 65 degrees, but was obviously much higher (I would guess at least 75 with high humidity). He started hitting the fan speed button on the thermostat, and then left it at medium. He said, there, I set it to medium, so that should cool down the room quickly. I also asked him if he knew about the over ride code, but he claimed he had never heard of it. I figured I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to get anywhere with him, both because he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know about the over ride and because I had long ago figured out how to adjust the fan speed. I thanked him for his time. Throughout this ordeal, I was told numerous times that this was a green hotel, so they were required to have the motion sensing thermostats. I am sure that is true, but I would imagine you can be green and still get the temperature in the room to a comfortable level. There are a number of hotels in the area and I will be checking out of this hotel and going to one of them tonight. Even if you conference is being held at the Peabody, I would recommend staying at one of the nearby properties.", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Allentown, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cFirst Time Ritz!\u201d", "Author": "xsouthernbellx", "ReviewID": "UR95332992", "Content": "My boyfriend and I took a trip from Pennsylvania to Florida for the first time.

It took very little time to get the keys and go up to the room. The rooms were light and a good size, and well insulated from noise. The aircon was reasonably quiet. The TV was big, plenty of plug sockets. We stayed in the new tower overlooking the pool. There aren't really any sights to see from the hotel so the choice of room should only be dictated by how big a room you need. We ate breakfast in the B-line diner at the hotel every day. Wonderful service and friendly people. The portions are generous, although expect to pay more than you would outside a hotel. The room makeup times varied throughout our stay. It was nice to bump into the housekeeping ladies though, they were friendly, as were the people on the concierge desk which was well staffed. The pool was a good size, and despite record low temperatures people were still swimming in it! The hotel has free passes for the i-Ride trolley bus, which is a bonus with stops a short walk from the entrance. We used the trolley to get to and from the Outlet Malls, Sea World and Universal, although we also swapped to taxis for quicker trips. For British travellers I would recommend against ordering tea. It's not what you get back home (honey and lemon). There's no coffee/tea making facilities in the room either. The fridge in the room had complimentary water (ideal for a day at the theme park), and a special menu so that you could stock the fridge with food and drink.

There was plenty to do at the hotel, though the fitness center steam room and whirlpool were broken. \"Free\" trolly tickets (included in daily $15.98 fee) allowed us to travel to places along International Drive without having to move the car, (parked in the garage for another $12 daily fee/ $20 if you want to valet). We took the trolly to Cafe Tu-Tu Tango, a favorite, and to the Outlets. The completely remodeled 26th floor room in the \"old\" tower was lovely. Loved the bathroom and separate area for changing and luggage. You could use the fridge, but there is no coffeemaker or microwave in the room. Great TVs in bed and bath rooms. The downside, and this was an issue that may be just seasonal, was as the college bowl team hotel, the entire fan base stayed there. Never a free time to use the hot tub outside, the pool was so crowded that we had to sit on the edge of the pool deck with our feet in the water to \"relax\". Enjoying a relaxing afternoon by the pool on a warm New Year's Eve day was not an option. We ate at the B-line diner for breakfast which was decent but overpriced. They have spectacular desserts and I would highly recommend the chocolate mousse cake...heavenly. There we were able to get our $3 regular coffee. If there was free coffee, I am not sure where it was since there was nothing in our room about anything ...no in room directory aside from a magazine. The beautiful, trendy Rocks lounge had $20 sliders that were insanely good {did we really pay $20 for three sliders? oh yes we did} with great drinks. We chose to do Neew Year's Eve there and enjoyed the balloon drop and lounge band enough, though it was lacking some energy. As we were unwinding, I had to walk (in heels) down 26 flights of stairs as the fire alarm went off for a false alarm around 1 a.m.!

One thing I have not seen mentioned in the reviews I read was the great location on International Drive. Coming from San Diego, CA, I wasn't familiar with this area and only choose this hotel as it was the chosen \"team\" hotel for Michigan State University, who was playing in the Capital One Bowl. While I wasn't happy with my team's performance in the bowl game, I thoroughly enjoyed this hotel and my stay, even despite a 1:30 a.m. on NYE fire/fire alarm and evacuation. The hotel is situated right next to a lovely shopping area with many bars, restaurants and shops - I think it was called the Pointe. Great and easy to walk to and lots of options. Our room's view was lacking - but the furnishings more than made up for it. The bed was so comfy I didn't want to leave it. I traveled with an injured back and was a bit anxious regarding the bed - but it more than lived up to my hopes. The room (king bed) was actually pretty large, with a sitting area, lounge chair and ottoman and a separate desk and chair. The TV was probably 42 inches, flat screen and nice. I LOVED the digital TV in the bathroom mirror - I want one at home now! The bathroom was a bit \"tight\" on space, but fine for the two of us. No separate tub and shower, they were a combo. I liked the 'feed the fridge\" program versus the usual mini bar. You order what you want from a menu and they bring it right up. Prices were reasonable. I found the pool area, which was nice, was crowded and we had trouble finding a chair. That was disappointing. The roof top pool was closed for repairs (we weren't warned about this at booking or check-in, so I deducted on the rating). Also the valet parking was OK - I found the valets a bit difficult to deal with). We ate at Napa restaurant in the hotel on NYE and it was delicious! It is new, opened about 4 months ago. The service was excellent and the pricing reasonable. The bar/lounge above Napa (I forget the name) was nice, had a band. The hotel is large, but we found it easy to get around. We booked through a consolidator web site and got a TERRIFIC rate. I liked the free Wifi in the room and the morning paper (though why the New York Times?). There is a daily resort fee of about $15 - which I believe covers the wifi and 2 free bottles of water per day and the pool usage.

The hotel is HUGE (a large part of the hotel is a convention area, and there is even an over-the-highway walkway that leads to the Orange County Convention Center next door) and beautifully decorated with paintings/sculptures/artwork throughout (the colossal chandeliers are fabulous!). The new pool area is large, the heated pool (a \"no-entry\" pool) is gorgeous, with a big slide for the kids, and an oversized hot tub, with easy access (although unfortunately it was too COLD outside for us, we're Floridians, to swim); and, there are multiple restaurant/cafe/bar facilities throughout the hotel and pool area that serve anything from a quick snack to sandwiches to a full-course meal (our favorite, with the best price for the value, was the B-Line Diner). There is also a shopping/restaurant area within a block's walking distance (includes B.B.

In a nutshell - if you want a moderately-priced, classy, elegant, extremely comfortable hotel, with a professional staff that looks to provide you with all that you'll need during your stay, you can't beat the Peabody, and we HIGHLY recommend it! It's only drawback is that, because of its location on S.

The pastries and baked goods on display in the restaurant were fantastic looking and so good that you wanted to eat them all! Really the only negatives were the added costs that you will incur (resort fees and parking), which is not out of the oridnary for a hotel of its caliber, but perhaps out of the oridary for Orlando accomodations. So if you're coming here - just be aware that its generally a step above other hotels in the area - and be prepared to pay as such. Its also rather close to the Universal Studios - we took a cab ride there and it was only about $10 each way, which is another great positive. The resort fee also gets you on free to the I-drive trolley, so lots and lots of dining and shopping options are quickly available to guests.

We stayed in the new tower \"2\" which had only been open 3 weeks. When we arrived, our reservation paperwork said \" 1 king bed\" . Upon checking in, they only had two doubles available. What upscale hotel still offers two doubles? After 45 minues of arguing, we were given a room with two queens which was okay. When we entered the room, we noticed that it was dusty. My fiancee was able to write her name on the bathroom mirror in the dust. The remote control had stickcy stuff on it and was covered with dust. I went for ice and couldnt find the ice machine so I asked the room attendant. She told me that she had no idea where the ice machine was so I wandered the floor for a while until I found it. There were many other issues that should have not happened at a higher end hotel being a seasoned traveler. Hoping not to have to write a review, we met with Mr. Marshall Kelberman, the manager of rooms for the Peabody. He was very polite and assured us that he would make things right. He did take some money off of our bill. Unfortunately, immediately after that evening, when returning from several work events, we returned to our room and found that the room staff had forgotten to place the 4 glasses in our room for beverages; although they did take the dirty ones away. After calling, they did bring us glasses after some time. Upon check out, when leaving the parking garage, unfortunately our key card became demagnetised at the cross arms. We pushed the help button and no one answered. We pushed it again and again and nothing. After a while, we called the Peabody main desk and they sent a bus staff member to let us out. Why do they have help buttons in the parking structure if there is no monitoring? Overall, the hotel needs quite a bit of help. This was just a quick summary.

The hotel usually takes care of me beautifully, however, the last two trips have been borderline at best. This last trip was meant to be a nice weekend with my son and out of town family (they stayed at Disney while my son and I stayed safely far enough away at the Peabody). The room was a newly renovated room and still smelled of fresh paint. Perfectly appointed, except for the remote that worked when it sensed it was close to being launched across the room and the TV that would intermittently lose audio for 5 seconds at a time every 10 minutes. Coincidentally, right about the time the local weather was being broadcasted. Typically, the hotel leaves a kind note and chocolate covered strawberries in the room. Not that they are on my diet, but my teenage son rather enjoys them and the touch was a thoughtful gesture. By not having them in the room when we returned late from dinner and my turn down service request ignored, I see this as an indicator that the level of service is not quite being the same as in the past years. The valet was completely understaffed and even with a call ahead 10 to 15 minutes prior, they always seemd to take an additional 5 minutes to bring the car around. The final \"F\" on this experience has to do with their lack of total customer service. My son had left an important item accidentally in the room. When it was noticed (within 24 hours of our departure), I promptly called the hotel and was hung up on and transferred around until I finally was connected with someone in \"Lost and Found\". This gentleman assured me that the item would be returned, but would need a credit card to pay for the shipping. As if I hadn't paid enough all ready for \"services\", but not being one to quibble, I provided my credit card information and was told that it would be sent out by the business office, Fedex ground, that day. I live 3 hours from Orlando, it would have arrived to me in 2 days at the most if it was sent out within reason from the day I called into the hotel. Over a week later, and after going through the same rounds of calling in, being hung up on, and transferred I finally have a tracking number that shows it really takes over a week to ship something 3 hours south. I should have just gone back and picked it up myself. If you are used to or are looking for an exceptional experience, this hotel would no longer be my first choice.

Service and value, however, should have been stepped up in order to accommodate for these inconveniences, and it simply wasn't. Guests are certainly paying for convenience here--- the menu prices for drinks and food items were outrageously priced for the lack of atmosphere and just-so-so quality of food. We encountered several issues during our stay. First, although we were told to call down 15 minutes in advance of needing our car from valet, we could not do this because both of the phones in our room were broken. The two phone lines were all static, and we could place no calls, even to extensions within the hotel. We walked down to valet, requested our vehicle, then as we waited we decided to report the phone problem. We were assured that \"someone from engineering\" would enter our room while we were out and repair the phone. We were then told that if the phones were not fixed to simply dial 4-4-4-4 from our room, to which we asked, \"But if the phones have not been fixed, how can we dial this number?\" We were assured again that the phones would be replaced within the hour. We waited over 20 minutes for our car to be pulled around, then left the property for about an hour and a half. Upon our return, still no phones. When we reported the issue again in the morning to front desk upon checking out, we were told there was \"no record\" of our prior request on file. That was frustrating!! Our second and thirs issues happened on the morning of checkout. Although we had the \"Please Do Not Disturb\" sign on our door, and Check-Out is not until NOON, Housekeeping started banging on our door at 8 a.m. We were not only jarred awake from sleep, but were forced out of bed to answer the door and tell them that we were not checking out for four more hours. At this point I would have most certainly complained to the front desk about this disturbance, however since we had no phones, this was not a simple task! My husband and I attempted to fall back asleep, when less than a half-hour later, impossibly LOUD fire alarms started going off all over the property, but most directly into our ear drums from right above the bed. The loud speaker then announced that a series of drills would be performed (at 8:45 a.m. on a Friday morning?!?). The alarms continued intermittently for about 45 minutes, each time just as incredibly loud and shocking to the system. We checked out of the hotel exhausted and anxious from the many nuisances and disturbances which had taken place during our stay. Our final issue came about as we were driving home and realized we had left something in our room. We phoned the hotel and were transferred to Housekeeping. The contact there informed us that Housekeeping does not take inventory of Lost and Found until later in the evening, and that we would be called if our item was found. Because I received no phone call, the next day I called back. Housekeeping had no record of our item, so I was transferred to Lost & Found. Our item was never turned in by the staff, which most probably means that it was taken. We take responsibility for leaving this item in our room, but most 4-Star Hotels employ staff that may be trusted to turn in items that are left behind. This was very discouraging, and certainly says something about the lack of training and low quality of staff that are employed at The Peabody. A star in the midst of all the dust- the Bellhop ( I believe his name was Adolfo- cursing myself now for not writing it down!). He greeted us by name each time we would enter the hotel, was very knowledgeable, had pride in his work, and should be commended for his excellent work ethic and what he gives to his position and to the hotel. My suggestion for this hotel would be to look at other 4-Star Hotels such as the JW Marriott in order to study and learn from their systems and staff training.

I was also told the construction was only going on Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Upon our arrival and after a 7 hour flight, when we checked in, the front desk wanted us to sign for the $15.98 a day \"Service Fee\" for 3 rooms. The \"suite\" consisted of 2 rooms with a palor in the middle. The services were for items we weren't even going to use: Wireless Internet (we brought our own), local and long distance use of the telephone (we had our own cell phones to use), 2 bottles of Peabody water (we bought a 6 pack at Walgreens for $3.79), I-Ride tickets (we purchased 3 - 1 all day pass for $12.00 and we didn't even end up using them), use of the fitness center (we never used it), and shoe shining (we were wearing tennis shoes and didn't need shoe shining). We were told at check-in that this \"Service Fee\" was \"automatic\". After much complaining, they finally waived the \"Service Fee\". We awoke on Saturday morning to construction noise and on Sunday morning we were awaken to jackhammering and construction noise at 7:45 a.m. We complained at the front desk and were told they would change our room. I also mentioned that I was told the construction was only Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and the front desk told me that the construction was 7 days a week as they were trying to finish the hotel for the upcoming convention season. When we arrived back at the hotel later in the day, they had changed our room to one on a higher floor when we complained that we were still on the side of the hotel where the new tower was being built, we were told it didn't matter where in the hotel you were, you were going to get construction noise because they were now doing work in the main hotel. Our new room was just as bad as the previous room. Little did we know that there were some brand new rooms in the hotel but we didn't get any of them. We found out when our friends arrived to spend a few days and they had been given new updated rooms. Our rooms had old furniture that had nicks in them, old drapes and old dirty looking carpets. When we complained again, after spending a lot of money to stay at this hotel for 9 days, they refunded us 2 days for 1 of the rooms we booked. We also had to endure 2 power outages, 1 in the middle of the night and one beginning at 4:00 a.m. and going on and off until 11:00 a.m. The person I spoke with in Reservations should have been honest about the construction and the \"Service Fee' when I made my initial reservation or at least when I called to confirm my reservation. I was lied to and this hotel ruined our vacation! I can honestly say that I will NEVER stay at another Peabody hotel ever again and will never recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brit abroad", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel with exceptional staff\u201d", "Author": "littlemissleek", "ReviewID": "UR73388234", "Content": "My husband and I travelled to Florida for our honeymoon in July. We were welcomed by a wonderful check-in agent (Stephanie I think) and a new starter who were both welcoming and friendly. I had called in advance to check that we could leave luggage in the reception as I knew we would arrive before 3pm. However, upon our arrival at noon, our room was ready. We appreciated the I-ride vouchers although we didn't use them everyday. The hotel location was great for the restaurants and bars on International Drive and is a short walk to Pointe Orlando. Our room was a newly renovated one on the tenth floor. It was a good sized room with a really comfortable bed, good sized bathroom and a view of the pool. The location of the room meant that it was quite dark. The motion sensor lights saved me a couple of bruises walking around in the dark and my husband loved the TV in the bathroom mirror. Our room was cleaned to a very high standard every day and whenever we saw housekeeping in the corridors, they were always friendly and polite. The pool area was well maintained with plenty of space for everyone and the pool itself was lovely and warm and there were plenty of towels easily available. We used the concierge just once to ask for directions and again Candi was very friendly and as well as offering the directions we needed, she suggested different methods and prices for getting there. The only downside we experienced with the staff was one day when waiting for a taxi, we were not assisted by the doorman so proceeded to get into a waiting taxi without their help which was fine by us but made the taxi driver uncomfortable as it was not the way to do things. I cannot say that we were ignored by the doorman, I think there was a coach full of people arriving at the same time so they were busy. We followed the same steps when getting a taxi to the airport and were helped by both a doorman and a bellboy. We also ate at the Capriccio Grill on the first night. I made my reservation on the same day and the assistant who made the reservation was fabulous (I can't think of her name but she was happy and friendly even addressing me by name when we returned at 8.30 for dinner). Our server, Maryann was excellent - she talked us through the whole menu, giving her personal favourites and recommending some sides (including advising us to share!). Lastly, we had a problem when we left the hotel in that we discovered when we arrived in Washington that we had left some things behind at the hotel. I called lost and found who were very quick to offer assistance - our belongings had already been found and they were waiting for some instruction from us. We were only in Washington for a couple of days so waited until we were in New York to arrange the onward delivery to our hotel there. I called lost and found again and provided the details and was told delivery would be by the end of the week. Unfortunately, that did not happen. However, I contacted the Peabody again when we returned to Europe and Maryellen in reception and Glenda in lost and found were both very efficient and fast to solve the problem. Glenda in particular deserves praise from me here - she called me at work the next day to offer her apologies for any confusion and to confirm the despatch etc. My only disappointment is that we missed the duck march as we were simply not there at the right time. If we return to Orlando in the future, we would come back to The Peabody without hesitation.

We had flown from the West Coast to Orlando to attend the national Elks convention and arrived three days early, staying in a one-bedroom suite hotel near the Orlando airport. Did Disney and Kennedy Space Center for three days and packed up the rental car to move to The Peabody for the convention. Returned the rental car to Payless, hopped into a cab and arrived at The Peabody to find my bag was missing. Hubby thought I had it, he thought I had it......you know how that goes. Telephoned Noel, the Town Car driver, who happened to be returning to the airport area, and asked him if we'd left the bag in his car. \"No,\" he said, but he would be happy to stop by Payless and see if they had it. Called the suites hotel and Payless no fewer than four times each that day and, of course, no luck in finding it. Totally upset and depressed, I stopped by The Peabody concierge desk and they were very sympathethic, giving me the telephone number for the Orlando Police Department so that I might file a crime report. They also directed me to the nearest mall so that I could buy makeup and other essentials. I didn't have so much as a toothbrush! Our room at The Peabody was not a remodeled one but was clean, offered a very comfortable bed and met our needs, as we were rarely in it. The woman who cleaned our room each day was especially good, friendly and we tipped her well. The pool area is nice and large and offered a respite from the busy days of the convention. Staying a week, we were able to try out the restaurants within the hotel and within walking distance, as well as room service, which was always good and arrived within a half hour of our order.

The valet WRECKED MY CAR! We didn't notice the damage until we had already left the hotel. We immediately returned to the hotel. The person who told me they were the valet manager proceeded to blame me for the damage and deny it was their fault.

I have called Orlando \"home\" since 1986. While the military has allowed me to travel all over the world, and the ability of staying in some of the best hotels, I have always regarded the Peabody to be one of the best hotels in Orlando. After staying there the first weekend of April, I am highly unimpressed. What they do right: SERVICE, SERVICE, SERVICE! Everything from the great front desk service to Al the bellman, to Hercules the gentleman by the pool. In my opinion, these people were saving grace for the Peabody. I felt that they showed genuine concern for customer satisfaction, not that it was just a job. The only exception to this rule, and I think it's the standard with most of the hotels now in Orlando was the Valet. Whether it's the upscale, arts hotel, or the luxury, chain hotel downtown Orlando, or the Peabody, the Valet service seems very cattle rustler like. Get in, get out, no customer connection. I will say that they \"arts\" hotel probably does the best out of all that I have experienced in Orlando. The other thing that shines at this hotel, are amenities. Check out the HUGE pool or the fitness center. The equipment is a little dated, but still effective. Which leads to the bad... What could be done better: While there is ongoing construction for the new tower, the original hotel is VERY outdated and stale. When we first walked in the room, the first impression that we both had, was \"La Quinta\" until we noticed that the tv was still a glass tube vice a LCD/Plasma screen, but a lot of stations were included. The furniture and carpets are very worn and the standard rooms are very small. Self parking is about $12 and Valet about $20. I understand the prices, because of the Convention center right across the street, but I would imagine that hotel guests, should be able to get either validation or a reduction. We went with the valet, mainly for the reason that the self parking looked like it was at the other end of I-Drive the way some people looked walking. Now the AWFUL: We arrived around 4(our fault, running late). My childhood friend was getting married that evening at 530. I thought plenty of time to grab a quick shower and be there. Boy was I wrong. It took an hour and seventeen minutes to get a ready room. Which is shocking for a 4 star to have 1) such long room turnover and 2) for ANY hotel to be holding on rooms an hour after check in time. It was almost 530 by the time we got to our room. When we got there, there were clumps of hair still in the shower, and stains on the sheets on the bed. I went back down, and was given an immediate upgrade to another room, but by the time we got in that one, it was after 6. A full TWO HOURS after we checked in. UNSAT! Full disclosure: We could have immediately checked in if we wanted to be in a \"smoking\" room. Peabody, please tell your staff, to not suggest someone a SR with the caveat, \"that doesn't mean they HAVE smoked in it, just that they CAN.\" First a non-smoker will smell it and be affected by it, no matter how long ago it was, and two, if the floor is smoking, then it doesn't matter what the room is. that's why many hotels are now smokefree. While my situation may not have been typical, I feel the way that it was handled, was. Overall I would still recommend the Peabody, because there are more hits than misses, but when it misses, IT MISSES...in style. Those two hours really put a sever damper on our weekend. That had nothing to do with any individual person as much as it had to do with the organization of the hotel as a whole.

They now charge for parking which is $12+. You can park your car in the garage and WALK not be shuttled but WALK back to the main hotel. I could not believe it!! They are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on the expansion and didn't bother to add a shuttle to the budget. If you can take the walk and can find this hotel at a good price then I would say by all means stay here. It's nice, the beds are totally comfortable.

This was great because I could run back to the hotel for lunch since trade show food offerings are less than desirable, as well as dump things I'd picked up in the morning out of my bag to make more room for the afternoon. Also convenient was the beautiful, sunny, spacious lobby where I could meet up with friends & colleagues at day's end. I highly recommend the hummus as a snack while sipping. A fun bonus was getting to watch the famous Peabody ducks that are in the lobby fountain all day do their red carpet waddle as they returned via their own elevator to their penthouse pond suite. I dined in the restaurant Capriccio both nights of my stay. It was excellent and reasonable overall. I had breakfast in the B-Line Diner and found it to be good as well (I would, however skip the oatmeal). At the entrance to the B-Line diner there is a handy take-away counter where you can grab pre-made sandwiches, snacks & drinks. There is a good pool-side grille also. I hadn't stayed in this hotel for a few years and recalled the rooms being much nicer. Maybe it was my room (#767), maybe it was that I've stayed in some even nicer places since, but as nice as the rooms are, I felt mine was a little tired and likely in need of an update in the next year or so. The halls smelled a little old too. Here's what I liked about the room: The bed was comfy with a down comforter under the sheet for extra cushy feeling. I liked that they offer you the option to not have your linens changed every day and to reuse your towels if you wish in order to help save resources. NY Times outside the door each morning. Fairly well-stocked mini bar (just in case :-). Despite the fact that there was a dry cleaning box & chlid's ball under the TV cabinet when I checked in, the room was clean. Here's what I didn't care for so much: No magnifying mirror in the bathroom. You have to expect some noise from other rooms, but the plumbing from the other rooms was excessively loud. There was a TV on the bathroom counter taking up precious space. (I realize some may find this a plus; I'd rather have a magnifying mirror). I had received a good rate through the convention I was attending and was told that a variety of services would not be available to me with this rate unless I wanted to pay for them - I don't recall what all they were because I didn't really care about any of them, but I recall Internet Access, International Drive shuttle, gym access, morning lobby coffee being on the list with a few others. Nobody stopped me from getting a cup of coffee in the lobby :-) which was good since there is no coffee making equipment in the room. I was also charged $20+ tax per night to valet my car which I felt was a little excessive. I could have self-parked, but it was quite a hike, it was very hot, so I gave in and valeted. Service throughout the hotel staff was excellent. I discovered rather late in the evening on the first night that my TV remote did not work. It was late and I didn't want to deal with calling down to get it fixed, so I called the front desk and reported it the following morning. When I returned to the hotel later that day it was fixed and there was a message on my room phone telling me it had been done. I would stay here again if I had a convention to attend or a special event at the Peabody itself.

The carpet has stains and it is fraying against the wall. The room is in need of renovation because the wear and tear is not acceptable for what this hotel normally charges a night and defiantly not for its stature. The bathroom has a nice granite countertop with a t.v. The bathroom was clean but, I found several stray hairs. The tile around the bathtub is also starting to grow mold. The bed is very comfortable with lots of pillows. I received a rate of $87 on hotwire. Honestly the hotel is worth $87 but, not more. The hotel charges an extra $15 a night for a hotel service fee. All that is included in this fee is 800 calls, internet access, shoe shine, coffee in the lobby in the morning, two bottles of water, trolley tickets, and access to their fitness center. The average person will never use any of the above except for the bottled water. Their website states that the room was supposed to have a refrigerator and microwave in it which it does have a refrigerator however; it is only for its mini bar. Their website doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mention this but, to have a refrigerator and microwave for you to use it is an extra $15 a night a piece. Then you have to either pay $20 for valet parking or $12 to pay in a parking garage. After taxes along with the parking and hotel fees it is almost $150 a night. If you need a refrigerator and microwave it will be almost $200 a night. Most hotels in Orlando offer all the above for free with lower rates and also have very nice rooms. Orlando has a very large selection of excellent hotels so there is no need to settle on this one considering what they charge.

Everyone greeted us with a smile and each person was quick to offer their help. Each time I exited or entered the building, in fact, the valet people and bell hops were friendly and helpful. I was very impressed with them. I was also pleased with the services offered by the concierge. We needed their help on several occasions to get directions to attractions and advice on different modes of transportation. They were always friendly and helpful. The rooms at the Peabody are beautiful and well-appointed. The bed was the best hotel bed I can ever recall sleeping in. The room was spacious enough for the three of us ladies to get ready in the morning without crowding each other. Of course, we loved the LCD tv in the bathroom, too! We ate at the B-Line Diner twice for lunch during our stay. I highly recommend the chicken caeser salad and chicken noodle soup. Both were absolutely delicious! Everyone at my table enjoyed their food on both occasions. The service was not as good in the diner as it was in the rest of the hotel, though. But it didn't stop us from returning. My biggest complaint about my stay at the Peabody is the parking situation. I understand that they are undergoing major renovations, but that is not the fault of the traveler. I believe much better accommodations should be made for people who bring cars. Currently, you have two options. A) Allow valet to park your car and pay $20 per day or B) Park your car at an off-site parking garage and ride a shuttle bus back to the hotel for $12 per day. It seems very unreasonable to me to charge such a high amount when the hotel is inconveniencing its customers. I was not happy about this at all. However, the valet people and shuttle bus drivers were always very helpful and friendly and we never tipped. In fact, the first day I was there the bell hop told me that they do not work for tips...I'm not sure if he was being honest or just trying be nice, but I believed him! It took about 20 minutes for us to get the car back from the valet and about 15 minutes to get to the parking garage and back on the shuttle. We never had to wait for a shuttle. We did see construction going on, but never heard it. We were not disturbed by the construction other than having to deal with the frustrating parking situation.

I usually hate large hotels, but I loved this one. It was charming and classy. In fact, it made me think about movie stars who live in hotels--this would be a good candidate for a prolonged sojourn. I was able to see the duck parade on three occasions, and it was great fun. The staff were amazing--very rarely do you encounter such consistently high quality people and service. The food was exceptional at their bristo style restaurant, as was the service. It was also fun watching the chefs--I ate there three times. The diner breakfasts were delicious--they actually know how to poach an egg which is a good indicator of the quality of the chefs. The room was nice, lots of space and well organized. The bed was extremely comfortable. I liked the fact you could put a card on the bed to save them changing the linens daily. The recreation level with the pool was fun, and I had lunch out there one day. The bar around the fountain allowed for interesting people watching and meeting colleagues in a pleasant environment. So, all in all, I can't find anything negative to say about this place, and given how much I travel, that is in itself quite amazing. Regarding the additional charge, I declined it because I didn't have a car or a computer with me (I used the business center instead). I used the two bottles of water daily and was not charged. I did not think the hotel rates were bad (although the local taxes are) compared to Europe for example where you would get much less for much more. So I guess it all depends on your perspective. I went over to Winter Park one day to the Morse Museum which was a real treat and walked around that neighbourhood.

The room is a standard issue hotel room with no upgrades a 5-star would merit. The furniture, tv and armoire are average late 90s and the bathtub needs an overhaul - and that small tv in the bathroom BEHIND the toilet?? For business travel, I expected at least a small fridge and en-suite coffee maker, but neither was available. I asked that the mini-bar be emptied and they would not do that so an additional fee for a small fridge had to be paid (families should keep that in mind if you need to keep food or beverages chilled for children). I asked that a small coffee maker be brought to my room and they would not do that for 'hygienic' purposes. The DAILY additional fee of $15.00 covered my .50 newspaper, $2.00 worth of water, i-train passes (which cost $1.25 per ride) and very weak coffee that I had to trek to the lobby to get for myself. The gym is off-limits unless you pay AN ADDITIONAL $10.00 DAILY and the fridge will be delivered to your room for another DAILY charge of $10 or $15. So add about $50.00 per night to the already high per night fee to get the basics that are already offered in other hotels as part of the per night cost. The hotel staff I dealt with was nice enough and professional, and the lobby and pool areas were certainly clean enough. The location is convenient to the strip given it is not smack in the middle but only a walk away and still quiet enough. And a short drive or bus-ride away from the major attractions. So it is obvious that my main gripe are the additional fees that are not necessary when the basic room tarif is high to begin with at an establishment that is not yet upgraded but cites itself an almost 5-star. There would be no reason for me to stay here again given there are other much more reasonably priced places in the same area that offer more to their clientele.", "Date": "January 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida, USA", "Title": "\u201cNot quite what I was expecting\u201d", "Author": "hkleinberg", "ReviewID": "UR22154336", "Content": "When we booked two nights at the Peabody we were expecting a romantic stay at a top quality hotel. Perhaps my expectations were too high... First, the primary complaint - the daily fee. The fee is supposed to cover internet access (Hello! This is the 21st century and even low budget hotels now offer free Wi-Fi!) and valet parking which is an unfortunate neccesity. At first it may seem posh to have to use valet services, but it quickly grows old as you have to plan your every move in advance because you really need to call for your car before you wait 10 minutes to receive it. Construction was being done on the hotel so self-parking is not really an option unless you want a LONG walk, and also note that their 24 hour diner is closed for renovations too. This hotel really seems geared more toward a business traveler who just has the company pick up the tab for all the little extra expenses, but as a vacationer, it would not be my first pick again. Don't even get me started on the Business Center and how much they wanted to charge for printing. Total rip off. To boot, we thought we were getting a really nice room for what we spent, but ther only thing that distinguished the place at all from a clean room at the La Quinta was that they had a TV behind the toilet. It would be a nice amenity if the tub was big and nice enough for a bath, but unless you are a man, it's hard to really see it - if you get what I mean. We also ordered a Pizza from room service late at night. It had just passed the time for the regular kitchen to make it, so we ended up with their different late night Pizza options. To be honest, I've had better pizzas from the freezer section at the grocer, and for the price and time it took for it all, I wouldn't do it again - not that I'll return to the hotel. To be fair, the room itself was very clean and had some cute duck details like the doorstop and duck shaped guest soap. The bed was large and comfy. You could tell it was a higher quality accomodation, it's just that my expectations were for much more considering the price. The staff - especially the valets - were always more than friendly, and it was fun to watch the ducks swim in the fountain in the lobby.

The lobby and other public spaces (including the pool) are very nicely appointed and spacious and are quite popular. There's the daily duck march (referenced by other reviewers) which I though was a little weird bu other guests liked it. The fitness center is musty and small - needs an overhaul.

This covers 2 bottles of water per day in the room, towels at the pool, and Wi-Fi. The charge is not that bad, but the Wi-Fi did not work the last couple days and calls to tech support were politely handled, but the sense of urgency in resolving the connection issue encountered was less than adequate. While not expecting 1 hour turnaround, it is not unreasonable to hear something in 3 - 5 hours. Waited almost 15 hours to hear the matter was \"resolved\". When login was attempted, the problem with access still existed. The restaurants are OK in the hotel, but are expensive. The gift shop is small and stocked at a fair level. Best bet is to go north on International Blvd and pick up what you need plus there is a nice assortment of restaurants for all budgets. Note: the hotel is under construction. The building stayed in is not affected - yet, but the immediate surrounding areas were being prepped with sewer and water lines during our stay and could be heard throughout the day. They are in the process of constructing a massive new tower scheduled for completion in the Fall of 2010. A model of the expansion is on the Recreation Level outside the Tennis Pro Shop. With the construction, their parking is gone. If you drive there or rent a car like we did, one will need to drop off their passengers and then drive about 3 blocks away to the deck in the Pointe Orlando Mall and then get shuttled back via bus. If one wishes to go to one of the many attractions in Orlando, the driver will need to reverse the process. You get the privilege of paying $6/dayfor this incovenience. You do receive a card that allows you unlimited in and out of the garage during your stay. The signage is decent to get you to where you need to go to pick up a shuttle bus. If there is any consolation, this \"fun\" is spread to all The Peabody Orlando employees as well as their guests that choose to self park. Needless to say, this process gets old fast. Valet parking is available, if you wish to pay for it and there are plenty of taxis as well. Fun note: the ducks attract sizeable crowds at 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. It's pretty interesting to watch the 4 ducks (1 drake and 4 hens) make their way from the fountain in the lobby bar to their \"palace\" on the Recreation Level. If you have young ones (5 - 10 years), you can have them act as an \"honorary duckmaster\" for one of the ceremonies. My son (9 yrs old) got to do it and pretty much \"ran the show\" (the ducks are so conditioned to the routine there is very little for the honorary duckmaster to do).

The only available king was the murphy bed- and while I was hesitant, i decided to go for it anyway- and it was great. A little low to the floor- but super comfy! The beds are great. The room was a decent size and had nice waffle bathrobes, and more importantly the a.c. worked really well. My only real complaint about the room was the hairdryer was one of those small travel sized ones attached the wall- and at a 4 plus star hotel, I expect a full sized one. As for parking- I did taxis all the way and did not drive- which worked out well for me. My coworkers were staying at a house and came over for dinner a few times, 1st time valet took about 10 minutes (pretty standard) and second time they faced some issues- and in return asked that my room service breakfast would be comped the next day- which wprked for me.

I went to the pool for a brief 2 hours before I had to be anywhere on day 1, and it was a zoo- a lot of young teenage kids running around, pushing each other in the pool and yelling. On my last day, I had another 2 spare hours and discovered the \"kids pool\" Now this was a real treat. It was like a full sized swimming pool with a waterfall- and 1 foot deep tjhroughout- gated off- and I was the only one there!

Let me explain. After a nice day at Epcot, my husband and I checked into the Peabody around 8PM. Pulling up to the hotel, I felt like I was at a busy airport, dropping someone off. It was loud and noisy and chaotic. A man approached our car and told us to give him the key...that it was mandatory valet. Great, I always valet anyways, so we handed the key and waited for him to give us our valet ticket. He didn't. Instead, he ran off with our key and yelled to us about finding him after we check in. Very strange and unprofessional. My husband and I were worried someone would steal the car, so he stayed by it until I checked us in. When we went up to the valet stand, they told us they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have our key and blew us off. It was awful. I was in tears over the messy situation. About an hour later, someone finally was able to locate our key and parked our car...for $18 dollars. That really should have been waived for our ordeal. We went inside, un-packed and changed clothes to go out to a nice dinner. We had reservations at Vito\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favorite. We asked the concierge to call us a cab, he was very rude and told us that there were too many cars out front (it was a valet disaster) and we could either walk to dinner or walk down the street to hail a cab ourselves. He also said that it was getting late and the only place probably open was Denny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.

My husband and I booked for priceline and got a good deal for a 4* hotel in the Orlando area. When we arrived, we were confused by the mayhem of the valet parking, as I had read ahead of time that self-parking was an option. Apparently there was construction going on, so 100% of the cars had to be valet'd for 18/day plus tax. This wasn't the end of the world, but we hate to waste money on something as simple as walking to your car. We arrived at 3:15 (checkin is at 3) and were told that there would be a slight delay and they would call our cell phone when the room was ready. No problem, we'll check the property out. The hotel was kind of a zoo because there was a big modeling \"workshop/casting\" going on and kids were all over the place. It wasn't what we had in mind, but at the end of the day, it was great people watching. We waited in the lobby area and had a few drinks, watched the ducks march, etc. Around 6pm (3 hours after check-in time), we got the call that our room was ready. Room was nice and pretty much like the pictures posted on this site. THEN, we went down about 6:25 to get our car from valet. We had previously made reservations at 7pm at a place that was literally 5minutes drive away. After waiting 1/2 hour and no sign of our car, I rescheduled our reservations for 7:30. We didn't make it until 7:45! It took about an hour to get our car, which was apparently good compared to the 2-3 hour waits described in another review. Next day, we reserved a cabana at the pool for $75/day. Good deal for shade/chairs/towels/beverages, but the wireless wasn't working and our tv didn't go to ESPN which was a disappointment for my husband. All in all, that was a great deal for a cabana. By the way, we left our sunglasses in the car the day before, so decided to buy new ones at the gift shop rather than deal with the chaos of valet...we kind of felt trapped! All in all, it was a good stay. If we had paid full price, we would have been much more irritated with valet.

I can honestly say this is one of the WORST hotel stays I have ever had, The once fantastic Peabody Orlando has gone to hell. Its a shame really - because in its day it used to be one of the best. 2008 is a different story for the Peabody. The 20 something year old hotel is showing its age. The rooms are dated, my faucet leaked, the carpet was frayed and torn, the wallpaper in the bathroom was stained , the grout in the tub is dark and moldy. The place needs some major remodeling and attention to bring it back to the standards they claim. Upon check in I was checked in to room 2147. Within 1 minute of entering the room. I went to use the bathroom. When I raised the lid. There was dried urine and fecal matter all over the seat. Looked like it had been there for over a day. It was disgusting. When I called downstairs to complain. The front desk manager was very arrogant about it and did not handle the situation with any class. She was so bold as to suggest that maybe I had done it. I was appalled !!! They finally changed me over to 2145 (next door and same housekeeper). They made me wait over 20 min for the new keys. It was not a pleasant experience. I went to use there spa facility. It is dated, tired, rundown, dirty, and also in need of attention. The shared Jacuzzi looks like it was installed in 1980 and has been painted so many times there are 2 inches in layers of paint. The tiles are cracked, moldy. stained, and in now way does this resemble the spa facility of a 4 star hotel. Furthermore about 30 min before closing. The employee on duty went inside the shower area, undressed, and showered in the guest area. This looks terrible and should not be allowed. I had lunch at the dinner. While the food I have to say was excellent. The facility is crying for help. It looks like a retro space age dinner that got stuck in 1983 in a time capsule and was never let out. The place is greasy. dirty. outdated, the blinds next to the window where my booth was where dusty and greasy. It needs to be torn down and redone. Even the menu I was handed was old, battered, and greasy to the touch ! But the worst part of the stay. Is the Valet service. The hotel is building a new tower right next door. (This is probably why they are investing \"0\" dollars into making the current tower nice for guests) The parking garage is torn down and gone. The only option for parking during the construction is valet. The charge is one of the highest in all of Orlando. Furthermore the wait times are INCREDIBLE. On the evening of May 24th. I waited 2 Hours and 28 Minutes for my car to come around. I missed my dinner show and lost the non refundable tickets. I was not the only person in this situation, It was so out of control. That guests called in the Orange County Police Dept for help. Out of desperation that the hotel was not bringing them there car. Hotel management handled the situation in a horrible manner. They ruined many peoples evenings and vacation. They showed a complete lack of respect for guests and in my thousands of nights in hotel room stays. Can tell you I have never seen this situation in a hotel ever. There where hundreds of people stranded without there vehicles because the Peabody Orlando refused to bring them there cars. I am a diabetic patient. I explained them that if they could not bring my vehicle. Could I at least walk to it, or have someone go to it to get my medication. The staff and management at the Peabody Orlando REFUSED to honor my request and made me wait 2 hours and 28 minutes to gain access to my vehicle and medication. The next morning. I waited again over 45 min for my vehicle to be delivered to me. The car was delivered full of mud and grime all over the carpets and exterior of the car. The vehicles are parked in a mud swamp. The hotel provides no mats or any safeguard to keep the cars clean. I will now have to pay to get my car detailed when I leave here and shampoo the carpets. I can see the swamp where the cars are from my window and its very muddy and dirty. After endless complaining. All I got was a valet refund and false promises that this would never happen again. That for the rest of my stay the car would remain on the ramp for my convenience. The truth is that never happened and the hotel, its staff, and management not once EVER kept any of there false promises to me. Furthermore I never received an \"Im sorry\" or \"I apologize\" from anyone here. Except one of the mangers \"Ms. Tara Tate\" whom I have to say was very polite and professional. But in the spirit of the Peabody Orlando, was full of lies and false promises. The actions of this hotel are shamefull. In some cases Ilegal (denying a guest with a chronic disease access to his medication for over 2 hours), and a disgrace to the Orlando hospitality industry. All I can do is hope that other guests will read this and re consider ever staying at this hotel. Specially if you plan to use your car. Id wait till after 2010 when the new tower is supposed to be ready. Maybe then they will care about there guests and the service. But for now.

There were in the neighborhood of 100 people standing outside trying to get their cars from valet parking. The first employee we saw told us to get in the line to the valet window. Once there, we were told to go to the \"little black girl taking the list of valet parking ticket numbers.\" The guy behind us told us he'd already been there over an hour. The employee behind the glass, looking completely exhausted apologized and told us that 'they'd been taken off guard by the rain last night and were having to wash down every car before bringing it around and that they were going as fast as they could.\" I asked simply to give me my keys and that I'd walk around to the car myself. That request was refused, saying that they couldn't do so as they needed to make sure every ones car got out safely.

Let me start by saying that we had a GREAT rate for the room - via Bookit.com. At 99 dollars a night I really shouldn't be complaining, however.... The room was made up very late each day. We had to ask for our bottles of water each day - there is a mandatory 10 dollar per adult guest service fee which includes several things, including two bottles of water per day (and internet among other things). Not an awful thing, but it was kind of annoying to feel petty by having to call and ask for them - not once, but every day. The worst was the parking. I wasunder the impression there would be free self parking - mostly from comments on this site about the fact that the spaces where narrow. Well, I would have been happy with narrow spaces. Instead, there was no self parking and I was faced with an 18 dollar a day valet charge, plus tips each and every time I came and went from the hotel. Which would be tolerable, except that it was simply AWFUL. We had to wait at least 30 minutes on several occassions to get our car. And when we would call ahead from the room to have the car pulled around we were told that it was too busy so we would have to come down in person (if it wasn't so busy I wouldn't have minded coming down in person - that was exactly the point). I understand they couldn't have cars just sitting there, but even after I assured her I would be down in a few minutes, knowing they were backed up by about 20 - 30, they refused to do it. Additionally, every day I was told it would get better, that it was a new process, that the hotel was unusually full, etc. yet there was only one day when I did not have to wait a ridiculous amount of time. I have two small children and it was very disruptive to have to have these waits, but to have to pay so much for it on top of the terrible service was just insulting. Other than apologies, I only received one day's 18 dollar refund upon checkout. Also, the pool was closed for 3 out of 5 of my days there. i don't know if it was scheduled maintenance or not, but a big part of our plans included just relaxing by the pool. They did have an arrangement with a nearby hotel to use their pool, but you know it's just not the same as being able to run up to your room each time. Particularly as I have two small children who wouldn't have wanted to walk to the other hotel, and so the thought of having to get the car to drive there (see above) wasn't appealing. We ended up spending time near the kids pool - which was OK, but not the same. So I hate to complain, but it really bugged me that we had to pay for such a horrible service. I mentioned it to the checkout staff when I received my bill (and parking cost me about another night's worth of stay) and they refunded me one of the days of parking. Not a huge effort in my opinion. But if you are considering the hotel, and are picky about cleanliness and like a business-like feel, this is a great place. Also - the duck march was very cute. My kids were honorary duckmasters for one of the marches and Duckmaster Dave was just amazing with them and it was a great experience for all of us.", "Date": "March 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "long island", "Title": "\u201cLove For The Peabody\u201d", "Author": "ajsworld", "ReviewID": "UR14612757", "Content": "My family and I stayed seven nights.

It was more than just a diner, there was definitely a chef back there as well as a first rate pastry chef. The pool was a highlight. It was nearly Olympic sized and was heated! There was a huge spa that was heated very nicely at around 103 degrees. Perfect! We also loved the complementary robes. The only downside to me was that we had to pay $18.00/ night for valet.

We obtained the hotel on Priceline for the bargain rate of $85. We arrived at the hotel about 10:00 a.m. and our room understandably was not ready. We checked in and went to the outdoor mall next door. About 1:00 p.m., our room was ready and it was excellent. Duck soap, duck coffee stirrers, duck shampoo, and the most comfortable bed. We watched the daily duck march where the ducks are led into the fountain for food at 11:00 a.m. daily. My only complaint is the $10 service fee for water and internet. It should be included in the room. Okay, now for some Orlando travel duck tips: 1. You will get bombarded by toll booths on the way from the airport to the hotel. Have your change and dollar bills ready. 2. Who here likes a good deli? Too Jays on Dr. Phillips Blvd is the place to be with reasonable prices - packed with locals. Ask the hotel for directions - also a great breakfast away from the tourist traps - but just minutes away. I got a free mini black and white cookie at the end of the meal while my wife was using the facilities. 3. The outdoor mall next door charges $2/hr to park and is not that great at all. Take a quick drive to the outlets for some fantastic shopping and bargains. I bought a new pair of sunglasses as my wife made me throw out the $6 pair I bought at Rite Aid. Concerge will give you good directions to this shopping mecca. 4. The pool area is fantastic - enjoy a nice swim in the morning before it gets too crowded. Watch your little ducks as it gets deep in some parts. 5. No need to leave the hotel for a nice cocktail in the evening. Both the lobby bar and Mallards inside of the hotel are a great place to have a drink. 6. Parking is free which is a nice touch - I would highly recommend renting a car in Orlando. 7. Gift shop had some amazing deals 50% off some clothing. Stop in for a set of duck cookie cutters or a stuffed duck. 8. Restaurants inside the hotel appear expensive. I did check the menus and I am pleased to report there is no duck dishes. Okay, that is all the travel duck tips for now. Enjoy your stay!

When checking in I was slightly unimpressed with the lady behind the counter, she seemed like she really didn't want to be there and didn't really impress us as a super customer oriented person. That was okay, she wasn't offensive but just not what we expected based on some of the other reviews here. We got to our room, the room was clean and neat, the view was fantastic. We did notice that we did not get a mini-bar key so we went to the front desk and encountered the same lady that checked us in. She wasn't any friendlier but did appologize for not giving us the mini-bar key. When we got back up to the room, we then realized that we never got the card for our dash board but decided to wait and get that before we left. Other than that minor incident, we had a terrific stay. On the second day we rented a cabana at the pool. It was very nice; it gave us shade when we needed some and the sunshine otherwise. The pool was clean and spacious, the landscaping was nice. The attendant at the pool was marvelous. I did read many comments about the $10 service fee so I was prepared for that. There were no surprises. I got exactly the relaxing weekend away I was looking for. I didn't have a chance to eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel, we ventured along I-Drive and enjoyed some of the many restaurants there.

I stayed at the Peabody from July 29 - August 2nd. First of all this was my first trip so I did not know what to expect. The check in was easy, and we proceeded to our room. The first problem we encountered was that we were not given the King Bed we had requested. We didn't complain and went right out to a theme park. Upon returning we encountered what seemed to be 400- 500 teenagers in the hallways, on the elevators and basically overunning everthing. I was tired and only had 2 hours sleep because of an early flight. I looked down to the pool. We counted 218 teenagers in the pool and over 50 teenagers, unsupervised, in the hottub sitting on each other(because there was no room) and acting crazy. I was 20 floors up and could hear the screaming and yelling for over an hour and could not sleep. I went to the pool and asked the one parent I saw what she thought about the 50 + boys and girls sitting on each other in a hot tub on a religious trip. Teens were ,seriously, riding up and down the elevator and calling it a party elevator as we tried to get on the elevator. I was unbelievably upset and it was ruining my trip and my stay. The teens and some parents would just continously shove you out of the way and you could wait 1/2 and hour to get on an elevator packed- end to end- with dripping wet screaming teens- coming from the pool. I showed the manager what was going on around midnight. We were upgraded to another room as the people in the last review said. The other room was awesome. I was very impressed with this room, but I can only imagine what it would cost, had not thousands of teens kept me up all night and taken the room had had been promised(I had even paid to upgrade to a king bed. The accomadations for the second room were second to none, but my original room was basic and not what I asked for. The Superior Room is no different from the Delux except for a little T.V. set and the fact you are moved a few floors higher. On a positive note, room sevice was good, we had a blow dryer and iron and ironing board. If you stay in the fron part of the hotel you can see both the disney fireworks and the Seaworld Fireworks simultaneosly at 10 p.m. There is also a 10$ daily charge that they will bill you for at the end of your stay for water and an I trolley pass. The internet is 10 $ more a day. It is close to Seaworld, Universal and Discovery Cove. Discovery Cove is awesome, but you can skip Seaworld and Island of Adventure. Universal is cool too- but you MUST have the express pass. The marching of the ducks is cute and be sure to take a duck soap for a souvenier. Again, I would definatey call ahead and ask what conventions are here because they will ruin your stay. The last day the teens had gone and we enjoyed a pianist and the marcing ducks.

The hotel is beautifully decorated, with ample and comfortable common areas and lovely rooms. The pool was large and had plenty of loungers.

My kids were invited, however, to be duckmasters and lead the duck parade one day. Duck Master Dave was terrific and so kind to us. It was the highlight of the trip. My only complaint with this hotel is that there are no coffee makers in the rooms. You have to clean up to go downstairs and wait in a very long line to buy your $3 cup of coffee.

So I ventured away from SPG and gave the Peabody a try. I was quite happy I did! Check-in was fast and easy, which was pretty fortunate given we'd pulled up just as droves of conventioneers were doing the same. The Peabody's website has a rather odd (to me, at least) room reservation process - rather than check certain selections and such, you just write to them telling them what you want and trust they'll make it happen) and so I was a bit concerned I'd not get the kind of room I wanted or would but I could actually tell they paid close attention to all that and got us exactly what we wanted. We asked for a suite, which we got. And we asked for a smoking room - which they didn't have, but they did give us one of the few rooms with a balcony and so that was taken care of! The furniture was all in good shape and the rooms were decorated nicely. The bathroom itself was rather small, but there was a large vanity with dual sinks right outside the bathroom so that more than made up for it. Plenty of closet space, and there was also a wetbar, minibar, sitting area, dining table. There are quite a bit of dining options on property, and all of the ones we tried out were pretty good - including room service. We did get up early (hey, 10am is early for some of us! hehe) to see the Duck March. It lasts all of a few seconds but was pretty cute - who doesn't love ducks? Certainly, Orlando is a very family-oriented town and a lot of the hotels in and around the city cater to large familes for extended stays.

I live in Orlando, but love to 'get away' every once in awhile to a nice hotel. The Peabody is a very formal looking hotel - lots of marble and polished brass, etc. One would expect great service (which I've always received), but what is somewhat surprising is the genuine niceness of the staff. Every request I've had has been met. Parking is free, unless you valet. You might expect a bit of a walk, especially if there is a big event going on in the convention hall. I usually drop my bags off at the valet and then self park. (if I have a companion to watch my bage, of course). There are several places to eat if you looking to just stay at the hotel. The B-line diner has good food, albet expensive for what it is. The kids meals are a good price, though. (Yes, 'expensive' is so subjective... so I guess it depends on your budget.) There are more than enough places to eat on International Drive - you can get a good recommendation from the concierge, or just hop in your car and explore. If you don't have a car, then you can take the I-drive trolley. But... I digress.... The pool is so nice - very large and well maintained. The hot tub is also large - very nice! There are lots of shaded chairs if you don't want to sun. The poolside service is my favorite indulgence. The burgers are really good (I don't usually eat burgers, but for some reason they taste better poolside)... and the drinks are tasty. I usually stay in the most economical (cheapest!) room available. The beds are so comfy, and and the bathrooms are clean and very elegant. The view can be nice (if you are up high, facing sea world or disney you can expect a fireworks show every night), or kind of plain (a low level room above the pool). I like the lobby - a grand piano is surrounded by small cocktail tables. You can sit and relax or order snacks/drinks while someone plays the piano.

At the Peabody Orlando, you cannot get into the health club with your room key and the club does not open till 6 AM. It costs $10/day (or $25/week) which is not surprising for a hotel in this class. However, the hotel should allow guests to access the health club 24 hours with a room key like every other hotel I have stayed at does.", "Date": "May 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york city", "Title": "\u201cWell Run Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ivanciment", "ReviewID": "UR7633082", "Content": "Well-run hotel; food was decent and service was uniformly friendly.

Breakfast is not complementary. In fact, I spent around $20 for an omelette, hash browns, milk, and juice at their restaurant. That's just rediculous. They charge a fee for a \"health club membership\" of $7/day instead of having a complementary gym. In fact, just about everything at this hotel costs extra that is included at hotels costing 1/2 to 1/3 as much. The room was no different from those hotels, either. I would expect a whirlpool, suite, and kitchenette for this price. I kept shaking my head trying to figure out what makes it a 4 star hotel. I even asked the management, and their answer was that they have all these facilities available on site (but for and additional fee). Even the duck parade was a major let down. How lame!

The Peabody is listed as a 4 star hotel and I would say that is about right. The location of the hotel is excellent if you are going to Universal or Seaworld. It is on the quite end of I drive directly across the Orlando Convention Center. I wanted to be on this side of Orlando instead of staying at near Disney. I feel there are better restaurants and shops in this area compared to Lake Buena Vista. Check In- Check was easy. Pulled up and had the bellman take our bags. Nice feature of the hotel is free self parking. Most resorts in this area charge for self parking which is just an extra change and a waste of money if you ask me. Self parking is right next to the hotel and they have another \u00e2\u20ac\u0153main\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd entrance near all the self parking area. The hotel check in line was about 10 people long but moved quickly. Lots of families checking in with kids. Which kind of surprised me for this type of hotel. Because of all the people in line the hotel staff added extra people to speed up the process. I asked for an upgrade on the room as it was a special weekend for us. The clerk said she did have a nice room on the 17th floor facing Disney so we could see the fireworks at night. Hotel Lobby & Elevators- The hotel lobby is kind of chopped up. It is not a grand entrance like some of the reports type hotels in this area. But more sectioned off in different areas. The bellman grabbed our bag cart and we headed up to the room. The ducks were just making their match out from the center pond so the center area was packed with people. How can you tell when you are staying in nice hotel, the speed of the elevators! The elevators at the Peabody FLY. Our room was on the 17th floor and they moved us up there in seconds. We never had to wait for more then a couple of seconds for elevators the whole time we were there. Nice! Room- Our room was 1760 which was facing Disney and the Orlando Convention Center. Below us was the pool. The room it self was shaped weird. It was not your standard square box but more of a U shape. The entrance of the room had the bathroom on the right side and the king bed on the other side of the U. Windows went all across the facing the pool. Lots of natural light! At first I did not like the shape of the room but after a while it was great to open your door and not see your bed. Bathroom was very nice and even had a little TV in there. Bed was great. One of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on. TV was standard TV not a flat screen. Everything worked great and was in good condition. $10 a day report fee. Yes, they charge it. You get 2 bottles of water with it, free I drive trolly tickets. We takes cabs so did not use the I drive trolly. The water was nice to have each day but I would rather not be charged the $10.00. But what are you going to do. They do give you free shoe shine service! Which I did take advantage of. Overall Comments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Hotel staff was very nice. Everyone went out of the way to make you feel welcome. Room service was quick and not as pricey as other hotels. Never went to the pool are because it was to cold. Point Orlando is a complex next door that is being fixed up. New places are going in and when it is done it will be a great place to hang out. It is walking distance from the hotel right around the corner. The hotel is a 4 star hotel. Not a resort. It lacks the big grounds most reports have and large pool areas. But the location is in the middle of everything and is very easy to get to I-4. We got a special rate at the hotel for $95.00 a night and I think it was worth it.

After 15 minutes of standing in line my husband went to the bar area & sat down so that he could keep an eye on our luggage which had just been abandoned on a trolley in the reception area. I continued to queue and it took about 45 minutes to get to the reception desk. There was a full quota of reception staff on, an apology was offered for the delay but I felt it would have been better if one receptionist could have dealt with non-conference check-ins. There was another long delay to get the bags brought up to the room. The room was adequate, quite spacious and clean, windows could have done with being cleaned. Good view over Orlando area.

They have wireless everywhere which you pay as part of the resort fee. The pools and the Jacuzzi were very good. Make sure you go into the spa.

Obviously you have to pay for any beauty treatments, or massage. The only snag I had with them is that Valet parking is $14, if you don't want to pay park yourself the car park is only a few steps away.

We were looking forward to our stay at a hotel that claims to be 4.5 stars. Our stay was more like a 2 star experience, at best. I called several days in advance to confirm our reservation and to request a king bed. When we got to our assigned room after check in we found double beds. The room was shabby with moldy grout in the bathroom, hairs all over the place and peeling wallpaper. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the mini-bar door to open. The room was extremely hot \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ac wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on. We went down to the pool to use the hot tub and were very disappointed in the quality of the jets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there were hardly any and the few jets the hot tub has are extremely weak. We were upset to find out that the gym area charges guests by the day. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find mention of this on the Peabody website. Dinner at the Bi-Line diner was horrible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the food (burgers and fries) is very poor quality and extremely overpriced. We went to our room to take a nap at 9 PM before heading out to a midnight movie showing. As soon as we dozed off a dog started barking and howling from the room next door. A dog! Peabody does not accept pets, yet there was a dog disturbing us. We called security who came up and pounded on the door, causing the dog to bark more while the front desk repeatedly tried to reach the room by phone. This meant we had to listen to pounding, a dog and a ringing phone from next door. The security guard asked if we would like to be moved to a different room. We said yes. It took the on duty manager, Elliot, 40 minutes and 2 phone calls from me to get us a new room. Extremely little apology was offered. We were moved from 1033 to 1069. We should have been given a free upgrade or discount or something for our trouble, but we just received a room in even shabbier condition than the first.

Well, we had a rental car and never used the trolley. We didn't bring a laptop and so we had to pay $.69 a minute for internet access, and we didn't drink their water. I asked repeatedly to have the charge waived, and they said no. We spent close to $50 on internet access, but still had to pay this ridiculous fee. It is like they were desperate to grab every last dime from us that they could. I will never stay here again. It's a shame, too, because I plan conferences for my company and was there \"checking the place out\", with the intention of hosting a conference for 575 people in November. Nope -- won't do it.

We arrived with lots of stress on our backs and came back home refreshed after just one day! The Peabody had a convenient location; especially if we had wanted to go to Sea World (we passed it by in our way back from dinner). I booked the hotel the night before our arrival on priceline.com for $100 which came out to a total of $124 with taxes. The infamous service charge is true: $8 for two bottles of water, wireless internet connection, and unlimited local and 800-number calls. The problem is that when checking in they don't make a point to clarify whether this is a mandatory charge or only chargeable if you are planning to use the services mentioned. The lobby is exquisite and it gives you a glimpse of what is about to come. As soon as you enter, the attentive but unobtrusive staff makes sure you feel welcomed. We arrived at 1:00 p.m., two hours earlier than expected and requested an early check-in, which was granted without any hesitation. The ladies at the front desk were extremely helpful and professional. Our room was on the sixth floor. We were very pleasantly surprised that it was enormous! It had a round table with four chairs, a sofa, center table, end table, two chairs, a bar with three stools, a beautiful armoire (which hid the flat screen TV), and a king bed. Even though our view was pitiful (heliport), we did not mind exchanging that for the spacious, clean, and well-tended room that we received. Restroom had all the expected ammenities and was extremely clean, as well. After dinner on Saturday (which we ate outside the hotel), there was free live entertainment (a pianist, bass player, and violinist) in a very inviting area of the lobby, close to the bar. They were so good that we stayed there for three hours, until they played te last song at midnight. The drink prices are a bit high, but what you would expect at this type of venues(we paid a total of $24 for a pina colada and a chocolate martini; and then $4 for a soda). We spent Sunday in the pool which was heated to what I would say were a very comfortable 80 degrees. You could rent their cabanas and well-padded lounge chairs or just use the basic chairs without charge (plenty of choices among sunny or shaded areas). I must confess, though, that we missed the famous \"duck parade\" -you could not peeled us off from the pool!!) If you are traveling with children, this might not be the place for you. The Peabody seems more appropriate for couples seeking relaxation and a luxurious experience or for people on business (the hotel is accross from Orlando's convention center).

The pool area is expansive and actually allows for privacy. The hot tub is big, so we didn't feel uncomfortable, even though others were in at the same time. The tennis courts were nice, and we enjoyed playing. The concierge was helpful in explaining the public transportation system. We won a $75 bid on Priceline, so the grand total was less than $95.

This was my worst hotel experience EVER. My colleague brought her reservation confirmation sheet with her and was told during the check-in process that they did not have a record of her reservation and she would need to find a room elsewhere. Because there were several conferences in town, there were no nearby rooms. So, she ended up having to stay with me. Strike one. Strike two-- our room was dirty. There were cup rings and large coffee drops on the marble counter, there was lipstick on the lampshade (the side facing the room), a large piece of ribbon was pushed under the entertainment cabinet rather than actually being vacuumed up when housekeeping came in the next day. Housekeep actually entered our room (while we were in it) without knocking first! I often say at five-star hotels and the cleanliness of this room was not at all acceptable. Strike three-- the wireless never wokred after 6:00 p.m., was always slow, and cost $7.00 a day for connectivity for one laptop. You had to pay an additional fee for a second laptop. I do feel lucky to have been given a room upon my arrival. Two colleagues who arrived at the same time had to wait for over two hours to be assigned a room. And we arrived at about 5:00 p.m. Numerous others at the conference told stories about not having a room, having to vacate their room before their reservation was over. No one had success with the wireless access. Everything is a $13 cab ride, except for the airport which is about $35.00, from this hotel. The hotel is close to nothing except the convention center. I phoned the hotel to discuss my stay and spoke to the front office director. The director said all the right things, but as it turns out, talk is cheap.

Being as this trip was being reimbursed by my employer, this was not even a close to an acceptable resolution. To his credit, I requested, and was given, a reversal of the refund (writing a $140 check to my employer was not something I was interested in doing).

One cannot comment enough about the comfort of the Peabody Dream Bed. The bed was absolutely the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. They even sell them on their website peabody at home. The linens were soft and luxurious. The suite has a sitting area with chair, couch, desk, and coffee table separate from the sleeping area. The television was large and hidden in a beautiful armoire. Peabody Hotel Robes were provided during the stay and more than enough towels were available in the room upon arrival. The toiletries were even coordinated to the hotel, with soaps in the shape of 3 dimensional ducks! Free newspapers and \"Architectural Digest\" magazine were in the room, along with a very handy guide listing all the local eateries. Room service was quite pricey, with the hotel charging nearly $55 for a 12 pack of beer. But, we never used room service anyway, so the high prices did not bother us. The best part was the special treats provided for us. Happy Birthday chocolates were left on the pillows, and on the day of our wedding, they provided a bottle of champagne, strawberries covered in white and dark chocolate (looked like tuxedos), and a sailboat made of chocolate. All of these \"treats\" were provided at no extra cost! This definitely made our stay much more enjoyable!!!! The pool was beautiful and not at all crowded.

The Peabody is for you. I got the peabody for 75/night on priceline and I was So happy I did. Like you, I read many many reviews for the peabody and I was truly impressed with what I saw. During this review I will inform you all of the key questions I had that were never answered in ANY of the reviews. It was just me and my boyfriend there for a disney/universal studios vacation for 8 days. From the moment we stepped in, we KNEW we were going to enjoy our stay. When we checked in, I knew to ask for a high floor king bedroom with a (distant) view of disney's fireworks. (Thank you tripadvisor!!) Melanie made that dream come true checked us in early (1:00 pm), picked up our disney tickets that was delived from ticketmania from the concierge and we were off to the room. We went upstairs and everything was so Clean! It even smelled soapy. The TV is pretty big and modern for a hotel, and there are three phones, one next to the bed, on the desk and behind your toilet seat. I didn't get the famed TV in the bathroom, but I didn't notice until our last day there! Thats how much I didn't need it. The marble bathrooms were beautiful and the maid service was absolutely great, folding the toilet paper, placing the soap duck on top of the towels. Very nice touches in the bathroom. The Bed. My goodness, need I say anymore? You SINK in to that bed. I have learned to RESENT my own bed after sleeping in the Peabody's. There were nights I was full of energy when I got in, once I hit that bed I was out like a light. Its a wonderful place for naps in the middle of the day. That first day we jumped on the I-Trolley which was interesting to say the least, the drivers were nice and there are a LOT of things to do on I-drive. We went to belz (now prime) outlets and had a ball. It was about a slow 25 minute ride just to get out there. We used our free i-trolley passes that was included in the resort fee. The gave us two for everyday, we only ended up using 6. On the way back we walked to pizza hut, came back and ate and went to the pool. The pool is NICE. If never been in a heated pool before and man it does make a big difference. It was really really nice out there, i didn't get to hit the bar but that looked nice as well. The one thing that urked me was the fact that there is a separate kiddie pool that none of the parents take there kids to. I mean it IS a kiddie pool for a reason, so the adults can be in the main pool. Other than that we went in the pool twice during our stay and sure wished we could have went more often (IT WAS HOT). Side note: The pool DOES close at dusk but plenty times I looked out my window there were people swimming as late as 12am, with no lights...so I guess its at your own risk. Now here's the good stuff, the stuff I couldn't find on the site. DISNEY transportation is pretty good. On the 1st day we had ressies with Cinderella for 8:10 so we had to cab it. $35 people. Stick with MEARS! They provide a shuttle, a decent greyhound sized bus that is always on time and only $6 roundtrip per person. They have a station in the hotel, and the drivers are really nice. Thanks Raphael!! The $6 is really worth it. As for Universal Studios, I'd rather take a cab because with Mears its 14.00 per person round trip and with the cab its about $10-12 per person and a very easy ride. The Bellhop were extraordinary. Just magnificent. Their customer service is very very good. They were always there to help, Thank you. The ducks! They were cool, try to catch them on a weekday morning, on a tuesday it wasn't so crowded as people mentioned, it was quite comfortable. Shower's were nice, not just your basic showerhead you could change it to massage etc. There was a peabody robe which I did not use. B-Line was ok. We had Breakfast there and were not too impressed, the food was pretty bland to us. But it was hella convienent to have them open 24hrs a day! If you ever have a sweet tooth in the middle of the night, that is THE place to go! Lynx is right outside as well, I didn't ride it, although I did understand you could take it straight to universal studios which would be even cheaper, seems to run a LOT more frequently than the I-trolley. Restaurants withing walking distance (and for us walking distance is a mile) Sizzler, Pizza Hut,(takeout) McD's, Houlihans, Friendly's(good food, great service), Denny's (good food, great service) , IHOP(great food, great service), Johnny Rockets Diner, Red Lobster. Many Many more down the way. Did I mention there is a mall (although under construction) right across the street? Pointe Orlando, filled with shops and restaurants. I attended the gym facilities while there, not a bad selection at all. Several treadmills, ellipticals, stair masters, all top of the line brands, Lifefitness, Precor, etc. Strength machines were good also. Fee: 10 dollars, which includes locker. Check out was smooth, kinda lost my appetite when I saw the $60 resort fee bill that is mandatory. But I expected it, once again thanks to tripadvisor. I did request to checkout one hour later, which was granted, we waited and hung out with the ducks until mears came to pick us up. All in all, great hotel! You won't regret it. Really. Any questions?

I've stayed several weeks at several Carlton Ritz hotels and this one would be a close 2nd or third place finisher. The staff were helpful and pleasant. I liked the fact that it was a very quiet and peaceful hotel. The room we got was on the 19th floor with a view that can't be matched! It was awesome. We are a family of 4 so we asked for a king and a sofa bed and that is what we got. The room was very nice and large which is very important to me. The price for all this... $95/night. We stayed 4 nights but I wish we had stayed longer. I used Priceline for this hotel and didn't know what a deal it was until we got there. The whole place is nice. Others have written about the ducks marching in etc. It's nice. The piano music and the ambiance are hard to beat and the feeling of rich surroundings and beautiful interiors will linger on long after you have left this beautiful hotel...", "Date": "July 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Easton, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cPretty, but overpriced\u201d", "Author": "sgardner42379", "ReviewID": "UR3610578", "Content": "I stayed here for five days while at a conference. Conference rate was $199 a night plus tax - very high, I thought. The hotel was very clean, nice lobby. Their claim to fame is that they march a few ducks in on a red carpet every morning and let them swim in the lobby fountain for the day - at the end of the day, they march all the ducks back out. There are usually more than a hundred people trying to watch and photograph this \"event.\" Stay out of the lobby at 11 and 5!! The room was clean, comfortable, and we had plenty of towels, etc. I didn't find any staff that I spoke to who were very friendly - most of them had the attitude of \"uppity\". Excuse me -you're hotel employees, not British royalty! Outside there is a white sidewalk, white curb, and white road - very hard to differeniate the difference with sun glare. I fell, and was badly bruised for a month! Security took my statement for an incident report, offered to take me to a hospital, and provided me with ice and an ace bandage for my knee. Afterwards, they called once to see if I was OK. Bottom line - I don't think guest safety is a big factor. Food and beverages in the hotel were very high priced and nothing special. The background music was kind of old-fashioned. Overall, I could have had a room at several other hotels locally that were more down to earth, price wise and a lot more pleasant service-wise.", "Date": "June 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cTrouble at the Peabody\u201d", "Author": "momSarasota_Florida", "ReviewID": "UR3599299", "Content": "My husband was out of the country so I decided to take my kids to Orlando. I thought since we were alone we should stay at a very nice hotel. Upon arrival I asked the conciere a question and was about to ask another but I was interupted with O.K. very loudly so I said O.K. and left. He was very rude. Then we went to a theme park for a few hours. After arriving back at the hotel I loaded my 2 year old into her stroller along with some of our things. We had already put some of our things in the room. While walking into the hotel, the parking lot was very dark with no lighting in that section so we continued walking when suddenly the stroller is abruptly stopped and my daughter is screaming. There was a rope blocking another parking area that could not be seen it was red and we were in the pitch dark. I am very lucky it only resulted in minor injury, a small bump on the head. There was no flouresent tape, no barricades, no lighting only a thin red rope. She seemed to calm down after we got inside of the hotel. Then my 7 year old son decided to watch a little t.v.. So he was surfing channels when suddenly I see and adult film, When I say adult I mean xxx they were in the middle of the worst thing he could see. I was horrified I could not believe what he saw. We are a religious family. How can I ever erase my child's memories. What he saw was irresponsible of the hotel. We did not order that movie or the adult channel. Before you take children to this hotel please check channel 23 to make sure the adult movies are not assigned to your room and tell them to block all adult programming.

Needless to say we weren't disappointed. The Peabody is by far the nicest hotel on I-Drive and in the best location. Our main interest during our stay was Universal, which was an easy drive. We didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants...we made the short drive to the nearby McDonalds or Sizzler for breakfast, so that we could get to the parks sooner and tried many of the City Walk restaurants for dinner. Parking is free (except valet, of course) and the parking lot is very easily accessible to the hotel. Only downsides- they implemented a mandatory $7.00 nightly hotel fee which is \"mandatory\" for priceline users...the impression that I was left with is that it is optional for other guests, but not totally sure. But the 7.00 pays for itself...no parking fees, 2 bottled waters, internet access, free local and toll free calls are included for the 7.00. My husband was very disappointed with not having a coffee pot and having to pay a $10.00 fee to use the \"workout facilities\" On the last night there, they had a band that was playing at the House of Blues (I believe it was the band itself on our floor) they were very loud and disrespectful, however once security found out about it, they intervened....the officer actually pulled up a chair at the end of our hall to ensure peace and quiet for the rest of the night. All in all a nice hotel, I've stayed in better and worse.

The Large clean pool heated to just the right tempature. Also large whirlpool for the adults and seperate wading pool for the kids. Stayed on the 20th floor and I have to say the Peabody's elevator has to be the fastest one I've ever expirenced in a hotel. As for the Peabody's duck parade into the foutain, don't blink - it last about 2 seconds. Not overly impressive. We stayed at the Peabody after spending the first couple of days of our Orlando trip at the Disney Yatch Club. I enjoyed my stay at the Peabody as much if not more. The Peabody is not design for Children however, they were very accomdation to our toddler. I especially liked the price of the Peabody $104.00 on Hotwire. Disney's Yatch club ran $420.00 per night.

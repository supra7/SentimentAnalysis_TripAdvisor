There was a small table in the room, a kitchen sink, a stove (with oven) and microwave and fridge. The cupboards were stocked with cooking utensils, pans, dishes and silverware. They have a laptop that they will let you take to your room, or to one of the Wi Fi hotspots for personal use. This came in very handy! The kids really enjoyed the on-site pool.

It was wonderful. First, check in was a breeze. The staff were friendly and efficient. The only thing you should be prepared for is paying for the room up front. We were not aware of this policy, but given the reputation Daytona used to have, it makes sense. After we checked in we got \"the $0.50 tour.\" We were shown other rooms on the property, where the laundry was, location of pool and grilling area, shuffleboard area, etc. We were then taken to our apartment and shown around. It had a smallish kitchen area, a comfortable living room (room for 4), a nice and newly redone bathroom (with GREAT water pressure by the way) and the 2 bedrooms. One bedroom had 2 twin beds and the other a queen. The quilts and sheets were obviously new-ish, but were comfortable, as were the beds. There was plenty of shelving and dresser space, as well as coat-hangers in the closets. Neither bedroom had a TV, but the living room did have a small tv with cable and a dvd player. There was also wireless internet and an emergency 911 telephone (no actual landline though). Cleaning service are M-S, no Sunday service, but that was fine. There were plenty of towels and the trash was wonderful because there were two bins below the kitchen sink, one for recyclables and one for trash. Most amenities needed in a kitchen were there, no paper towels or dishwashing soap but everything else was available. The rooms were very clean. The pool area was also very clean and the pool was pretty large considering the small size of the property. There was also a grilling area you could sign up for and direct beach access. Honestly, the review thus far does not do this place justice. The individual touches, the fact that the same couple has owned the property for 51 years, the head-maid who had been there for 23 years, the friendly staff, the regulars, the location...I do not plan on staying anywhere else in Daytona ever again.

The rooms were all neat as a pin and spotless. We finally chose a second floor room that was oceanfront. The balcony had a table and chairs. The room had two full sized beds and a separate kitchenette with a full-sized refrigerator, a small stove, sink, microwave, plates, utensils, pots, and pans. They also provided dish washing liquid! The pool was heated, but the ocean breezes in November made it difficult to swim (but not impossible!). There was shuffleboard, a nice sundeck, and a great grill area. Everything was clean and kept in its place. The owner lives on the property and has owned it since the 50's. There is a sign in the office that says, \"This property is not for sale.

I am enjoying my stay so much I just had to leave a review of this great little place. Sure, pulling up from down the street I was thinking to myself \"What kind of place did my grandmother book this time?\" My sister and I unpacked as the grandparents went to check-in. They were back quicker than I had anticipated! Having done a lot of travelling over the years to many types of resorts in the United States, Caribbean, Mexico and abroad I have never seen that process go so fast. We were originally booked into a \"double room.\" We entered room number 11 and I was taken aback. The room was small but very clean. We had all the amenities we needed: mini fridge, TV, microwave. When you take a beach vacation how often are you just hanging around in the room anyways? We didn't care that the room was small! However, the owner of the hotel told us that in the morning we could switch rooms to the one next door because it was a bit bigger. (All of the rooms are a little different in some way) When the next morning came around she asked us to come and view another room that may \"suit our needs better.\" All I can say about the room she showed us is WOW!!! Walking in the front door there is the living room. It has a recliner chair, sofa with pull out bed, TV (with cable), closet, and a three drawers. The next room in is the FULL KITCHEN! Four burner stove and oven, big fridge, big sink, stocked with ALL the dishes (plates, cups, pots/pans, forks/spoons/knives). Then, there is the bedroom. Two double beds, six drawer dresser, closet and phone. Around the corner is the bathroom. There is no tub, only a shower. The back is a patio with a table and a few chairs. We are located right in the courtyard. There is a cute little gazebo out there and around the corner to the pool and beach! Speaking of the pool... it is heated! Which may not sound too appealing in the summer months but it really adds a little something extra. Instead of hesitating and inching your way into the water... you can just jump right in to the luke-warm-bath-like water. VERY NICE!!! There are a lot of chairs so you don't have to worry about not getting one when you want to sleep in a little bit on your vacation. There is also a little gazebo out by the pool. Thursday nights they have a DJ out there. They also have a BBQ area right by the beach and you can reserve it to cook out with your family and friends. They have several picnic tables and you can sit out with your own sandwiches and enjoy the ocean front. I am not sure if this review is helpful or not... but I just had to share my experience. This hotel is not your average beach hotel. There are not that many rooms here and you really feel that you are appreciated here. Even the maintence workers wish you a good morning! If you are looking for a family friendly, small hotel on the beach and an unforgettable experience then you should really check this place out.

Tropical it is. the buildings are very colorful as well. the room i had was very spacious with all that i needed- the only one thing they dont provide is the coffee for the coffee maker tho you will find filters in the cupboard. you bring your own coffee. that was ok by me. the balcony on the lot side was very much lit up at night so you could sit out and enjoy the weather.. they had plenty of washers/ dryers outside to accomodate their customers.so all in all it was fantastic. the beach side was fabulous. right on the ocean. you couldnt ask for more. their prices are reasonable. if you have a problem the maint. man is right there to help out with anything that needs to be fixed right away.the managers are very accomodating for anything you need. they have thurs.night DJ to provide music and dancing by the pool in the gazebo. with the rain that fell on that night and he didnt get to play for 2 hrs the management had him come back the next night to finish where he left off. they want their customers to enjoy their stays there. the rooms are cleaned daily. you just have to bring your shampoo with you. they dont provide that as well. all in all i can only say- try it out and you will be pleasantly surprised. if you have a room on the 2nd flr - you have to walk the stairs. they are steep. there is no elevator to most of the 2nd flrs. but that was ok. Book a stay there and you will be sure to go back again. they have plenty of beach lounge chairs on the patio for a day or longer in the sun by the poolside. and a bar-b- q - for anyone wanting a cookout with a picnic table to accomodate your families.

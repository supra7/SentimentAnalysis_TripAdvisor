The price/value is actually pretty good for New York, as is the location (if you want to be close to the Times Square tourist madness). But I've stayed at a couple of nicer hotels in NY, therefore I just can't give more than 3 points. But it is close to four. The best tip I can give you: Book through the iprefer loyalty programme (iprefer.com). Then you are entitled to a room upgrade if available and free wireless. Problem is that the receptionist had no idea about this, so I had to stay in a standard room the first night, which was probably the tiniest room I have ever seen. I couldn't even open my suitcase properly. The next morning at least they upgraded me with no discussion. The Wireless is actually free anyways on a 1-hour connection cycle, but convenient to have it free for the whole stay so you don't have to log in again all the time. Windows seem to be rare, even my upgrade room only had a tiny one. All in all: For that price certainly one of the best deals you can get in NY. But if you want to stay in a really nice hotel, it may be worth investing that 50-100 bucks more per night.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roscommon", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in the best location\u201d", "Author": "SandyRoscommon", "ReviewID": "UR126374675", "Content": "Stayed at stay hotel for 5 nights in Feb 2012 with my husband.

The Bad Experience: small rooms (demand a larger room, don't let them tell you this is Times Square and they don't have any larger rooms, they have larger rooms- you have to get into your NYC attitude unfortunately here.) lowsy customer service, room service (just needed ice for a drink, I was celebrating) and food left in hallway the entire weekend.

So with that said, I booked this hotel for several reasons. First of which is due to the fact the hotel actually takes time to read and respond to reviewers like myself, showing they actually care. Secondly, I wanted a hotel with character, not a major hotel chain catering to business types. And most importantly, location! I think the hotel delivers on all three. My wife and I were in town celebrating our 5th anniversary, our flight got in very early on Thursday morning and our room was not ready (understandable), but the hotel does provide luggage storage, and it was an easy process to check it in while we went out for the day. When we came back later in the day to check-in to our room, we were pleasantly surprised by a nice bottle of sparkling wine compliments of the hotel to celebrate our anniversary. We stayed in room 902, which was a King room, and while other posters complain about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tiny\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms, I thought the room size was very appropriate for a couple. Fact is, you sleep in the room, and maybe come back for a quick rest\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6so this was a very low priority for us to begin with. Bed was very comfortable, room was clean, bathroom was clean, and the room has a safe. Even though we had a street facing room, and with the proximity to Times Square, we did not feel noise was a factor, and slept great each night. As for the elevators that several have posted about, though they are a tad slower than what you might be used to, I would not say our wait for an elevator was ever longer than 3 to 4 minutes if you actually timed it by your watch. So please, do not make a decision about this hotel based on the elevator!! As for the common areas, the lobby is very colorful and they have beautiful, what appear to be blown glass chandeliers. The sitting area is very chic, and the Aspen Social Club has quite the Rockies feel in the middle of NYC, very cool bar/restaurant. On Saturday night, it seemed to be a pretty popular hangout too for those wanting a party or hip bar scene. Finally, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talk about location. If you are doing the major NYC heavy hitters, i.e. museums, theatre, Times Square, shopping, this is absolutely the place. Times Square is literally 3 restaurant fronts over from 7th Ave which is the backbone of Times Square. My wife and I also went to Wicked, which was only a few blocks away, went to MoMA (again walking distance), Central Park, Radio City, Rockafeller, 5th Ave shopping, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6all a comfortable walking distance. For trips down to the World Trade and Greenwich Village, etc. the Subway lines are all right within 1 or 2 blocks. Great selling point is the 2 Irish pubs across the street and right next door to the hotel! Location wise, you really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat this. Overall, I am very pleased with our choice, and combined with the price we paid per night, the location, and accommodations, I think this is a great value. Great job, Stay. I would definitely recommend, and will be sure to \"stay\" again the next time we are in NYC.", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hot Springs, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201chotels stay\u201d", "Author": "Darrell T", "ReviewID": "UR124441150", "Content": "The hotel was a decent hotel for the price compare to the others of the same price in the area which I have stayed at before.

Reception team, concierge team, they were all very friendly and always ready to help or give suggestions (e.g: the best way to go to JFK airport or directions in the city). The luggage storage on the last day was very useful as well! The hotel as a GREAT location, it's 20 meters from Times Square, you cannot find better location in NYC! My room (on the 9th floor) was very nice, very clean every day, very quiet and with a great view on Times Square (M&M's building)! It was really not a problem to sleep every night! Before my trip, I read many comments about the Stay like \"tiny elevators, slow elevators, tiny rooms,...\" so I was naturally a little bid afraid about what I would find...but I can tell you that I travel a lot for leisure or for my job and I can tell you that okay the two elevators are not huge but really not smaller than the average in other hotels, they are not super fast but really not slower than the average in other hotels...they are just normal elevators !! When I stayed, the hotel was almost fully booked and I never had to wait more than 30sec to get into the elevator, and I was on the 9th floor. The rooms are not huge but really really not tiny neither, they are really normal size for a hotel in the heart of NYC just beside Times Square! The room was very clean and with a very nice design decoration, very comfortable bed and clean bathroom with a lot of amenities renewed every day. The safe in the closet was useful to put passports, flight tickets,... There is early everything you need. I really recommend this hotel to everyone, if you are traveling for business or leisure.

The hotel is a symphony of white - white walls, white leather chairs with blue neon lighting breaking up the tedium. An enormous fish tank hits you in the face on arrival. Food was Mexican and OK.

The location is also great -- close to everything in Times Square -- and believe it or not, being on the 8th floor I did not have a lot of street noise and was pleasantly surprised at how quiet my room was. The drawback of being on the 8th floor, however, was trying to get the elevator in a timely fashion. There are only two very small, very slow-moving elevators for the entire hotel. I saw many exasperated guests during my short stay. Not sure why I had to wait 25 minutes for a bowl of yogurt/granola during breakfast service in their restaurant when I was one of two guests.

The location is excellent, just a couple of steps away from the heart of Times Square. Being that this was my third time visiting NYC, i was not expecting a very large room, as most rooms in the city are fairly small. Given the mixed reviews that can be seen here on tripadvisor about this hotel, I was kind of hesitant in booking, but it had really good rates for the time of the year. Upon arriving from the airport, about 7:30am we attempt to check in and the young lady at the reception desk (FATIMA) informs that there is a room available on the fourth floor or we can wait \"until later on\" for a higher up floor. Since we had just gotten off a 5 1/2 hour red eye flight we decided to take it. As others have mentioned, the elevators are small and slow. It only holds about 2 people with 2 suitcases. So we get into the room which faces the street and it is freezing! The window did not shut properly and you can feel the draft coming in. The room was however clean and well kept. We tried to turn on the heat and it was not working. After noticing that you can also hear all the street noise, we decided to call down stairs and go with the room on a higher floor. I call the reception desk and the receptionist informs me that it is fine, but she does not know when the room will be available because she doesn't know what time housekeeping will get there to clean the next available room. I said that was fine, as we didn't have a problem waiting. She tells me to go ahead and take our luggage down stairs for storage. Before heading down, my friend and I decided to change into some warmer shoes, since we would be without a room for quite some time. As we were changing our shoes, the phone in the room rings and it was Fatima, asking if we were still going down. I said \"yes, we are just changing our shoes.\" She then begins to talk to me with in an irritated tone, saying that if the room is used they cannot change it. She stated that housekeeping informed her that there were still people in the room. Again, I told her we were on our way down, then she completely cut me off and responded, \"well you said you were.....ugh...just....ugh\" and hung up! I could not believe how rude she was being. We go down stairs so our luggage can be stored and I asked how if she knew more or less when the rooms would be ready and she said, \"I don't know, it could be 1, 2, well check in is at 3, so 3 would be best. I can't give you an exact time.\" I said 'Ok\" and we went on our way. We return at 2:45pm and at this point there are people checking in at the desk and also sitting in the lobby waiting for their room. There are also two other girls at the reception area. So I go up to Fatima and ask her if the room is ready and she tell me no. So I told her that we would be sitting in the lobby and if she could please let us know when the room was ready and she ok. We waited and waited and nothing. Finally, like at about 3:45 I go back to the reception desk and asked a different young lady, as Fatima was no longer there and she asked me for my name. I told her and she gave me the new room key. I noticed it was tapped to the pillar next to the reception desk with my name written on it, because I saw the young lady reach for it. Fatima never let us know that the room was ready and instead just let us wait. I also noticed there were other people waiting in the lobby for the room to be ready and it was well past the 3:00 standard check-in time. We get to our room on the 8th floor; this room was much quieter, warm, and was also clean. The next day, we noticed there was no \"Don't Disturb\" sign. Whatever, we didn't think much of it as we noticed no one else had one. However, for a couple of days during our stay, we were awaken by housekeeping staff banging on our door yelling \"HOUSEKEEPING!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Really?!?! I think we got housekeeping service done about 3 times throughout our 6 night stay. We decided to stay an extra 3 nights and wanted to inquire what the original rate would be. I called the reception desk and the young man transfers me to reservations. I explained to the reservation agent and he informs me that the rate would have to be determined by the hotel itself because he was unable to pull my current reservation. I explained to him that the hotel receptionist had transferred me to him and he apologized and stated that unfortunately the stay hotel has a bad reputation for doing that. After that, I was DONE and decided to just look for another hotel for the remainder of the trip. I cannot believe the level of customer service that I received from this hotel. I have never experienced anything like this before at any other hotel in NYC or elsewhere. Needless to say, I will NOT be staying at this hotel EVER AGAIN. I suggest you stay somewhere else, unless this is your last resort. The hotel itself is clean and I have really no complaints about the hotel itself, as the rooms are clean and comfortable and it is in a great location.

We were placed on the 8th floor in what is described as a spacious queen room.

The following morning after only a few hours sleep we woke up, got ready and packed our bags. I spoke with a very rude receptionist who had no sympathy and did want to hear any feedback her response was 'all hotels in NYC are of this standard' I requested to speak with the manager...we spoke with the manager and she was very apologetic she understood and sympathised with our situation. She told us to enjoy our day whilst she investigated with housekeeping and advised us that our bags will be moved to thew new room when we return. We returned feeling apprehensive about the next room..we were placed on the 9th floor in room 902 the room was what we were originally hoping for, although we were upgraded to a king room, nice large comfortbale bed, bigger room with more space and quiet .The hotel manager left a lovely apology note with fresh fruit and still water. This was very kind.However, there were still some problems they place a throw on the end of the bed, in all rooms they were stained and either need replacing or washed, the bedding consists of a sheet with a duvet and another sheet, every night I would do my best to not let the duvet near me just the new sheets as I assumed the duvets were not washed!

Although there were a few hiccups during the period of stay, i think this hotel still provide whatever that i wanted. I arrived at the hotel about 9.30am on 5 Nov. I do understand that i will not be able to check in that early but i still try to request for an earlier check in since we have been on the flight for more than 20 hrs and all we want is to wash up and freshen up ourselves. The receptionist told us that we can get the room at 11am and we were ecstatic. We decided to have our breakfast beside the hotel and it would be just nice for us to check in by the time we finish our breakfast. However when we return back to the hotel another receptionist told us that the room will not be ready yet and ask us to wait for a while more. We sat at the lobby all the way till 1.30pm. I guess if the first receptionist did not tell us that we can check in at 11am, we wouldn't hold so much hopes and probably we can walk around time square while waiting. This is probably the only complain that i have during my stay. I have read many reviews from tripadvisor about Stay and many reviews stated that the rooms are too tiny. However we feel that the size of the room is perfectly fine, the Queen size bed we have is really comfortable and the room is very clean. We are both able to open and pack our luggage in the room at the same time, and i guess this is good enough for us. I have taken the advice from the previous reviews to request for room on a higher floor in order not to be disturb by the music that comes from the drinking lounge at first floor. I have also requested for an electric kettle. There isn't any coffee cups in the room but you can easily get it from the restaurant downstairs. The hotel provide me with whatever that i requested for and they tidy up our room everyday. There was a night when the air conditioner in my room failed to work. It was really warm and i requested for someone to check it out. They quickly sent a guy from maintenance to get the aircon fix. Within 10mins, the temperature was back to normal again. Very efficient indeed! The porter were extremely helpful and always greeting us when he sees us. The location of the hotel is superb. Times square is just a few steps away and there is no problem for us to walk around even at night since Times square is always crowded and the hotel is just there.

Also, with regard to space, there was barely room for one shared suitcase. You cannot unpack because there are only shallow desk drawers- no dresser. If you are the kind of person who needs to spread out and organize your stuff, make sure you spring for a large room--and find out what \"large\" actually means. Our room couldn't have been larger than 10x13 with a full size bed taking up most of the floor space. It is hard to understand how small this is until your find yourself loosing things because piles of paper and bags quickly accumulate with so little storage space. On the up side, it felt safe and reasonably clean. There is a 24 hour grocery with healthy food next door and a Starbucks up the street if you need to get some early coffee like we did.

The doorman, for example, watches while people struggle to get their bags thru the doors. The concierge was helpful but the desk staff was somewhat surly. Used room service trays stayed in the stairwells for days, untouched. On the whole, my impression is that this was an unhappy team that needs a new leader.

The hotel is very clean and yes the rooms are small but nice for Times Square. No complaints there. We moved into a king room the next day and then the air conditioner did not work so had to move again - have to say the staff was very nice, especially the hotel manager Anna who listened to my complaints. She moved us into another king with a working air conditioner (as it was 100 degrees in NYC that day much needed!). They did give us a fruit plate and a letter and some water for our troubles which was nice. There is no free wifi in the rooms but is available in the lobby.

We spent 4 nights at Stay. and 2 nights with relatives in PA. Our stay at Stay. was an awsome experience in any way. We found the hotel after googleing a reasonably priced 4* hotel on Manhatten, Midtown. When first arrived late in the evening we were given a small room with no closet to put the clothes in. The day after we asked for a room with a closet and we were then moved to a much larger room for the next 3 nights, with no extra charge. However, the both rooms were very well equiped, with a flat screen, bathrobes, iron, and most important of all: the most comfortable bed ever! The linen was very soft with a de-lux-feel in it. The hotel is just around the corner from Times square, and it's really near to a couple of subway stops. However, we could not hear any noise in the room, we slept very well there, no ear plugs needed. We also borrowed an adapter for charging the batteries, which was free of charge. Very large and nice umbrellas for rent as well at the hotel lobby, free of charge. The staff helped us with some advice on how to reach a train to the Newark airport (take a train from Penn station, it's the cheapest and fastest way to reach the Newark airport, and other way around). We only ate one breakfast there, it was a very expensive experience, and we would not do it again. We discovered a Starbucks and pret-a-manger on our way to 6th avenue and had our breakfast there. You can also buy food and drinks in a small store next door. Just vis-a-vis the hotel is a restaurant called Dervish, it serves turkish/greek food, and we had some wonderful meals/dinner/lunch there. Prices are very good there! Next to it is an Irish pub, but we did not try it. At the hotel we had a couple of small problems with the telephone and radio, but that was very quickly handled by Oscar the charming! We loved the place, and we would definitely come again! We would also recommend you to buy one-week subway ticket (if staying that long). It took us every place wanted in no time, for \"no money\". Taxis are cheap, but often stuck in the traffic. And don't forget the theater tickets booth, called tkts, where you can buy some cheap tickets for that evening's performances. The booth is just on the corner between 47th street and Times square, a 100m from the hotel.

After MANY, MANY searches for hotels we came across The Stay Hotel on booking.com. My main concern was the fact that all the hotels in NYC have issues with Bed Bugs right now and have for years. So I went on several sites and looked for a hotel that has never had any reported problems or reports of Bed Bugs. This hotel came up as one that has had neither. We called the hotel direct and spoke with Amary the night clerk. He was wonderful and so helpful. I knew right away we needed to book our stay. We went to the website and might I just add the Stay Hotel is far more beautiful then the pictures on the website. The feeling you get when you walk in the doors is so relaxing and comfortable. The atmosphere is incredible. Sally was working at the front desk and she was so very helpful in our of our requests for our stay. (So far so good 2 out of 2 staff members were very caring and helpful). She made sure we had everything we needed and was so pleasant and friendly. We needed assistance in our room and Sally sent up Oscar. I always get a little nervous about having someone I don't know come into my room but wow was I surprised. Not only friendly and very professional also very funny. He was helpful in answering some questions we had for our stay in the area. When we needed extra towels we had the pleasure of meeting Mohammd. He was so friendly and you could tell right away he really was here to please and take care of the guests because we tried to tip him and he didn't accept it and said \" Iam here for you\" WOW I mean really how often do you hear that from a staff member at a hotel!!!!!! So nite rolled around and we realized we had forgotten our slippers so we called down to the front desk to ask if the had some here at the hotel. We then met Dennis who was very helpful and in no time we had slippers delivered to our room. When we went down to the lobby to ask about some shipping needs we had we were amazed at how helpful Dennis was. He not only answered our questions he helped us sign up for the \"IPrefer\" Rewards Program thru the hotel. Bottom line this hotel could be the best kept secret in NYC!!!!

The hotel is situated very close to times square, in fact from leaving the hotel doors you can walk onto times square within seconds, but it is still far enough away for an uninterupted sleep which is certainly what we had for the six nights we stayed. The hotel has a very 'chic' and stylish interior and I was impressed with the hotel lobby area upon arrival. The staff we dealt with were all very friendly which to be fair is what we have come to expect on previous visits to the states - certainly put ourselves to shame on the service side of things. Check in was quick and efficient and we were given a room on the 5th floor, the elevator we found was quite slow and seemed to take an age to get to the floor but again this is just a minor gripe. I did ask for a room with a view of the city but we only got a room looking at other windows of the hotel but to be honest I think where the hotel is located it may not have been possible to get a different view but thats not a problem. The actual room was a double guest room and has a safe, ironing board with iron, a refridgerator stocked with drinks, hairdryer, 2 bath robes which was a nice touch and a flat screen tv which was on the wall, a 'Bose' clock radio and a telephone. We found everything to be clean and the bathroom has a large shower. There were no tea making facilities in the room but room service was available if required. I had read reviews saying the rooms are small and yes, I have stayed in larger rooms but it as certainly large enough for two people and as already touched upon we were not disturbed at all during the night. The bed was comfortable and the room has air conditioning which was needed as we found the rooms to be warm which was no bad thing. We only ate at the hotel once and that was at breakfast which was very nice and filling, we wanted to eat somewhere different each day and that was the only reason we didn't eat at the hotel more than that. The hotel bar is nicely set out and again staff were really friendly. There are loads of other bars and places to eat near to the hotel if you do want a change.

I was traveling alone and stayed three nights. The room was small, stylish, well-appointed and had every amenity I needed--fluffy towels and robe, hair dryer, iron, toiletries, internet for a $10 fee, and a comfortable bed. I ate at the restaurant twice because the service was excellent, the food was fresh and delicious, and the small plates were the perfect quantity for a later dinner. It's not a boring hotel cafe, it's a hip bar/restaurant. I was on the 4th floor, which was plenty quiet. They have two open staircases, so I was happy to be able to use the stairs and not wait for the elevator. The location is incredible! There is a market next door that sells fresh fruit salads, coffee, breakfast sandwiches, and dairy. Starbucks is across 7th. You don't get the Times Square noise because it's on a side street, yet you are steps from the subway and Broadway. Walk to Hell's Kitchen around 9th (hotel is between 6th/7th) and there are plenty of great real NY restaurants that are not the touristy TGI Fridays of Times Square. You will appreciate this hotel if you are a minimalist, organized, and petite solo traveler (not too tall or chubby) who chooses quality over quantity and is comfortable with an experience that is more typically European than middle America. If you are very tall, very wide, carry a lot of luggage, or need to pace your room, this may not be the place for you. I only had one issue. The heater is loud, so I should have requested an additional blanket for the bed. Would you select the sashimi plate and cucumber salad and leave feeling comfortable knowing you had delicious, high quality food or would you go to Claim Jumper so you can get a large portion and be completely stuffed?", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood location, Great hotel -the stay\u201d", "Author": "lmsyd", "ReviewID": "UR97483030", "Content": "The stay was a great hotel!

Then to top it all off, when I found out back in Australia that the town car we used to go to JFK had double-charged us, the staff at Stay contacted the town car company on my behalf and organised the refund for me. Another great advantage of this hotel was the location. So close to Broadway and comedy shows and still walking distance to Central Park. There's a great diner just 2 doors down which was our main breakfast haunt (and even has yummy black and white cookies). We also tried out the Turkish Restaurant across the road and were happy with the food on offer there. The only downside really is that acouple of nights the Aspen Social Club is playing loud music late into the night (I think it's Thurs, Fri and Sat nights).

Nice view of the M & M store's GIANT jumbo tron tv but the curtains did keep most of the light out overnight. There is no closet or storage space in the room. Just a small arm sticking out of the wall next to the bed to hang a few things on. The bed was comfortable but my boyfriend and I both agreed it had to be a full size mattress and not a queen like we were told. It was small. The lighting in the rooms is horrible also. There is a mirror on the wall but no light anywhere near it so this makes getting ready to go a difficult task if someone else is using the bathroom. The elevators take forever to get to you and to get you to your floor. They're also VERY small. We are small people and felt very crammed just the two of us with our baggage (one each).

I have stayed in hundreds of hotels all over the world some of which have suffered from varying degrees of noise on occasions but this is in another league. The club finishes at 3.30am but then the \"phase two\" starts, drunken kids banging on doors, shouting, swearing, arguing and generally doing what drunken kids do. I tried to change rooms at 2.30am but of course the hotel was fully booked. It is possible that rooms on higher floors are better but somehow I think you will still suffer.

I stayed at Stay Hotel for 2 nights in April and it was probably one of my worst stays in a hotel. The hotel is spectacular in the public areas, you can't deny that. It was the funky decor and attached bar that led me and my colleague to book the rooms in the first place. We came from another hotel in NYC to this one as we were staying in the city on our own budget for the weekend and the hotel staff kindly offered to look after our bags as we were too early. No problems there so we headed out for the day. We came back and that's where the issues started. The hallways are gloomy and tiny, the rooms even more so. My room faced a wall and had no hanger, just a pull out rack from the wall with no hangers on it. The bathroom was small and my toilet leaked - This was reported several times throughout my stay and nothing happened. My colleague had to move rooms as his hot water didn't work in his room. Mine achieved lukewarm status after a few minutes but it still wasn't a pleasant experience. The air con was so noisy at night that I couldn't sleep properly and yet turning it off wasn't an option due to the unseasonably warm weather beginning of April. There was also people walking up and down the corridors or night and the walls were paper-thin. I was ill during the stay and ordered room service one night. This turned up from downstairs over an hour later, after one follow-up call, and was stone cold. Not the greatest of experiences. The final straw was when I came downstairs in the lift to check out at 4am and could smell weed in the hotel lobby. I asked the receptionist if she could smell it, as it was particularly pungent, and she just shrugged. I did email the hotel afterwards to complain about my experience and did, to their credit, get an email back.

I am a Chanel employee and our corp. office booked 8 rooms at your hotel from Sept. 22-25th. When I arrived on Wednesday, Sept. 22 (around 1:00 P.M.) I was greeted by a very nice doorman who took me to the front reception. When I arrived at the desk, there was a young girl socializing with another gentleman checking in. He was obviously flirting with her and she was discussing her life history of living in the Bronx and going into detail about her nightlife among other things. I patiently waited for 10 mins, and she saw me waiting to check in .. but continued to ignore me and flirt with the man as he engaged her. Finally the door attendant recognized my frustration and was apologizing for her. He got her attention and kindly directed her to me as I was standing there with all my luggage waiting. She told him and me to hold on as she was talking. He offered to take the luggage of the guy she was speaking to in order to move him a long and she snapped \"I'll call you if he needs his luggage taken\". Finally he found another front desk attendant for me ... this process was over 20 minutes and clearly set a tone for the service of my stay. The next morning, Thursday Sept. 23rd, my co workers and I went to the Aspen room for breakfast. There was one young lady working and she was clearly the only one available to service us. She did the best she could clearly, but the service was EXTREMELY slow since she was waiting on others, and I assume was doing the cooking as well?? It was impossible to get out of there in a timely manner due to her being the only attendant. We decided to try the Aspen room again on Friday, Sept. 24th to the same reception. We were having to chase down the waitress in the back to get our checks, refills, and service. I want to make clear this young lady was not terrible, she was very nice, but a hotel restaurant needs at least 2 people working in order to accommodate the guest! I finally left Saturday morning on Sept. 25th. When I went at 5:10 am to check out there was not a front desk attendant. I tried to call using the house phone, and no answer. The phones were ringing behind the desk from other callers (or guests) and no one was present. I went to the front door and the doorman was laid out on the chair snoring!! I tried to wake him up 2 times before having to shout to get him slightly awake. He was not coherent my first try, I asked if he worked for the hotel, and he mumbled \"yes\", then went back to sleep. I tried again to get him to wake up and he just mumbled. I once again tried yelling behind the front desk and there was no answer or help. I walked into the restaurant and no one. Finally I screamed at the sleeping door man and he finally came around. I told him I needed to check out and he finally woke up enough to radio the front desk guy. Upon the arrival (about 10 mins later) of the front desk attendant I was able to check out. The whole process took 45 mins!!! The front desk attendant asked if I wanted a cab and I informed him \"yes I needed to go to LaGuardia\". There was a black lincoln town car out front and I asked him if a cab was available? He said they were all the same price. I got into the car service and was hit with a $55.00 car ride to LaGuardia (which is normally ranging from $30 - 40) and was upcharged with a service fee of $5.00 for using a credit card.) Your attendant did not try to fulfill my request for a yellow cab service, he rushed me into the car service with the comment \" they take credit cards and are all the same price\". I am terribly disappointed in my experience at your hotel .. for $350.00 a night I can stay at the Essex house, or Helmsley Park Lane for much better service and room .. and I promise Chanel corporate travel will know my experience with your hotel as they use you for a lot of their business travel for their consultants!

What do you really want. Price..Location. Just start booking this hotel right now. New York is expensive. The only reason I use a hotel in New York is because it is convenient to everything. I don't need a pool or lounge. 95% of the time when I'm actually at the hotel, I am unconscouis...sleeping. That being said, I understand the reviews I read. The decor of the hotel was stylish. This includes the room. I was definitelly ok with the style. However, the room we received was the size of a large closet. The desk drawer handle was broken. Average cleanliness feeling. I could still see hair on my towel. Granted, it was my hair but if I was cleaning I would have removed it. It was an impression I received. The staff is not rude. Most respond to you but they are not service oriented. I went up to the desk several times. They kept asking me to move to move to where they're desk was. I guess they weren't where their desk is usually. They don't immediately respond to you that's true. They'd rather finish their own conversations with other staff members than see what the customer needs first. Also asked for a cab, ended up hailing my own cab in the rain. It was annoying but I'm pretty independent anyway. Plus, it's pretty hard to hail any cab in Times Square especially when it's raining so I can understand why they didn't seem really enthusiastic about it. The air conditioner was extremely noisy. I can sleep with noise if it's a constant noise but this air conditioner would be humming and then it would start another noise like rushing water or something. I fixed it by just turning on the fan instead of the air conditioning. The fact of the matter is the place needs good management.

I had reserved via booking.com for a reasonable rate. The main reason I chose to stay here was its excellent location: it's basically in Times Square, corner of 47th and 6th Avenue, a block away from all the main attractions, like Rockfeller Ctr, subway and railway stations and only 5 minutes walk from Central Park. On my arrival I found out my room ( a standard queen sized) was upgraded to a King room. I was thrilled at first because I had not requested it and , moreover, I didn't have to pay extra. To my surprise, when I got to the room (room 820) I discovered the size of the whole room was miles away from being King sized. Anyway, it was clean, the bed was comfy and the bathroom spacious enough. Better suitable for one person, not for two. But once in New York , one would not expect to spend their whole day at a hotel, so for the night it was ok. There was a mini fridge in the room, a flat TV screen a Bose radio station with Ipod cradle. There was no proper closet though, except for a tiny wall closet with a safe and ironing board in it. So I had to leave all my stuff in the case. In the room rate a special pass to a nearby fitness center was included upon request at the reception, but I never took advantage of it. Free Internet connection was provided on the lower ground floor in the business center, as well as free copies of the New York Times. Breakfast was not included in the price, but giving the hotel's central location, loads of options where handy (Starbucks, Pret a Manger, Sbarro, to name a few). All in all , I would say that it is a place with no frills but good for exploring the city- far from top of the line but affordable and clean. I would recommend it to both young people on a budget and families and personally i would stay there over again. Only drawback, the heavy noise at night. I could not sleep most of the time.

Save yourself the heartache and stop by the lobby and lounge for a 45 second view of the downstairs decor. I read the reviews about this place and called right before I was going to book a reservation and spoke to a man by the name of Daniel. I expressed to him that though most people enjoyed the decor of the hotel, the noise would be an issue for me. I requested to have a room on floor 8, 9 or 10 if i was going to spend my 2 nights at their facilities. Daniel checked the occupancy and assured me that was not a problem at all, and was going to notate it in their files. So before grabbing a train out from Long Island, I called the hotel to verify my room arrangement... guess what, not only did they not have any notations of my room request (guaranteed via Daniel), they also had NO RECORDS of my reservation at all!!!! After spending an hour and a half back and forth on the phone with the front desk staff, priceline.com, and a man by the name of Noah at the central reservations office, the conclusion was that over the course of the past 30 hours, not a single manager at the hotel downloaded the reservations from the central reservations office (as well as there not being a manager on duty to do such tasks). End result, was that Noah had to call the hotel and have them do the reservation manually; to which the guarantee of a room on the top 3 floors was granted to me via Noah. Upon final check-in at the hotel, after already leaving my credit card for payment; I was given a room on the FOURTH FLOOR. I was baffled and argued with the man at the front desk for a minute, to which he replied to me \"well sir, I understand that people told you that, but daniel isnt here right now and this is the only room I can personally give you.\" Man was I screwed. I just paid this hotel $775 for 2 nights stay. I was stuck in a room with only about a foot of room around the bed, the noise level from the streets and the club could wake up a hibernating bear, the housekeeping staff seemed to be constructing a village right outside my door, and the staff were straight up rude and disprespectful. After arriving home, I called and spoke to the general manager \"Chris\".. wow. what a shotty guy this is. I explained this entire experience at the hotel to him. He asked what would \"make me happy\", I told him I didn't think I should have to pay since... I already charged the room to my card, then got blown off for the guarantees made to me by both Daniel and Noah. his response was a rude chuckle, and a sarcastic \"that isnt going to happen.\" He asked for my email address and then told me i would hear from him in the next 48 hours, but that unfortunately, I did stay at the hotel. I would once again recommend to stay far away from this place, the gorgeous decor is a facade to a poorly run organization.

When I lifted up the window the entire window came off its frame and smashed down immediately onto my left hand. I had to shout at my husband who was in the bathroom to come fast as i could not lift the window off. When i got my hand freed it was extremely swollen and my wedding ring finger had doubled to twice its originial size. Thankfully my wedding band had saved my finger being shattered/broken. I was upset and immediately put my finger under the cold tap. After a few minutes i phoned to reception and quite shakily told them of the situation. They did not seem to care very much but she said she would send someone up. About 10 minutes later two mainatinence man arrived up to fix the window! I was incredibly upset at this as I said I thought at least a manager would come up as clearly this was quite a serious incident and I was still in pain. The two men were embarassed as clearly they did not know what had happened. I told them that obviously we did not want to sleep in a room without a window so i said that i presumed we would be moved to another room. These two guys were actually nice and understood where we were coming from and they were the only ones that saw the size of my hand. About twenty five minutes later a manager PHONED the room and said that they were quite full but had another room they could move us to. I told the manager that i was annoyed this was taking so long as i was in pain and we just wanted to get unpacked and rest up. She then asked me if i needed medical assistance! I declined as the cold tap seemed to be bringing down the swelling a little however there was clearly alot of bruising. Also i informed her i was pregnant and could not take any anti-inflammatories. We moved to the new room which was smaller even and there was a bowl of fruit left there. We never heard one word from reception staff or a manager since.

The street itself is quiet, but literally within 20 paces, you are in the middle of Times Square.

Times Square location can be annoying on the other hand when you have to wade through all the tourtists just to get where you are going. I had an uneventful and pleasant check-in experience. My medium queen room was on the fourth floor which was quiet at all hours. The decor was modern, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. The linens were fresh and new, and the bathroom, though small, was very nice and clean. I even had a little bit of a view, even though I believe my room looked out over the back of the hotel. The restaurant/room service menu looked great. I came close to grabbing a drink or some food from the restaurant, but ended up going out with friends instead.

The location is fantastic. It's located on 47th just east of 7th. Times Square is probably a couple hundred feet down the street. The rates are very good for the location. If you want to stay at a chain (Marriott, Hilton, Starwood, etc), you'll definitely end up paying far more than at Stay - think around 40%+ more. The lobby is very chic, if not a little cold. Loud music and modern style, if that sort of thing appeals to you. Now, the neutral. It's a small room. If you've stayed at places like the Marriott Marquis or Hilton Times Square, the rooms here are probably anywhere from 1/2 to 1/3 the size. Given the room rates, it's expected and it is what it is. TV is nice, a lot of channels, although a channel guide would be nice. Room has everything you need - radio/alarm, wifi, fancy VOIP phone, toiletries, iron, hair dryer. A luggage rack would be nice, though. Room is nicely decorated with all black furniture, although it would be nice if they could touch things up every now and then - the black desk was scratched up, as was the closet door. AC is a tad loud, but not terribly so. Works just fine. Echoing previous reviews, yes - the elevator is tiny and slow. I took my time and walked up and down the steps (there are 2 sets - one with the fire doors and one across the hall that is open). Annoyances include: Outlets by the desk are literally at desk height. In order to use them I had to move the desk away from the wall. Same with the outlet on the other side of the bed, which was behind the nightstand. On top of that, those particular outlets are tied to a switch by the bed, which was off when I came in. I didn't realize for a while that they had no power and it took another minute or so to figure out that I needed to turn on the switch. Minor annoyance, since I did figure it out. The front desk staff was a disappointment. There was one young man on duty who didn't acknowledge that I had walked up to the \"window\" for about 20 seconds. He was efficient, if not polite. No eye contact and I felt that I was inconveniencing him. Perhaps this is supposed to be an aloof, pseudo-European thing, but I found it a bit off-putting. Random observation: The website touts L'occitane toiletries, but they are, in fact, some eco-friendly brand (don't recall off the top of my head). I read through some older reviews and found one from August 2009 saying that they had been replaced over the summer and yet, the website has not been updated. This needs to be corrected. A quick note about the recommendation - I clicked yes, but it's a qualified yes. Would I stay here again for a business trip? Probably not, unless my client was particularly sensitive to cost. Would I recommend it to colleagues? Again, probably not with the same caveat. Would I recommend it to friends/family? IF they are looking for a place in the middle of the action and are on a budget and don't mind \"cozy\" accomodations, then yes - they could certainly do much worse. However, they must also know they won't earn any loyalty points, which is a big deal for me, at least.", "Date": "March 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "KJE4150", "Title": "\u201cVERY noisy room but great location\u201d", "Author": "KJE4150", "ReviewID": "UR58845146", "Content": "The hotel is very modern and chic.

The hotel is in a fantastic location, particularly if you are going to be there for the New Year's celebration. Period. Now for the bad. Small rooms, bad service, unattentive management, noisy... you get the point. My wife and I stayed here in March of '09 and had a pretty bad experience. Staff kept waking us up as they yelled at each other across the hallway at 7 or 8am. They sounded like they were in our rooms having a conversation while we were trying to sleep because the walls are so thin. At night, you can't sleep either because the club downstairs pumps music so hard that your nightstand will vibrate. Other than the fact that it was in a good location, we did not enjoy our time there, at all. We let management know and they offered us a complimentary night stay if we chose to return. It was so bad that i didn't really even want to take him up on the offer, so at first, I declined. However, since I was in a bind looking for a hotel in a good location for New Year's eve, I figured, what the heck. Maybe now that they know they screwed up the first time, they will treat us much better the second time. Plus, it's one night for free and hotel prices were pretty high... I should have just spent the money somewhere else. Most of the things that annoyed me about this hotel were still prevalent. This time, I went with my wife and two friends. On New Year's Eve, my friend got assautled by two guys... TWO!!!! in the bathroom stall. He got pushed out of the bathroom and in self defense, he punched both guys in the face and knocked them both to the floor. The bouncers at the hotel quickly jumped on my friend, without asking any questions and proceeded to beat him sensless and pound and kick him while he was on the ground, giving him a black eye, bloody mouth, busted lip, swollen back of the ear and bruised ribs. Then they kicked him out of the hotel and wouldn't let him back in. Eventually he got back into his room. When he woke up the next morning we went down to management and told them what happened and then we called the police and filed a police report. The hotel has cameras which should have caught everything on film. Management did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT THIS!!!! NOTHING... To this day (26 days later) my friend still has pain when he moves a certain way because of the bruised ribs. NOTHING!!! After checking out our last day, I checked the bags in because our flight didn't leave till later. When I returned to the hotel, I gave the baggage handler a ticket and he got my bags out of a room. Instead of taking it out to the cab for us, he just walked away after they were all out. I proceeded to pick up the bags on my own. When I reached down to pick one up by the floor, I sliced my finger open on one of the metal baseboards by the baggage room entrance. This is a baseboard that should be attached firmly to the wall, instead it was sticking out and it cut me so deep that I was still bleeding when I got back home to Miami. I went to the front desk and asked them for a first aid kit because I had cut my hand on the baseboard but they didn't have anything to give me. The guy actually would have been ok if I had just walked away because after he said he didn't have anything he just kind of sat there. I looked at him and said, \"I'm bleeding all over your counter because i cut my hand on your property. Get me something to put on this!\" That's when he walked to the back and came back with some alcohol and gauze. No manager came to say anything and again, nothing was done. There were other little things that were very annoying, such as concierge recommendations being way off, bags going to the wrong room, etc... but I don't want to be here all day. Bottom line is, I gave them a second chance after our first terrible experience and you'd think they would have paid extra special attention to making sure that things went well for us, so theoretically, they were on their best behavior. But instead of making it up to us, it turned out to be a disaster. Some things are just not worth the trouble and frankly, after our two terrible experiences here, I wouldn't go back even if they offered me a month for free.

I am a slim woman and I was traveling with a four-year-old, but the room size was a problem even for us. Heaven knows how two full-size adults deal with it.

No luggage rack, no closets, so you end up stumbling over it for you entire trip, or putting it on the nice clean bed - gross, considering that your bags have are probably fresh from the the filthy environment of an airplane baggage hold and luggage carousels.

Booked the hotel because of its location. Was quiet let down by the room (Have stayed in hotels in New York before which were more spacious). Had a double room on the 3rd floor. Being in such a great location didnt benefit me as my window looked out on a red brick wall! The room was tiny, barely enough room to walk around the bed which wasnt very helpful considering I was mainly there to do shopping and had 2 suitcases each. Ended up using the desk for the suitcases. As already mentioned by several others, the air conditioning was very loud and would keep you awake. Also the doors banged shut VERY loudly so it woke me up a few times during the night when others would be getting in. Also the minibar could not be used for cooling water because it might set off the sensors and have a $50 restocking charge put on my credit card, a bit annoying considering it was boiling when I was there. Very small wardobe space. Bathroom was very basic, not even a sink stopper which would have been handy for washing out clothes. There was nothing in the room in relation to the services of the hotel (room service menu, hotel details) The hotel itself was in a great location about 30 seconds from Times Square. But was quiet disappointed that Wi-Fi was available free of charge in the lobby to anybody but to the paying guest it was $9.95 for 24 hours to have it in your room. Don't really understand why guests should have to pay? The hotel turns into a club on Fridays and Saturdays staying open until 4am. Wouldnt really bother with buying drinks there though. $8 for a bottle of Budweiser, $12 for a shot of Jagermeister, $14 for a Mojito. You could head to any of the pubs close by for better value.

The noise from the bar was extreamly loud for three of the nights but we put up with it as it was off time square and to be expected and it generally finished at 2am and with ear plugs it was just about possible to sleep however on the friday night it was deafening and after several hours actually made me feel pysically sick as the base was actually causing vinrations in the roomi and the music was beyond any acceptable levels of tolerance a hotel bedroom. They had a private party and the Dj and base may as well have been in our room even with ear plugs we couldnt deaden the noiseat all. I complained so vehemantly after 1am that the night porter moved us to a room on the 9th floor.The problem with the rooms as i see it on the lower floors is that the central (escape i might add) stairwell is open all the way down from each floor no fire doors until you reach the gorund floor and then you enter directly into the bar. There is no sound proofing worth taking about to the floor slabs or to the circulation routes nothing to stop the noise travelling up several floors. The staff were unfriendly except for one of the door men and the service man. Yes we actually met the service man..3 times in fact which brings me to the next problem, the air conditioning it was making a terrible persistant squeaking sound that lasted several seconds then stoppen and came back randomly. It was too warm to not to have the Aircon on at night so this was annoying. The service man couldnt identify or fix the problem. Also reception when we complained a few times twice didnt pass on the message to him and we had to call again. The final problem was with our toilet which was prone to blocking and not though the excessive use of paper either i might add. We were heading out the first time one morning and reception assured us they would have it fixed. We came back late that night and it was as we had left it. We called recption again and when the service man arrived he said he had never been given the message the first time.

Being right in the middle of Manhattan is just perfect for walking or taking a cab to many of NY's sights & attractions. The Hotel is quite hip and modern. The lobby has funky alien lighting and a large floor to ceiling fish tank. The staff are quite young but were attentive and addressed our every needs, although they were quite casual at times and I can see that some may not appreciate this, but it did not bother us. We requested a room on a high floor due to guests previous complaints about noise from the hotel bar/club. We had no issues with noise (apart from the usual NY sounds and regular police sirens) on the 7th Floor and our double room had ample space for 4 people, 2 comfy beds, a wardrobe with safe, LCD tv, Bose Stereo and good sized shower room. The entire hotel is dimly lit (for ambience I guess!) and we needed to put the lights on during the day to get dressed. There is wireless internet, however it is only free to use in the hotel lobby/ground floor and there is a charge to use it in your room which was a little inconvenient. The hotel has a small business centre which we did not use and a trendy bar/restaurant serving mainly light meals (if there is such a thing in the US!) & breakfast, with waitresses & bar staff with extremely short skirts-if you like that kind of thing. There are obviously thousands of other hotels, restaurants and cafes right on the doorstep. Times Square Broadway ticket stand is literally 200 yards away and is the best way of seeing a last minute show usually for 50% of the regular price. Overall \"Stay\" was a good trendy, clean option for a Manhattan hotel, ideal for singles, couples and small groups visiting the city. Its not perfect and many reviews have mainly complained about staff & noise. Definitely request and insist on a high level room. Staff can be good or bad depending on the day, what you expect of them and how you treat them. During our stay, they remained friendly and helpful and we got to know them over the 5 days we stayed there.

You have to try Evergreens for breakfast - good food, really quick service and friendly staff. I would recommend the omelettes - husband recommends the lumberjack. Stay itself looks impressive and minimalist from the outside. Lobby is very chic,very modern with funky lights, tropical fish tanks and comfy sofas. Staff were polite and quick to help us check in or with anything else we needed. We had a queen room on the 2nd floor. Yes, it was small but how big a room do you need when all you are doing is sleeping in it? Plus, we both had big bags with us and there was ample room to store them (under the desk and in bottom of small wardrobe) and to store all our shopping bags without feeling like we were tripping over things. Bathroom was small but had a great walk in shower - we had no problems getting hot water and we used the shower at various times of the day. When i was told we had a room on the 2nd floor i was a bit worried as i had read the various reviews about noise from the nightclub below - i'd even packed us ear plugs as a precaution. We were directly above the bar/club(for some reason they count the ground floor as floor 1, which can get confusing in a lift) but i can honestly say that the noise never once disturbed us. Yes you can hear it but it's more the thud of the bass rather than actually being able to hear words of songs or music itself. We never once needed to use our ear plugs, we were so worn out that we were asleep before our heads hit our pillows and the background noise was so unobstrusive that it never once bothered us. The only thing about the room that was disturbing was that the smoke alarm flashes a white light every 30 seconds or so. It was disorientating the first night, but you can't see it when your eyes are shut and it was not bright enough to be truely disturbing. On our 2nd day we got back to the room to find that our air conditioning had broken. We reported it to reception and within 10 minutes an engineer appeared. It was something really simple to do with a tripped switch, he fixed it instantly but then checked all the unit just to make sure there was nothing else wrong. He was very thorough and pleasant. No more problems with it for the rest of our stay. Room was cleaned every day, clean linen and towels also. No problems like other people have mentioned.

It was our 14 year old's first time in New York. I bid on Priceline and got a good price. I called the hotel, and found though that this was only for one queen sized bed. The young lady I spoke with said that there was no problem and I could upgrade for $50 per night to get 2 doubles. This was great. On our arrival, I found that Priceline had called the hotel, and told them I only needed one bed. The hotel reasonably enough changed it back to one queen. The unfortunate thing was that they were now sold out of rooms with two beds. This was when I met a manager, I believe his name is Patrick (apologize if I've got it incorrect). I heard him on the telephone with Priceline, and he couldn't get an answer as to how this had happened. Obviously we were concerned. Patrick couldn't seem to get satisfaction from Priceline, but quickly found a way to make it right. This made a tough situation quite good. We were very pleased. Now, about the hotel. The location is about 30 paces to Broadway, Times Square, and all the shows. This is ideal for a tourist. Can't say enough. I hadn't flown into Newark in the past, so the day before we attended, I called, and spoke to Walter, the concierge. Can't say enough good things about him. He advised us to take the Coach USA bus from the airport to the Bus Terminal, which is about a 10 minute walk to the hotel. This was $70 round trip for all three of us. Its a good saving, because a lot of the cars or shutles where tolls and tips are extra. The hotel lobby is beautiful. It seems that several times a day they are cleaning it. The rooms were well kept, and the beds were new I think, and very comfortable. The are small as others have written, but we weren't going to play football there anyway. The washroom was fine, and in the morning there was lots of hot water. The Bose radio, and large screen TV are nice touches. There is a bar in the lobby, and I think my wife and I would have had a night cap there, but we were with the 14 year old on this trip, so that was not happening this time. Seemed nice enough though, and liked the music. There is a restaurant, that seemed a little pricey to me.... $16 for coffee and pastry etc, but there is a deli next store, and a good but cheap restaurant only two doors beyond that. We like to go to different places to eat anyway. Back to Walter, the concierge.... if you are there, take advantage of his knowledge, he'll send you to plays, and to great sights.

I went back upstairs furious and my husband and I laid in bed listening to the pounding music. 45 minutes later, I left a \"message\" for the hotel manager. Someone promptly called back and said they could move us and \"upgrade\" us to a king size room. Does anyone care at 1:30am if their room is \"king sized\". We moved and finally fell asleep.

A joke! I explained that staffing issues are not the customers problem, but the managements. This was met with apologies that seem to be so routine that they mean nothing... A hotel that does not check its online bookings because they have nobody to do it?? Any good hotel could have check us in quicker as a walk in! My advise to anyone looking to stay here- Yes its cheap, but you will be better paying a few extra buck to stay at the W just down the road. Or splurge and go for the Bryant park. Some advise to the Hotel- If you screw up a booking, don't make people wait an hour in your lobby when you could set them up in the bar with free drinks (standard in most good hotels).

Check-in went smoothly and I can't comment on the lobby staff other than that because we did not have any other contact with them. Understanding this is Manhattan and space is limited, the room was TINY. There was probably 8 inches from the end of the bed to the wall so you were better off climbing over the bed to get to the other side. 2 suitcases occupied half of all the available floor space. My husband and I are 5'10\" and 5'2\" and small framed and it was too tight for us to spend any time relaxing in the room. One person might fight it okay. If everything else is good, you could overlook the tight quarters but that was far from the case. If you are not an early riser or early to bed, be warned you will not have hot, or even warm water available to you. We noticed this the first night and it continued to prove itself true the entire trip. This is a REAL problem when you are traveling during the winter and just want a warm shower at the end of the day to help you thaw. Also, sleeping by the window was very uncomfortable because the window is probably original to the building. The silk curtains do nothing to stop the cold air from creating a freezing draft all night. Cleanliness: old does not turn me off but a few other things made me not want to think about what they did or did not do at the hotel. First of all, everything I picked up from the floor (bags, socks...) had long blonde hair sticking to it. Neither of us have long or blonde hair. The slate tiles in the bathroom had a good deal of white buildup but the while subway tiles and grout looked fine. But the basics of wiping the sink or mirror while you stayed were not attended to. Toiletries: Good thing I pack my own just in case. 1st day: We had shampoo, conditioner and body wash the first night. No bar soap to wash your hands with or lotion; but they did have 2 chocolates on the bed. 2nd day: they did not leave a new shampoo, conditioner or body wash but we did get a bar soap. No chocolates, no lotion. They took our used wash cloths and did not leave any new ones. 3rd day: A lotion finally and chocolates again but nothing else even though the toiletries were all used up. 4th day: New shampoo, conditioner and body wash finally. No lotion, no chocolates. 5th day: A bag of bar soaps left on the bed. Overall, no rhyme or reason. A few other notes: there was no iPod dock. The safe is the small standard kind they have everywhere-big enough for a wallet or two but definitely not your laptop. The internet was supposed to be included in the package I bought online but that was not honored. They wanted an additional $19.95/day. The lighting in the whole place is very dim-it sets a great mood but makes getting ready in the morning (putting on makeup) impossible. It was not a horrible experience.

The DJ spun top 40 hits and had the entire crowd singing and dancing. I highly recommend visiting Stay Hotel for your next trip to NYC.", "Date": "January 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "portugal", "Title": "\u201cNot so bad...\u201d", "Author": "PaulfromPortugal", "ReviewID": "UR23975664", "Content": "DATE:28/01/2009 Reviewer:A TripAdvisor Member, PORTUGAL Great location...

We arrived in Mid Jan for 5 nights. The hotel we selected was a good choice, I feel. On W47th street, in the diamond district, but just off Times Square. From the outside it is not much to look at. The street is pretty shabby, dirty, and of course, noisy. But inside, it is another story. It has a great lobby. Love the fish in the giant tanks! And of course, since it was January, there were few guests, so it was quick and easy to check in and out. Small issues to be mentioned include the very noisy intercom systems that the hotel staff use in the hallways on each floor. The sound of their talking via the system penetrates very easily through the door and can easily wake you. In fact, I would have to say that noise was the biggest issue I have with this hotel. Not that you can really blame them for it, since after all, ambulances make a lot of noise, and if you can hear street noise easily that is just to be expected. Even six floors up. What is NOT expected however, is to be able to hear and even feel the music coming from the hotel bar until the very small hours. Around 4 in the morning, to be precise! But even with these concerns, the staff were friendly, helpful and certainly helped to make our stay pleasant. The room was very nice, and we even got a free upgrade to a bigger room. All in all, I was pleased with the choice of hotel, and if I intended to visit New York again, I would most definately stay with Stay again. It is very centrally located, easy to find, and very good value. At least in January!", "Date": "January 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cStay within your budget at Stay\u201d", "Author": "orangekoi", "ReviewID": "UR23664796", "Content": "I do a fair amount of business travel for a company that is exceptionally cost-conscious. It is difficult to find decent lodging in NYC while staying within the travel budget allocated me, but i managed to do it, (and even with a dash of style!) at Stay. Upon entry, I found the lobby decor to be updated and very pleasing -- i like the aquariums in the seating area, which were a calming sight after the ruckus of the NY streets! The staff was limited and overworked when I arrived, but they were still gracious and accomodating, though obviously tired. I was able to get into my room at the unheard of hour of 11am, which was a huge bonus, as any business traveler knows. There are only 2 elevators at Stay, and both are quite small. It didn't prove to be an issue, but you will spend some time waiting for them. I liked the color scheme of the room (orange is a favorite!), and though the quarters were tight even in my \"Large\" room with a king-size bed (which is typical for NYC), the rate was just $220, which is exceptionally reasonable for the Times Square area of Manhattan. I found the bed to be very comfortable, with nice sheets and a fluffy duvet. It was great that there was an actual closet in the room, a large flat-screen tv on the wall, and the blackout shades on the windows were awesome. The hotel's updated phone system was also really nice because a digital touchscreen allowed you to set your own wakeup calls & such, and the tone of the alarm was actually pleasant to wake to. The bathroom isn't as tiny as in some hotels of this level I've stayed at, but it isn't grand by any stretch. There was only a shower, no tub, but the shower itself was spacious enough & its interior was updated with tiled walls and a slate floor that ran thru the entire bathroom. The hotel features L'Occitane products, which was also a nice little surprise. The issue i had with the bathroom is that there is a pedestal sink with no counter space, only a very tiny glass ledge beneath the mirror for your toiletries & \"stuff\" -- the sloped forward tank lid on the toilet didn't afford any more surface-area for toiletry items! However, everything was very clean, and there were extra towels in the bathroom, always a plus! Do note that if noise bothers you, you should definitely request a room on a higher floor -- Aspen is the very cool bar on the ground floor of the hotel that was surprisingly busy until at least 4am....and was also surprisingly loud in my 3rd floor room on my first night there! With earplugs in and the room's fan turned on high, i could still clearly hear a very methodical thump of bass and the music from the bar most of the night, which didn't bode well for getting any sleep. I requested a move the next day, which was very politely acommodated (i'm sure they get that a LOT...) and i then had no problems with noise in my new room on the 8th floor. All in all, I'd definitely stay at Stay again...it fit my budget yet didn't feel bare bones, old or dirty like many of the other hotels within this price range that I've stayed at in this area.", "Date": "January 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cNYC...Good Stay!\u201d", "Author": "Enigmablue", "ReviewID": "UR23338673", "Content": "We booked this ages ago for NYE in NYC solely based on price and location! Then i read the TA reviews and nearly changed our booking before we left Oz however i'm glad we didn't. We stayed 5 nights (27th Dec to 1st Jan) and after 5 weeks in other 4/5 star hotels elsewhere i thought it held its own. Yes it's all true...the small rooms, the slow lifts, the random housekeeping, the 'porno' hallway lighting but hey it's NYC and you don't come to this amazing city to dwell on the negatives of your hotel. It's a great location right on Times Sq, funky but expensive bar downstairs (every time we ordered 2 drinks it came to $20 no matter what we chose to drink), free net access, cool tv's, comfy but compact beds and some neat decor in the rooms. We stayed in room 915 and our frends in 921. 915 was a corner room with the luxury of a small hanging wardrobe which our mates were envious of!! They also were near the lift and it could be a little noisy. Renos on Floor 10 seem to have stopped for xmas but it looks like their nearly finished. If your extremely fussy, overweight, very tall, claustrophobic or just like to moan then don't stay here. It may not suit families and the oldies either given the pumping bar scene in the Aspen lounge. If you can get a good deal, like a comfy bed and want to be in the heart of NYC and all it has to offer then this is perfect for a short stay! Other NYC highlights....Juniors on 8th for Pancake Breakfast, walking to all the sights, Stay is near the start of the hop on-hop off bus tour and close to the subway.

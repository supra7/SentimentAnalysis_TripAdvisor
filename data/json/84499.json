Could not have asked for better service. We arrived pretty late, about 12am. Our room was still available, we checked in with no bother and had an amazing nights sleep. Room was huge, king size double bed, 2 bedside tables and 2 dressers. Huge bathroom, outstanding shower and bath combo. We booked a bus tour of LA the next day through the owners and instead of letting us walk, the owner gave us a ride to where the pickup point was. We were initially supposed to fly out around 11pm the following night; instead of carrying our bags round all day, we were allowed to leave them in the owner's living area. This was a great help. To cut a long story short, our tickets had been cancelled. After a quick phone call, we arrived back at 2am. No issues at all; shown back to our room and told we could stay as long as we needed to until our flight was sorted. Owners gave us directions on how to go and pick up our re-issued tickets. Really cannot recommend this hotel enough. Had the owners not been so accommodating, friendly and helpful, we would have been in serious difficulties.

Most hotels in Hollywood have parking but you have to pay and it\u2019s not on the premises. Entrance to parking lot was very narrow (only 1 car could barely get through) and there were only like 8 spots for the whole hotel. Check in was fast and easy. The room was very large and the internet (free) was fast. Room was very dim yet it had so many light switches scattered in the large room. The counters were very low and I had to keep going on my knees to look in the mirrors (I\u2019m 5\u20198 which is not that tall). My window had a lovely view of a wall a few inches from the building. The bathroom seemed new and clean but the water temperature was not stable. The TV reception was bad and NBC was completely out during the Olympics! Staff didn\u2019t have a solution for it. Luckily I had my DVR at home running or else I would have demanded my money back. Around 10:30pm a \u201clady\u201d was banging at a door demanding her \u201cthings\u201d from someone who refused to open the door. Staff tried to calm her down but she kept hitting the door and shouting crude things. By the looks of her she was a hooker. Staff called security/police to get her out but it took a long time before they were called. Staff also sunk to the woman\u2019s level by saying profanities which was very unprofessional. The room was very dark which was nice when trying to sleep. In the morning, the parking situation was horrible. People parked in places that were not spots and they blocked me, my boyfriend and others from moving their cars. My boyfriend and I are locals and we had to go to work that morning. Staff was too busy addressing complaining guests to help out with getting our cars out. After 15 mins of careful maneuvering I got my car out and had to lend my car to my boyfriend so he could get to work on time after dropping me off. We had to race back to the hotel to get his car during our lunch (staff was nice enough to allow his car not to be towed during this time). We had a good time on this memorable Valentine\u2019s Day night despite the hotel.

I have to say for the first time in my life I was really scared. When we arrived to the Star Inn, the place looked really dodgy, the doors to the street n backyard were fully open. When we were checking in, a shemale walked in and asked us for money. Every single time we walked in or out both of the doors were open and we didn't see the staff anywhere. So basically anyone can walk in. The rooms were big but dim. I can't tell were they clean since I couldn't see there properly. One night a horrible screaming n shouting woke us up. A woman or shemale screamed and their room phone kept ringing. We were awake listening that almost an hour before security came. Soon LAPD arrived and then they started to discuss about the situation in the hallway. I still don't know what was that all about. That was the most horrible hotel/motel I've ever stayed in.

The hotel is cheap and I have seen worse area's of LA but I did feel quite unsafe while staying there mainly due to some of the dodgy looking guests. The front and back entrace to the hotel/motel are left wide open meaning anyone could walk in if and when they wanted to and the desk isn't manned 24hrs so the rooms are quite exposed. My friend and I ended up putting our suitcases across the door at night when we went to bed for extra security. The room itself was large enough and the cleanliness was okay, my one gripe was the sheet was too small for the bed so you would end up having the bare mattress underneath you during the night which was pretty gross. One a positive the location of the hotel is not too bad, close to Universal, Hollywood Bowl and so on. It also has a free car park at the back. I think if you are maybe a guy or a group of males not wanting to spend much then this would be okay for you but I really wouldn't recommend it to females staying on their own or anyone with kids.

The location is pretty close to the Hollywood/Highland Center if you don\u00b4t mind to take the metro for 2 stations for only $1.50. Of course you can walk there, if you like to, we did so as well (BUT just ONCE!) The are where the hotel is located is not the best one, but definetly not the worst. We hadn\u00b4t had a weird feeling somewhere around, there are homeless people...like everywhere in the city. So actually it was nice and we liked it, because we didn\u00b4t expect too much for what we paid for a room of this size. The only fact I didn\u00b4t like was the guy of the reception... maybe I do him wrong and he had just a few bad days... but he hardly said a word the whole time, nothing to mention about the expression in his face... nothing to feel very welcome.

This hotel fit the bill and more. Specific points worth mentioning: Parking--I was grateful for free parking near all the major Hollywood landmarks (some would call it a hike, but I like walking). I planned to stay in Hollywood until 4PM the afternoon of the day I checked out and asked the clerk if I could leave my car at the hotel. She just asked me how long and said 'no problem.' The room--Could have used some sprucing up, but it was clean and I was thrilled to have a refrigerator. The bathroom--WOW. It had obviously been redone very recently and was absolutely spotless and beautiful. It didn't even seem to fit the style of the hotel. Major points for this. The location--the Hollywood sights were several blocks away (walking distance for me) so some might not like that. There are tons of fastfood restaurants around the hotel (including a Denny's).

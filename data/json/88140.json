If you do not bring your own computer they have one in the lobby for guest use to check e-mails etc... You are close to Carabba's and Texas Roadhouse and a few other restaurants.

Generally she was rude, with short answers to our questions, including why we were forced to stay in a smoking room when both me and my fiance overheard her talking to her co-worker about all these non-smoking rooms that were available, but \"not to us.\" Road weary, we decided to just accept the smoky stinky room and called it a night. I tried to complain the next morning, but since a manager wasn't on duty (big surprise), we got nowhere. In addition, my credit card wasn't charged for the room until December, even though we stayed in June.

I asked the front desk staff if the AC was broken, but she said it's never air conditioned in those areas.

There is also an outdoor pool -- that we thought should have been cleaned and ready for guest use given the extremely hot temps and the fact that it was Memorial Day weekend!

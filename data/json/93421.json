The room we were given on the 7th floor west wing was incredibly shabby, possibly clean but hard to tell. There may have been mold on the ceiling, but the room was so dingy that I can't be sure. After that first night, we checked out at the desk, checked back in (insisting on a different room), and landed on the 9th floor east wing. The room had been freshly painted, there was daylight coming in the wondow, and while not rising above the basics (no lamp, just an overhead light, no washcloths, no hairdryer unless you borrow one from the desk) it was clean and comfortable with a modern and clean bathroom. We had hot water in the shower every time, though a few times it took about 15 minutes to get warm. We're academics on a budget, and staying at the Carter for 5 nights freed up more than half a grand for theater tickets and nice restaurants, compared to what even a chain \"budget\" hotel goes for in Times Square. We would rather pack a washcloth and forego a few amenities in order to be as close to everything as the Carter is. The hotel is a block from both the 42nd St. Subway station to the east and the Port Authority station to the west, so virtually every place in the city is accessible from the hotel. For example, one day we left the hotel at 11:30, took the subway to Brooklyn, ate pizza at Grimaldi's and walked back across the Brooklyn Bridge, then took a subway back to Times Square and were back at the hotel at 2:15. Add in the 42nd St. bus to take you to Grand Central, the U.N. or the NYC library, and there's no where you can't get to easily from the Carter. Although the desk staff seems abrupt, the housekeeping staff is helpful, and even left a sweet note saying \"enjoy your stay\" handwritten on a scrap of notebook paper. They only clean each room every other day, but left us 6-7 towels (but, again, no washcloths!) so we had plenty of clean ones. I would stay there again, and will ask for our room, #932, or a similar one.

Finally they understood we had booked for one week and not only for one night... We got a cardkey on the 17th floor. Room 1700. The rooms are not big. Two separate beds, a TV (without remote and about 7 channels) a closet, a bathroom. Everything was fairly clean. We saw no insects or bugs during the whole stay. We had hot and cold water. The AC was working fine and it was the newest thing in the room. We had no waterboiler sponsored by the hotel in the room so we just went to a hardware store on 23rd Street and bought an immersion heater which we used the whole week for boiling coffee water in the small room. We had brought our favorite Swedish brand of instant coffee with us, not taking chances thar far... So we had breakfast in our room every morning. Two blocks from the hotel on the same street is Food Emporium, with lots of good food for reasonable prices, and just a few minutes from the hotel you have a Walgreen\u00c2\u00b4s store... one pint of their chocolate icecream just $1,79! I do recommend the subway, and most of all the 7 day prepaid card, which gives free rides on all subway trains and buses. It's very easy getting to know the system if you have a map.

Bare necessities covered.\u201d", "Author": "travlinhix", "ReviewID": "UR120440875", "Content": "I read alot of reviews on Trip Advisor before booking this hotel, and admit to being skiddish on my arrival, so lets begin with the GOOD POINTS FIRST. The location is less than 1/2 block from the EPICENTER of Times Square (smack dab between 8th Ave and 7th Ave). I booked the room for two nights ($99 per night) which you will NOT FIND for this location anywhere in Times Square. The room had a private bath (in my research the cheap hotels were not this close to T.S. and had shared baths with neighbors). Water pressure is the best I've ever experienced (like at home) and the water was perfect temperature (hot). There was soap and shampoo/conditioner and towels in room (to debunk another review that stated it was non-existent). The hotel is currently under much needed repairs and renovations, so at least they are trying. A tour-bus desk is located in the lobby where we purchased an awesome hop on-hop off package thru Grayline Bus Company (Sooo worth it!). You can store your luggage in a secured closet for $2 bag if you arrive early or want to sight see after checkout. Visible security guards at all times in the Lobby near elevators. I did not see one homeless person hanging out in lobby like some reviewers wrote. The 24 hour coffee shop attached to lobby has great coffee and is not expensive. NOW FOR THE NOT SO GOOD: Our room was not cleaned after the first night BUT was clean upon arrival. The front desk informed us later that they only clean/service rooms AFTER the second night of your stay. We had to fetch new towels. The front desk not overly pleasant nor offensive, more like processing cattle, but if you ask for extra towels or blankets (which you will), they will hand it to you at the front desk, but you will have to pick it up. I never got the extra pillow that he said he would send up to my room. Oh well. Only thing new was the carpet. The room was NOT FILTHY like alot of reviewers stated. I think people perceive it as filthy because its not modernized nor was ever updated or decently repaired and the room is ABSENT of ANY decor including pictures. The sheets WERE CLEAN, but thin and worn. Bedspread and blanket really thin for the cold months (sleep in long underwear). TV worked but no remote. Hodge podge furniture made room seem it was assembled from a thrift store clearance sale but the King bed matress was comfortable enough (no pillowtop but comfy). Bathroom tiles seemed like they were haphazardly resecured. The three windows we had faced blank cinderblock walls of another building. No central air (window units) BUT the radiators keep chill out of room. The \"once upon a time\" medicine wall cabinet over the sink was missing the mirrored door so it was converted into a shelf, but there is a mirror sealed inside the bathroom door. The ever winding corridor was very creepy to walk through but quiet. I didn't see any Americans staying there (all Foreign guests). Did not see one roach or rodent. No coffee pot or clock in room. No shade or cover on the converted upside down table lamp that was used as the main room light fixture. CONCLUSION: This is the perfect hotel for the PRICE AND LOCATION! The room was clean but VERY unattractive! Having your own bathroom for this price is a plus! I felt secure although the hallways felt creepy, but it was actually safe (awakend repressed horror movies). If you can get past the ugly, and just think of it as a quiet place to sleep and shower, within a few steps to the magnificent, majestic Times Square! I'm sure the foreigners have seen worse, so its probably considered a 4 star hotel in a third world country? I have stayed in all types of hotels (from Marriotts to the Days Inn). I'd rank this one below a Knight's Inn for room condition BUT rank it a 10 for the location. REMEMBER what you are going to NYC for...to hang out in the city and NOT in your room! Save your money to eat in a nice restauarant, which will be your hardest choice because they are ALL soooo good! And YES, I would stay there again (for the same price). Other hotels in vicinity started at $300 a night. I took that extra $200 a night and spent it on great food, gifts, and sights! You MUST have an open mind to stay here.

That's when I also noticed that most really bad reviews were from quite some time ago and the newer they were the better they got. Upon arrival we noticed that the hotel apparently is taking some time and money to renovate the entrance and lobby and although it was a little bit of a mess, the staff apologized first thing and we honestly didn't care, since the renovation did not seem to involve any major, noisy structural work. We asked for the best room they could offer and a nice staff member took our suitcases and took us upstairs to the fourth floor. He entered first, and probably because of all the bad reviews, checked everything. He turned on the light and TV and doublechecked if everything was clean. My friend was a little shocked that they aparently had to doublecheck if the cleaners did their job, but honestly - I prefer him checking than us finding a mess, right?! The room itself was small (but hey, it's New York - people here live in apartements that are smaller than my closet back home!) but nice and clean. The nightstand was broken (but if you come to New York to have nice furniture stay at the Waldorf) and the TV was so nostalgic! All wooden and with a terrible sound - but then again, if you want to stay in your room you might want to splurge a little and stay somewhere else. The bathroom seemed to be newly renovated - it had new tiles everywhere and the faucets seemed to have been replaced not too long ago. The bathroom is always my major concern and I wasn't disappointed. The beds were REALLY comfy (no kidding here - they must have bought new mattresses!) and the sheets were older, but clean. Adding all this to the perfect location - Times Square is only one Block away, you have cheap dining on the next street and public transit available on every corner - to me this was the perfect budget place! The only thing you might want to consider is that you are staying in Manhattan (also see location!) and that a) there is a lot going on outside and b) people in the hotel are coming and going at all times. It was quite noisy at night but since I know that I'm a light sleeper I always take earplugs with me - easiest problem of them all: solved. I stayed for 3 days with a friend in the City and we stayed outside pretty much all day only to come back at night, take a shower and crash.

Yes clearly it isnt the most modern or luxurious of hotels but come on! You're in New York City, Times Square to be exact!!!! After i had read al of the reviews, my stomach was literally in knots from the airport to the hotel, i felt a bit sick walking into the hotel from fear of what i had read.... I had NOTHING to worry about. Seriously! And this is coming from a girl who stays in 5* hotels whenever i go away.. Once we had got in the hotel you can tell its a bit old and slightly grubby looking but we stayed open minded! We checked in within 5 mins and were on the 21st floor, room 2100. The lift looks a bit old and dodgy but it was fine and very quick. Our room was not one of the renovated ones but the room was clean, the bed had fresh sheets and was very big and comfy. The bathroom was clean and we had clean towels, shower bits and toilet roll. If you are expecting something like the plaza, then go to the Plaza! Personally i was in New York to explore and Hotel Carter was the perfect place to rest my head. This hotel did in NO WAY put a downer on our trip, i would stay here 10 times more. Seriously, its the perfect location!!! We did everything we wanted to because of this fantastic location, and we booked a show and a few excursions through the hotel and they were great. Honestly, i usually have very HIGH standards but like i said, YOU'RE IN NEW YORK!!!!!!! NEW YORK GUYS!! Just suck it up and go! Make your own decision when you get there!!!

Yeah its the best price near Times Square. If you want classy and lots of extras go pay 5 times the price somewhere else. If all you do is use the hotel for sleeping this is the place. Ok let me list the good things about the hotel: Times square is a 2 minute walk. Subway is a 2 minute walk. STARBUCKS is around the corner. If you want cheaper coffee McDonalds is right next to starbucks. If you want really weak coffee, use the little coffee shop right next to the hotel. Taxis are easy to get here. If you need pizza late at night theres a killer place across the street from starbucks. Restaurant Row is a 8 minute walk from the hotel. Taxi from LGA airport is around 25 bucks. The TV in the room had 5 channels all in english. 3G works great in the room for your cellphone but sucky in the lobby. There were no bugs, roaches or flies in the room. Beds were comfortable as far as I remember. Was basically in a coma every night coming back from town. Bars, pubs and restaurants were all over the place. Killer breakfast place 5 minutes walk over on 9th ave. If you have a late flight, the hotel will hold your bags for 2 bucks a bag. Comes in very handy so you can check out and then go back out till you need to leave. Now the not so good things: Internet is 5 bucks for 30 minutes. (not really a bad thing unless you think everything should be free and paid for by the government.) Room is just like a motel 6. Get the picture? Street noise can be loud at night unless you been to the bars. Then for some reason you dont hear anything. On the fence things: Strip bar a short distance down the street. No shady people walking around, just they have sushi and that made us laugh everytime we saw it. Hotel IS remodeling, so sometimes its a little messy. Not really a bad thing. Dont expect \"plush\" to fit in anywhere after the remodel. Things you might have read in other reviews: Elevators, there are 3 of them and they work and are not slow. But if 300 people are checking out at the same time, what the heck do you expect? Check-in people are friendly, if you have an attitude with them good luck, youre in NYC who do you think is going to win? Yes there is no breakfast in the hotel (you would not want it anyway) Bedbugs, never saw one. Air conditioning, small unit in window, worked fine and it was 80 outside. Beds were clean. If you want new towels put the old ones outside your door in the morning, or exchange them downstairs. Hot water, there were 4 of us, no problem. Shower will not fit 4.

I would typically rather pay the extra money to stay at a better place, but the price here was just so astronomically low for New York, let alone the location, that I figured why not just suck it up and deal with the downsides for one weekend. After all, I knew my friends and I would barely be at the hotel anyway. The first red flag was when I called to confirm the reservation and subsequently again to ask about parking, and both times I had to call multiple times because the phone just kept ringing, and both times I got a different person on the phone who was rude and acted confused as to why I would care to confirm a reservation or, even worse, find out where to park nearby. When we first arrived, Carter was about what we expected. It was old and ratty with a funky smell in the lobby, and sketchy front desk guys checked me in while simultaneously attempting to flirt (which I went along with in hopes of getting one of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms we had read about in the reviews). As I checked us in, a woman went up to the reception desk complaining about filthy sheets in her room. This made me nervous, but I tried to remain optimistic. We took the elevator up (also old and ratty with a funky smell) to the wrong floor at first \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the 15th floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and we were horrified. The hallway reeked and was very dark, with some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strange\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd people just wandering around. It felt extremely unsafe, We got back in the elevator and went to the correct floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the 5th \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and felt relieved that the hallway didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t smell that bad, it was much brighter and definitely cleaner, and there were no hallway creepers. Our room offered an equal amount of relief. It was moderately clean (even the sheets!), didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an odor, and seemed just fine for our purposes of sleeping and showering\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 until we saw the bathroom. The wall and ceiling were covered in thick, disgusting black mold. The shower curtain also had mold on it. The water in the sink and shower had such a strange smell that made me wonder what was going on in those pipes and whether taking showers there actually made me clean. There was a rack above the sink which held the towels, and because they were touching the wall the towels also had mold on them. I began to look around the room and noticed several portions of the wall, particularly the wall on the other side of the bathroom, had bulging bumps that looked like potential water damage. I smelled a hint of fresh paint and began to think maybe there was much MORE black mold in the room that had been recently painted over. Sickening. So, as the title of this review states, I was really hoping not to be yet another person giving this place a terrible rating. I knew the pros and cons going in and wanted to rate it fairly based upon the rule of getting what you pay for. But, really \u00e2\u20ac\u201c black mold?! Has the board of health just completely given up on this place? Honestly, I think I would have preferred the blood stains on the wall that I read about in some of the other reviews. In short, yes, it is cheap. It is in an amazing location. The staff, although weird and a little creepy, was nice enough (they did only charge us for a 3 person room even though they knew there were 4 of us, saving us $20 per night). But you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re taking a gamble when you stay here because you really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what kind of room you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to end up in.

Inside, we were met by marble walls, heavily patterned carpets and flurescent lighting (so cheesy!) but we were quickly checked in and headed up to our room on the 17th floor. There is a concierge desk, where you can book theatre tickets, a shuttle to the 3 airports and get info on pretty much anything, in the lobby (aswell as computers with internet access - small fees apply - and vending machines.) The lifts are old but in good working order (if a little small for the amount of guests the hotel can obviously accomodate). We got to our room and an instant feeling of relief and happines flooded over us! Lovely clean white beds, air conditioning, a private bathroom (old fixtures and fittings, but clean and tidy) and a big built-in wardrobe.

We were both a little nervous about this place after reading some of the reviews people wrote about this place. When you first walk into the lobby you can automatically tell the building is extremely old and has never been completely renovated. Literally everything from the carpeting, to the front desk, to the elevator doors are old and weathered. Check in was quick and easy and we didn't have any problems with our reservation. When we got up to our room however, our key cards didn't work and we could not get into the room. So I went back down stairs and informed the front desk of the problem. The gentleman working the front desk tried to activate the cards again but when I got back up to our 7th floor room they still didn't work so I had to go back down. I was a little frustrated at this point but I remained polite and the front desk called the manager, his name was Minh, he was very polite and helpful and he immediately came up to our room and took care of the problem. When we entered the room it was FAR from fancy but after a quick inspection we found no signs of bed bugs, no mice or rats, and no trash or dirt. The mattress had a clean mattress cover on it, and the sheets and the bedspread were clean as well. Our room was small. It had just enough room for the bed, a desk, nightstand, and a TV stand. The furniture was extremely old and beat up and had graffiti in it but served it's purpose. Our room also had a small closet, which came in handy for my wife. The tile on the bathroom floor was clean, the sink and the shower were clean, and we had what looked to be a brand new toilet, which was also clean. You can tell the bathroom had been thoroughly scrubbed down before our arrival. We had 3 clean towels, but no wash cloths. Just a word of advice.. If you stay in this hotel bring your own towels and wash cloths, or hang your towels after using them because they won't bring clean ones to your room unless you go to the front desk and ask them for clean ones. It would also be a good idea to bring a trash bag or two because they don't clean the room during your stay either. The walls in our room had no artwork or anything on it, which was no big deal to us. They had what looked to be a fresh coat of a lavender colored paint, and the ceiling was white. The room was very small and plain, but that was ok with us, it served it's purpose. The carpeting in the room was very old and worn out but it was vacuumed clean. The door to the room was sturdy and had 3 different locks on it so we felt safe. Just don't plan on watching much TV because we only got 3 channels. Two of them were news channels an the other one was cartoon network. We didn't spend much time in the room during our stay anyway. We were out Times Square most of the time. The location and the price of this hotel can't be beat. You are literally a half block a way from Times Square, and everything is within walking distance. Fine restaurants, theaters, shopping, night clubs.. Anything you could want in NY is a short walk away. All the people that posted reviews and said this hotel is a nightmare are wrong. It's clean, and there were no bed bugs or rats!! I think people take the fact that it's an extremely old building and associate that with being dirty. We had no problems with this hotel and would definitely stay here again. For 99 dollars a night you can't beat this hotel. Anywhere else in Times Square you'll be paying 300 bucks a night if not more.

Now I and my family have a lot of experience in Traveling. We own 2 hostels for backpackers and we have been many times in NY before so I do think we have a reasonable enough experience to be able to judge a place. We have also invited my wife's sister, who lives in Louisiana to come join us for a couple of days in NY. It as actually her who saw the reviews and said that no way she was going to stay in this hotel. Instead, she invited us to the Marriot marquise, that is also right on times square only 3 blocks from Carter hotel, for 2 nights. It's a $400-$500 a night hotel. So after sleeping 2 nights in a 5 star hotel we dreadfully packed our backpacks and moved to the Carter hotel. The truth is, if I had to choose between the 2 hotels i think I would still prefer the Carter hotel as the value for money ratio is much higher than the Marriot. Yes, of course staying on the 44th floor was nice, and yes, the rooms are cleaner and they have good room service but i enjoyed the beds in the Carter better. For $100 a night, in NY AND in times square this hotel is a bargain!!!!!! The people in the reception were very helpful especially one bearded guy that I don't know his name. The bed sheets were 100% clean, so was the bathroom. They only thing that could have made it an almost perfect stay is that if they vacuumed the carpets more often. As the guy who wrote a review before me said, all those who complained in previous reviews are either serial complainers or they simply are used for much more luxury hotels and for $100 want to receive same quality and service as a $500 hotel. You get what you pay for and even more in this hotel. I can sincerely say that we have finally found our place to stay for future trips to my favorite city in the world!!!!", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harlow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cKeep an open mind - don't let the bad reviews put you off!\u201d", "Author": "angie190784", "ReviewID": "UR112318949", "Content": "Like others, I too was very aprehensive about arriving at this hotel! The first pleasant surprise was the great location - literally a stone's throw from Times Square - I fully expected that to be the end of the good news. However, walking into the hotel and straight up to the front desk to check in with no problem was one hurdle overcome. Some reviews mentioned queing for hours on end but I can honestly say that during my 3 night stay I never saw more than 3 people waiting to be served. Sure, the foyer area of the hotel looks a little tired but you have to take into consideration the age of the hotel and of course how the price reflects this. We were allocated a room on the forth floor (409) and was relieved when stepping out of the elevator to be faced with a smell of recently painted walls - no other horrors. It was at this point I began to relax. The room itself had a new bed, fresh CLEAN sheets, a working A/C unit and NEW curtains. Admittedly the carpet left a little to be desired but as my main concern was the condition of the bed I breathed a sigh of relief! The bathroom was very clean, we had clean towels and complimentary soap too. I wouldn't go as far as to say that the water was piping hot but it was more than comfortable to take a shower under. It didn't take too long to discover that the hot and cold taps on the hand basin were switched (ie the cold tap was hot and the hot tap was cold) so that was that mystery solved! I felt comfortable that I wouldn't get trapped in the bathroom in the event of the handle coming off in my hand - this was purely because no handle existed!! It did however possess a chain to put across if you wanted a little privacy. I did nearly fall off my chair on day 3 when we returned to the room to find new bedding and towels had been delivered. Therefore, it appears that maid service does exist in the hotel. The staff were nothing but friendly and I can honestly say that I encountered no problems during my stay. You just have to keep in mind that it's an old hotel and you're not paying top dollar to stay there so you should forgive the outdated fixtures and some decay. I would even go as far as to say that I would definitely go back, even if it's just for the great location. I might however request room 409 to be on the safe side! It makes me wonder that if more people could be bothered to write good reviews then maybe this hotel's reputation wouldn't be quite so bad.

There was an ample sized wardrobe, a dressing table, an old tv and nothing else. The bedding was clean, as was the bathroom. A maid came in on one of our days and just straightened up the sheets on the bed, and replaced the dirty towels. Both me and my friend got bitten during the holiday, but we couldn't tell if this had happened in the hotel or outside. On the last day I looked under the bed to check I hadn't left anything and saw two rat traps under there, I was thankful at that point that I was going home! At the end of the day I would recommend this hotel because if you're going to New York for a tourist holiday you're rarely in the room.

Sure it's cheap, at $100 per night, for Time's Square but is it too much to ask for the room to be clean?

The hotel being the age it is there could very well be asbestos in the walls. I wouldn't be surprised if some of it was exposed. The tub was full of hair that wasn't mine, I found a big crawling around on the floor in the washroom, and there was a used condom under the bed. Can't forget about the dirty sheets and towels that weren't soft (this last point being minor). See pictures attached at the end of this review. I talked to \"front staff\" about all this and what they said was I could switch rooms, leave early and get one night refund (still had 2 remaining), or have it cleaned. I was going to switch rooms when housekeeping came by to supposedly clean the room. Well they changed the sheets (which had black stains, like grease on them), got rid of the condom, and changed the towels. What didn't get cleaned was the hair in the tub - which I thought was judging by the smell of cleaning chemicals in the washroom. I didn't realize till later the tub hadn't been fully cleaned and by then I wasn't going to be there much longer so worked around it.

After booking this hotel through hotels.com we stumbled across a youtube video of this hotel- we were pettrified. We were going to cancel but we're talked out of it because everyone's expectations are different, besides we weren't planning on staying in the hotel we wanted to see the city. So we called the hotel directly and asked if it was safe for 4 females to stay here safely because the reviews were awful. He told us that yes it was safe, they have security, it's clean and when he first took the job he saw the reviews too and was scared but assured us that the reviews were false and it was clean and safe just outdated. We called again and said we would be checking in late and would that be a problem- we were told no. So we show up at the hotel at 12:30am to a huge line in the lobby and there was 1 person \"working\". Everyone was waiting patiently and then everyone started getting grumpier and grumpier and we had no idea why. I was actually getting frustrated with the people in front of me who wasn't letting the man do his job. Well then everyone started whispering about what was going on. we waited in the line up for 4.5hrs. The hotel had actually over sold the rooms and left approx 50 people without rooms. People checked in at 2pm and was told their room wasn't ready and to come back and when they did they were put on stand by. People had been literally waiting all day for a room that they had already paid for but didn't have a place to lay their head. We found out that if you don't check in by 8pm they start selling off your rooms to people that walk in. I walked down the street to another hotel and they weren't shocked in the least that this had happened because apparently it's common. We were fortunate that we only wasted 5 hours of our time trying to figure out what we were going to do, however there were people who waited hours and hours. We had about 10 officers called to mediate the situation. It is expensive to stay in NYC and this allowed us to do it on a budget however when you think you're spending a $100/night and then are forced to choose between being homeless for your stay or figuring out how you're going to afford $449/night it leaves a sour taste in your mouth. I didn't get a chance to see the room because they sold ours to someone else, however the lobby was filthy. I had an opportunity to hear some of the guests reviews who actually had a room and they were not favourable. My suggestion is if you do book this hotel- do not directly book it with the hotel itself but through a third party because they will honour your stay.

The floor was all covered with an old and dirty carpet. There was also a walk-in closet that we decided to leave closed because of its musty odor, plus, the ceiling was falling apart. The bed was big and comfortable and the bed sheets clean. The bathroom had a strong musty odor with an oxidized bath and very old structure coming apart. The towels were very used and kind of dirty (they didn't change them during our stay) and there was not gel/shampoo.

The first room I was in was not two bad but as with alot of old hotels the door to the bathroom no longer closed and unfortunately the bath was so dirty I went out and bought cleaner for it! However, the hotel itself is in one of the best locations in New York, literally walk out the front door turn right and within 2 minutes your on Times Square. At the prices they charge you can't get anything better. Over the years I have heard horror storys about the carter but to be honest you just have to use common sense. If your a single traveller and have a fancy laptop don't go and sit in the lounge using it at 1am and then return to your room the next time you go out chances are it wont be there when you get back. Also don't wave the fact you've just got paid around, all of this is pretty much common sence but as alot of the people staying at the carter are young and have just finished working at Summer camps (in August and September of course) they don't usually use common sence!

You don't see much of the staff but they tend to be friendly and helpful as long as your polite to them (except one checkin lady who seems to be ready to flip for no reason). Again use common sence if you start shouting straight away they won't help but be polite and they can be very accomodating.

In addition to that, the stains in the bathroom tub/toilet, no toilet paper, no light fixtures over the lights, wet urine stains on the carpet, small animal droppings, and the AC was in the window but there was no outlet to plug it into, anywhere! So, I guess the AC was just for show?

Went Thanksgiving Day parade. Friends who are frequent travelers to NY were staying there and had stayed there before. Traveled with 17 and 20 year old children. The hotel was dirty, the floor in our room was filthy-no way would I go barefoot. Sheets were clean but we discarded bedspreads. TV was lousy. No amenities like fridge. Shower was clean, really old; good hot water. Last night the weather turned cold and we almost froze in the room - we were too tired to request another room. I'm really obsessed with getting good hotel rooms (my kids couldn't believe I stayed here) but we had a blast staying there and still laugh about it. I tried to think of it as urban camping because I felt a big grungy but sightseeing around the city sort makes you feel that way anyway. Just gave us one of those lifetime experiences. It was awesome to walk less than half a block to be front line at the parade and rest of Times Sq. My son went back New Year's but it was booked so he got place in Secaucus and he really enjoyed the better hotel.. It was just a fun NY experience and I felt safe. NO WAY would I stay there with smaller children-in fact, we didn't see any children, but lots of foreign travelers. Don't expect much anything other than a place to crash here but we loved spending our $$ in the city instead of on a room. Our friends said they had signs of a mouse but we saw no evidence of rodents or any bugs. Desk staff was friendly. I plan another visit this Fall to NYC. Will I stay here again? Probably not- I plan to stay in another district and I feel I can afford more on a room, but if the price at the Carter is drastically better, I wouldn't discount that I'd try it again. And, the garage across the street was $30/night - expensive but certainly not by NY standards. We only did that one night and then parked at Secaucus which has the cheapest train rates in/out of the city that we found-and the shortest route. Would I recommend Carter? I just say be aware that you're going really budget and see if you think you can live with that. Sleep, shower and sightsee. I've stayed in worse hotels that were rated higher.

It had the parlor's name and logo all over it... Every room has a window AC unit so in the summer you can keep your room fairly cool. The downside to this ... it keeps your room cool in the winter too because the window isn't shut all the way, and the unit doesn't fully fit in the window.

Tip: get a 1-day or 7-day unlimited pass Hotel staff -- friendly/helpful, offered to have towels delivered to our room, doormen always gave us good directions Clean and secure -- clean sheets and towels (see note regarding towel service below), 3 manual locks on room door; main lobby door is locked after a certain time but there is always a doorman to let guests in Con's: Old hotel -- in much need of restoration/renovation, old furniture/fixtures, bathroom door did not close completely; however, some rooms seems to have had a recent facelift such as a new stone bathroom floor and new curtains Large hotel with minimum hotel staff -- translation=some areas may not be cleaned on a regular basis, dusty carpet and closet in room, lobby is more like a college dorm lobby Noise -- windows and walls are thin -- You can hear the city noises from outside; also, we could hear people in the hallway easily, but luckily everyone on our floor was considerate and relatively quiet.

Ofcourse this wasn't a 5 star hotel, but for this prize and location I certainly will return to Hotel Carter again next year. They were in the middle of a big renovation, and I think it will be a 2 star hotel soon. I recommend this hotel for backpackers/lone travelers and young couples. One last comment. To all the people who wrote bad reviews about Hotel Carter; who are you guys anyway? Are you all born with a silver spoon in your mouths? Go to a beach motel in Tel Aviv. Share a dorm with 20 other smelly backpackers on a dirty matras on the floor, with only one toilet without a seat or toiletpaper.

Ok, the carpet on the stairs leading to the lobby could be cleaner and there was one brick off but the staff at the recpetion was very efficient and friendly. The guy who took up my luggage explained me how to do if there should be a problem getting warm water in the shower but during my whole stay of 4 nights I had no problem at all with warm water and I did not see this famous brown water which you see on some photos of the reviews. The pression of the water was great (18th floor) and the water so hot that it could wake up a dead man in the morning. The flush in the toilet was perfect, too. The linen of the bed was clean as well as the towels. The bed was comfortable. I appreciated the honesty of the Hotel management, unlike the big 5 stars hotels which appeal to your sense for the protection of the environment and saving the planet and make you feel bad and guilty if you want fresh towels every day, the CARTER chose to make up the rooms only every second day which is great because you don't have to clear away your belongings every day before the show up of the cleaning crew:) After the second night my bed linen was changed and this without any special request from me. The room was spacy (1823 on the 18th floor) ok, the wallpaper and the painting was a bit poor and somewhat peeling, there were some tiles missing in the bathroom, but, hey folks , do you go to New York to explore the city or to scrutinize hotel rooms? About safety: during my first night there was fire alarm ( wrong alarm as so often) but the NYFD was there in less than 5 minutes. They have 8 working computers and a printer in the lobby, you can have an internet session of 30 minutes for 5 $, but if you connect for the second time, the internet provider asks you to do a little review which takes not more than 2 minutes and by doing it you get 30 minutes for free which is a great thing. The staff of the information desk is very effeicient, they helped us to find a rental car provider int the surroundings of the hotel in less than 5 minutes and the reservation was made by phone. The hotel has no private parking but just on the other side of the street is a public parking with a flatrate 35 $ per 24 hours. One of the big plus points of the CARTER is this little store on the ground, open 24/7 run by very friendly Egyptians, you can have everything you like at any time of the day and the night, cold and hot drinks, cold and hot meals, bagels, danish, fruit, newspapers, they even do sandwiches on your request with whatever you like on it, the guys are great, it was a pleasure to talk to them, after the second time you come in, they welcome you as if you had ever been there, hard working men but feeling visibly good in this cosmopolitan hotel. The location is great, the CARTER is situated in the very HEART of New York City, you leave the hotel, turn right and in about 50 seconds you are at the Hard Rock Cafe, for those who don't know New York, the HRC is located on Times Square just the other side of the NYPD. The underground station Times Square is within a 2 minutes walk And the price!!!! 99 $ per night, each room , no matter if you stay alone or at 2 or 3 or more, I paid less for the 4 nights than I paid in August for ONE single night in one of the 5 stars Hotels located on Times Square. So hello you open minded people who go to New York to explore the City of lights and spire, you who just need a comfortable clean bed to sleep in and a powerful shower in the morning to wake up, you who don't want to spend a fortune for a hotel but more for all those wonderful things you find in New York, don't hesitate and choose the CARTER. Staying at the Carter makes you feel young again and reminds you of the good all travelling times by Interail:) To put you into the mood, go to youtube but only watch 2 videos, the one with Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue in the background and the one from that drunk man in this wonderful blue wallpaper room and you will only have one wish: going there and find out . If ever you should feel lonely and want to fight your sadness in the company of bugs and coackroaches, don't count on them I did not meet one single one neither in my room nor in the lobby. There was no dead body under my bed, so maybe the story about the Murder Hotel might as well be an urban legend! One tip:it seems as if there were big differences between the 700 rooms, so insist as I did to have a renoveated room and if you are not satisfied with the room they give you, ask for another one. They told me they were trying very hard to renovate the hotel, but even God did not create the world in one day, did he!

So I went downstairs to complain, and the guy at reception was more than happy to offer me another room. In fact, he gave me keys to a few rooms and said that I can choose which ever one I prefered. The room we moved into was a lot better than the previous one. Except, the carpet was still grubby. Also, I'm sure I got bitten a few times in the night- must have been the bed covers. The lobby area feels a bit shady, but we literally used the hotel just to sleep and shower. TV didnt work properly either, but wasn't too fussed about that. There's also a 24hr snack shop inside the hotel which is quite handy for bottles of water, etc. The location is excellent - less than a minute walk from the lights of Braodway. For the price we paid, it definately is worth it, but again, it depends on what you want out of your holiday. I'd rather save $40 per night staying at a \"nicer\" hotel and spend it out on the town. Also, there is no need to use the yellow cabs AT ALL. Get a 7 day subway pass- it's way cheaper, and it's SO easy to use(the subway, not the pass!)

We had to laugh when we entered our rooms. A single bare lighbulb hung from the ceiling, with remanents of what had been a lighting fixture. We were told we had an updated room. I guest that meant that the bulb was a compact flourescent rather than the old fashioned bulb. The two dressers and tv stand were broken and barely standing, the telephone didn't work, the carpet was filthy and had some gooey stuff in it. The bathroom was clean, but the attempt to cover the mould with white paint wasn't successful. There was a leak somewhere, and the floor had puddles of water that never dried up, so we had to wear our crocks to keep our feet dry. It was the worst room I had ever been in, including my travels on the \"$5.00 a day guide\" of 30 years ago. But I had been warned. What bothered me most was the attitude of the hotel. I've been to some old and shabby motels, but the staff at least try to be accommodating. Like others have said, there is no maid service, the rooms are not cleaned during your stay, towels and bedding isn't changed. There was debris in the hallway, which had not been cleaned in the four days we stayed there. There is no interest on the hotel's part to do repairs or proper cleaning. At $139 a night, you should expect some cleaning and basic maintenance to be done.

The damp, mouldy smell in the hallway should have been our first clue, but we were optimistic. When we saw our room I was very disapointed to say the least. \"No frills\" just doesn't describe it, the basic ammenities were just not up to the most minimal of standards. The carpet was so dirty I couldn't take my shoes off, and the extremely thin bed spread had so many stains on it that I didn't want to sit down. The light above the bed was missing a lamp shade, which we could have tolerated if the sound of water running out of the bathroom tap in a solid stream and the beeping of the smoke alarm weren't already testing our nerves. The water in the toilet was brown, and when we tried to flush it even more brown water came up. We immediately asked the front desk for another room, to which we were told they were very busy and there were no other rooms available, but he would send someone up to fix the tap. When someone came 10 minutes later to fix the tap, he took one look at the room and said, \"You guys didn't get a very good room, I'll be right back,\" and left. 2 minutes later the room phone rang and the man at the front desk apologized for the room and asked us to come get our new room key. If a hotel employee didn't even want to stay in the room for 5 minutes to fix a tap, what hope did we have??? Our second room on the fifth floor was an improvement, with clear water in the toilet, sink and shower, however, there was no hot water at any time during our two day stay. The new bedspread was still very thin and stained, but atleast the sheets were clean and the bed was fairly comfortable. The air conditioner did work well, but created a very distracting smell. We were able to open one window to air the room out, but there was no screen. The bathroom door had so many coats of paint on it that it couldn't close. We weren't able to connect to any free wireless Internet on our laptop either. Both of our windows faced brick buildings, so we never got to see the \"great views\". Bottom line, yes, the hotel is right in the heart of Times Square, which is great, but spending anymore than a few minutes awake in your room will just kill your excitement for the city!

The hotel is only a block from the Time Square hub. - Bring house slippers or something to walk on (you won't feel comfortable enough to allow your feet to touch the floors). - Do not use the other elevators in the back of the hotel (creepy and under construction - you won't be able to figure out how to get to the front lobby from back there). - Be prepared for things to be old and dirty (yes, the electrical sockets were hanging loose and the walls were in need of painting, carpet looked a little moldy, etc). - There will be no iron or board in the room (I assume it can be requested for use). - There is a friendly guard at the entrance (that is a good thing! If you are an attractive female traveling solo, you'll appreciate having the guard right inside the door. But I still didn't stay out too late that night). - The rest of the staff is friendly enough. - There is no comforter on the bed (just sheets and a thin blanket. However, the bed was actually comfortable). - No bed bugs. - No handle/knob on the bathroom door. - the mirror on the door was too old and foggy to see clearly. But the bathroom mirror was fine. Overall my experience was not horrible and I would stay there again if I really needed to save money.

One of these bus + hotel packages. The agency we bought our tickets from made a point of telling us: \"If there's something wrong with your hotel room, don't hesitate to request another one.\" Excellent piece of advice, that was, and it turned that we had to follow it. Four times, precisely. The first room's AC not only blew out hot air, it was also ridiculously noisy. And we were in July, so AC was a must.The second room itself was fine; the only problem was the presence of a dead cockroach the size of my big toe in the bathtub. Again, in room #3, the culprit was the bathroom; diarrhea-brown water oozed out of the faucets. Given that we had travelled all night and that it was 7am when we were given this somewhat surreal tour, we would have gladly settled for the fourth room, where the only issue was a malfunctioning TV, something we didn't care about. However, the employee who was showing us around would not have it, and nothing short of begged us to follow him to yet another room, which turned out to be as satisfactory as I assume a room can be, at Hotel Carter. We had no problem with the room during our two-nights stay, but we didn't spend that much time in it anyway. Probably not one hell of a lot more than we did roaming the narrow, creepy, neverending corridors that snake through this gigantic building, whose walls breathe a long, tortuous history. Call me crazy, but I believe some buildings are alive. Not haunted, *alive*. And Hotel Carter is one of them. Decades upon decades of seeing more humanity than more humans do in their lifetime, is bound to leave an imprint, to seep into the walls somehow... And I can just tell you that once you settle down in your crappy Hotel Carter room, if you take the time to sit down and listen, instead of whining about the bare lightbulbs or the blinking TV, or the noisy AC, you'll hear many, many stories... Some happy, others sad. And others, straight out of a horror movie. These stories are written everywhere: on the peeling wallpaper, the rotten carpets, the tired old furnitures, along the long serpentine corridors which remind you of family-friendly movies such as \"Psycho\" or \"The Shining\"... But they ARE there, all around you... If you only take the time to look, and smell, and listen. And most of all, take the time to let your imagination run free for a while... Now, it's up to you: you can pick Holiday Inn, or Ramada Inn, or whatever other sterile, insipid, generic \"Inn\" chain that you wish. Chances are, you'll like the first room you're given, and will sleep well, without fearing the bedbugs may bite you. Or, you can pick Hotel Carter. Old, smelly, dingy, dirty, dodgy, creepy Hotel Carter. It really depends on what you're looking for. We wanted a place to sleep for two nights, and we got it. According to the other reviews I've read, not everyone got so lucky. However, we got so, SO much more than that: we got an experience. We got spend the night in Overlook Hotel.

We usually stay at 2.5 -3 star hotels in Manhattan (for example, Holiday Inn and Hilton Garden Inn). Unfortunately, all hotels ranging from $175 - $350 per night were booked that evening. Thus, we had a choice between $130 for a one star and $350 for a 3.5 star hotel. The HOTEL CARTER was SO DISGUSTING we left at 8 pm without checking out. Though we're courteous people, we didn't bother to do so as we had prepaid anyway and the lobby was littered with the following: a jumpy looking street hood making a rather obvious drug transaction and a sadly young prostitute whose infectious state was apparent from the lesions on her face. We ended up at the Marriott (the lowest price available room spur of the moment) charging on our credit card $380 for a box-like room. We're not at all wealthy -- are middle class parents of college aged kids living frugally. However we ended up spending over $500 that night for the two hotels because the small mountain of bugs in our room noshing on on some previous client's piece of banana in the garbage (yes -- they were red-tinted and appeared to be blood suckers) , the brown-stained bed cover (it looked as if someone with uncontrolled diarhhea had sat on the bed previously) and the rat racing in the hall outside had us thinking we'd need medical attention the next day if we stayed.

I have stayed in many hotels, mainly Westins, Marriots, Sheratons, Hiltons, many like those. But this one takes the cake. The place advertised cheap, renovated rooms, private baths and so on. But they forget to mention they are filthy and grotesque!!! The place itself is located right next door to a gentlemens club where strippers hang around outside all day. As soon as you enter, you see neon lights and cheap old, chairs. The men at the door who greet you are the only good thing about it. The woman at the front desk was rude and inconsiderate. She first told us we couldn't go up to our rooms yet because it was about an hour before check in. So we demanded and got our key. We should have just turned back when she said it was too early. But they don't give refunds, AT ALL. So we get on the elevator, poor excuse for one anyway, when we get off, it looks like one of those bad films shot in the worst neighborhoods of NY. The hallways are barely big enough for two people to walk close to each other, the paint is chipped or gone, the floors are horrible, the lighting is scary and the door was aweful. Looked as if I could break it down without much effort. So we get into the room and we all drop our mouths. YUCK! Two double beds so close to each other there is practically no room to walk in between. Carpet that hasn't been cleaned in over 7 years, Curtains which looks like I bought it from a man standing OUTSIDE of the dollar store and the bed and \"comforter\" are so old your completely grosed out. The sheets looked as if they were washed recently, but the rest of the place was so disgusting, that you didnt even want to take off your shoes, let alone sleep on the bed. And the bathroom!!! WOW, the bathtub is one of those that were painted so all the paint was off or chipped and the toilet was the same. Someone had actually used the bathroom (Number 2) right before we got there. GROSS! We stayed the night since we pretty much didnt have a choice. After a long day of shopping and eating, we kind of didnt care anymore since we were stuck and it was only for one night. But then at night, UGH! There was this loud noise that sounded, at first like someone screaming, then later we figured out that it wasn't, but we still don't know that it definitely wasnt. I offered to pay for a stay at the Sheraton, but we decided to stick it out. The next day, we all had to use flip flops to shower with, and threw them away after, no one wanted to touch those things, let alone bring them back home. And when we checked out, it was the same RUDE woman. And they wouldnt even let us hold our bags there until actual checkout time since we got up early to shop some more.

We went to the police station at Times Square and the police were chocked and told us to contact the Health Department (in US you dial 311). They also told us to show them to the other guests, at least so that we would get our money back, but we did not want to spend more time of our visit on this, so we just left the hotel (and our clothes).

However that being said, everything else and I mean everything else goes downhill to hell after that. The first thing that attacks the senses is the disgusting smell when you enter the lobby, it turns out they have a small falafel shop attached to the entrance and day in day out you have this stench that permeates your clothing and body, you'll have to spend money at the cleaners to get the stench out. Then we have the staff, best way to put it, they simply don't care!!! , they do NOT care.

I can't add anything else because no matter what i say it won't make a difference. Then we have the rooms, the rooms are filthy, old, smelly, the sheets are old, smelly and i wish i had blue light with me, i'd probably see stuff that would make me want to pack up and leave for central park, there at least you know what to expect. Another funny thing, they have an old airconditioning unit in the room, during the night the howling wind keeps you company, we're talking January in New York (very very cold) and don't even ask for an extra blanket, the phone doesn't work, and don't take a shower after midnight, no hot water!!! TV is busted, no soap nor shampoo, I took my only shower in lukewarm water with my slippers on, yes the tub was that dirty.

From the minute I rung up to get directions I received no service. I got the response from an Asian Lady \"Just get here!\". Once I got there by cab i checked in and to my shock there was blood on both my beds in the room. The room had not been cleaned and there was still soap left behind from the previous guest. I went to complain to the service desk and the response was that they clean every alternate day and the cleaner is not here. I was burning up! I was listening to one of the guest next to me complain about a similar issue. They turned around and also said to him that it is not a 5 star hotel. The arrogance displayed in the hotel staff left a very sour taste in my mouth. The service clerk then gave me two bed sheets to change myself and that was the best solution according to management. The list of things that went wrong just piled from there on and to some up what happened I will wrtie down what happened to my 6 day stay on the hotel; 1) Blood on the Sheets the first day 2) On the second day the whole hotel completely ran out of toilet paper 3) Day 3 still waiting for toilet paper. 4) They never cleaned my room the 6 day i was there 5) I developed rashes form bed bugs and it was the same with my friend who was travelling with me at the time also sleeping in the same room but different bed. Doctors confirmed that it was bed bugs. This ruined parts of the trip and made both me and my friend irritated from scratching the whole trip.

I actually booked a \"Standard Room with Double Bed\" for only $100/night (on a website called Agoda). Major score, until I read all the reviews and freaked out. I was traveling with my boyfriend, and this was our first trip together, so I wanted to make sure he did not unconsciously associate me with bedbugs somehow. It turned out to be just fine. Location and cost really does redeem the hotel from any negatives! I called the day before to make sure they had our reservation, and when we got to the hotel, we had no trouble checking in. There are doormen standing at the small entrance 24/7, and they're fun, probably because they're used to seeing some sketchy characters come from Cheetah's, the strip joint next door. Calm down though, down the street from THAT is the Westin, so the street's not that shady (literally in Times Square). There's always somebody at the \"front desk\" (a walled-of banker's counter), and during our stay, it was a young (early 20s) Hispanic or Asian guy the whole time. There were always a lot of people hanging around the lobby, which was sort of dingy, but that's where the hotel offers FREE WIFI (as well as computers if you want to pay for access). This is huge for anybody addicted to their email. For some reason, there were a lot of Asian businessmen at this hotel, and in general, a lot of foreigners. Our room, 812 (I think? Can't completely remember), was right by the elevator, but we never had any noise problems. The room was pretty old: the front door jammed, the bathroom's small (and the door didn't completely shut; there were 2 small bars of soap and thin, worn towels provided, and the tub was newly remodeled with a new shower curtain that smelled like it came straight out of the package), and we discovered some ceiling plaster was falling onto the head of the bed. TV is small, and didn't get a lot of channels (plus somebody totally stole the remote control). There was an AC, fully functional, but there are only the two 3-pronged outlets in the room (for the TV and AC), so choose wisely which you would unplug to charge your phone. The room also had a closet, the cleanliness of which I didn't totally trust. But honestly, none of that would kill me, or even harm me in any way. We were surprised with a king-sized bed instead of just a double! We did make our own bed each day, as there is no maid service. I think the key to the stay was that as soon as we checked in, I went to the Duane Reade across the street and picked up some Febreeze (or generic air and fabric antibacterial spray) and sprayed down EVERYTHING in the room- the bed, between the sheets, the bare mattress, the floors, the closet, the bathroom, the shower curtain, the AC, the hallway outside our room, and even my boyfriend. No bedbugs during the trip; I got more bites just from walking around New York. Check out is at Noon, and involves just dropping your room card into a little clear plastic box on a desk. Not fancy. You can store your luggage for $2/bag, and you do this with the concierge who directs you to the doorman. You should probably tip too, but... we didn't. He really deserved it though, it's a hard job! I enjoyed the experience, overall, and thought the location made it a lot easier to see all of New York.

Each room has a window air conditioner, and they all looked rather old, but worked. Our room had double window with both sides having broken panes on top! One window was even duct-taped shut!! The bed was nice, though, even though the sheets were too small to even tuck in under the mattress! The windows were so dirty that we could not see too well out.

The rooms are rather small, only a bed or 2 and an old Tv on a little table (no remotes).

We do not demand much more than a nit and cheep hotel. When arriving to the hotel we found the reception to be reasonable but not good. The check in when nice but the staff was short in words and did not welcome us to the hotel. We got a room on fifth floor. Already when we stepped out from the elevator we found the corridor to be in a bad shape. Opening the door to our room made us laugh. The carpent was very old and we could see that it was very worn and the dirt was stuck deep into it. The wall painting was falling off and the sealing painting in the bathroom was also falling off. There was a TV on the room but not working. The air condition worked though. Under the bed we found ciggarett butts and 0,5 inch dust. The bath room was also worn and some days we did not have any hot water. We stayed for 9 days. There where no cleaning of the room during our stay and we had to ask for new clean towels and toilet paper our selves. The sheets where clean when we arrived but not replaced despite our stay for 9 days. If you are going to New York and want to stay at at cheep place, Carter Hotel can be someting for you. But you must accept a room in poor shape and no service at all. We only used our room to sleep over night and was out in the city all day loong. Carter Hotel is more like having \"roof over your head\" while you are sleeping. Carter Hotel is in a very bad condition and it can not have been renovated for at least 20 years. Elevators worked fine during our stay. Our view was a brick wall 1,5 yards from the window.. Carter Hotel offers a very good location only 2-3 minutes walk to Time Square. At the corner 43 Street and Times Square there is a very nice Europe Cafe that offers nice food. The store wall to wall to the hotel does not offer the same quality. We are not the persons who needs a high classed room. I, who writes this, have stayed in many places and the only place worse than Carter is a youth hostel in Tokyo with cockrouches running on the floor.

For a tourist that rather spends the money on sight seeing and can live with a room in poor shape this hotel can be an alternativ.

I am still traumatised by my experience in the Hotel Carter. We were supposed to stay in another hotel but had a call from our agency and learned the day before that there was no room available for us. We started searching for another hotel and had no choice but to stay in Hotel Carter, otherwise we would have to pay 300$/night. What a mistake! We arrived at the Hotel and the staff was ok. The first room we got had dirty, brown-spotted sheets. We asked for another one but the ceiling in the bathroom was coverded with mildew. This hotel was so disgusting. The third room we had appeared to me more habitable because the carpet seemed new (but really ugly), there was a desk where we could put our stuff ( no way I would have but my bags on the floor, the entire hotel screamed cockroaches to me) and the tiles in the bathroom were more intact than in the other rooms. Anyway, my boyfriend and I decided to stay in the hotel because we felt that it would be difficult to find an other one in our price range, and also because our stay had already been paid through an agency. The first night, we decided to go to a Duane Read to buy some stuff to clean the room and protect our health. We bought a bottle of Clorox and everything to clean the bathroom, and also a cheap shower curtain that I put under the fitted sheet. We slept with socks, pants, and with a fleece because we were scarred that there would be bedbugs in here. I even slept with my head covered with my hood because I was afraid to put my head directly on the pillow. The next day, we were shopping and dining and we were thinking about the room. I told my boyfriend that when I would see a bug in the sheets, that would be the end for us at the Hotel Carter and we would have to find another hotel because this place was making me crazy and was ruining my stay. We arrived at the hotel room at 1 am ( because we had decided to be as less as possible in that dirty room). When we opened the lights, we saw a big bedbug and many little ones on both beds in the room. I was so horrified as well as tired by the situation, and my boyfriend was very angry. My boyfriend managed to capture some little bugs in an empty bottle and we came down to see someone of the staff. The man said to us \" You can have another room if you want to\", but it was clear to us that we had to find some place else and not have a fourth room as disgusting as the others. So we were at 1:30 am on Broadway, trying to find a decent place to sleep fo the night and the next one. We are both students and had a very limited budget. In that situation, we were ready to pay 400$/night for an hotel room, just to have a free way from the Hotel Carter. After an hour of walk and lots of infos asking, we found a Comfort Inn in the area, new (built 3 months ago) and at a reasonnable price. We had to come back to the Hotel Carter to get our stuff and to inform the man that we were leaving. I wanted a proof that we were checking out sooner than what was planned, but somehow, the man had lost our registration paper. He kept telling us to come back the day after to get our proof to have a refund for those nights. I wasn't trusting him at all and decided to wait for it. The man had us waiting for an hour, and he never found the registration paper. He finally accepted to fill a new one where he would confirm that we were checking out. At 4 am, my boyfriend and I were in a new, clean and comfortable room in the other hotel. We washed the clothes that we wore during our stay at the Hotel Carter that night in the bathroom with my shampoo. We were really afraid to have bedbugs in our luggages. We came to bed at 5 am that night. When we came back home, we washed everything to be sure that there won't be any chance of having bedbugs in our appartment. We had to pay for two hotel rooms for two nights during our three nights stay that was supposed to make us save money... For additionnal info about the Hotel Carter, lets just say that there is a stripper club next to the hotel and this is clear, as we see people asking for a room at 1, 2 or 3 am, that they just want a cheap place to have sex. The clients are international tourists for most, but also junkies, pimps and hookers. The lobby smell weird, and the elevator were broken. This is the kind of hotel that had been built a long time ago, and was probably a nice place 50 ou 30 years ago. Now, it is old and low-maintained. Seriously, after our trip, I have the feeling that I would not accept to sleep there only one night, even if I was offered 1000$ a night. So why would a pay 97$ for it? After our visit, I read on the internet many things about this place like bedbugs, cockroaches, rats, and even murder... This place should be close by the sanitary service of NYC as soon as possible.

Check in was so-so, staff not very helpful or friendly but not too problematic. I had a double room with own bathroom but both the room and bathroom were very dirty. There were 2 very used and wet towels left in the bath when I got there (and remained there through my stay) and the sink was filthy. Carpet looked like it had never had a hoover near it. Single lightbulb swinging from ceiling and window about 6ft from another wall so no natural light or air. Cupboard to hang clothes was filthy so kept everything in backpack for 3 days. On the plus side the location is great (literally 1 minute from Times Sq and main subway) and at least the doormen (or were they security...) were friendly enough. So in short, you get what you pay for. I've stayed in many hostels and budget places all around the world and have stayed in better places in 3rd world countries. But this is NYC and you're not going to get a bed for \u00c2\u00a32! I may consider staying again if travelling on my own with limited availability elsewhere, but it would be last resort!", "Date": "May 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "US", "Title": "\u201cHorrible\u201d", "Author": "particularwave", "ReviewID": "UR15486365", "Content": "With the price, I wasn't expecting much.

The parents of the friend I was travelling with offered to pay for our hotel in New York as we both had little money and some of my family had helped us out at the start of our journey with hotels and hostels. When we arrived at the hotel I allowed him to deal with the receptionist as he had the bookin details. We were both tired from a lengthy day of travelling and were looking forward to getting washed up. We were made to wait for three hours on our room. The receptionist spent the three hours giving us a variety of different excuses why we couldn't be given a room. At first he was suggesting that we had no booking made, yet we had proof (admittedly we had to search our luggage to find it), he then suggested that we only booked the room, but had yet to pay for it, that the cost of the hotel was not charged to the credit card over the internet, and then when we had contacted my friends parents and gotten the credit card details to pay there and then, and possibly again, they proceeded to inform us that there were no rooms available for us at that time. Throughout this the receptionist was excessively ignorant and antagonistic. In the time we spent waiting in the reception there were numerous other confrontations between members of staff and guests. I recall one Scottish couple leaving the hotel in disgust, marginally over the thirty minutes for a refund as they couldn't get back into their room as the key wouldn't work. Before I get to the room, I should make it clear that the night before I was to stay there, there was a murder in the hotel. I would include a link to a report about the murder but i am going to assume anyone interested can use a search engine and you'll see that I am not lying about it. It was Labour Day weekend 2007. There wasn't even the sense amongst the hotel staff to get the cops to take the body out through a back exit, instead it was removed through the main lobby of the hotel.

That's why i was not surprised by the things i saw in this hotel. I was in the hotel from april 1st-april 8th, i' m just back in Amsterdam. I did not have a bad experiance at al in the hotel, the room was al right, evereything worked except the tv. The room was clean as well as the bed, the carpet was obviously old, but who cares, wear slippers. Ok, it's not the walldorf astoria, but wat can you expect for such a price, at a great location like this, a stonethrow from Timesquare? Me and my girlfreind went to NYC with the folowing attitude; we're not going to NYC for the hotel, but for the City and al that it has to offer. We got out of bed early in the morning and we got back in the hotel late night, we only slept there and took showers. Again we only slept in the hotel, and for that purpose it's sufficiant. Near the hotel are several places where you can get a great breakfast for a good price. If you want more luxury at a location like this, you're going to pay top dollar for it, in the area where this hotel is prices over $300 a night are common. We payed only $60 each a night in a flight/hotel package through a travelagent, in my opinion a bargain. Ok, the lobby is smelly and the room was not cleaned during our stay, but in contrairy to what in read read here, the staff was freindly and helpfull . We had a problem with the water, that was fixed in half a hour and we had a ''problem'' with the keycards to our room, that was fixed in a minute. Was the hotel a little bit shaggy, yes it was, but again what can you expect for such a price. If your expectations are not to high, this hotel is not that bad at all. Some tips; -Ask for a room as high is posible, we stayed at the 19th floor, there was absoluteley no smel or whatever and we had a decent room. -If you are freindly to the staff, they will be freindly to you. -Don't expect to much, that way you won't be dissapointed. -if you are spoiled or you want to bathe in luxury, don't go here. In general; before you go anywhere, check the internet, read reviews. That way you won't be surprised like some people here.

The only nice thing about the place was the doorman who was polite and nice everytime. We entered our room....1704. And the bed was made and looked clean. The sheet had a greasy looking stain on it when inspected at close range. The bathroom sink was constantly dripping which was annoying I got in the shower right when we got there so we could go out and do some site seeing and shopping and noticed some long black hairs on the wall. Looked behind me and realized that they nicely left me the bar soap from the last person who stayed there. I looked above and in the vent above the shower there was tissues sticking out of it, who knows why and I wasn't about to take them down and find out. My girlfriend and I made a complete joke of the place, normally right away I would complain but we just wanted to enjoy the day and I decided that I would complain later that night when we came back. When we came back I told the guy at the desk nicely about the problems. He had nothing to say other than \"oh Shi*\" you tell me earlier i change you room....he then told me to talk to the manager in the morning. So we woke up and we left and did some more shopping I came back to check out and complain. HAA what a joke! The chinese lady acted like it was no big deal and wouldnt even listen to my complaints. Just before this a lady with her family told us they had to be moved from a room on the 8th floor to the 17th floor because of a rat in their room the night before. All in all. Avoid the place.

The TV was old but I never even turned it on. However, there were also NO bugs and NO mold in my room. The sheets were clean. There was no blanket on my bed when I went in, so I went back downstairs and asked for one and got a brand new one fresh out of the plastic. The mattress was firm, so must have been relatively new. The fixtures had been re-done in the tub/shower (but the old ones just capped). The bathroom had been re-tiled, floor and shower walls with \"marble\". The shower curtain seemed new and was clean and mold-free. Things were not \"finished off\", so there was putty around outlets, pipes etc... The carpet was relatively new and basically clean, except around the edges. It appeared to have had a \"lick and promise\" type vacuuming. I had 3 windows, so it was nice and bright with the curtains and shutters opened. It was a little warm but the bathroom window opened, so I was able to let fresh air in. I stayed 3 days. They didn't clean the room during my stay but there was a cleaning guy around in the hall when I was heading out the one day and I asked for fresh towels and he was more than generous with them and asked if I needed anything else. I'd asked for fresh ones the day before at the front desk and while they didn't have face cloths, once again, they were more than generous with giving fresh towels and they were clean. OK, so it had it's quirks...and it's old and kind of rough around the edges but you can't beat the location or the price.

But since we only had enough money to afford a cheap hotel( You don't gain alto from selling cookies) we settled for Hotel Carter. Our troop leader did not check this websirte before the trip, she just looked on the Hotel website. The hotel website is completely different from the actual hotel. If you notice, it rarely speaks about its \"excellent staff\" or \"family friendly activities\" or even its \"luxiourious rooms\" becauase the truth is the it has none of those. The staff is never available , there is a club in the lobby, and the rooms are positively revolting! ...............After arriving from a quick jaunt from Grand Central Station, we walked up the steps to what we now call hell. Right next to the door is a small deli which seemed to be like a convienen place to eat. Yet that deli was NEVER visited due to our great desire of staying as far away from this hotel as possible! Now the first thing that went through my head amidst the dirty carpet and plastic light \"THIS LOOKS LIKE A CHEAP LAS VEGAS HOTEL!\" but it's worse. We walked int othe loby to find a group of , lets jsut sqay, NOT kid friendly, people sittin on a couch while a couple of rugs were laying around on the floor. After a lot of confusion with the front desk lady and her giving us procedures about the 1.00 charge per extra key card we gathered around the elevator. Aft3er about 10 minutes and 1 of the two levators being pronounced \"out of order\" we arrived at our rooms which were inconviently put on three totally sepreate floors. The rugs were filthy, it smelled as though there wer a dead rat and it was terribly cold. we wwalked oer to the window to find that there was no screen and it was extremely unsafe! Then while we put our stuf down, contemplating if we should put our clothes in the drawers we opened them up to find about 20 gumwrappers, cigarette buts and other odd trash. then we went to the bathroom which needless to say was not functionable. When it came time for bed my best friend and I sat huddled together on top of countless sweatshirts trying as much as possible not to touch the stained blankets.

I jammed the door at night with a random chair that was in the room to be sure. Had I brought along ANYTHING of value like my laptop I would have never been able to relax while out and about. As it was I just had clothes and bathroom stuff so I left stuff in the room without worry and had no problems. The staff as a whole weren't dying to help anyone but one guy was alright. Location was ridiculously awesome. On another note.....Places like NYC need budget options for travellers that just want a bed and a shower. And the building has 700 rooms! All they have to do is keep it clean!!!!! I don't understand why they even go to the trouble of being open if they are just going to upset people! Hire some damn maids!!! I think a homeless guy was sleeping in the lobby but there weren't shady people hanging around that I saw. I came and went several times a day and I kept my guard up a little while there but never had a problem. One other weird thing...The shower was hot and POWERFUL. That thing was blastin' hard!

Well the room was quite clean. The only thing we didn't like was that the TV wasn't working and the bathroom door didn't close. But we were too thrilled about NYC, that we didn't care much. Well it was funny that the place was full of asians, but we didn't care. During my second and third time things turned. I booked Carter, cause I had been there before, the place is good, and the price was good. I checked on Jan 1st, around 8 AM. They gave me a room what was on 4th floor. The window was so that it was to jard and there was sort of wall... so that was enough scary. I was so tired after delayed overnight from Europe, I just fell asleep. Altough it was so cold in the room that I had all my clothes on + blanket I carry while I'm travelling. The sheets and everything felt just to dirty. I woke around 4PM and went for a walk, when I came back I could tell that someone had been to my room, nothing was gone, but my suitcase was in a differnt place. Ok, the roomservice? But the room wasn't clean, it was still dirty. I was happy to check out during the next day, but I was scared cause I had already booked the hotel for the next week, while I was back in NYC. When I was back for the 3rd time, things got worse. At this time my room was on floor 8, just next to lift. OMG, I was scared, cause the door had marks like someone had tried to break in there and being a 22-year old female, travelling alone for work, and being in a room like this isn't nice. The room smelled like a pool, the bathroom was dirty, the window was broken from top. I slept so that I took my laptop, camera etc, to bed with me, I was so scared.

We arrived at about 5pm and after them struggling to find our reservation we were finally given a room key. The lobby smelt and looked awful but was nothing compared to the state of the room. The hall ways were dingy and filthy as was our room. My friends bed sheets were completly stained and mine had blood stains all over them. We literally through our bags down and went and sat in a resteraunt for a few hours until we were ready to go back there. We ended up sleeping in jumpers and jeans so our skin wouldnt touch the sheets. And all night there were people walking up and down the hallways shouting and knocking on doors. We were very scared for our safety. At this point we called back to Australia and got family to find us alternate accomodation!! The bathroom door wouldnt close and the bathroom was definatley not useable, and you could not walk anywhere with out shoes on. The floor was covered in dirty carpet.. there were dirty tissue and ear cleaners and dust everywhere. You feel so dirty just standing in there. There was a neon light outside the hotel room so even with the lights off it felt like you could have been in a brothel. The rooms looked as if they have never been cleaned. this place should not be running as a hotel. At 7am we left in the clothes we had on all night unable to bring ourselves to use the disgusting showers, and went down and complained to reception. They were not helpful and they were laughing in our faces about the situation and pretending who was the manager. After giving us a key to another room, which was just as bad we went back down and demanded them refund the remaining nights we had booked.

The curtains had holes in them and there were inexplicable noises coming from the heating/pipes. The carpets were filthy and clearly hadn't been hoovered for some time and there were layers of dust about an inch thick on the radiator. The sheets were stained and had hairs on them, the bedspreads were also stained and threadbare. The plastic wrapping had been left on the mattresses from when they were purchased. The heating didn't even come on (and it is the middle of winter). There were cables in the room and a hole in the wall to the outside. The bathroom was equally dirty with enamel peeling off the bath and sink, damp and mould on the walls. When we moved the toilet roll and there was a ring of dust left. The room also smelt musty which we couldn't do anything about as the windows did not open. We were also shocked and distressed to find our beds were infested with bedbugs. After the first night we were covered in bites which made us very uncomfortable and as a result negatively affected our holiday. We have also had to spend money and time dry cleaning and fumigating our clothes and luggage. We changed rooms on arrival having been appalled by the first room we were given, but it seems that all the rooms were of a similar poor standard. We also complained directly to the hotel at the time and were told that there was nothing they could do in terms of a refund. The man we complained to admitted that the rooms were 'disgusting' and said that other people had also complained of bedbugs but was powerless to offer us any compensation. On our return we undertook some research into the hotel and found on tripfinder.com numerous other people who shared a similarly horrendous experience. They also reported bed bugs, filty rooms and we were also alarmed to learn that there was a murder in the hotel last summer, numerous room thefts and sightings of prostitutes in the foyer. This compounded our belief that they hotel was not a safe environment to stay in. Although we were prepared and happy to spend our time in a very basic, budget hotel we certainly did not expect to stay in somewhere which was filty and infested with bugs. Hotel Carter has been classified by lastminute.com as having a 1 star rating. The definition of a 1 star hotel taken from the English Tourism Board is 'Practical accommodation with a limited range of facilities and services, but a high standard of cleanliness throughout'. Hotel Carter did not come clost to the mark in terms of cleanliness. Although this hotel was not in England and I appreciate hotels are classified in various different ways, we were expecting a reasonable standard of accommodation bearing in mind New York is one of the world's most modern, cosmopolitan cities. On return, we were horrified to discover that we had brought some of the bedbugs home with us and are now in the process of fumigating at great expense.

The staff said there was nothing they could do about it as the building is being renovated so these thigs can happen! Never before in my life have I had to go and get roach spray for may stay at a hotel but this I had to do. When I went to bed I saw hairs and bits of fluf in it so I am not sure if the sheets had not been changed from the last person or if they had fell on the floor but it was very unpleasant and so I had to sleep fully clothed. My final grip is that for the 5 days that I stayed there my room was not claeaned, so I had to take my rubbish bags to the street and make my own bed. It is such a shame that it was so bad as I was hoping to go there regularly as the price and location were great. But it felt more like staying at a bad hostel.

I can honestly say that the hotel Carter is THE WORST of the lot! Please ignore the room picture that they post on their web site, after staying there I can only qualify that picture as a deliberate scam! When you arrive at the hotel you have to deal with their desk attendants, there is a particular Chinese lady who is positively THE RUDEST hotel clerk I have ever encountered in my life. My room looked like it had been last renovated sometimes in the late 60's, with a renovation cost of maybe $10 tops. The walls were dilapidated and dirty, the carpet completely filthy. The closet had no hangers or drawers to speak of, and it looked more like a very dirty tool shed than a place where you would like to leave you clothes in. The bathroom was a nightmare. The TV remote didn\u00c2\u00b4t work, there were no lamps, and the bathroom light was broken. The bedsheets were torn and the whole room had a musty, unpleasant smell. When I tried to reason with the lady I mentioned above, she repeatedly tried to walk away from me. After I stopped her a couple of times she pointedly told me that they did not cleaned the rooms or changed the towels. After a heated discussion she gave me two towels (I refused the first she gave me because they were fithy and had burn holes in them), and a light bulb for the bathroom that I had to change myself. I would have gladly walked out and tried another hotel if my stay hadn\u00c2\u00b4t been paid for in advance.

Do yourself a favor and NEVER book this hotel. New York is a great city, and staying there shouldn\u00c2\u00b4t have to be a nightmare. There are other options in the budget end for Manhattan hotels that provide at least a minimum of cleanliness and comfort.

Could it really be as bad as people had said?? My mom was prepared with Lysol, bug spray, our own sheets and blankets and garbage bags... When we drove up we were laughing because it seemed so surreal... The door man had a crooked hat... Cheetah's strip club was right beside the door... When we walked in to the lobby the security desk had a small Chinese woman behind it.. Was this our protection?? The long rolls of carpet were in the corner of the lobby... The smell wasn't too bad... We went up in the elevator to floor 4 and there was a pile of garbage beside the elevator.. oh great... our room had a key card which was encouraging as someone had mentioned they had a key and the door wouldn't shut... Since this was a group trip I got to see a variety of rooms... Our room was ok..one king/queen size bed with one sheet and a thin blanket (thank goodness we brought our own) .. There were hairs on the sheets and a black dots that I'm not sure if they were bed bugs or not.. There were red stains on the desk that my mom thought were blood... The TV was an old turn dial kind that only got one channel PBS and it was fuzzy... The bathroom was falling apart and there were bugs in the bathtub (I don't know why anyone would bathe here)... The taps both had a letter H on them instead of one being H and C... The vanity had no mirror... In another room the bathroom door could only be opened from the outside so if you went in and shut the door you couldn't get out again... Our tour guide said be thankful you didn't get room 517...so of course we all went up to investigate... 517 hadn't been cleaned in who knows how long... towels were all over the floors..the bed wasn't made...garbage was everywhere...and the smell was of rotting McDonald's food...I think I would have passed out if I got that room...Another couple in our group switched rooms because the ceiling was caving in to their bathtub...On another note most of the rooms did not have smoke alarms and a couple were found in the dresser drawers... Apparently some members of our group were put in recently remodeled rooms but I unfortunately did not get to check these rooms out...

My girlfriend and I have stayed here twice because of the budget price that comes along with the hotel. There's a reason for it. Everything you've read about is true...and then some. I, for one, have never noticed any bugs or rats, and am grateful for that. But seeing all of the other reviews, and having stayed here twice, I can honestly believe the other reviewers. For one, the front desk people can barely understand English. I understand maybe having a little trouble speaking English or whatever, but when you are in the hotel business and over 90% of the clientele will be speaking English, it should come into consideration when hiring front desk people. However, at the same token, check in is fast, but bring reservation confirmation! The lobby is something straight out of a dance club, with blacklights and the such in the lobby itself. There are unused carpets stacked high in the right corner of the lobby as well. Very unappealing. The elevators take forever to come down, but are realtively quick once you are on them. Now to the rooms. The hallways are very dark and creepy looking, as if you are about to enter your own horror movie. Upon entering our room, there was a very musty smell. The TV barely worked, only getting maybe 3-4 channels that worked properly. We can hear some other channels, but the picture didn't come in at all. I had to physically move the TV around the room to try and get better reception, mind you this is cable reception, NOT rabbit ear antennas! As for the cleanniness of the room, it wasn't too bad, but did notice alot of dust in corners, and some fallen debris from the ceiling. The bathroom door does NOT shut. I've stayed here twice, and neither door has been able to close properly. Unbelieveable. Next, the lack of maid service. We stayed for 2 days and never once did I see or at least HEAR a maid cleaning the room. We had to get more towels from the front desk, and make our own bed. Probably a good thing, seeing as how I wouldn't want any of the people that worked there in my room to begin with. The only good thing I can report about this hotel is the Lucky Star Cafe, which is next door, adjacent to the hotel. Good food, open 24hrs a day, and relatively cheap for New York. Last but not least, a murder has recently occurred there, so now the police have stepped up their presence. This place should be condemned. I've read it used to be a homeless shelter in the 80's, and after seeing some guests in there, as well as in the elevators with me, I believe this place is still used for such activities.

First of all, you cannot beat the location of this hotel. It's in the heart of Times Square. As well, this hotel offers one of the best values in NYC (rooms start at about $100 night). The front desk staff is friendly and efficient. The hotel is secure and safe with a minimum of two door men/security at the door (that's what I experienced during my visit). The lobby is clean and has an area dedicated to accessing the internet. Off of the lobby is a small deli/cafe that offers a variety of hot meals and snacks and is open 24 hours. The elevators are clean and fast (I believe there are three elevators in the hotel) and there were rarely times I had to wait for them (hey, when you're in NYC your time is valuable and you want everything to be as efficient as possible). The rooms are spacious, clean and very comfortable and many of the rooms offer a view of Times Square. I cannot imagine staying anywhere else in NYC. Once you walk out the front door of the hotel you only have to walk about a block and a half to access just about every major subway line in the city. As well, you're convenient to such things as most of the major Broadway theatres, all of the amenities of Times Square and The Port Authority is just around the block.

We just stayed here for 5 nights (in our 30's, no kids with us) for $120 a night. For this price at this time of the year, we were more than pleased with our room. It's no Hilton, etc but we didn't pay Hilton prices in NYC for Oct either. I was very nice to the guy when we checked in and he even let us check in an hour early - I suspect this helped. Check-out took all of 2 seconds to drop your key in check-ou box. We prepaid through some website, so our receipt was provided by that website when it was booked. We also didn't have to even leave a credit card for incidentals. Location - awesome, very close to all the broadway shows as well as Times Square. Subway, 1/2 block away. Room - tv, a/c and telephone worked (don't we all have cell phones anyway), sheets were clean, I don't use bedspreads at any hotel so I didn't even look at it, floor vaccumed, no sign of any bugs or creatures of any kind, locks worked. Our room (1624) had a balcony and a view although the door was permanately locked going out there - we crawled out the bathroom door and sat out there anyway, the closet was triple the size of any hotel I've stayed in, we got 2 keys at no extra charge Bathroom - bathroom was clean, there was paint falling off the ceiling in the bathroom but it didn't fall us on, one of the shower spickets fell off but we just put it back on, water was hot everytime, they had soap behind the mirror, 2 towels, no shampoo. Internet - free in the lobby on your own computer, they also have 4-5 computers you can pay by the hour to use Lobby - coke machines for $1 20oz drinks ($1.50-$3 anywhere else), doorman that checks for your hotel card before he lets you in. Housekeeping - non-existent, but we kinda enjoyed this as we didn't have to worry about anyone going through our things. We just put our towels out by the door and went and got more from the lobby everyday, we got 4 more everyday. We didn't change our sheets, as I would rather not even know what the mattress looked like without sheets, we didn't see one trash bag out in the hallways or trash under our bed. Store - there was a little store connected to the hotel for snacks, etc. They have the best burritos, we had them 3 times. Guests - most of the guests were European, Asian, and Indian, not a lot of English-speaking people staying there. Complaints - From the people speaking english, I only heard one complaint. A couple's tv wasn't working and she'd asked for 3 days to get a different tv. The guy was about to get her a new tv, when her boyfriend started being rude about it and really complaining. The boyfriend said he paid for a room with a tv and he expected one. The hotel guy told him that he actually paid for a room with a bathroom and if the the tv works then that's an extra for him. For the price, this was a perfect place to sleep at night. I couldn't get anything less than $200/night for these dates on priceline for a 2 1/2*, so we were able to spend our money on shows, etc. It could definitely use some updating and repainting, but we were there to sleep and take showers.

When I booked the hotel, I informed them of my late arrival and they told me that this would not be a problem. However, on the night I arrived, I was greeted by this very annoying employee, basically telling me that there were no available rooms because I was late. I was shocked, obviously. We had a bit of an argument at the reception. The annoying manager, whose English was terrible told me that they would refund the money I paid into my credit card and that it would go back into the card in a few days. Now, I was so angry with the hotel at that moment that I would have happily accepted this offer, but the problem was that they were not going to refund me with cash. I didn't have any other source of money. If I had the amount of money that the average Manhattan hotel requires, I would not have stayed at the Carter in the first place. Anyway, after about 10 minutes, they found a single room where me and my two friends had to stay for the night. The following day they put us into a double. If they hadn't found that single room, we would have literally be homeless during our 10 day stay or we would have had to put all our spending money to book another room and have a miserable holiday stuck in our hotel, without anything to eat. Other problems included - - Constant police surveillance. Now. You might think this is a good thing, and I guess it is but you just feel awkward when the lobby is constantly watched over by police officers. - The sheets were not cleaned. - The walls were crumbling, - We stayed at the hotel for 10 days and the towels were changed just once, and that's only after we asked for them to be changed on the 3rd day,. - The people at the reception were rude, inexperienced and were behaving in such a way that you wonder whether they're slaves working without pay. - The television sets in the rooms are a complete waste of space. You can't see anything and barely make out what is being said. Advantages - - Spectacular location - Cheap - Decent size rooms I will not stay in Carter again.

Me and my friend were traveling around America after working at a summer camp. We booked into the Carter for the same reasons that i suspect 99% of its clientel does, its cheap, alot cheaper than (at first glance) most other places in this great location are. As we were expecting the absoloute worse when we arrived in the lobby we were pleseantly suprised, although obviously dated, the lobby isnt what i was expecting ie. crawling with cockroaches and transexual prostitutes. The staff were \"new york friendly\" (no niceties but not overly rude.) When we got up to our room things became a bit more like we imagined. There was beer bottles and pages of porno under the beds from whoever 'used' the room last. The bin in the bathroom still had rubbish in from the last guest, and the bathroom definately wasnt clean. All of this i can deal with, at least it had its own bathroom we said to eachother, and the location is undeniably great being a 40second strole from the infamous times square. So we went out, soaked up our first day in the city and went back to the room at about 1 in the morning. I went to bed in my sleeping bag as the sheets wernt clean and i didnt fancy sharing a bed with our previous beer swilling, porn reading guest. When we woke in the morning i went to get my wallet from the TV table, to find it open and cashless. When i went to sleep my wallet contianed $260 cash, it most definately didnt in the morning. What is particularly worrying about this is that the doors on the hotel rooms have the credit card style swipe entry thing, which means that it must have been a member of staff, who came into our room whilst sleeping and stole from us. This is a rather worrying thought. When i reported this theft to the reception, as we were checking out of our 3 night stay 2 nights early, we were simply greeted with a shoulder shrug and a \"what can i do?\" not a helpfull response. I would avoid this hotel like the plauge, no matter how cheap it is, it ended up costing me an extra $260 a night than i expected.

The guy at the desk told us flat out that this was going to only be a few steps up from the hell we had just come from, but we honestly didn't care. It was a million times better than the other place! The hostel didn't have an a/c or any kind of fan...our room at the Carter had a GREAT a/c in the room! At the other place, we had one shower and one toilet to share with a floor of about 20+ rooms (meaning at least 40 people). At the Carter, we had a private bathroom with a shower. The shower WAS on the small side, but it worked and it was our own! At the other place, we were given a bunk bed that if you barely tapped it, it shook like it was about to completely just fall apart. At the Carter, we had a king-size bed with clean sheets.

The bad news is that, yes there is a very noticable and distinct smell to the entire hotel, and it is not a normal smell that you get use to. It smells like pee, mold and like its never been cleaned. The lobby is decorated with torn furniture, neon lights, and some very shady residents of the Hotel. The office staff was ok, they were quick and efficent, didnt lose our reservation or give us any problems. However, if you get offended easily, I wouldnt even bother going there because the front desk are young kids who repeatly said, \"hell yes\" , \"[--] no\" and \"word\" when asked questions. The hallways have mismatched wallpaper with old, flat carpet that is bumpy and had lifted up. So make sure to pick up your feet, and bags or they will get caught on the carpet. The room was small, but mostly clean. I never saw any bugs, or critters. There is a lot of \"gunk\" on the walls, and the paint is chipping everywhere. The windows had a brown film and were cracked so bad, I thought if we touched them, they would fall outside. The beds were hard as a rock, but after a long day of walking, its not hard to fall asleep anywhere. The carpets are flat, dirty and if you walk around barefoot, you get a black film on your feet. So, we refrained from putting anything on the carpets. The bathroom was actually pretty clean and the shower worked wonderfully. There was also an air conditioner that we had to plug in ourselves, but it also worked wonderfully. Bottom line, if you are just looking for a very cheap hotel to stay at, this is your place. It is ideal if you are going to spend most of your time outside if the hotel and just sleep there. Also, because of the dirtyness, tackyness and a large number of strange guests and residents, I would try to be in the hotel itself as little as possible.

In the lobby I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so tired I don't really absorb the crowd. It's a dive but I'm not thinking straight. I go up to the desk and the guy behind the window tells me he has a room. \"I'll take it.\" \"OK. It's $116 plus one dollar nonrefundable room key deposit.\" \"Fine,\" I say, and pull out my credit card. \"No. Cash only.\" He sees me look at the Mastercard and Visa signs. \"You can pay by credit card only if you have a reservation.\" \"Well, give me a reservation.\" \"It's too late for a reservation today. Cash only.\" I pull out my money. He passes me a plastic room card with 1031 written in bleeding red marker across the front. I get in the elevator with some teenagers reeking of alcohol. The elevator door creeks opens on ten and I know I'm in trouble right away. The exterior room doors are all badly painted a vomit-teal-bluish hue. I put in my key and open the door. It gets worse. The bathroom. The tub has rust stains. There is no shower head, just a pipe sticking out of the wall. I turn the heavy silver metallic cold water knob and immediately the hot water knob falls off and clatters into the tub. The toilet has no tank so the opened toilet seat falls backwards and looks like a pitiful gaping mouth, jaws wide. I close it then feel like I should wash my hands. But I see no soap. And no shampoo. There is no stopper in the drain in the sink. Later, the cap of my toothpaste falls into the sink and disappears. Across the bathroom is a closet. When you open the door you see the emergency exit plan. For the Dixie Hotel. Which I can only hope was the name of the Carter Hotel some lifetime ago and they simply didn't bother to change the sign. Above this was scrawled a profanity laced poem I cannot repeat here, but it alluded to bed bugs and unclean toilets. An unmarked phone sat on a rickety table. No alarm clock. The king sized bed was the most sanitary seeming thing about the place. A large mirror with a piece of broken frame sharply protruding hung on the wall. A functioning air conditioner mercifully sat in the window behind a receptionless television. A metal coat hanger sat in the corner. I intuited why I had been made to pay cash: no refunds, no refuted credit card bill. I went back downstairs to ask for another room. The earlier guy was gone, and the night shift guy had taken over, an older man. I asked him if he had a better room. He gave me a pitiful look, innocently shrugged and said, \"They're all the same.\" He handed me three tiny bars of soap. I walked outside. As near as it is to Times Square this section of 43rd is pretty desolate. Across the street is the entrance to a huge parking garage. Across from that is the Cheetah Club where I saw a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dancer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd screaming at the guys in the parking garage. Before going upstairs I asked the front desk for a wakeup call. \"Does the phone ring pretty loudly?\" I asked. \"I don't know.\" I went to the room and took a shower. Or rather, it took me. Because the pipe sticking out of the wall was bent toward the back shower wall I had to sort of push myself against the tile wall to get wet. Then the drain immediately clogged and the water got to ankle level. I then took the metal hanger and put it's hook on the frame of the door on the inside so that in the event some criminal broke open the door (the secondary lock was long gone) at least the hanger would clatter to the ground to alert me a second or two. After the shower I got fully clothed and laid on the bed on top of the covers and tried to sleep. I got up with my 4:00 a.m. wakeup call and escaped in a cab to airport.

I asked to see a room - \"No, I don't let anyone see the rooms\".... says the guy behind the bullet proof glass, Alllllrighty Then!!??? My girlfriend and I thought to ourselves, \"How bad could it be? and she, being able to speak Spanish, asked a Mexican family all ready to leave in the lobby how the rooms where. Next thing I heard was \"that's it! -- three of the family members said \"there were bugs in the room and try to get a room high up\", making little critter movements with their fingers, hmm guess it takes a while for the bugs to catch up with the new hosts\" Oh well \"- I'll take the loss on the booking rather than show up at the funeral with itchy rashes all over.

At the beginning of our holiday, all the things that happened to us at this hotel were laughable, as this was the only way to cope, but at the end it was tiring and fustrating and we just wanted to go home! if your thinking of booking to stay in this hotel, please dont unless your a sucker for punishment!, if you already have, keep smiling its the only way to get through it and we wish you good luck !!! :-)", "Date": "January 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NC", "Title": "\u201cDoing NYC on the cheap\u201d", "Author": "LadyInLexington", "ReviewID": "UR6629916", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel and had a pleasant experience.

OK, before I begin what is most definitely going to become a \"rant\" I should mention the one good thing about the Hotel Carter. That would be its location; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in a fantastic place close to Times Square, the bus terminal and a short stroll to 5th Avenue. Ok, now for the \"rant\". I read a mixed bunch of reviews before I went on my trip about haunted rooms, thefts and it not being the best of hotels. But I thought \"hey, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in some pretty cr*ppy places, how bad can it be?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Well let me tell you, it can be BAD!!!! We (my girlfriend and I) arrived at the Carter late on Thursday 14th December 2006. We were greeted as we opened the door by the delightful whiff of the greasy cafe that is, for reasons unknown, adjoined to the hotel entrance. As we climbed the hotels steps, tastefully decorated in Technicolor patterns, set off by the various tones of dirt, grime and trodden in chewing gum I took the opportunity to admire the strange dolls that are displayed in glass cabinets around the entrance. As I admired them, and the 3 working Christmas lights that surrounded them, I enjoyed the tasteful out-of-tune music that played in the background. I can only compare it to a musical Christmas card that was low on batteries. Not put off, my girlfriend and I made our way to the reception. The first thing that struck me about the reception area was the fact that it had clearly been designed to stop people leaping the counter and attacking the hotel staff. This being New York, I thought perhaps these sort of things happen. When I met our \"Friendly\" night receptionist, I soon learnt that all this security was in fact to keep her in. To say this woman was rude is an understatement. She had clearly attended the Adolf Hitler School of charm and passed with honours. After we received what I can only assume was the standard level of abuse and rudeness (and were charged for the pleasure) we made our way up to our room. We were on the 19th floor, and let me tell you a ride in the lift (which I believe was last serviced upon the buildings contraction) is an experience in itself. Will you make it? Won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you make it? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all very exciting. When we got to the 19th floor hallway, the first thing that strikes you is the lighting or rather, lack there of. There is a 40 watt bulb once every 40ft, so its kind of like staying in a poorly lit multi-storey car park (but dirtier). We made our way to our room and arrived at our door that was tastefully decorated a nice shade of green/dirt with a few dents and smashes for good effect. On entering our room we saw that it was last cleaned some time in the mid thirties. The linen looked relatively fresh, except for a very suspicious stain, and the bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 well, lets just say if the room was cleaned in the mid thirties it was by a lazy cleaner who forgot to do the bathroom. But still, as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in some bad places and was not about to let a few decades of dirt, an abusive receptionist and dodgy lift put me off. I was in NEW YORK BABY \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Having emptied our stuff into the spacious wardrobe (ooh another good point, sorry there was two) my girlfriend decided to have a quick wash before bed. As she did this I lay on the bed and decided to check out the wonder of American television. No sooner had I turned on the TV then came a yelp from the bathroom followed by the door opening and my girlfriend in fits of hysterical laughter. I walked over to see what was going on, when I noticed what was coming out of the taps. Now, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not too sure how to describe this but it was kind of like lumpy gravy with flecks of grey. Thankfully, we did have both hot a cold running versions of it. I was going to phone reception to complain when I remembered that this may mean I would anger the receptionist and god forbid, they set her free to come find me. So, we left the taps to run for 10 minutes or so and they did eventually run clear. So, I went back to my laying on the bed and watching TV when something caught my eye on the wall. I looked, and with the reviews of this being a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153haunted hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ringing in my head, I saw a pentagram had been etched into the wall. Fan-bloody-tatstic! Immediately wanting to get this out of my mind I thought I go to the window, pull the curtains back, and have a look at New York by night. I was quite impressed with the 5 square foot of Times square I could make out from our window and watched the bits of HUGE advertising boards I could see light up and change. As I stood there, I became aware of my right leg starting to get cold. Assuming the ghost of the Carter had come to get me I slowly glimpsed down to take a look at it. But instead of a gruesome spectre I instead saw that there was a hole, about the size of my fist, in the wall leading directly to the outside world. I was all set to complain, when I realised there was actually a better view of Time Square from the hole than there was from my window. So that was my initial experience of the Carter, and frankly in the 2 nights that followed, it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any better. No doubt you are now reading this thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153well if it was so bad why the hell didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you change hotels?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And the reason for that simply was we were there with another couple and the chances of getting 2 rooms on the weekend before Xmas were not good.

Upon my arrival, I realized that I had been scammed. We arrived at about 8:30 or 9:00 PM, and when I tried to obtain my reserved room, I was rudely told that they were sold out for the night. I asked the rude woman \"what is the point of a reservation if you are not going to RESERVE a room for me?\" and she still refused to offer us a room. We asked if they would accomodate us in another hotel since we were now stuck in NYC with nowhere to sleep and not enough money for the fancy hotels around Times Square. We were told to return at around 3 AM and we would get a room.

This is where it gets good - we were handed a large pile of sheets, one towel, and a thin quilt that looked about 85 years old and would NOT keep us warm, and were told to go up to our room, clean it from the guests before us, and apply our own bed settings.

We had read the other reviews before booking, so we were prepared for the worst; but our room was ok & we have stayed in worse (in Europe; Greece & Turkey).

I just came back from a weekened shopping trip to NYC and chose to stay at the Carter because I wanted to stay in a central area (Times Square) and most importantly... I had a budget of $150.00 per night including tax for my hotel stay. The Carter Hotel fit the bill. I went to their website and found that it was $10.00 cheaper a night then when I had phoned them earlier. I paid $105.00 a night including tax. this meant more money for shopping YEAH! Here are the Pros: Big bed that was strangely one of the most comfortable beds i have slept on. Strong Powerful water in the shower. Air Conditioning was good for the heat wave that went through the city. Amazing view from the 21st floor. Concierge was very knowlegable and helped me map out my shopping trip, and also gave me some great coupons to macys and bloomingdales. Here are the cons: There was no hair dryer in the room and when I went down to the lobby and asked for one.. i had to be put on a waiting list. they called me while i was asleep at 11:00 pm and told me to pick up the hair dryer in the lobby or it would go to another guest! overall assesment: If you want to stay in a good location and do not have much money to spend and you dont need amenities in the room such as a hair dryer, coffee maker, or iron, then the hotel carter is a great choice. and if the negative reviews are true, then trust me they are taking your advice and they are showing some improvement. they now have Card Keys instead of Metal Keys, and they have marble bathrooms, instead of old tiles. oh, and the elevators are pretty fast and modernized. i did not have to wait a long time to get to and from my 21st floor room. If you want to stay in a good location and have some extra money to burn, or better yet, an expense account stay elsewhere. but dont forget that you get what you pay for.

I went straight down to reception and the receptionists reply was \" oh yes, didn't we tell you we had a mice problem when you checked in?\". We then changed rooms. Our second room was much bigger, but far more dirtier. One of the windows had been broken and boarded up with a very thin piece of cardboard! The best part was, the thin piece of cardboard didnt fit the window frame, so where the gaps were it had been stuffed with tissue! Some nights was very cold! The receptionist also told me to put any food into a carrier bag and hang it from the door handle so the mice couldn't eat it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I know it was a low budget hotel, but for that you still expect cleanliness, safety and happy staff. My friend and I did not let the hotel ruin our five day break in New York, we hadn't enough money to go elsewhere so had to stay for the duration. We managed to cope there, and can now laugh at it and put it down to experience! And what an experience it was!

One girl was taking a shower in our 11th floor room, (all the bathtubs are painted white with wall paint, which chips off) and the shower head fell off.

A/C was working properly too! We had 2 A/C's, one in each bedroom. We also had a very big balcony, however the only way to get on the balcony was by climbing out of the window which is not a problem at all for three people in the ages of 22-24.

The staff was friendly and appologized for not having electricity in the first suite we got (we found out just after checking in and got another room right away). I must say that both rooms we saw wre not bad at all. They're budget, that's it.

It is unfortunate, but their website does not even remotely reflect the level of quality of this dump. Upon initial arrival, we had to park our vehicle in the garage below the hotel which resembled a cave or Bastille dungeon more than a parking garage. Entering the hotel, the lobby reminded me of a casino, complete with what appeared to be bulletproof glass (that did wonders for the confidence in the safety of the place!) The $1 charge for a room key seems a bit strange to me...how are you to get into your room without a key? Entering the room was perhaps the worst disappointment of any traveler. Let me preface by saying that for $115, usually I would expect a decent hotel, but recognize that New York pricing is a little different, and therefore expected this to be comparable to a room in any other area that would run for $40-50/night. I can honestly say that I have stayed in hotels for $30-40 that were much cleaner than this hotel can ever hope to be. The beds were not \"made\" as in the pictures on the site, but rather just had folded comforters on top of (hopefully) clean white sheets. The floor had not been vaccummed in at least a month, and that is being generous. I seriously distrusted using the bathroom, and it didn't have much to do with the door that didn't quite close. The TV had only air stations, with no cable, and not even an antenna to get decent reception. There were multiple missing pieces of hardware on the \"furniture\", which did not even include the rudimentary table and chairs of even the most basic budget hotel. The phone did not work at all. Out in the hallway, there are no words to describe the interior of the hotel. The closest I can come to visuals is to ask you to picture a movie involving a scene were a raid is being done on a drug hotel...that should provide all the mental imagery necessary. About 24 hours after checking in, our youngest daughter began violently projectile vomiting, for no apparent reason, and it became even worse when we got back to the hotel. We could only conclude that she contracted something in all the filth in the room (including a discarded soda can well within site of any supposed housekeeping staff, which apparently does not exist at the Hotel Carter). After debating the \"merits\" of the \"value\" of the hotel, I began using my cellphone (remember, the room phones don't work) to call the 800 #s for other hotel chains, in hopes to find one that could take us in! We were lucky enough to find another hotel a couple of blocks over that had a room for about $85/night more. I wanted so desperately to get out of this situation, that I threw away my $134 for the second night at the Hotel Carter, and put down another $225 at the replacement hotel for the same night. Upon checking out, the manager had a quizzical expression and comment as to why someone who had paid for the room would refuse to stay the night...health and welfare rank high on that answer list! The best advise I can give to anyone is to not even bother with this hotel. I've seen others on this site say that the proximity to Times Square makes up for the condition and filfth...don't believe that. There are plenty of hotels in the area, and you have to realize that there is a reason the Hotel Carter is priced so far below the other area hotels. It is not worth saving $100-200/night for the filth that you have to deal with in these rooms.

The hotel was clean enough for my boyfriend and I to stay in, and I'm a very picky person. The view was nice from the window, the sheets clean and the king size bed was HUGE!! The bathroom was fine to my standards, and we got a few channels on TV, TBS being the one that I recommend- there are loads of sitcoms on all day. When checking in we were greeted by a young girl at the desk, who was very helpful and pleasant. During the stay, we unfortunatly came across one of the other receptionists - and older chinese woman, who is quite rude. We're glad that she didn't check us in. Not that she ruined our stay, I think she just deserved a negative mention for being so moody. There is a small newsagents connected to the entrance of the hotel- so perfect for quick snacks- they even sell hot food, but I opted to eat at 'europa cafe' which sells reasonably priced healthy food (I didn't want to eat Mcdonalds every day. NY food is so expensive!!) which is on the corner of the block. The carter hotel is literally 20 steps away from central Times Square. Which is perfect for shops, shows, cinema and more. The hotel is excellent value for money, we got flights and hotel for 6 nights for \u00c2\u00a3420 each!!! That was from lastminute.com.

The room stank, as if someone had thrown up and it stank of cigarettes, too. The room was a total mess, with filthy clothes everywhere. I thought \"oh my god, do they always give the keys to a room that is occupied ? Will someone march into my room the next time ?\" The next room, which I then stayed in, was also filthy, there was no furniture in it that was not broken. There was a small cuboard, where you could put your clothes and there was a big brown sticky puddle on the floor, the size of a car tire. During my stay (5 nights) my room was not even made once ! I had to ask for toilet paper at the reception. But the most awful thing was: there was no water for 2 complete days and nights. You can imagine what the toilet in my bathroom looked like after one day. It was only on the second day, that we received water bottles to wash ourselves, the whole place stank and everybody was complaining and screaming in the lobby about the missing water. It was 35 degrees Celcius outside, and you could not shower ! Every time I asked at the reception, when the water would come back, they told me \"within one hour\", and this kept on going for 2 days, I really was angry. The problem with this place is: there is some kind of really bad energy in that hotel. I think everyone who stayed there will confirm this. I could not sleep at night, because of the smell and the filth and I was afraid of the things underneath my bed. I had a look underneath my bed and saw so many filth, dirty tissues and strange black things I could not identify, that I decided not to look further.

I'm a 20 year old guy from Denmark, me and my buddy traveled around the US for a month and when we were in New York we stayed at the Hotel Carter. Rooms: The room was plenty big for the two of us. We basicly just used the room for sleeping. What else do you use a hotel room for when you're in the City that Never Sleeps. I mean, if you're on vacation in New York, then its stupid to stay in your room the whole time. You need to be out on the streets of New York, sightseeing! The room had beds and drawers for the clothes. The bathroom was OK, but of course not a luxury condition. It had water for brushing your teeth, a toilet to do you stuff and a place to take a shower. What more could a man ask for??? Service: The service in this hotel was good. When we called the hotel at 7:30 AM in the morning and asked if we would get our room NOW insted af 3 PM which is the officiel time you get your room, they were nice and said yes right away. When we arrived, check-in only took a few minutes and then we were in the elevator going up. The next day when we wanted to \"plan our week\" there was a lady in the lobby whoms only job was to guide N.Y. visitors. So we spend a few minutes with her. She was really kind and gave us a lot of tips of where to go and when. She also helped us book the things that needed to be booked. Value: This hotel is RIGTH NEXT TO TIMES SQUARE... it doesnt get any better then that when it comes to location. Right in the heart of New York. I think we paied somewhere aroun 100$ per. night for our room for 2 people. I think thats pretty good value. We only needed to sleep somewhere.

All reviews I had read stated that this hotel is in a fantastic location - right in Times Square and in the middle of the action but the hotel itself was awful. The other hotels we looked at online were so expensive, so the Carter Hotel was a good, cheap option. When we arrived, flashbacks of the reviews I read came instanly to mind. I thought.. I should have believed them. The staff at the hotel are extremely rude and abrupt. It took about 20 mins of standing at the reception desk for someone to acklowedge our existence - there were 4 people behind the desk who continuely ignored us. We finally got checked in by the rudest, most arrogant woman on the planet. We finally got to our room and, yes, it was awful. Actually, it was totally disgusting. We ended up asking for another room and the arrogant woman on reception actually let us choose from another 2 rooms (she must have had a weak moment). The final room we chose - being the best of the 3 - was fairly good if you like blood stains on the quilts, cracks & dints in the walls, a tv that only had 2 stations that worked (the tv's in the other rooms didn't work at all - so 2 stations was a bonus), the bathroom door didn't fit to the frame - so you it didn't close, the toilet spat out water from the pipes when flushed, the tap in the shower fell off every time you touched it, there was mould all over the bathroom, the towels were extremely thin and about the size of a hand towel, the sheets on the bed were stained with who knows what - I tried not to think about it, the walls are very thin (so if you're planning a fun time in NY, remember your neighbour can here everything you do), our room was serviced once in a 5 day period (luckily we had pinched the toilet paper and extra towels from the other rooms when we were trying to pick a room).. the list goes on and on. The hotel has a tour desk with some chick that can't speak english and is happy to try and ignore you. But when you bug her enough, she'll throw a couple of brochures at you and then pretend you vanished into thin air. Such a friendly little thing she was - NOT!! My suggestion - go find a tourist information centre somewhere else in New York. This was just too hard. In the end, we tried to look on the bright side and spent most of the days out seeing the sights. We only went to the room to sleep (or tried to in between neighbours enjoying themselves). We tried to see it as the glass is half full...we had a roof over our head, a half-comfortable bed to sleep in, and being the middle of winter & freezing cold, we were warm (cause we wore two layers to bed).

We had booked 3 weeks before travelling and had not read a single review until about a week before the trip. I must say after having read numerous reviews on this website, I was terrified at the prospect of having to spend 5 minutes in what sounded like a close 2nd to the Bates Motel in the 'house of horror' stakes! However, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. First impressions were not great as the worst thing about the place was probably the lobby. It is extremely outdated and gaudy looking. However, we checked in with no problems at all. Furthermore, we had no problems with any of the staff for the duration of our stay. We actually had very little to do with them but when we did approach them we found them to be both courteous and polite. Our room was on the 18th floor. Thankfully we had no problems with the lifts at any time. The room itself was more than adequate for our needs. The bedsheets were clean and I have to say the bed was probably the biggest I've ever slept in! My biggest fear was probably the potential 'extra occupants' but I am glad to say we saw not a hint of a rodent or an insect. The bathroom was clean and I did not hestitate to use the bath. However, my boyfriend did have problems when using the shower. There must be some problem with the water pressure as it alternated between scorchingly hot and icy cold. Two towels were supplied at the beginning of our stay and these were the only ones we were given for the five days we were there. No mini bottles so be careful to pack your own shampoo. Luckily, I had read previous reviews and was prepared for this. Also, do not expect maid service at any time as it ain't gonna happen! Our biggest concern was that the heater in our room could not be turned off or even down, so in stark contrast to the arctic temperatures outside, we were uncomfortably hot. The windows did not appear to open even a fraction. However, these were petty concerns in light of the location of this hotel, which really cannot be beaten. You only have to step outside and you are in the heart of the city. The only drawback to this is the constant noise outside the bedroom window all night long. All in all, If I had to do it all again I would stay at the Carter Hotel without hestitation. Its not the height of luxury but if you could afford that you probably wouldn't be reading this review in the first place.

The shower fixtures were MISSING, not to mention the shower rod was being held up by a rubberband....that's right folks a RUBBERBAND.

It is the worst place we have ever come across. Being world travellers, and having in stayed in 5 star down to motel standard, this hotel is the most disgusting sleeze of New York. We cannot believe it is still operating, but believe me guys, by the time I have finished, it hopefully won't be! Run by a consortium of asians, one of whom is dictatorial, who are out to fleece people is an understatement. They seem to lure people through agents at an agreed rate, but when you check in, they tell you that the rate agreed is not their rate, and charge you more. This `racket', especially applies to New Year. Because the hotel is in a prime location, it is supply and demand. They know people will have a hard time finding any accommodation at this time of the year due to the celebrations, or if they do, they will have to pay more than double or triple to stay in a better class of hotel. BEWARE. If you do book through an agent, ensure you pay a deposit or pay in advance, and in that way, they cannot up the rate. Better still, do not stay here at all. Even for just sleeping in, it is not worth the worry of having to go back to the room at night! They also charge you a dollar for the room key saying it is refundable. It is not. Another way of fleecing the public! Seven hundred rooms at this time of the year, they could be making seven hundred dollars alone on room keys. Look at the photographs other travellers have submitted - believe me they are not trick photography. You need a shower to rid yourself of laying in the beds all night, but then you worry about what will actually come out of the shower. Watch the toilet too. If the toilet is blocked and you flush it, the whole contents of the toilet will explode and land on you and everywhere else around the bathroom. The lobby, I agree, is the best entertainment. It is a sort of cheap version of a Las Vegas hotel during the sixties. People arguing over rates, people booking in and then straight out again, people giving it the benefit of the doubt and giving it a try, but then checking out the next day. People standing with towels and toilet rolls in their hands, having had to ask for them because there are no cleaners. Linen is not changed, towels are not changed, rooms are not cleaned. I actually think they are only changed for when people check in. The only thing, if anything, going for the hotel, is that it is an ideal spot for the New Year celebrations, and there is a very nice guy called Abdul, who is a kind of mediator and stands in the lobby trying to help people and keep the peace as much as possible. He is wasted in that slum though. The job is utterly beneath him. He got us in to Time Square on the night of the celebrations in a prime position at the front, so big thanks to him - it made up in a way, for all the grot, slime and sleeze of this joint, which I find unbelievable is in existence for tourists in the middle of New York city.", "Date": "January 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reigate, Surrey", "Title": "\u201cJust keep a stiff upper lip\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4316787", "Content": "On 1st December 2005 I waited at Heathrow for 3 hours before boarding my flight to New York.

The water dribbled out of the tap and the floor was covered in soggy paper towels. When we got to the Carter Hotel we were booked in immediately. We went to our room on the 22nd floor and found it to be adequately spacious with hot and cold running water in the bathroom. The bath had been meticilously cleaned so often that the enamel was worn through. The towels were like sandpaper. The furniture was minimalist tat but the sheets were clean.

We visited this site before we booked a room and went horrified while reading some of the reviews. So we just wrote down the address and didn't book a room til we got to New York. I should also add that neither one of us were 21 at the time. We had heard that it'd be real hard to get a room when you're under 21. So we got a room at the cosmopolitan hotel but could only stay there for a night since they were booked. So we had no choice but going to Hotel Carter. We loved the atmosphere in Time Square, so we were on a good mood when we arrived to the hotel. The person who helped us check in were a Latino guy, a very friendly and helpful person without overdoing anything. The hotel looked desperate for a makeover. So we checked in and went to the room. I was really happy when I saw such a nice and clean room. Later that day we discovered the bed sheet had some old dirty blood stains but since I slept with my pajamas on and a bath towel underneath me I didn't mind it. Our bathtub had a very weird stain, it looked like a bloodstain or something, but that was alright too. We just took quick showers so it didn't bother us. The African-American man who sits in front of the elevators was a nice man as well, he talked with us and made our stay there a bit nicer. We didn't have cleaning service for our entire 9 days stay. But come to think about it we were glad, we didn't want people in our room anyway. We went out 8 in the morning and didn't come home til 10 in the evening everyday. So we didn't notice any weird smells coming from the deli. We didn't go to New York to stay in our room the entire time, we just wanted a cheap place to put our stuff in while we were having fun! If I want to take long showers or watch TV, I could stay at home. We spent all our money on shopping, eating great food and we also went to the Broadway Show Sweet Charity. It's all about what you priority. + The location - we could stay out every night and didn't feel afraid a single time. The price - couldn't find anything better were you don't have to share a bathroom The staff was friendly every time our parents called Many subway stations nearby Great places to eat nearby Always someone at the front desk We had air condition in our room - A little dirty and old Tv didn't work Bed sheet was dirty Tv didn't work too good, but we managed to get the good channels.

It is a very basic hotel. The Spanish guy who worked on the desk at the night was nice enough as was the young Asian girl. There is internet access in the lobby, which is quite cool. Its great if you don't mind the 60+ year old black guy who comes up to you while you're typing telling you how he doesn't hate anybody and gibbers to himself!! He was sat next to me just talking fast to himself before talking to me. Oh, silly me, i forgot to tell you that he is the night watchman/ security person. He was a nice guy and always said hello even though i wasn't sure about the guy. The New York cops were in the lobby twice while we stayed, including an undercover cop escorting somebody out in the elevator! Anyway here starts my honest account in chronological order. We got a little lost around Times Square so asked a cop where it was. He chuckled a little when we said the Carter, but he said its ok, they've done it out a lot, just keep your things locked up! By this point we're tired from carrying our stuff, we just wanna get there. And we did, 2 minutes later- absolutely fantastic location. went into the las vegas style lobby and checked in with the young asian girl. we stayed in room 1502. The lobby wasn't too bad in all fairness. A few times we heard people discussing whether they should check out or not. In the lift we go, a bit of a funny old polish smell and needed a vacuum but its a lift, but it really doesn't matter. And through the hallways. Pretty ok, nothing too drastic. Now into the room. Looking at the other photos on this site, I seems like we had the Penthouse suite!! Floor: Needed a good vacuum- under the bed was very dusty, and i found a fortune cookie shaped bag. It didn't look like a pyramidal tetleys tea bag, so i investigated. CAUTION DO NOT HANDLE, RAT POISON. Oh cool. so back under the bed it went. I must stress though, as bad as that sounds, i found no evidence of Rat or mouse activities. Some of the carpet was not fastened in the corners, but if you had the guts to look under, you are better than us!! Bedding: Very clean, superb, couldnt ask for more. Very comfortable nights sleep, except for the odd door slamming but the walls where thick and we didnt hear anyone in the adjacent rooms being rowdy. The headboard was indeed the innovative technique of nail the scrap of carpet to the wall, but again was clean and no complaints. Pillows were clean as well. No stains. Electronics: Panel hanging off in the corner with 3 or 4 wires showing! One of the socket outlets was hanging off, but we had one that was good to use. Our telly worked in it as well. But we just ignored them and got on. The plug in the bathroom looked well dodgy, looked burnt in a sense, so we didnt use it. Disposable shavers are the best, trust me!! All lights worked and the switch was safe. The room had been repainted. It wasnt a bad job but there was the occassional lump of paint around from not being applied properly. Lots of the paint was put on thickly, looked out of date paint, you know the type that dries out and streaks thickly?? The bathroom: No major complaints. Taps leaked when putting them on, but hot water came through, was generally clean, tiles a little grimey maybe. Shower curtain was clean. I had great showers, water came hot very quickly. The basin had no plug, but we managed to use it. I wouldn't recommend asking for improvements to our room, but we knew what to expect so were quite satisfied. Besides if we did ask, the old asian lady seemed a bit mean and rude. If you expect crap, especially by going on some of these reviews, then you may be pleasantly suprised- we certainly where, however some of these reviews are so recent that i honestly think we had the penthouse suite!! If you expect something moderate, then you may be ok with it, you may not be. Overall i give it a 2/3 out of 5, but thats because we had the heads up on what it was like. Would i stay again? I would stay in room 1502 again, but judging by some of these rooms on the reviews, i certainly would'nt. Oh don't use the deli/snack place next door- its a rip off. you can go to other places such as k-mart on 34th street and load up on snack treats and drinks. If i have missed anything, please don't hesitate to email me to ask any questions about the place.

It was the busiest weekend of the year, so we didn't have any choice to be honest. The room was an utter disgrace. My suitcase remained closed and locked (more for fear of rats and parasites rather than thieves!!) The room consisted of a king size bed and a tv. You could barely walk around the bed, but that just suited me fine as I didn't want to touch the carpet. I made my husband check everything before I entered the room. Underneath the bed were old dirty, empty bottles and probably 10 years worth of dust. The wardrobe consisted of a cubby hole and the hanger was an old pipe. The bathroom was just so disgusting it was beyond belief! We were very lucky to have warm water for a shower so we could dress for the wedding, but the rest of the time it was freezing cold, therefore 1 shower in 3 days! Yuck, not pleasant! Once we were over the initial shock, we just stayed out of the room as much as we possibly could and just went back to sleep. Do take your own towel if you take a chance with this hotel, a pair of flip flops to wear in the shower and something to wear in bed, I slept in my clothes and am still itching on my return!!

I can however say that, despite not being the Ritz, the Carter is not quite the complete hell hole that I feared it would be. Ok so the Carter is grotty, dirty, run down, out dated and most certainly in need of renovation, however there are a few things you need to consider before your visit: 1) The fact that you are reading this will mean that you have probably read most of the nightmare reviews and will therefore not be disappointed with what you find when you get there. That was the case with our group and so we weren't horrified with what we found. If you go prepared for it to be bad, you might be pleasantly surprised with what you find. 2) Many of the complaints from hotel guests are about minor things. e.g. no clean towels, etc. Therefore go prepared, take your own. You are paying less that $100 per night to stay in Time Square, you can put up with no clean towels and your room not being cleaned while you are there. 3) While the room was grotty, the bathroom facilities were perfectly serviceable, we had hot water every day and the shower pressure was fine, (one word of warning here though, the floor of the shower was quite manky so a cheep pair of flip flops could be a sound purchase!). 4) Hotel staff - We didn't have a problem with the staff while we were there. If you are polite to them, they'll likely be ok with you. So all in all my Carter Experience wasn't quite as bad as it could have been, it certainly proved good value considering what we paid and the location. As mentioned above, you have read the reviews so you won't be expecting much, the majority of people that have complaints won't have looked it up before they go and are expecting more than actually get. In fact, sitting in the lobby of the Carter is quite an experience in itself, watching people come to the lobby to complain. I would certainly recommend it as one of the top things to do in New York City, along with the Statue of Liberty, Empire State, etc!!! On a more cautionary note, people obviously have had a bad experience of the Carter, so it may be that we were fortunate and just got some of the good rooms. It could be that's its luck of the draw when you get there. If you want to guarantee no problems don't stay there, if however you are on a budget and think you can handle a few inconveniences then this could be the place for you.

So upon our arrival in NY, after a long journey from Venezuela, we were told by a very unpleasant and rude Chinese lady, who seems to be the owner's wife, that they didn't have a room for us!!

After 2 hours waiting for an answer, we were told they indeed had a room for us, but that we had to pay again for it, at a higher price of course, since they had never received any payment from us or from Cosytel.

However, this is a gamble if there is a fire as the fire detector is in the nightstand drawer next to the bed. Everything about these rooms is disgusting. I am not being vengeful or picky they truly are disgusting. The carpet, curtains and walls (if the plaster is still in tact) are filthy. The bedding is threadbare and barely tolerable as you hope the sheets have at least been ran through a washer. There was no screen on the window (which actually helped air the place out a little). The bathroom was disease carrying scary. Seriously who knows the last time it had ever been cleaned. There was hair and a used Q-tip on the floor. There were dirty towels hanging on the back of the door, used soap stuck in the drain and mold on the barely hanging shower curtain.

Do not think that some people are over picky, because I certaintly am not. I travel alot around the UK to football/soccer games, and as you can imagine we find it difficult to stay in any high profile hotels due to the label attached to football fans. We end up in basic bed and breakfasts which are not the \"Hilton\" but at least they are clean. This place (I refuse to give it it's real name as this is not a hotel) is the most disgusting place I have ever been. The moment you walk through the front door, you feel the atmosphere. The staff's attitude is appalling and the foyer is dirty and smelly. I would have thought that the foyer may be clean to give the customer a good first impression, but this is not the case. They have made no effort what so ever. The moment I got to our room, I went downstairs to say I was not staying there as the door was damaged, They gave me another key to a different room, which had someone already in that room. We ended up in the original room. I immediatley left the hotel, got a telephone directory and tried to book elsewhere. This was unsuccessful on the first night and we had no choice to stay in the room. Due to the time difference I could not contact the booking agent in the UK so I found a web cafe and emailed the agent to find me alternative accommodation, no quuestions asked, and with no extra charge, or else this case would be escelated to a higher level, things were that bad. We slept on top of the covers of the bed, fully clothed, with towels (later thrown in the bin) to cover the pillows and sheet/blankets. Toilets were not used (I was scared I might upset something living down there!) and showers were not even attempted. I had to wedge the door closed with a chair, as the impression I got from the hotel, there certainly would have been some unsavoury characters staying here. If I were to set a picture of a horror movie or a brothel, this would be it! I was booked into this hotel for 4 nights, 1 was enough, and I would have preferred to stay in a prison cell. I handed my key back and told them I was checking out. They claimed I had booked 4 nights, and with a laugh in their face from me, I was away.

Everything in our price range was booked. Despite all the negative reviews posted here, we booked at The Carter anyway. We looked at it like an adventure. And, it definately was. Everything you read about the lack of cleanliness, poor service and the overall state of disrepair at this location is absuolutely true. But, thanks to reading the warnings here, we thought ahead and remedied some of the problems ahead of time. We each brought a towel and our own shower stuff. We each brought some plastic cups. And, we arrived with the mindset that at worst we would be camping a block from Times Square. Everything was easy after that because thats exactly how it turned out. The bed in our room wasn't dressed. So, we got some clean sheets from the front desk and made our own bed. There was a bag of garbage from the last people who occupied the room, so we just heaved it out into the hallway. We preferred not to be bothered by any housekeeping staff so when they never showed, we were OK with that. (We're still not sure if the hotel even employs any houskeeping staff.) The bed was comfortable. And, the air conditioning worked just fine. There is a sign above the front door of the hotel that that reads in all of it's truthful, broken English: \"You want in Times Square for less.\" If thats what you want, thats what you get. And thats all. End of story. If you want your bed turned down nightly, free HBO and a mint on your pillow...I would suggest that you book into The Hilton or plan your vacation in West Virginia or some other more friendly place. This hotel is definately lasting on borrowed time. It is a disgrace. I have never stayed in such a lousy, out-dated environment. (I grew up in New York. So, take it from me...) Without a doubt The Carter will be closed and condemned at some point because of the neglect it has sufferred over the decades. We saw no rats or roaches. But, all that you read about carpeting nailed on the walls and what-not..? True! Drippy taps? True. Unreliable elevators? True. Dank and moldy? Also, true. Maybe a rich hotel chain will buy it and perform the renovations required to ressurrect this address. Or, maybe the city of New York will finally do the right thing and mercifully execute it for the good of all future guests. But, in the meantime...If there is one saving grace, it's that this hotel tells no lies. It doesn't present itself to be something that it is not. You will get a door that locks reliably one block from Times Square at a (super low) price as advertised that is less than any other hotel in Manhattan. You will encounter lazy, confused, unapologetic and robotic staff, poor plumbing, unreliable elevators, etc. But, think about it. What else would you expect for the price in Times Square? You will get what you paid for. We paid under a hundred bucks nightly. Thats a Times Square bargain. A nicer room in the same neighborhood that is roughly the same size can easily be three times the price. We laughed about our stay afterward. I would recommend this hotel to anybody with a store of patience, a sense of humour and room in their baggage to pack their own towel. Every subway line is a half block away. We wouldn't stay here again if there was a variety of other affordable choices available.

The only thing good about it was that it was right near Times Square.

When we got there the parking attentant told us that we could not. We went inside and asked the woman behind the desk and told her that whoever answered the phone, when we made the reservation, told us we could take the car in/out of the lot w/o paying extra. The lady stated that it depended on who was working the garage. That, first of all, gave me a bad impression of them, the fact that they're not all on the same page. Then, we were on our way up to the room. The elevator was old, slow and seemed kind of musty. When we got off the elevator on our floor, the hallway was long, dark, and plain, like something out of a horror movie. We got to our room and the door barely opened, we had to kick it open and slam it shut. The room was tiny, dark, and small. The head of the bed was against the wall and the foot of the bed was practically against the wall on the other side of the room, that's how small the room was. The view we had was of a dumpster and we could barely walk near the window b/c the foot of the bed was so close to the wall and there was a tv at the corner. The tv had only 2 working channels and the walls were covered w/ writing that guests carved into it. Now, onto the bathroom. This bathroom light was the brightest light in the room. We had to put down the toilet lid to flush the toilet and had to use all our strength to flush. The sink dripped water nonstop and the shower was a hole in the wall w/ a shower curtain covering it. It was worse than those public baths at the beach. The dirty room we could stand but the dirty shower was definitely unbearable. We tried to call down to the front desk, 3 times, to let them know we wanted a refund and there was no response. We figured the quickest we get out of there, it'll be more likely that we could get a refund, they absolutely refused to give any types of refunds. We were actually willing to take a loss so that we wouldn't have to stay there, but turns out all the other hotels were booked or the prices were outrageous due to it being the September 11th weekend. We ended up not taking the car out of the garage b/c everything was close so we could either walk or cab it. We took a shower w/ our slippers on and we had to leave the door half opened b/c the bathroom door was just like the door to the room, it wouldn't open or close w/o some strength.

Crime happens in this hotel everyday! I seriously think the hotel should be closed down by the government and I truly don't know why they are still in business. My husband, my sister and I arrived at Hotel Carter on 09/15/05. It took us 2.5 hours to check-in. (They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a computer. Every thing is memorized in hotel stuff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head or written by hand. Unfortunately, the hotel stuffs are not very organized, they messed up people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reservation and they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem care or feel sorry.) While we were waiting, we saw so many unbeliveable things happened... 2 girls who had left their luggages in the hotel's storage room but the bags are gone when they came back. (Note: The hotel charge $2-3 per bag but they are taking responsibilities for your stuff.) Two polices came and found out a guy who works in the hotel stole the bags and dump the empty bags in a big trash car. The hotel manager seems known that but he protent he didn't know. At the same time, there were 15-20 people complaining to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manager about no water in their room and some said their TV/air condition are not working (PS. it was 90 degree and humid in NYC.) Hotel manager told everyone they are aware of the problem and are fixing it. By the afternoon, water will be available at every room. Even people are not happy but they accept the fact that they are not getting water any sooner. Finally we got our key to the room and we were told that our room is ready. I opened the door, there are still 2 people in the room and... well, un-dressed. I apologized to them and back to front desk and asked for a new room. We waited for another half hour. (While we are standing there, the stuff blame each other for the mistake they made.) They gave us another room and we found there is no water in our room. So we back to the lobby again, and the manager \u00e2\u20ac\u0153promised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that when we come back in the evening, water will be available. So we went out and started our first day in NYC. After walking on the Time Square whole afternoon, we returned to hotel around 7:00PM- exhausted and smelled and of course we all wanted to take a shower. As soon as we get into the lobby, there are so many people argued with the hotel stuffs and things start to hit up- we Shockley found out the hotel had no water for TWO DAYS!!!! Many of the people didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shower for two days! Of course they are angry and frustrated. Unbelievable! My husband questioned the manager and asked him to tell us the truth- either the water will come or not. The manager said with really cold voice: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No body knows, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know either, I hope the water will come tonight, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know, I cannot guarantee!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd My husband tried to understand why they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell us they have this major problem when we check-in in the morning. And he wanted to know if they really have people fixing the water system or not- we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any plumbers or workers. The manager just totally ignored his questions and walked away. I also heard one of the hotel stuff shout to another man and a couple: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask me, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know (repeatedly), go away, OK? Stop asking me! If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like, you can go! Go!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As you can imagine, people started to shout back to the stuff. There were also about 20-25 people waiting for the check in- some of them stop the check-in process and tried to get their money. Some of them just standing there hopelessly and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what to do. My husband started to raise his temple as well. Allow me to point this out clearly, he is a very gentle and lovely person. I have known him for 12 years and I have never seen him like that. Like other people, he asked for the money back, the Asia lady told him \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you can go if you wanted to go!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But she has no intention to return our money. We started to argue with her and she said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Get out, get out! You get out of my hotel, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want you THESE KIND OF PEOPLE here, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even thinking to stay here again!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Excuse me, who wants to stay there ever again? I never ever again step in here even you give me money to stay here!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I found myself shouting back to her. After talked to my husband, we decided to leave. I cannot let my sister (who flied 18 hours to New York to join us) staying there. She was absolutely exhausted. We stormed back to our room and get our stuff down to the lobby and prepared to leave. There were even more people. We also saw two poor girls who lost their baggage and the guy who is in-charged for the storage room seems not care. He in his poor English, telling the girls: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what happen to your stuff, they are gone. I have no idea who took them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd People started to lose control and one of the guy tired to bit up the hotel manager and the guy. The Asia lady is still shutting to people- by the by, she was standing behind bullet proofs glass the whole time. She keeps asking people to come up-front if they wanted to check-in!! No water in the building, and they still want people to check-in? It just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make any sense to me. My party and I were kicked out from the hotel at 9:30 PM at night in NYC. At that time, 99.9% of the hotels in the city are booked. We spent an hour to call all the hotels on the yellow page. Finally we found a four stars hotel for $410 a night. Needless to say, we have no choices- we ended up stay there. Over all, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s such scary experience.

It definitely isn't the cleanest, but the $89 a night for that location can't be beat. We only really used it as a place to sleep and get ready for the day. We checked in easily, went up to our room and saw there were 2 queen beds instead of the king we were supposed to have. Not a big deal, we just put luggage on the other. The first thing about the room though, it smelled really bad. I sprayed some cologne into the fan and it was fine the rest of the time. We had no view, but that didn't matter, we weren't staying there for a view. The TV was not plugged in and the closest plug was in the bathroom, so the cord had to go in there. You had to step over it to get into the bathroom, but again, we weren't there to watch TV so we never really used it. There was a big stain in between the two beds, the picture on the wall was crooked, and the shower never really got too warm. It was really strong pressure though. The heater made fairly loud noises all night. The worst thing about this place I didn't even find out til checkout. When we checked in they said we had room 635. I noticed during our stay that our key said 633 on it though. I didn't really think anything of it, just thought maybe it was messed up. But when we checked out they said we really were supposed to be in 633. So our key that said 633 on it opened room 635, meaning if they had checked someone into 635 they would have walked in us or our stuff. That wasn't too cool. But when I stayed here, I didn't have a lot of money to spend on a room as a college student. This place gave me somewhere to sleep and shower and that's all I cared about. I never saw rodents, bugs, prostitutes, or anything people have mentioned like that.

It was colder inside than outside. When I asked about the heating I was told it was automatic but wasn't cold enough for it - December in New York??? I don't think so!!!! The only place there was any heat was the giant lobby area which was always roasting! Other guests I spoke to in the lift were equally unimpressed!! I had to wear several layers of trousers and tops and a hat and gloves to go to bed in the evenings! Also, didn't feel too safe when there was someone following me to my room and banging on the door one evening! When the bed was made after I complained (the only time all week) there were still stains all over the sheets.

I wanted to go to Times Square for New Years Eve. Other hotels were about $800-$1200 for 2 nights, but the Hotel Carter was $250 ($89 the first and $129 New Years Eve + tax). Let's be honest - it's not the Hilton. We checked in on December 30, 2004. I checked for any reservations before we left and it was totally booked. I had two copies of my reservation (in case they kept one) and presented one at the desk for check in. Since this had the price on it, I didn't have any problems. The receipt and room information was already printed, so I just had to check and sign the credit card receipt. Everybody was ID'd and it was printed on their receipt. One of the booking problems is that it seemed like all the reservations were done on paper. The lady at the desk had a huge stack to go though, but found ours. After collecting $1 for our room key and signing all the receipts, we were off to our room. I first walked in, the room was larger than one that I had stayed at in the Paramount Hotel. The floor had been vacumned and the bed was made. The biggest problem with the hotel is it's age. The carpet is old and worn and the bathroom has seen better days. The reviews about the TV are correct, you only get about 4 channels. The shower was tiled and was old. Because of it's age it looked dirty, but really wasn't. Because the hotel was filled, the elevators were a bit slow. However, at busy times, the hotel staff escorted guests by using the freight elevator in the back. I would say the average wait time was 5-7 minutes. My room was on the south side of the building on the 21st floor. I was able to get a wireless signal on my laptop from the Hilton Hotel. The biggest problem I noticed was with the shower. If you take your shower at peak times, when the hotel has a lot of guests, it tends to \"pulsate\" hot and cold. At one point it would get really hot then really cold. This would be a problem if you have children (there is only a standup shower). However, my girlfriend took her shower at 'off-peak' times and didn't have much of a problem. Best advice - bring shower shoes, it will make you feel better. There is a small store (which has beer) in the lobby area. It's open 24 hours, but it's kind of pricy. I bought 2 candybars for $3 & 8 wine coolers for $30. It also has sandwiches and cooked food, which looked pretty good. There is a drug store and other stores less than a block away. There is also an ice cream place about a 1/2 block away and a Starbucks also. The hotel lobby has several vending machines with soda, water and other drinks for only $1, which was a good deal. There is a smoke detector system in the hallways, but not in the rooms. There are battery powered smoke detectors in the room, however mine was taken down and put in a drawer. I don't believe that there is a sprinkler system in the building. The room doors had a latch system, deadbolt and a chain. The heating system was a steam radiator. I couldn't get the lever to work to control it (which was on), so I regulated the heat by opening the window. The windows are newer thermal pane, with one half being an air conditioner. The air conditioner was manufactured in 2002. If you have anything that has a three-prong plug ( like a laptop power supply) there is only one outlet with the ground. The others are the \"two\" type version. You would have to bring an adapter or unplug the air conditioner. There were two parking garages - one next to the hotel and one directly across the street. I didn't park there, but they looked okay. The hotel is only one block away from Times Square. If you are a neat freak, offended by old yellowed fixtures or plan on spending your whole vacation in your room, this isn't the place for you. If you are like me and wanted somewhere to shower and sleep, so you could explore the city, it's just fine. I'm not cheap, but it sure saved me a bundle.

We reserved this hotel online 2 weeks prior to arrival, and received confirmation (just a reply email, no confirmation number). We failed to check this website and it turned out to be our biggest mistake. The first red flag was raised when I tried to call one day prior to arrival to find out if they had an iron board and hair blower in the room (One can never assume anything). The toll free 800 number was always busy which was something unusual. When I called the regular number, the phone was answered by a real person but only with a greeting \"May I help you?\". I had to asked if this was hotel Carter and she said yes. I complained about the toll free number being busy and she cut me off saying that many people called the hotel. I asked if the room had a hair blower and an ironing board and she said no. We arrived late and upon checking in, we were told that there was no room for us. How outrageous! Since there were 2 parties that were traveling, we reserved 2 rooms and received confirmation for 2 rooms. Now they were telling us there was no room and no apology. I'm not sure if the staff does not understand English or they pretend not to understand English when it comes to confrontation. After hours of waiting, we found an Asian guy in the hallway who told us that he was one of the 2 maintenance guys for this hotel but because he was sick, he was not on duty that night. How can a 700 room hotel only have 2 maintenance staff? He showed us a room but it was a storage room rather than a hotel room. There were all sorts of furniture and black plastic garbage bags piling in the room and in the closet. There was no light fixture, the whole room was lit by a naked 25 watt light bulb on the ceiling. I thought I was in a holding cell. The room was dusty and stunk. They tried to make the bed and cleared out all the debris in the room but when they almost finished vacuuming the room, the other maintenance guy was called to handle another emergency (turned out that this hotel has millions of emergencies because NOTHING works). There was NO towel in the room and when we asked for towels, the off duty maintenance guy told us to go to the maid closet to get them ourselves! The room key did not work so we were locked out of our room for a long time. We went down to front desk and management grabbed the maintenance guy when he exited from the elevators. The maintenance staff did not even have a walkie talkie or any other devices to help them do their jobs. The minute he showed up, a whole crowd of customers bombarded him with problems and issues, I had to dragged him to our floor to have him take care of my problem before others started taking over. We had to fight to get our problems taking care of! The bathroom door knob was missing, so the hotel tied a string from the door to the wall so we could open the bathroom door! There was NO hot water, I'm not sure if there was heat in the room (luckily for us, we were there on Thanksgivine week and the temperature was in the 40s and 50s so it was not so cold). We were awaken 3 times that night because the heat was so old that it cranked up and made horrible loud noises. There were only 3 elevators in the hotel and the night we were there, only two were in operations and we ended up having to use stairs to get to our 5th floor room. The other party was not so lucky, they ended up on the 21st floor so they had to wait for 10-15 minutes for the elevator each time. We ended up not daring to leave our rooms because we did not want to be subject to other \"surprises\". We checked out the next day and vowed NEVER to come back. Advice to the next traveler: Do not be fooled by their cheap price. It's not worth it. By staying in this hotel, you subject yourself to compromising hygiene situations and countless outrageous customer service nightmares. I have traveled to developing countries and am used to substandard accomodations and service. Nothing compares to my hotel Carter experience, perhaps because Carter is in the heart of New York, right in Times Square, one would expect them to maintain at least a clean and functional place for tourists to spend the night. This hotel is far from being clean and functional. It is a dump and in my opinion, for approximately $100/ night, a very reasonable price comparing to New York standard, you end up paying too much. I intend to write to the City of New York's BBBs, the Department of Consumer Affairs and the city's Health Department about this experience. The fact that Carter hotel continues to be in operations in light of all these complaints remain a mystery to me.", "Date": "December 30, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cEnter if you dare!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2900655", "Content": "This I can honestly say, no exaggeration, was the WORST hotel I have ever seen in my life.

We have stayed at this hotel twice and to this day I can not believe that we went back for a second time. Yes it is cheap (for New York) and we were prepared the second time, but this hotel is incredible!! On our first trip I did not take my socks off the whole time I stay here (5 nights) as I was afraid to touch the carpet, I also opted to sleep in long pants and t'shirts rather than my normal pyjamas of fear of laying on the sheets. We witnessed cockroaches and mice and there was a blow up doll outside our window!

Even the 1 bullet \"Terrible\" rating is giving the hotel more credit than it deserves. My American friend and I survived our 4-night stay. We will go to heaven for being tolerant to the challenges posed by this hotel and did not suffer our friendship during our stay. Well we aced it all probably because: a) of my humble background in my upbringing in Asia - as an Asian I was taught to embrace the vicissitudes of life with humility and gratitude; b) we were seasoned travellers to NYC (you cannot deny the charm of this bright-light big-city juicy Apple); and c) we were so drained after a 20 hour flight from Asia to NYC that having a roof over our head and being away from the rain and cold in NYC in Dec were decent and welcoming!! BUT - surviving it all and being accepting do not mean allowing others to suffer unnecessarily the same horror which pales the Hammer House of Horror series. So do yourself a favour to get a better insight into the mismanagement of this hotel BEFORE you commit to part with your hard-earn money and risk ruining your deserving holiday in NYC. I read the reviews here with fond memories of our stay and agree to almost all of the minimal good and endless bad reviews. WHAT IS ATTRACTIVE ABOUT THIS HOTEL? The good side is that the hotel is in GREAT LOCATION right in the smack of Times Square and theatre district. This helps in saving a lot of time walking, and rushing from point to point - particularly from dinner / shopping to your theatre show. You can always hop back to the hotel to rest before you embark on the 'second' part of your sight-seeing of the wonderful city if you choose a hotel in great location e.g. next to a metro station. This is probably THE ONLY REASON that the hotel survives the very, very, very bad reviews still stands there today. I am surprised that there are no law suits against them yet. Now, what you are going to read are stuff which DATELINE, 20/20, 60 MINUTES and similar current affairs shows on your National TV should take up as a story - better still - with hidden cameras! a) BOOKING ON THE INTERNET The hotel website is pretty simple and decent enough to complete your booking transaction. Indeed - the Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS model) works like a charm on the website. Teachers - use it as an exemplar when teaching your students Information-Computer-Technology (ICT). But, the RATES DO CHANGE AT THE LAST MINUTE - so print out COPIES of your booking confirmation to settle any dispute. I am forwarding a copy of the confirmation e-mail to my credit card issuing bank to dispute paying the difference. b) RECEPTION Do not expect customer service. Be nice to the staff and they reciprocate. I gave the booking confirmation to the Asian lady at the reception to process my booking. She did not return them, saying that she needs them for records. I suspected that the reason she held on to them was to con me of the sudden higher revision of the room rates when she saw me reading the rates table on the counter - which - was then immediately removed by her 'floor manager' Henry - a senior Asian who seemed resigned to the state of affairs working (and owning?) the hotel. She was also on the phone when processing my booking. I could be arrested if I repeat what she hollared to the caller verbatim here. I had to WAIT to pay for our 4-night stay in full by credit card (cos the machine was not ready) as well as to get a key to the higher floors (cos the computer was not ready). We compromised for a lower floor room in the end - and wasted an hour waiting to get to the room after we arrived promptly via shuttle from JFK airport. c) MAYHEM AT THE RECEPTION You will be entertained by near Jerry Springer-like mayhem and shanigens in the exchanges between the guests and the hotel staff every now and then. We witnessed such situations when we checked in during late afternoon, and checked out at 6 a.m. d) DECOR The talent of Martha Stewart will REALLY be put to test to deploy her to do community work for making over this hotel - if she has the life time and talent to do it. The pieces of carpets at the reception level were criminally mismatched that your eyes hurt - probably used as a strategy to de-range you so that you will lose out to any possible arguments with them. e) ROOM I do not know about the higher floors. It may help if you get them and have a decent view of the city. Our room had curtains that could not be drawn. The heater worked on the first night when we checked in - in fact - overworked that it was so hot that we perspired. Luckily, there were a couple of unsealed areas around the air con unit (which was new) which we manipulated to allow fresh cold air to circulate into the room. Can't tell if the air-con unit was a toy. With the holes around in the room, I suspect that there could be occupants other than ourselves i.e. rodents (as claimed by other reviewers), although I did not witness any. I took sleep aids for 2 nights to escape from the horror of reality into slumberland. On the first night we were too exhausted to care. f) TELEPHONE There is a 50 cent charge for local calls. I used my cell phone to pay for any extra charges my home phone company was going to charge as I was NOT going to put that ear piece of the telephone to my ear. My friend from Maryland claimed he called and left messages - which was not indicated by the phone red light. Never heard the phone rang throughout the entire stay there. g) TV You could not even re-sell that antic for free on ebay. Possibly going to be rejected by charity organisations. There were only 2 viewable channels. The rest were fuzzy images. The pin socket was losely connected to the power point and easily kicked off. We did not watch any TV, but turned it on to muffle the air of desolation in the room. h) ROOM KEY, DOOR & LOCK You will better appreciate the functions of keys, door locks and door knobs more than ever in your life. My flexible asian hands renown for fixing anything could not even open and lock the door with the key. My friend did it with care and succeed each time we enter or leave the room. ONCE, THE DOOR KNOB CAME OFF and we had to fix it back. Now I appreciate studying woodwork and metalwork in high school. i) BATHROOM & SHOWER Decent shower curtain. There were 4 taps: 2 for the bath tub and 2 for the shower. We let the water run a while before we shower, just in case there was rust. The cold water shower tap did not work on the first night - but thank god it did subsequently. We showered only in scathing hot water. Finally - you could never completely shut the tap off after that ... drip drip drip every moment after that. j) TOWELS We had to go to reception to ask for new towels every morning (in a nice polite way) before we left for sight-seeing in the city - and the nice caucasian lady I spoke to behind the counter indeed arranged to have our bed made up as well, which, was a bonus to us! God bless her for her good work ethics and earning decent wages in a place like this. k) BED There were yellow stains on the bedsheet - but I convinced my friend that they were iron burnt marks so that he could have restful sleep. There was an extra pillow and blanket in the closet - but we dared not move them. We just hung our jackets in the closet - always fearing that something would jump out of it. We peeled the bed covers off the bed immediately when we got into the room - the carpets looked cleaner. We were amazed that there were no blood stains. l) FLOOR CARPET We were thankful to ourselves for bringing our own flipflops or sandals. We fear having our feet touched the carpet on the floor in the room or tiles in the bathroom. m) CABINETS I was living out of my luggage - but my friend had his clothes in one of the drawers as there was only so much room to place our luggage and things. We found out that the drawer of the pedestal next to the bed which the phone rested on could not be opened when we were looking for a directory. We finally did open it - but did not find any directory. There were left over items from previous generations of guests. OVERALL EXPERIENCE: We could not fault ourselves for choosing the hotel given that it was peak holiday season and we could not get rooms in the better hotels at affordable rates. We have explored checking our previous hotels at higher rates but there were no rooms available. RECOMMENDATIONS: If you have been in the military or working/living in some countries under immensely harsh living conditions, you would probably survive the ordeal and take it with a laugh - even though I perceive that at US $89 per night excl. tax is over-priced for the dilapidated conditions. Like some reviewers who generously gave the hotel an OK rating, it would probably be acceptable if you just need a bed and a roof for the day. But if you do not wish to suffer from disonance after shopping in MACYS, BLOOMINGDALES and designer shops at Madison Ave with all the designer chic goods returning to a slump for accommodation, then I suggest you consider paying the higher price to experience the pleasure, convenience and prestige of other decent hotels. Otherwise you may need therapy after your holiday. We saw many guests got more than what the hotel claims \"Our Room Rates Will Warm You Up\" - the guests certainly got HOTTER in moods than just being warmed up from a ruined holiday living under sordid conditions. Someone reviewed Howard Johnsons as Hostel Johnsons, and I guess now CARTER HOTEL would join the same league as Carter Hostel, fighting very hard NOT to beat HJ to the title.

For three nights I just needed a room, nothing fancy and the location sounded fabulous. Then I got there..... .......where to start, ok well the first thing that hit me was the appaling service on reception, the woman is nasty from the word go, and that is before you have even said anything. Once I got my room key, myself and a colleague went up to the room, then bed had not been changed or made since the last occupant. The floor had I have no idea what on it and there was a damp towel on the side. Then I went into the bathroom, the toilet was dirty with urine on the seat and there was a wet flannel in the sink. Strangely enough the mould on the ceiling didn't bother me that much, nor the resident cockroach. So I went back downstairs to complain, I had checked in well after the check in time and had expected the room to have been cleaned. I really didn't think that was that much to expect. All I really wanted was to have the room tidied, but management offered me another room. The door lock was broken in this room. Really all I wanted was for the first room to be cleaned. I was then guaranteed this would be done by the time I got back in that night. Meanwhile whilst down in reception I spoke to someone who had been into three rooms and was checking out, he was not the only one. One of the rooms he had been shown had a broken lock, the next was already occupied and the final one had the ceiling falling in. Anyway back to my tale, I got back in at half ten, to find that the room still hadn't been cleaned. The guy behind reception ended up cleaning it. I have never been to somewhere where you see so many people constantly checking out in shock over the state of the hotel. Seriously this place is awful, it is not worth your money. It is stressful from the time you move in to the time you leave. Honestly I would not recommend this place to anyone, even my worst enemy!! I really cannot stress enough, do not stay here.

The shower was OK - when it worked and there was hot water, but on the occasions it didn't and there wasn't you left the bathroom feeling dirty. A nice touch was the persistent clunking and thumping of the insane radiator EACH and EVERY day for our six night sojorn. We couldn't open the room door twice and oh, we had a mouse in the room on the last morning. The staff were friendly enough, but ambivalent about the state of the place. The bell boy - not the brighest button in the box - summed it up when he said 'i don't care - they don't pay me enough' and berated the people who complained to him about the state of the place saying he refused to help those who moaned.

At first we just laughed at the missmatched carpets and furniture, the neon lights and the smell. But, when we got to our room, we had to try and open the door for over 10 minutes. But, that was not even half of it. We walked into a room that must have never been cleaned from the last person who was in there. There were shoes left behind, and a razor in the bathub, the closet was filled with garbage and the room smelt horrible. If your okay with that, then thats another story, but may i add there was no electric, let alone cable or atleast one light, the beds were un-made and the bathroom's were not to even be touched. We kindly went down to the lobby, and we had a man bring us up there with a key. The mad tried several rooms, all of them had people in there still. He did not even knock. Finally, we recieved a room. This room also smelt,and the bathroom had flood on the floor, by this time we were completly disgusted, but we had no choice. The manager said he would get us a room tomorrow that was better. That was a lie. The only reason we stayed was because we had no choice, there was nothing else available for that day. By this time all of our Thanksgiving was ruined, we were all stressed out, and grossed out. We all could not get a wink of sleep that whole night, the sheets had hair and holes, the matress was filled with holes and layers of dirt. The entire night we heard rats scurrying. Or what we thought, but there assumtions were true , because the next morning we found out that there were rats in another womens room that night. By this time we were all passed the point of stressed out. We thought that maybe if we got out of the rooms that it would not be that bad, but it was. All we thought about was how disgusting we felt with no showers and god knows what was on our bodies.

After days of searching on the Internet, I came across Carter Hotel. It was well cheap especially for the other prices in New York; we were paying \u00c2\u00a340 per night. So I booked the hotel online. A few days later my friend called me telling me that she had been online and looked at reviews of Carter from other people who had stayed there, and to be honest all the reviews gave a negative image of the hotel. I reassured my friend that it should be fine and that we can't get a better deal than that unless she wants a youth hostel, which has shared facilities! But deep down I wanted to cry I was reluctant to even start my trip. I looked at the confirmation of the hotel and we could not cancel at such short notice.

OK hold your breath because I was, the lady at the desk asked the hotel porter to assist us with our luggage, we had big suitcases, we turned around and wait for it...YES there was a very old man about 75 years old. Small looked like he was about to snap! And he was to carry our luggage; I took my own bags because I felt sorry for him. Anyway went to the room, the door was jammed and the old man had to kick it to open, and this had to be done every time we wanted to enter the room. In the hallway outside our room there was carpet on the walls! One thing that carter did not know about was decorating, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure that Ann Maurice of house doctor is from the USA; carter should be her next project! We walked into our room, and we were like yes its ok for what we are paying but both our faces had disappointed looks on them! We tried to unpack and put things in the closet, but it was jammed and we could not open in, so we were living out of suitcases. The television had one channel with no reception!

I was expecting the worst, considering that I have backpacked, camped and stayed at many hotels and hostels around the world, including countries where hot water was an extreme luxury. We even brought extra sheets from home, just in case! Hotel Carter was pretty bad, but it can be a livable space esp. if you are in NYC on a budget and you want to experience NYC and not the hotel room. You are only two blocks away from Times Square and you really, really can't beat the price of the room. Book on line to save even more money (it cost us only $89 a night). Stay here if you only want a place to sleep, shower and change. Do not expect real hotel amenities!!!

There were questionable people hanging outside (it is NYC) but there was a friendly security guard. As we approached to check in, there was a line in front of us with many complaints, including dirty, wet sheets and being locked from the inside of their room. There was even a family in front of us with Falun Gong pictures pinned to their luggage. The hotel front has big neon signs with a mosaic of cheap small carpets lined together to make the lobby rug. It is quite a sight. Even if you don't decide to stay here, seeing the lobby is a NYC experience! We decided to only stay one night at first since we really didn't know what to expect of the room. There is a $1.00 deposit for the room key (make sure you keep your receipt) and they do make duplicate key right there on the spot if needed. There is also a security deposit box as well to keep your valuables. At one time, it looked like there was a jewelry store located in the lobby as well. The elevators were fast and we got a room on the 12th Floor facing away from 42nd St. (on the quieter side). It was windy in NYC the weekend we were there and our room was outside the \"L\" on the big neon \"Hotel Carter\" sign, but the drapes worked and we were too tired to be bothered by the red light and the banging of the old sign. We were high enough not to hear too much street noise as well. We had clean sheets (don't bother checking underneath the bed), warm water (take your showers early or late at night when there is less usage), and ample closet space. The furniture was old and beat up, but we didn't use either the closet or furniture to place our things. The paint was peeling; the light fixture had no cover. We turned on the TV once, we had about 6 channels, but we didn't bother watching. We had no headboard; instead, it was a hanging carpet underneath the one painting in the room. The bed was king sized and the bathroom was clean. We had clean towels (small), toilet paper and soap. If you needed anything else, there is a little deli downstairs that seemed to be open 24 hours (at least it was open at 2:30 AM). There were a lot of international people who were staying there. Hotel Carter is more like a hostel than a hotel. It is a very old building, looks like it was built in the '30s since there were two separate faucets in the shower for bathing and for the shower. I am sure in it's heyday, this was the place to stay. My advice: Stay for a place to sleep, change and shower. Use the extra money to get a nicer Broadway seat! Don't expect too much.

I felt really ashamed being American thinking if this is their first trip to America what a terrible impression based on that hotel. This hotel really needs to be shut down!!!!!!! I was one of the lucky ones because I booked on my own, I was given a full refund and found a better hotel.

GREAT PRICE, for my boyfriend and i, it was only $110 per night inclusing taxes. while we walked around the city we decided to price out other hotels of the same 1-2 star status and they were not even close! a smaller hotel about 4 blocks away, quoted a price of $179 plus tax per night and we even had to share a bath!! another hotel about 10 blocks away was a bit more modern, but quoted a price of 205 plus tax and the room was the size of a broomcloset with a single bed! YOU WILL NOT FIND A BETTER PRICED HOTEL OR LOCATION. TRUST ME!! 2) bring your own shampoo, because they will only give you tiny bars of soap. 3) if you dont like your room, ask to change it. ours was a lot cozier the second time around. 4) keep your receipts for the key deposit. 5) be nice to them and they will be nice to you. i guess they are true new yorkers! if you know what i mean =) tough!!! 6) do not buy orange or apple juice from the drink machine because you will get a soda. 7) check in time is great! any time after 9:am --- Check out time is better! 1:pm. you can leave your bags in the locker if you have a later flight. 8) if you dont like your room, check out within like 10-15 minutes & you will get your money back.because i saw a couple who tried to get a refund after about 2 hours. i know if it was my hotel i would not give a refund after 2 hours! besides, does it really take 2 whole hours to decide if you want the room?? 9) ask for a room facing the front! fantastic views!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10) go to see the lion king show! right behind the hotel! we thought it was the most entertaining show ever! 11) you must try the cheeseburger deluxe from the little diner in the hotel. after a night of barhopping, this was the best way to relax! 12) get your passports ready cause you will have to show I.D when you check in. 13) out television only had two channels. i called the desk and they sent someone to fix it for us. afterwards, we had 4 channels!! but then again, who needs to watch television when you are right in times square?? 14) take my advice and you will have a great stay. my botfriend and i had a fantastic 10 days at the hotel carter and grew fonder with it as the days passed by. we will be back next year! have a fun trip! -J", "Date": "November 4, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cThought I was on candid camera!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2799206", "Content": "I read all the advice on this website before I left on my trip but decided it could not be that bad!

I usually book through Priceline and have gotten great hotels at great prices - but a group of 5 made a last minute trip and EVERY HOTEL, Hostel and YMCA in Manhattan seemed to be booked unless we wanted to spent more than $450 per night (and even those rooms were tight for all 3 nights). Since the group was on a budget - we booked the Carter which I've known has had a bad reputation for years - but the group agreed that they would rather spend the extra $1,000 per room shopping rather than booking a more expensive hotel. We all survived - didn't spend much time in the room - the bed was OK and plenty of heat and hot water - but as mentioned comes out a strange brown color at first... The rooms have keys that you have to play with to get them to work... and I suspect that many people don't return them for the $1 deposit, so there may be many of them circulating... Use the deposit boxes in the lobby if you have concerns... Our room was dirty when we got there - and the front desk very nicely advised us that it would eventually be cleaned... just wait... We had two rooms - both had their own quirks - peeling paint, bare bulbs, broken/no headboards, dirty towels in the closet, spliced extension cord inventions that I'm sure are illegal by any electrical code, TV with few channels, no hangers, clean but apparently stained sheets, bathroom doors that didn't close - or wouldn't open if pushed tight, no decoration of any kind.... and the doorknob pulled out in your hand whenever pulled... although they did fix that after a complaint. I wasn't brave enough to look under the beds! The maid didn't come after 2 days, so the front desk very nicely advised that maid service was every other day - but that the hotel was full so that they weren't surprised that they didn't clean - but had towels and toilet tissue at the front desk. Now, if you know this before you go - you can probably deal with it when the alternative is no hotel at all or paying lots more money. But a steady stream of people arrived expecting a real hotel and were in shock. As mentioned in other reviews, Abdul is the best resorce for getting any attention and he is very effective in resolving situations - its amazing that another hotel hasn't hired him away... The younger girls at the front desk are sweet and accommodating but can't do much other than give towels, etc. Avoid any of the older employees - you will just get yourself upset.... So - if you just need a bed for the night and don't ASSUME anything except a cheap price - you'll most likely survive your experience and have stories to tell for years.... But, if you expect even minimal standards you'll want to pay more for something else if you can find it.... This is at best a one-star hotel - and only gets this rating due to the private bathrooms... They are putting down lots of new oriental rugs all over the hotel to 'spruce it up' - but I suspect that this hotel will eventually be converted into a more expensive hotel due to its size and location.... It could be a very nice budget hotel with just a little work - but then the price would undoubtably increase by at least double. There were lots of European tour groups there - and its amazing that any tour operator who has stayed there would send clients to the hotel - Europeans have a tradition of staying at budget hotels - but they are usually spotlessly clean and attentive to customers.... but then again, the goups may be happy to trade the cheap price for the opportunity to spend their money shopping rather than sleeping.... There was lots of activity in the hotel by the Falun Gong religious/protest group - not sure if they were staying there or if this is part of their operation like the old New Yorker Hotel was associated with another religious group. All of the members were very nice and there is a table set up in the lobby for group meditation. The deli at street level is small but open 24 hours and of course all of Times Square is at your doorstep... So, considering the situation - I am not unhappy with my decision to stay at the Carter considering the booking situation at all the other hotels - but won't be in a hurry to return.

Fortunately, it turned out not to be so bad after all! I organised a trip for 28 Dutch students, ages varied between 15 and 19, and 4 teachers for a week in May during our break. I already told the students not to have too high expectations of the accommodation, and that it was low budget! However, when we entered the building, things seemed okay, not the Ritz, the staff was nice (okay, maybe they wouldn't pass a general English test), ask for Elaine, the rooms were sufficient (obviously not decorated by that hunky Nate Berkus, often seen on Oprah, or any other modern hip designer), the beds were big (!), the sheets we had were clean, and when they forgot to remake the beds, they did it the day after, and so on. The same for the towels, when you didn't get fresh ones, you just asked for them and they would be given to you, no problems there! Some windows could be stuck! Also the elevators, I read here that some had to wait 15 minutes or langer: BS! The elevator worked just fine! Problems with an unlikely guest, just tell one of the clerks, probably the big black guy, or the PC term African-American, and he will throw him/her out on the spot (only happened once, the poor guy). Some of our students stayed on the 8th floor, and no, there were no ghosts (actually, we stayed at the 6th floor as well, room 624 pretty clean). Yes, you couldn't close the bathroom doors in most cases/rooms, but, hey, if you have a nice bottom, why don't share it (or use the curtain!)! The shower worked well, hot water on the spot! Flush the toilet twice though! And if you need privacy for nr. 2, just go down into the lobby, they had a 'private' toilet down there! The location is great, no worries there, we loved having breakfast at the Europa Cafe, quite tasty! Thus, my opinion is that you could do a whole lot worse! This isn't a 5 star hotel, it's low budget, so what do people expect. None of our students complained, and they are Dutch, so rather picky, like me, and so did none of the teachers! So, if you just want to have a big comfortable bed to sleep in, and a hot shower 24/7, this is a sufficient option! I'll book it again next year when I will return with school!

We had read the reviews about it on Tripadvisor, but being on a limited budget, decided to \"brave it\" anyway. From the reviews, we expected to arrive at a pokey doorway in NY, with no hotel sign, flashing neon lights in the reception area and druggies hanging around in the reception area. However, the Carter is large as life with a big Hotel Carter sign going down the side of the building. Admittedly, some of the letters on the sign were not lit up, but it was obviously a grand old hotel in it's day. The reception was enormous, with oriental designs on the walls, and largely made of marble. The clocks above reception all worked and showed the different times in the main countries of the world. The seating was made of leather and was in good condition. We arrived around 9.30pm on a Saturday night and there were couples in reception waiting to be checked in, who obviously had made no prior booking... We were allocated our room with no problem and all the lifts worked all throughout our stay. There was never any queue for the lifts. However, we did encounter a few young ladies going down in the lifts doing up their clothes, and some young men enthusing about the good time they had just had. We stayed in a room on the 10th floor, room no 1028. It was a large room with an enormous bed that would quite easily have slept 4 people. We left the room key in the door on the first night by mistake but had no trouble. Yes, the decor and carpets etc were dated, it reminded me of hotels in 1970's films, it was like going back in time, but in a reminisscent sort of way. It was clean enough and we saw no cockroaches. Room no 1028 was great. It was on the corner so had 2 windows and was very airy and ight, with a great view up the street towards Times Square. The bathroom was clean and we had constant, very hot, water. The shower was like nothing I have experienced in UK, the power was out of this world - had to hold onto the window ledge to avoid being knocked over!. Worth visiting just for the shower power! We left it clean and tidy all the time so did not really notice if cleaners came in, but did notice the bins emptied, and towels and loo papers replaced a couple of times. Nothing was stolen. The TV had only about 3 channels that were not too fuzzy to watch, they were main stations with good films, but we did not go to New York to watch TV. Radio stations had good reception. Calls from the room to reception were not answered. The heating, as it came on was extremely noisy, a bit like a ratchet at a football match, but we found it funny and it did not bother us at all. The windows would not stay open by themselves, so we held them open with cans of Pringles, which worked fine. My main gripe was that on the bed was only a thin eiderdown, and it would have been very cold at night had I been alone. They were old grey scratchy material type blankets in the cupboard, which looked like old dog blankets which needed chucking in the bin. Would not have considered sleeping under them. Whilst we were there we only saw people on the 10th floor once, on the Saturday night and would not have been surprised if we were the only ones staying on that floor for the rest of the time. There was certainly no noise at night, apart from the street, which was a constant sound of car horns and shouting, but nothing to do with the Carter. No-one can expect peace and quiet in central New York. Location was fantastic, right in the middle of everything. The price was also v good especially for the location - the equivalent to \u00c2\u00a3158 each for 7 nights - no hidden extras. Gave us extra spending money for outside the hotel, which was for us just a base and somewhere to sleep. The staff seemed aloof and cold to start with, but as the week progressed and we did not complain, they became friendlier. However, whilst waiting for my boyfriend in reception one day, one poor chap went to reception laden with suitcases and said he was there to check out. The receptionist (they are all of Asian origin) barked \"Give me your key\", which he did and left without any response such as \"Thank you\" or \"have a good journey\" etc. On the last day we were told to check out by 10am and left our bags with the bell boy who put them in a room for $1 for the day. He was the friendliest person there, could not have been more friendly. I think it would only take a cosmetic facelift to restore Carter to the grand place it obviously once was. I would stay there again (but not alone being female as would be nervous of someone tryig to pick me up in the lift). Tip - ask for a corner room e.g no 28 on any floor as I understand the rooms not in the corners were dark and not so large and airy. If you want to spend twice as much for all mod cons, do not stay at the Carter. However, if you want a basic place to sleep, and do not expect room service, up tp date decor etc, the Carter is OK.

This hotel is absolutely HORRIBLE! After we checked in, we actually went around to nearby hotels to see what kind of availability & rates they had. But b/c we arrived in NYC on Good Friday, everything was booked/expensive (ie. $150-$250/nt). So we decided to tough it out at this DUMP of a hotel. We paid for 8nts at $80/nt before taxes. And during this time, our room was 'cleaned' ONCE (by 'clean' i mean they made our bed, picked up our old towels, and emptied the garbage. So, that means no new sheets, no vacuuming of the carpet or sweep of the bathroom, etc). All the other nights we went down to the lobby to get our own towels & toilet paper b/c they 'forgot' to clean our room. Not only that, they don't believe in vacuuming so the nasty carpet from the lobby to the corners of our room was covered with dirt & filth from the many guests before us. And the bathroom sink and floor was covered with hair from the previous guests - it was disgusting. When we turned on the A/C in our room to air out the cigarette stench, clouds of dirt came out. The bathroom door didn't shut, nor did the taps turn off completely. The first few nights, there was no hot water in the evenings and there were huge line ups to use one of the 3 elevators (i'm talking like a 10-15min wait). The staff is RUDE, RUDE, RUDE - no concept of smiling or customer service, they more or less just glared at you as you walked by. On the plus side, this hotel is in a PRIME location, in the heart of Times Sq and within walking distance to most sites. And we did have our own bathroom. But you know what, we met a couple while in line for Letterman tickets and they told us they booked via Priceline, and they paid $90/nt for a 4star hotel in midtown (the Sheraton). So, i'd recommend for anyone wanting to enjoy their vacation and stay in a hotel to splurge a bit and find other accomodations - save yourself the heartache of paying for this DUMP.

Instead of wallpaper, there was colorful carpet on the walls. When you're in the lobby, make sure that your watch has the correct time on it...or else you may be a little confused.

We choose hotel Carter because all other hotels were full or too expensive (we paid $36 p.p. including tax). Because we read the reviews we tought the worst!! At the end we staid 5 nights at the Carter so it wasn't that bad: We could choose between two rooms and we choose a small room with two BIG beds and a great shower (better than in my home in Amsterdam!). The floor under the bed wasn't clean, the window was broke and the room looks oldfashioned. Also our view wasn't like the internet told us to be but we were only in the hotel for a sleep and shower so that was o.k.. Tip: When you want to see a great view of TQ have a drink in the Marriot Hotel. The last night the man in the lobby took us to the rove for a view and showed us the better rooms (we didn't knew there were better rooms so when your room isn't o.k. ask for another one). The location is perfect and we had a really great time in NY. Good Luck and have fun!!

So I know what to expect. BUT this so-called \"hotel\" was just... horrible. I had to stay in a hotel until my house was fixed. I didn't want to spend that much money and I wanted to stay near my office. It was the biggest mistake of my life. I don't even understand why people call this a \"hotel\". I have stayed at other cheap hotels, and I was never so furious. As I walked in, the smell from the deli inside the hotel greeted me. The receptionist woman was rude. There was only one key for each room. Yes, a \"KEY\", not the passcard you get in other hotels. And you have to deposit $1 for the key. I would never ever want to steal that key... There was even a homeless guy, sitting at the chair in front of elevator and staring at my legs. Elevator door closed after I pressed \"door close\" button for the hundredth time. Once I got to 15th floor, room doors made me think that I'm walking to my cell in prison. Ok, now... the \"room\" I got. I got the mini-suite room, since it was the same price as the regular double room and it has to be more spacious. Once I entered the room, I saw dirty, purple carpet with children's drawing-like patterns. It looked like it was vacuumed a year ago. And, the room had \"matching\" purple curtain with cigarette burns. Alright, the \"hotel\" people have a different, or rather a bad taste. But the room didn't have to smell like cigarette. Yes, I requested a smoking room, but I didn't request any room filled with cigarette smell. I walked in to the bathroom. The door didn't close. Water was licking from the pipe. There was no hot water. And yes, I almost forgot. As I was turning on the water, the handle fell and I almost broke my toe. I kind of regret that I missed my toe. If it broke my toe I could have sued the \"hotel\". Damn! I turned on the TV, and found out that not only they don't provice cable, but only channel 7 was watchable. Other channels were just statics with little bit of sound. Even those cheap crappy motels have HBO. Don't ever stay there. If you are a budget traveler, spend a little more time searching the yellowpage and get other cheap but not horrible hotel in the city. Remember, NO hot water, doors don't close, rude receptionist, smelly, dirty room with purple carpet and curtain (I wouldn't want to know what colors other rooms were decorated). EVEN 80 BUCKS A NIGHT IS NOT WORTH IT!!!", "Date": "February 16, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anchorage, AK", "Title": "\u201cA grand stay...really...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1626948", "Content": "The Carter is well, the Carter. you get what you pay for.

Get over it, it is what it is and will always be Goddess willing. I found if you aren't a ****, the \"help\" is actually made up of human beings that will tell you where to go and help you out if they can, just don't try and lean on them, good way to get screwed. Can't blame them. P.S. If you need food get the cabbage rolls for 2.50 for 2, they call em egg rolls but who's kidding who. Best deal going.

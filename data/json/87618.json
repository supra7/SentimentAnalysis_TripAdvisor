Planned trip last minute, so closer, affordable hotels were booked. Got a good value. Room was clean, pleasant, enjoyed the shower and soaps. Nice view on the 28th floor. Staff was professional beginning to end, parking was easy. Grabbing taxis was super easy and less than $15 everytime (Shedd, museums under $10). No internet, we used our smartphones-no big deal. We had a few beers and a woodfired margherita pizza in lounge evening we arrived- other travellers were enjoying themselves, vibe was fine and wife liked pizza. Staff down to earth and nice that eve. Enjoyed a quiet dip in pool early one morning, made wife happy. Sunjday morning we left we had breakfast bar- it was nice, not super variety, but nice quality stuff for $19. The staff was really great. Brought us tasty homemade salsas for our omelettes, coffee in press was good, fruit was good.

The Hyatt McCormick Place has moved me enough to do so. They've got a monopoly on the convention center and they know it. Prices are exorbitant and what you get for it is sorely lacking. The rooms are a completely disgrace to any Hyatt. Twice I've stayed here and twice the sheets in a new room showed stains. They were fresh sheets all pressed and tight but there were brown stains on the edges. The bathrooms are quite the joke, a cube like relic from the 90s that can barely fit a toilet let alone a bath. The shower lets out a high pitched whine every time you turn it on and the shower curtains aren't long enough to cover the entire bath and you almost always end up with a wet bathroom floor. The vanity fixtures are dated and barely functional. Even the closet is just a curtain drawn across a small cutout space. The absolute worst part is the noise. The walls are paper thin. You here both adjacent rooms at the same time. It's not just a dull muffle, its full on conversations and even cell phones on vibrate. That is just downright ridiculous. Whenever a door shuts 5 rooms away, you get jolted up in the middle of the night. I'm not a light sleeper but this hotel design is a joke. And by the way, you can pay an upcharge for fridge in your room. Seriously??? Unless you absolutely have no choice or just like to suffer, stay far far away from this dump.

Apparently I should have seen what was going on in the area. The Hyatt's parking was $30 a night because the 2012 Auto Show was happening! Because of our busy day we only booked one night of the over priced parking and one night down the road. There isn't much dining selections outside the hotel so my boyfriend and I settled for the sports bar place there. The waiter was really nice and talked to us and told us to sign up for Hyatt Gold Passport because if you book two nights, you get one night free. I asked him if it counted if I bought Priceline. He assured me that the program did. They slipped my bill under the door and it had an unknown gratuity charge that I was never charged before at any Hyatt. I went downstairs to the receptionist and explained it to him so the charge was removed. (I left cash on the table) I also signed up for Hyatt Gold Passport. Somehow the nice receptionist decided to charge me another night of $30 parking! I emailed Hyatt about my issues and they responded that buying through Priceline doesn't count and they will email me back about my parking charge. I'm still waiting. It's been over a week! So overall the parking was outrageous! The hotel was clean. The bathroom was outdated. So unless you are working at the McCormick Convention Center.

Because of the cheap rate compared to other family oriented suite type hotels in downtown Chicago, we were able to get two adjoining rooms. Our children enjoyed having their own space, while my wife and I enjoyed the city view at night out of our room. The pool is deep for young kids, as it is a lap pool with no stairs and no depth less than 4 feet, but our kids still enjoyed the pool as an adult was always in the pool with them and there was never anyone trying to swim laps. Both of us adults used the workout room every day and the equipment was in the best shape of any hotel workout area I have seen. It was up to date and well lit with tons of windows. The best part of this hotel is its location in relation to the museum area of Chicago. Our whole family walked the 1 mile to Shedd's Aquarium and the Field Museum twice. The one morning it was a long walk as it below freezing with a strong north wind, but we made it in less than 30 minutes. It's a great walk with a few city blocks, then past Soldier Field, and through the park by the Lake. We also drove to Science and Industry, found free street parking, and that was only about 10 minutes away. Also drove to Greek Town which is within 4 miles. Great experience. Parking at the hotel is $30 to park your own car, which in our experience is reasonable in downtown Chicago. There is no free wifi which is why this hotel gets many low ratings, but is a business oriented hotel next to the convention center, and again isn't different from many business hotels in that practice. The only other negative for families is other than the restaurant/lounge at the hotel, there are no immediately accessible dining options. The closest is a McDonald's a few blocks away, and then after that, it's probably 1 mile to others. Worth mentioning too, in contrast with many of the reviews, is that our experience with the staff, both at the counter and concierge, was incredibly positive.

Location: Only for conventions. The only reason to stay here is its proximity to McCormick Place convention center. It would not be suitable for anyone staying in Chicago for tourist reasons, as there are far more nicely situated hotels in \"The Loop\" for the same price or less. Value: My room was $189, AAA rate. Interestingly, I was told that $220 was the cheapest rate at the hotel by two different staff, yet when I requested AAA rate, both people dropped the rate by $30. They did not ask for my AAA card at check in. Room: Average. Standard chain hotel, with the awkward surprise of the \"closet\" being built out into the room and closed off by shower curtains. Bathroom small, with below-average amenities. Room size adequate. Long distance view from 29th floor but it was a south side room, facing away from the Loop, so the view was not very interesting. Noisy room: distinct noises from hall and adjoining rooms - slamming doors, running water, flushing toilets, ice dispenser. The room was very clean. Restaurants: Unacceptably poor. This is not in a part of town surrounded by nightlife and restaurants. I would not walk outside alone after dark. You are pretty much stuck here unless you want to drive. At 6:45 tonight when I went down for dinner, the restaurant was closed for a private function. The pizza restaurant was also closed - 1 1/2 hours early. The guest guide said it would close at 8pm, but it had closed at 6:30. Therefore, at 6:45PM there was no open restaurant - just room service or a crowded and boisterous bar (not an appealing choice for a tired, hungry, older female). The hotel should not have closed the pizza restaurant early when the only other restaurant was privately booked. Service: I agree with the earlier reviewer juju030 who said the service is terrible. Exception: Erik at the front desk was terrific at check in. No other staff approached his level of service. The staff in the halls avoided my smile. The concierge desk seemed to think I was out of line for complaining about the lack of any restaurant at suppertime. I was on hold 5+ minutes when I finally called room service, and was told it would take 35 minutes to bring up my salad. The room service staff were unresponsive to my complaint about the lack of a restaurant. Overall: This reviewer travels a great deal, and know that any hotel can deliver uneven results. However the uniformly lackluster aspects of this hotel, its poor location, noisy and odd rooms, and abysmal customer service would all keep me from recommending it to anyone unless they MUST stay at the convention center.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA hidden treasure with a Great staff\u201d", "Author": "Powerplant66", "ReviewID": "UR124872960", "Content": "Thomas the front desk manager made it possible for me, my brother, my two sons and their two friends to have an impropmtu overnight adventure.

Last time I was here, which was some light years ago, had a nice stay. There is 1 suggestion however. I would Like to see some form of an Exciting and Thrilling experience be added to this complex. That being, a Free Fall type of ride up to the highest point of this 330 foot (33) story complex, where 4 passengers in a gondola (see Great Americas Edge), and ascend up an Elevator shaft all the way to the highest belconing. Once the car is ascended to the Hotels Highest point, it sits for just seconds before the car is released and drops 330 feet streight down, at so many mph. Patrons riding this ride, would land on their backs at the end of this ride, with the bottom track being dug underneath the Hotel instead of It being layed out on the street. It be a great adrenalin rush unlike any other in the USA and North America ever experienced anywhere. It would add to the Chicago South loop and would just add soo much to the City and add business in the area. It would unify partons from all over Chicago, and make the surrounding area, be more active and happening. This would be Only seasonal as the harsh Winters and even early spring weather is always unpredictable. It be a Summer & early Fall attraction only. There would be little construction on the Inside, as the 8 Gondolas would take an Elevator shaft through the actual Building. However, the Drop, would be on the outside of the West End of the Hotel complex. I would really consider this a thought and would try this .

Additionally, with lots of kids staying in the hotel for this competition, there were kids running up and down our hall at 10:30 one night screaming. I called the front desk, and they immediately had security up to our floor and put a stop to it. One tip: We reserved through the hotel website, and they have some kind of standby deal where you can upgrade your room for just $15 if they have empty upgraded rooms when you check in! We did this and it was SO worth it! We got a City View room on the 33rd (top) floor, and the fantastic view of the lake and the Chicago skyline was one of the highlights of our stay! Hotel is very far from shopping/sites, but a bus pass bought at the front desk was all we needed for super-easy transportation! The bus stop is right outside the hotel, and it takes you straight up Michigan Avenue. Perfect, and so much cheaper than cabbing it around town. Beds were comfy, room service great - I might possibly even stay here again even if we didn't have an event in the hotel or the convention center!

It is a convention center hotel, so most people will probably take a taxi or the airport express, but I wanted to save some money as I was not in a rush. So for those of you like mind, I can at least offer instructions from Midway airport. - take orange line directly from midway airport. Buy a fare card for $2.50 (2.25 for train, .25 for transfer to bus) or you can get a day or multiway pass if you think you'll use more transit. Get off at Roosevelt and exit the station. You'll need to find out which direction is East (you'll be facing either north or south depending on which exit you use). Walk two blocks east to Michigan (passing wabash) and catch a number 3 bus heading south. In about 5 minutes, you'll get to McCormick Place stop (yes, the stop is actually named that). Cross the street and there you are 2.50. As for the hotel, the service was extremely friendly (actually everyone is really friendly here... Chicago is becoming one of my favorite cities). I also booked a horseshoe hammond casino rate, and there is a free shuttle bus going there and back daily from the hotel (saving you about 160 bucks). Free airport check in machines in lobby is great too. Food in restaurant was very good, although a bit on the pricier side. Rooms very clean, but I have to be honest, a bit dated. The bathroom needs a makeover if the hotel is to compete with the trendier hotels like W etc. Also, the \"closet\" is basically a cubby hole covered with a curtain. That I have not seen before at a Hyatt. Also, rooms are not very soundproofed, so if you are planning to make \"noise\" be forewarned.

My only problem, which was a large one, was the noise. I don't think that our room had any insulation! The first night there were kids in room 3101 celebrating their 21st birthday. The noise was ridiculous. Security was called up to their room several times and it did finally settle down, but not until well after midnight. We could hear any little noise in the hallways and very early the next morning people started getting up and slamming their doors. We got virtually no sleep that night. We did tell the front staff this and we were told to let them know if we had any other concerns. But what can they do? As much as I thought the hotel was lovely, I am not sure that I will return based on the noise. We could even hear the people next door talking! That being said, the staff does go out of its way to help you. We took both taxi's and the #3 bus. The bus is cheap, but can take quite some time. Taxi would cost us about $10 - $13 to get downtown. Breakfast at the hotel was delicious. We did not use any other amenities. My father works for Hyatt, so I have stayed in many of them throughout the country and I have to say that this staff were some of the best in any hotel.

This is a pretty nice hotel--I wouldn't rave and brag about it being 4-star because in so many respects, when I laid my head down to sleep every night, I still felt like I was sleeping in a 3-star hotel room. My boyfriend and I won 2 nights here through Priceline for a holiday, so we understood that we really weren't in any position to complain about much. However, there were a couple of things that we THOUGHT would be expected, considering that we were still at a supposedly fancy place. 1. The walls are INCREDIBLY thin. If you stayed in that hotel with us that weekend, we could tell you everything that you did. We knew when you went to the bathroom. We knew when you showered. We knew when you fought in your hotel room three doors down for 2 hours. And we knew that your devilish 5-year-old did NOT want to take a bath, go eat breakfast, or do anything else that you politely asked them to do. They really should do something about the walls. 2. I appreciate the plethora of parking...especially since the hotel is in a major city. But when that doorman told us that daily parking was $33 and valet was $45, we almost had a heart attack. lol I guess that's more of a heads up for everyone. 3. You'd think that SOME of the money they're milking out of everyone would go towards the beds, considering that that's really what you're paying for. I know hotels aren't really using real boxsprings anymore, but the things that these mattresses were resting on were horrible! They made noises uncomfortable. They were cheap, wherever they got them from. We actually spent the next 2 nights at a run-of-the-mill Marriott in Detroit, and their beds--amazing! Felt like I was in a 4-star bed...kinda how I thought I was going to feel when I slept here. This alone made me want to never stay at this hotel again. Yes, I understand you pay for the name when you stay at this kind of hotels, but I mean, a bed is a standard luxury. If you're going to act like you're a luxury hotel, get a luxury bed! Or at least one that you can sleep in (not ON, in!) Great big fail on this front, guys. Minus one star. 4. I had a sink that took forever to process. It kind of annoyed me! You'd think this could be easily fixed with some Drain-o. Not a big deal, but it urked me. Good thing we had to sinks to work from. All in all, it really is a beautiful hotel. The decor inside is amazing, and the restaurants looked lovely (we chose to eat inside the city instead of splurging on hotel food). And you'd think with it being as tall as it is, the views would be better, but from our room, it really wasn't much. Doesn't help that it's not in the best part of Chicago--don't worry, you're not in the \"hood\" by any means, but you're definitely not in the thriving bustle of the city. So there you have it! Four star on paper, three star (to me) in reality. Will I stay there again? Not if I have a choice! I'm a little spoiled when it comes to my sleep. Would I recommend staying there?

Every Saturday night I was entertained by a fireworks show off Navy Pier, and I could see it all from my wall of windows. The staff members were extremely accommodating, doing everything they could to help me feel at home during my month-long stay. If I needed extra hangars, they were in my room within five minutes. One staff member actually helped me carry a heavy box to FedEx in McCormick Place to ship before I left. The hotel is often quite busy, and the elevators sometimes get busy, but the lobby areas are expasive and comfortable. There is a #3 bus stop right out front that will take you all the way down Michigan Avenue, so the distance from the city wasn't that much of a setback. The area was nice, and I even walked around the neighborhood at night and would see families walking their dogs (depending on which direction you turn as you leave the hotel...).

The specifics of the Amtrak issue are for another review, but that incident resulted in my first experience with the Hyatt Regency/McCormick Place, the hotel for which Amtrak provided over-night vouchers. Several dozen tired passengers descended upon the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reception staff very late on the evening of 18 August. [NOTE: Despite the late hour, no suspicious or \"unsavory\" characters were observed either in the lobby or outside in the driveway/drop off area.] As a veteran solo female traveler, believe me, I NOTICE things like that!] The Amtrak group\u00e2\u20ac\u201don the whole\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwas not especially happy, given the missed connections and the resulting confusion about rebooking. While I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak for any of the others, my observations of and dealings with the Hyatt staff suggest that they were unfailingly professional, patient, and charming as they collected the Amtrak vouchers and routed everyone to rooms. My room was delightful\u00e2\u20ac\u201dclean, nicely decorated, furnished with a comfortable bed and a flat screen TV (albeit with skimpy channel choices). The bathroom was huge in comparison with one provided by another major hotel chain (in California, earlier in my trip). My only complaint\u00e2\u20ac\u201da minor annoyance\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwas that several of us (assigned rooms on the same floor) thought we had malfunctioning key cards until security arrived to tell us that they are to be inserted/removed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slowly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Most keycards I have encountered like a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quick\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trip through the reader. If operation speed is a known characteristic of this particular kind of keycard, the staff should inform guests upon issuing the card, rather than have the guest arrive at the room, find that the door remains locked, then has to hunt for a house telephone to summon help. Amtrak also provided cash stipends to each of us to defray meal and cab expenses. The next morning I used some of that cash to enjoy a tasty breakfast in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Shor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd restaurant. I was pleased to find French press coffee available\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust like I have at home. Upon departing, the reception staff was cordial and the doorman was more than helpful in securing a cab and assisting with my luggage. Regarding parking fees: Obviously, I did not have a car to park on this occasion. On many trips, however, I do. Parking fees ranging as high as $50 per night (for self-parking) are not uncommon at major hotels in major cities. Often I find they are little more than very expensive \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hunting licenses,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since many hotels do not (claim they \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cannot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) ensure that spaces are limited to paying guests/legitimate event attendees. Even when driving locally (I live in the Washington DC metro area) I am not surprised to find hourly parking fees in excess of $10 to $20, whether at hotels or other controlled public parking garages. The Hyatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charge of $30 per day is not, in my experience, especially high or unusual. What is, in my opinion, an excessive fee: Steep daily charges for Internet access. This comment applies to most large hotels, and is a concern noted by other reviewers of this one. It is my experience that Internet charges tend to be inversely proportional to the size of the hotel company. Many smaller hotels, in fact, offer free wireless/high speed connections. Yet, every time I am in a Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, etc., 24-hour Internet fees run $10 to $12 or more. Perhaps (private sector) business travelers can voucher that cost. As a federal employee, I cannot. Do I have to incur those charges? No way! Two years ago I acquired an air card for my laptop. I suggest that other travelers consider that option for themselves. I travel frequently\u00e2\u20ac\u201dboth alone for business and with family/friends for leisure\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand have had a variety of experiences with hotels and other lodging options around the US and in Europe. My brief, unexpected stay at this Hyatt Regency certainly compares favorably with other major hotel chains I have used. I do agree that, for visiting center-city Chicago sites, the McCormick Place location may not be optimal. The many transportation options in Chicago certainly could negate that concern, however. On balance, I would have no qualms about choosing the Hyatt Regency/McCormick Place for a future stay, apart from the fact that Chicago has so many well run, well placed, tempting options from which to choose.", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Stay at this hotel, Great Service!\u201d", "Author": "luv2explore", "ReviewID": "UR78160751", "Content": "First of all, let me start by saying that take all the Tripadvisor reviews with a grain of salt. I was very nervous before I checked into this hotel because of all the negative reviews, however I can state that I had absolutely a positive experience. The only major negative about this place (which can not be changed) is the location. Yes, it is somewhat of an inconvenience being a bit out of downtown area, however with a CTA bus pass, it is very convenient to get there. I won this hotel on Priceline and for the price I paid for a 4 star property, I easily overlooked this. The lobby is beautiful. My room had no issues like all the other posters speak about. I asked for a city view room, and was given an incredible room with a great view. I could easily see many of the Chicago attractions from my room. The elevators were fast; I did not feel I had to wait excessively at anytime. The last and the most important thing about this hotel was it's service. Everyone is very friendly and they truly go out of your way to make your stay comfortable. One example was when we needed to heat up milk for my child at around 11PM, we called the front desk and a manager opened up the coffee shop for us to use. Overall, I think it's a great place to stay if you can get a good deal on priceline, or are there for a convention, etc. I would recommend it. Some other notes: Internet---The hotel charges $9.99/day for internet -- lucky for me, I was able to connect to my droid and use the tethering feature to get internet on my laptop.

The neighborhood is dicey and I wouldn't walk around here after dark. There is, literally, nothing in terms of decent food (or anything else) within easy walking distance. There is a decent tapas place a short cab ride away (Tapas Valencia) and a decent Italian cafe (Cafe Bionda, but watch out for the $15 house wine), otherwise, nothing. The hotel has a restaurant, but a 4 oz. steak is $35, plus they charge you $6 extra (!) for each side. Now that's arrogance. On top of that, the food is terrible. The potatoes they served were cold, the chicken was rubbery and could have bounced off the walls, and the crab cakes made most of the people in the group who ate them sick with the runs. The food was likely cooked in advance for the group and left to sit, or else someone didn't wash their hands properly. There is a pizza place downstairs, but in a town that's famous for its pizza, this place gets trounced by your average Domino's. I might expect this of a third or fourth rate hotel, but for a Hyatt? Really? For the most part, the staff makes a good effort, but it's spotty. Someone in the party had trouble trying to get to sleep with people in the corridor making noise, so she called security. What do they do? Come to her room to discuss the problem, with an open door, in full view and earshot of the people she was complaining about. Not very smart. The result was the people who were noisy made a point of slamming doors all night long to keep her up. She didn't call security again, fearing more trouble. On the plus side, (and it's not much, but at least it's something) they've made an effort with an improved fitness center. Still no bench or Olympic weights, but at least they've added some Life Fitness machines to the ubiquitous and generally useless Universal-type apparatus, so you can at least get a halfway decent workout.

I think of the two the McCormick Place Hyatt is more modern and has probably been more recently updated. The room was very clean, the room design was more current, and the bathroom fixtures were newer. On the other hand, I think the service at this hotel was perhaps not as serene as at the Hyatt on Wacker - I had longer waits to speak with the concierge/front desk at the McCormick Place Hyatt, and I got some \"I don't knows\" from the front desk in response to questions they should have been able to accommodate. One example was when we inquired regarding the Metra, which is the closest public transportation option to our hotel - they didn't have any schedules on hand and could not tell us anything about using it. Another example - I left an item in my room when I checked out, and one of my colleagues who was still in the room brought it down to be mailed to me and filled out a FedEx slip with my name and address. Due to a lack of communication between the front desk and the packing departments, however, calls to the front desk about my item the next day got a response that they didn't know anything about it. After calling back again, and speaking to shipping, where it turns out my item would have languished until I managed to get connected to someone who knew something about it, they finally took my credit card information and sent my item, which I have since received. I am inclined to attribute some of this confusion to the fact that many people were checking out the day I did, and I had confidence that this issue would eventually be resolved satisfactorily, but I think the front desk could strive to emulate the focus on service that the Hyatt on Wacker demonstrated to me during my stay there.That said, for attending a conference in Chicago I wouldn't stay anywhere else.", "Date": "October 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "michael30309", "Title": "\u201cMediocre...not worth the price!\u201d", "Author": "michael30309", "ReviewID": "UR47055881", "Content": "The good: Housekeeping was superb. The clothes I accidently left on the bed were folded and placed on the desk. The hotel connects to the convention center. If you're attending a conference, it's nice to get to the conference in under 5 minutes. The lobby is pretty modern/nice and full of extensive groups of comfortable couches--perfect for doing work or meeting with others. The bad: the walls are SUPER THIN--my neighbor's 2am shower sounded as if it were from my room. You can hear everything from the hallway--from people closing doors to full conversations. Good thing I'm a sound sleeper! The cable wasn't working for half of my trip (likely due to rain-satellite TV I assume). The fitness center (which isn't as extensive as Hyatt boasts) was completely packed each morning between 7-9am. I couldn't get on any of the bikes, elipticals or treadmills. Finally, the rooms were just okay. Nothing spectacular (great views from the top floors facing north). The ugly: NOTHING IS INCLUDED and the ammenities are massively expensive. Internet (which has cut out on me 3x since starting this review) is 10 dollars per day; if you want high speed cable internet, it will cost you 15 dollars per day. Drinks at the bar were 11-14 dollars for well drinks, water/soda is 2.50+ tax, and use of a computer or printer at the business center is about 10 dollars. Because nothing is around the hotel (and the surroundings are a bit sketchy), you're really stuck on paying for highly overpriced room service or ordering delivery. When you factor in a high price per night, you can easily expect to pay 300 dollars per night to stay here. In all, I would recommend this hotel for those who don't care about price and want to stay literally in the convention center. Keep in mind that a taxi here from downtown is 12-15 dollars each way and there is also METRA service and tons of bus service to the convention center.

Also as part of the package was free self park and free wireless internet. The concierge was very helpful and recommended a place for dinner. We did see a show, \"The Color Purple\" at the Arie Crown Center in McCormick Place and getting to and from the show was extremely easy and completely indoors. The hotel does offer a free shuttle to the Mag. Mile but it only leaves on the hour and only has 14 seats so it was booked for any time that we wanted to go. Taxi to the Mile depending on where you are going is $10-15 each way. The room was a fair size and clean. The decor was slightly older but in good shape. Our view from 3313 was AMAZING! We could see Navy Pier, the marina and several of downtowns buildings. The beds at the Hyatt hotels are wonderful and we never have a hard time sleeping:) I did use the Fitness Center and it was very nice and accessible 24 hours.

It's about a $10 cab ride into the city and believe me that cab ride is worth it for the deal you get here. The hotel also has an hourly shuttle to take you into the city.

We tried to secure our rooms an hour before check in...at most hotels you can check in, secure your rooms, but then simply wait until official check in to get your keys while the rooms are being prepared. At this hotel, this is impossible. During a very busy day, they made everyone wait around in the lobby until 3pm. It was packed with people. Why not just check everyone in, and then have them wait to get the key only? Then those who got there early have a better chance of getting the room type requested? As it was for us, we had kids with us and waiting in a packed space is trouble, so we left to go to the aquarium. By the time we came back we were on SEPARATE FLOORS. We were told the next day they would automatically move us to new, connected rooms. Nope. We had to come up and request it again, making us wait to find new rooms, and then wait for our luggage. On top of that, people should know that parking is extremely high and if you want to use a car at all, that you are forced to use valet for in and out privileges for $38 a day or your parking is $27 each and every time you leave. Thankfully, the front desk people are kind (it's not their fault the check in system and parking is stupid), but it was a hassle. Contrary to a lot of reviews, the hotel's location isn't terrible at all, depending on why you are there. If you want nightlife and downtown, this is possible if you drive or take the bus, but if you are there for museums like we were, it's good. It's within walking distance of The Field Museum, Soldier Field, Shedd's Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, and 12th Street Beach, next to public transportation (the #3 bus pulls up right in front of the hotel), and has many places to eat nearby within walking distance or a short drive. Chinatown is a few blocks down Cermak Street. Checking out didn't work via television, so again we had to wait in line to check out. Also, although they have three kiosks available for checking in and out, none of them were ever working. Also, no free internet. No wi fi at all. Only a for-pay ethernet cable was available.

I needed a no-smoking room, on a no smoking floor (asthma), I needed a refrigerator in the room (medicine) I needed enough space in the room or at the bell stand for a scooter.

The place was packed with my compatriots and really it is perfect if you are going to be at the Convention Center, just an elevator ride and an enclosed walkway away. The service was consistent. The staff really got that those people were anxious to get to their meetings but also needed breakfast. The wait staff was friendly; the food in the hotel restaurant was fresh and fast. The coffee came in a press and the tea was a premium brand with a pot. So here we are the last night. Dropped stuff off at the package room. The person manning the room was efficient and keen on detail. And yes, the public bus for $2.25 picks up right in front of the hotel for a trip to the museum or downtown.

Boy was I ever thankful that I had read the reviews on Trip Advisor about the hotel before I went to Chicago for the concert. First, this hotel is a smart choice if you're attending an event at McCormick Place. However, take heed about what other guests note in their reviews -- there are NOT any (underline any) amenities near-by the area outside of the hotel. This area is devoid of restaurants, sports bars, convenience/drug stores, gas stations, grocery stores, shopping, etc. This really surprised me because it seems to be an up and coming area. It really didn't matter that I was driving because I didn't want to take my car in and out of the parking garage because of the exorbitant parking rates. Besides, it was too late for me to jumping on buses or flagging down a cab just to grab a bite to eat. So I went without food until the next day. Now, sure I could've eaten in the hotel, but as other guests noted, the food was very pricey. So, plan ahead, be prepared and bring your own food, snacks and beverages if you stay at this Hyatt Regency. Or, you can hop a cab or the bus into downtown to grab a bite to me and have more choices. One other thing to note, the on-site restaurants close early. When I was walked to the concert around 8pm, all of the hotel's amenties were closed. This was confusing, especially since there was a concert going on next door. Guess they want to force you to order room service. The room was average.

I was there for the concert primarily, and to tour the city. I have to say, this hotel worked out quite well. The rooms were in good condition, though not outstanding. Services/prices were what I expect from a typical business/convention hotel: expensive and not worth my time. I didn't try the food, it was also on the pricey side. The room itself was incredibly inexpensive, especially considering the busy weekend. I paid under $100 a night thanks to PL, which, considering the other options, was a great value. So, now, as to the location. I had no issues with the location whatsoever. I used 3 different types of transportation to get from the hotel to different parts of Chicago: 1. By bus. There is a bus stop just outside the Hyatt. Several buses run by the stop. The #3 bus will take you up Michigan Avenue north to the Mag Mile area. It takes probably about 10 minutes to get to Grant Park, and ~20 minutes to get up to near the Hancock Center, the end point of the route. The #21 bus will take you west to Chinatown, but more importantly, it will take you to the EL Red line in about 5 minutes, and from there you can easily go all over Chicago. 2. By cab. Cab rides were fairly inexpensive and fast. I had no problem getting a cab, either going to or from the hotel. A ride from Grant Park cost $10, including tip. Very reasonable. 3. By foot. While I didn't walk around the area at night, during the day I found it quite enjoyable on the lakeshore. The hotel is close to Soldier Field (if you are coming to see the Bears, this would be an excellent choice for location), and probably took me 10 minutes on foot. Also nearby is the Museum Campus area, so the Field Museum, the Alder Planetarium and Shed Aquarium. These three are probably another 5-10 minutes past Soldier field. Finally, walking to the Grant Park area would take roughly 30-35 minutes taking the scenic lakeshore route, or probably 5-10 minutes less taking a more direct street route. I would probably say the largest issue I had with the hotel was the surrounding area lacked in any and all ameneties. There were no close (10 minute walk) restaurants, bars, or any nightlife whatsoever. You would be looking at the Loop for that, at least. Still, for sightseeing Chicago, if you are the kind of person that takes off in the morning and stays out all day, I would say this hotel is an excellent fit. You will likely save a lot of money compared to downtown hotels and not miss a thing. If you plan on coming back to your hotel often to change/rest/etc, I would suggest something closer to the downtown area.

It required a cab ride to go anywhere for dinner and there was one night I waited 35 minutes in line in the lobby to get a cab to go downtown and another night that I decided it wasn't worth the wait and had a tasteless bowl of soup for $8 in the hotel restaurant.

The hotel is connected to the conference center which is a nice feature if that is your purpose - if you are a tourist - i wouldn't pick this hotel due to its location. There were no restuarants/shopping/activities near by at all - a taxi or car would be required should you want to do anything.

The walls between the room and hallway are quite thin. Every night I could here other guests go into their rooms. This was especially annoying after the Bears game Sunday night.

Upon entering the lobby it appears to be a beautiful hotel and checked in with an ease. I entered my room my smell senses were overpowered with some sort of carpet fresh fragrance. (I am sensitive to smells more so than most,) I called down to the lobby and they readily agreed to put me in a different room. The first room was on the 18th floor with a beautiful view. The second room was on the 21st floor with also great view. The second room smelled worse than the first. It had an overpowering smell of cigarette smoke as if the room next door was smoking and we were sharing the same air vent. It was not a nonsmoking floor. This time I went down to the lobby. (The staff was always extremely helpful during my stay. They never once acted agitated towards me.) Explained to the desk clerk and he said that he would put me in a room on the 8th floor as the floor had been recently remodeled. It worked, as the smells were neutral. :( Lost my view but I was happy!) Before I had left home I had read the reviews on this site. Once I had settled in the room I could see why the hotel received such poor reviews. My list. Mold in the shower and no fan in the bathroom, clumps of hair on the hair dryer, tooth paste looking salvia in the bottom of the water glass, (check those room glass it looks like they sometimes recycle them without washing them.), dusty, scuff marks on walls, opened window and cigarette ashes flew in the room, no safe, paper cups for the coffee, phones were old and dirty, in the last two rooms the carpet was ripped and had snags to trip over. But I was still happy with the room. I did phone the manager of house keeping and he came up to the room. I informed him of this site and pointed out the things mentioned above, as they are almost all fixable. He offered a bottle of wine and chocolates and I accepted. The next morning I got up and put the dirty glasses including the one with white stuff on the bottom on the edge of the counter to show they had been used. I came back to the room in the afternoon and to my surprise the maid had turned the glasses upside down and placed them back to be used again. There sat that toothpaste salvia glass. I called two maids into the room and the maid who had clean the room tried pulling the glass out of my had. Told her I wanted to keep it. Called the manager and left a phone message about the glass. Went for an hour conference in the afternoon and came back to the room. The maids had been in for the second time and had doused the bathroom with bleach. The whole room was overpowered with bleach smell and the glass was gone. I then asked to speak to the hotel manager and to be switched again because of the smell. The next room smelled fine and was about in the same shape as the last one. The fiscal was over. Had dinner one night at the restaurant and the food was good would recommend the lobster bisque. Ate at the breakfast buffet and this was mediocre. Fresh coffee and orange juice but you pay $4.00 and $5.00 a glass or cup. The location of the hotel is poor however; public transportation and the hotel provide economical means to get downtown. Not everyone is comfortable taking the bus though. We did use public transportation and it was user friendly but took a cab one late evening for a cost of about $12.00 plus tip. It is a $45.00 cab ride to the airport. Again the staff was all great. The conference center was excellent and user friendly. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate it a 5. I would stay there again if I were going to a conference but not for any other reason. It is not a good value for your money.", "Date": "May 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cBetter than expected\u201d", "Author": "Thefoodcritic_7", "ReviewID": "UR4954772", "Content": "Let me first say that I was not looking forward to staying at this hotel. Initially I wanted a place closer to downtown, but since my conference was at McCormick place I had little choice. Second, I generally despise conference hotels since thay are impersonal and just too big for the personal touches and attention. What a suprise to find that the Hyatt at McCormick place defied my expectations. First and foremost, the service was great. The staff, to a person, was pleasant, helpful and often went beyond the call of duty. I was able to get an upgrade to a suite and a late check-out for example. By the way, the suite which was on the 22nd floor was wonderful and had a phenomenal view of Lake Michigan and downtown. The only downside, as may people have commented in their reviews, is that the hotel is out of the way, and you end up paying a small fortune in cab fares to get around town.

I am quite unhappy with this hotel and am VERY surprised it is a Hyatt! The pros would be that it is attached to the McCormick Convention Center which is obviously convenient for anyone attending a conference. Also, it was reasonably priced. The cons are as follows: - inconvenient location for anything other than the convention center. NOTHING is nearby. NO restaurants, shops, etc. You must taxi everywhere. During our three day stay here we will spend around $200 for taxi service just to get to the heart of the city's activities. - after returning to check-in to our requested room, which was not available when we first arrived,the bell hop did not offer to take our bags to our room. In fact he scoffed at the request and stated, \"Sure, but it's gonna be a long time\". Surprising, as we thought that delivering bags to rooms is the job description of a bell hop. -rooms are average. We were on the 10th floor which would have had good views of the city, but the windows are extremely, extremely dirty so it was difficult to see much of anything through them. Small bathrooms. Several large, unsightly stains on the carpet in the hallways. Missing closet doors in the room. -no concierge available in the morning for helpful restaurant advice, and the gentlemen at the front desk was unhelpful and stated, \"There isn't someone at the concierge desk?\" I would not stay at the hotel again or recommend this hotel.

The big negative for us was the club scene in the lobby on Saturday night. The scene was loud, chaotic and smokey. However, we expected that from researching previous posts on this site and there were many positives with the rest of the hotel. During check-in we had about a dozen couples ahead of us in line. This must happen often because there were at least six staff members at a long check-in counter assisting people. One staff member did nothing but direct the next person in line to the first available check-in staff memeber. We waited in line no more than 5-10 minutes. We were directed to check-in at the assistant manager's counter which is just to the left of the main check-in counter next to the concierge. I don't know if that made a difference in the room that was offered to us, but it may be worth requesting when you arrive. We asked for a quiet room in the west tower preferably with a view of the river. She said that would be a $15 upgrade charge. We said fine since we were able make our reservation using a $79/night promotion that was posted on the Forum section of this web site. She said that room was not available yet but there was a Jr. suite available on the 32nd floor of the east tower that we could have at no additional charge. It turned out to be a double room with wet bar and refrigerator. A very good deal for $79/night. We did not eat at the restaurant but found the lounges to be worthy of a drink before heading out on the town. Except for the club, it was an excellent experience.

When I got off the elevator on my floor, the hallway was dirty with bottle caps and misc debris.

There happened to be a maid just down the hall and I asked her to please take the glass away. When I entered the room I immediately noticed the bedspread was messy and I could tell someone had sat down on the bed, probably to watch tv (while they were drinking the glass of whatever was outside the door).

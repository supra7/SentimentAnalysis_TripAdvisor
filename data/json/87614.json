The hotel was classy, the rooms were comfortable, nice linens, coffee, refrigerator, nice size bathroom. I was not impressed with the way the shower worked, but everything otherwise was good, we had no issues with noise from the streets. If I could improve anything it would be the option for queen size beds, we had 3 in the room so had to take doubles, that just made me cringe, I'm used to a King, and the wi-fi for the price should of worked better. We spent a lot of time (and money) at the bar, Jim was a fun bartender and lots of other concert goers made it a good hang out after the show.

The absolute best thing about the hotel is the free shuttle. It will take you anywhere within a mile, and considering the cold, rainy weather we had while in town, it was much appreciated. He took us to dinner and to our meeting. The valet staff was also helpful and happy to call us a cab or point us in the right direction. The biggest downside to this hotel was the noise factor. It is across the street from Rush University Medical Center. During my 2nd night, I was awakened at 4:44am by a loud ambulance siren. The night before, there were almost constant sirens. In addition, the housekeeping staff gets started unusually early. My first morning, they started cleaning before 8am, slamming doors up and down the hallway. I heard every one of them; it was ridiculous. At 8:30am, I had to put out my \"do not disturb\" sign, because I wasn't ready to leave, yet. I can't figure out why they started so early. I had breakfast one morning in the hotel's restaurant. The food was decent; the service was average and a little slow. It wasn't really worth it. Go out for breakfast if you have the time.

I thought the room was below average compared to the typical Marriott. The wallpaper was starting to peel in certain locations, the rug was a little worn, and the mattress was really hard. Also, I'm not sure if I was being more microscopic than usual, but I seemed to find lots of little hairs all over, including on the bedspread, pillows, and sheets. Perhaps the worst part of my experience was the noise. My room was facing the main road and Rush University is building a new hospital across the street from the hotel. On my first night, they were doing construction through the night and I had a tough time falling asleep. They did not work any of the other nights, but they did get started pretty early in the morning. Furthermore, there are a lot of other hospitals in the area (it's called Medical District for a good reason!) and I heard lots of ambulances throughout the night. Of course, I traveled with another person from my office and he did not complain of any noise, as his room was on a different side of the hotel and he could not hear the construction or ambulances. This hotel had a few positives, though. First and foremost, although you are not staying in the main Chicago downtown, there is a city bus line that is right outside the hotel and will take you downtown in less than 15 minutes for just two dollars each way. Also, you are in easy walking distance (about 3-4 blocks) of Little Italy where there are plenty of interesting local restaurants to dine at, and you can also walk to the Jewel-Osco supermarket. The hotel staff was very helpful, too. A worker at the front desk very happily printed out my airplane boarding pass for me (the free computer in the lobby - only for printing out boarding passes and not for free internet surfing - was not working) and she also reserved a shuttle for my trip back to O'Hare.

Others may disagree with the safety issue; hard to know when you don't live there. Anyway...the main problem is that this hotel is far from anything interesting. Also, the concierge was sweet but she really knew very little. She told me the wrong bus line, etc. Here is what I learned this trip: If you are going to bid on Priceline, do not include areas that you are not 100% sure of and don't go below four stars. I've gotten incredible deals that way, but this time, I lost out.

The lobby was nice with some comfy chairs to seat in. Then we got all checked in and headed upstairs to our room. Guess what! The room was already occupied!! They had checked us into a room that had someone in it. Thank God that person wasn't in the room at the time, because that would have been relativly uncomfertable... Anyway we headed back down to the lobby to get a different room. What we had expected was an upgrade or a night free or something of the sort, but no, all we got was an apology. In our second room things weren't that great. There was a ciggarette hole in the curtains, the carpet was falling apart in one area, the bathroom door handle was broken, it was almost impossible to get cold water from the faucet, and the faucet squeaked VERY loudly. Our first night we noticed you can hear EVERYTHING that happens in the halls, people were out there all night long banging on doors and talking loudly. And, while I'm sure it was nice, the breakfast buffet in the adjoining restuarant was $25, which is absoulutly rediculous! There are some redeeming qualities of the hotel however, it was decorated very nicely and only 3 blocks from an el station, which was wonderful, we didn't have to use our car all weekend. And it's only a block or two away from a cafe called Pompeii which was delicious! And on the same street (Taylor, I think) there were many restaurants including the orginal Rosebud's and Starbucks. But being the Medical District you are right across the street from The Rush Medical Center, which could be good for some, but not us.

Same thing happened when I was leaving (on his phone) and he didn't bother to help me with all the luggage I had or anything. They don't offer self-parking either, so be prepared for the hefty 21 dollar valet charge.

Taxis were cheap, $8 to Sears Tower, $9 to downtown, $11 to Rush and Division for nightlife, $13 to Navy Pier. Little Italy is only about a 10 minute walk. One very nice gesture was the complimentary hot apple cider and homemade cookies awaiting guests in the foyer. It was very cold outside so it was greatly appreciated.

Many times I would rather not fight with the rush hour traffic so I began staying at this hotel right acrass the street. The shuttle will take you to the hospital, although it runs on a 1/2 hr schedule. Yuo can park in the parking ramp to avoid the $26 a night valet parking fee (Only parking offered). The hospital information desk sells parking passes for $20.00 for 5 stays, each stay 24 hrs or less per pass. The hotel is very elegant and beautifully decorated. The rooms arent overly large but spacous enough. The beds are top quality pillow top mattresses with super fluffy comforters. Rooks,the gourmet resturaunt on the first level, has a wide variety on the menu and also supplies a more limited menu for room service of excellent quality and less expensive than you would expect. Some rooms are business oriented with a nice work area with extra outlets. If you get a business room look at your bill because the computer system automatically adds $9.95 to your bill for wireles internet access. They have a few discounts for RUSH patients and prospective staff members but even without a discount I think you would be hard pressed to find a better/cheaper cost same quality hotel anywhere this close to the loop. The staff is completely professional, Kind and courteous From the valet to the Room service waitor and everyone in between. Aside from the few quirks (parking and internet things) This hotel is definitely worth planning a stay. I Am staying therelater today.

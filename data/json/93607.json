It's just a magical place that transcends not only time but a sense of emotional serenity. The very first time I stayed in this hotel I stayed in a very well appointed suite, with balconies, a living room, and I was in love. For this stay I was in a well appointed room, with an overall feel of room and comfort, but it wasn't the room I was staying there for, but for the hotel itself. You walk through the doors and you know immediately that you will be well taken care of. I had just left my Drs office, and was several hours early for check in, but honestly, there was no way that I could have gone to a restaurant or walked the streets with my face looking as it did at the moment. I needed a little down time before heading anywhere and they were gracious enough to allow me to check in early. (thank you) I quickly headed to my room and I was not disappointed with it at all. Yes, there were a few minor dings on the furniture, but realistically you cannot expect any hotel to replace furniture each and every time a hotel guest who has been careless checks out. And they were minor. While the bathroom was smaller than I would have preferred I still loved it and felt that it displayed good taste with a se se of warmth. The mini bar was well stocked with higher end beverages, which my palette sincerely appreciated, and I loved being able to lounge in one of the two robes provided while having an afternoon cocktail as I hid for a while in my room waiting for my face to go down a bit and enjoyed the view out of my large window. Once the swelling subsided a bit I excitedly made reservations at Feinsteins, and went walking to some of my favorite stores, Barneys, Bloomingdales and so forth that were all within walking distance. Truly my only disappointments with my stay was Feinsteins and The Library. Feinsteins, as I did not feel it portrayed a true level of elegance that one would expect from the Regency, and it lacked an overall feel of comfort. My disappointment with the library did not come from it actually being disappointing, as it has been redone wonderfully, but I do so miss the old bar that once was there. It invited mingling, good conversation, and wonderful music. Now it is more electronics, and seating only at tables, but it is still lovely and still home to the power breakfast crowd. Would I return tfo this NYC icon, rich with history? In a heartbeat and I plan on staying there upon my return follow up with my Doctor as afterwards I again want to be pampered.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cA Great Stay!\u201d", "Author": "dmarie250", "ReviewID": "UR126384030", "Content": "My husband and I received a two-night stay at the Loews Regency as a wedding gift to be used on Valentine's Day weekend.

It had a King Size bed, a seating/office area, a large bathroom with both a shower and a bathtub, a large closet and a kitchenette with a microwave, coffee maker and fridge. I have stayed at many hotels in and out of the city that do not have a refrigerator available so to me, this was a huge plus - especially if you are traveling with a family. The hotel is also in a great location just a few blocks from Central Park. Try to check out Dylan's Candy Bar if you're in the area too! We have been to New York hundreds of times, but had never been and we got some really great late night snacks! :) The only negative remarks about the hotel would be that the bell-hop grabbed our tiny weekend bag without asking and led us to the room. We had to tip him, when in reality we could have easily carried our own bag and found our way. If we had a lot of luggage, I wouldn't have minded. But it was a bit rude to yank our bag out of our hands. Also - another couple received the same gift for their wedding and they had a bottle of chilled champagne and snacks waiting in their room. I'm assuming that we should have also had this, but we did not.

This boutique hotel is beautiful and perfectly located if you want to be in walking distance for shopping at Barney's, Bloomingdale's, and many many major designer stores. I loved that! I chose the location primarily because I was going to an engagement party which was at a venue two blocks away. The doormen, bellmen and concierge were all very helpful, day and night. When I called from my room to the concierge to ask for directions to Bloomingdale's he told me to come see him for a discount card at Bloomingdale's (15% off!). Bonus! Being a foreign visitor I would have only got 10% discount which I found out at the Bloomingdale's Visitor's center. I needed a pair of scissors late at night and the receptionist made an effort to get them from the gift shop. A bellman took my shopping bags and put them in my room during the day when I had to rush back out to get a taxi to a show. That's what I call service with a smile! The gym was perfect for this type of hotel; they have all the regular equipment with TVs, mats, weights, stretching bands etc....everything I needed to work out plus a sauna (which I didn't use); they even offered fruit in the gym and a bowl of red apples by the main elevators in the lobby...nice touch. (ended up being my breakfast since I was so busy!) I didn't spend too much time in my room but I did notice the following issues which were inconvenient: the makeup/shaving mirror in the bathroom is for a 6 ft tall person (I am only 5'2), as is the location of the safety deposit box in the closet (on top of a shelf), the bar fridge did not close with the key ( I realized that at 1:30 am and I did not want the Engineering guy to come to my room to fix it at that hour ...after the party!)and the cross lock on my door was missing a screw and was loose (had to have the \"Engineering\" guy come as soon as I arrived the first night to fix it-he was very prompt and friendly). Wi-Fi is available for FREE in the lobby but there is a $14.95 fee if you want it in your room. The bed was very comfortable. I liked that I could use their IPod dock and use it for an alarm clock. The NY times was delivered for free at your door each day. I didn't think there was a blow-dryer in the room until I noticed it on Sunday high up on a hook in a non-labeled canvas bag behind the bathroom door; there should be a note somewhere saying that it exists there! I did not eat at any of their restaurants or go to the Bar which looked very cozy and fun They have featured B list celebrities who sing there as a poster displayed in the lobby indicated so.

We didn't even have to do the moving- they were so kind, and even sent milk and cookies for the kids the first night because of the delay. What a sweet surprise:) Beds in both rooms were very comfortable and clean. We loved the use of the bathrobes in the closet. Amenities in the bathroom such a Q tips and cotton balls were an added pleasure. The lounge had entertainment worth checking out prior to visiting because the events might sell out due to the entertainers they bring in. You might be best to book ahead. We went to the Metropolitan Opera which was an easy Taxi ride. Consierge was helpful with calling for dinner reservations for us, and answering our many questions! We were there for theater shows as well, and again, a taxi to the theater district is not expensive- $6-7 plus tip if you choose. New Years Eve the city was so safe that we walked all the way back from Times Square after midnight! Cudos to NYC! Walking to Central Park is a nice 3 blocks, and taking a horse and buggy ride thru the park is delightful! Go early for the ice skating to avoid long lines waiting- but it is fun and a larger rink.

I selected this hotel primarily for the location, but also because it is touted as one of the most kid-friendly in NYC. As a YouFirst member, I also get a great rate. I was concerned by some of the reviews, and overall, I think that some are unduly harsh. Check-in was relatively smooth. We had 3 junior suites, which more than accomodated our party. Two were ready when we arrived at 12:30 pm, one was not. By the time we returned 4, the third room was ready. If there was any \"disappointment\", it was the fact that the front desk staff is supposed to acknowledge my \"status\" as a Loews loyalty program member, but they did not. They did, however, have small welcome gifts for the youngest of our group, ages 7 and 9. I would say that the door and bell staff were the friendliest, and that the front desk staff were a little cold. The lobby is one of the best places to people-watch. The other guests ranged from \"normal\" to incredibly well heeled. The kids loved seeing all of the dogs being paraded through the lobby - the hotel is very pet-friendly (though you would never know it in the rooms - not a hit of doggy odor anywhere). I don't know what anyone is talking about when they criticize the hallways - our rooms were on different floors and they were all immaculate. The rooms were large by NYC standards. The bathrooms were slightly larger than some I've had in New York. They were all marble, and fixtures were in good working order. My shower had great water pressure and I had no problems with the temperature. All three junior suites were slightly worn around the edges, but nothing too bad. A hint of rust in the bathroom, some slightly peeling paint - really, just simple wear and tear. The rooms were immaculate. Our rooms faced the \"courtyard\", as it were - really just the other buildings on the block, but I have to say, they were nice and quiet. Everyone said they slept well and loved how quiet the rooms were. We did not eat at the hotel - too many people, and we wanted to go out and experience the area. Also we did not use the fitness or other facilities. The location was perfect for us - two blocks from the park, seconds from the best shopping and local restaurants. Everyone commented that they loved the neighborhood feel. The consensus of our group was that the hotel was great - perfect location, clean, comfortable rooms.

Some recent snotty reviews on Trip Advisor had me worried. I was relieved to discover that many of my favorite room service and bell staff are still working at the hotel, a sign that The Regency must be a good place to work - having a content and stable staff is paramount to creating a hotel experience that feels like home... The lobby and gym are every bit as nice as I'd remembered and while I did see the same scuff marks that several guests have complained about, I really didn't mind that the room looked a bit tired and worn. I'd liken it to visiting NYC and staying with your favorite old, monied yet slightly hip uncle - sure, things aren't going to be totally brand new, but that's part of the charm. And just like that favorite uncle, the staff welcome you with a smile and a welcome back - I was surprised that even the male room service operator remembered me and asked how I'd been doing (even though we haven't talked in at least 7 or 8 years!) From the front desk staff to the maids, the impeccable staff makes this place a winner... And if you don't mind lots of Texans with giant fur coats on the elevator this time of year, The Regency will no doubt leave you with a smile. The one disappointment was that they've somehow changed the receipe of their once renowned crab cakes to the point that they were inedible on the room service menu.

SERVICE - 1 We base the rating largely on service and professionalism of the staff and valet during a stay from 4-5 September 2011. The valet took our car and keys at 6:00 PM. We returned to our room at 11:00 PM and found a message on our hotel phone with a time stamp of 9:30 PM stating that due to our roof rack, the hotel could not fit our car in their garage. (We also note that we parked the car with the rack with no issues in a number of other lots on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.) We made clear to the front desk that their request to remove the roof rack at 11:00 PM was unreasonable (as was a three and a half hour delay in even attempting to inform us of the issue and the fact that they only attempted to call us on our room phone when they had two cell phone numbers on file). The front desk personnel informed us that they would find a resolution to the issue or would call us back to inform us if they could not. We received no further contact from hotel staff until we checked out the following morning. After waiting over twenty minutes with no word from the valet, we approached him a second time asking about the status of our vehicle. He initially informed us that he could not find the vehicle. We found the vehicle parked-in down the street from the hotel. (As a former New York and Chicago resident, I am quite comfortable with parallel parking, but the car could not be moved without risking damage to it or the surrounding cars.) While refusing to assist, the valet further had the audacity to claim that we ought to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thankful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that his morning crew had moved the car from an illegally spot that his own night crew had parked it the night before. The manager provided no assistance and informed us that, while she was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sorry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could not help.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The entire experience was unacceptable. When handing over a car for valet parking, we expect the hotel valet to assume responsibility for parking the car. If they cannot do so, we expect contact within a reasonable period (i.e. sooner than three and a half hours). We remained in our room for two hours after check-in and could have easily resolved any issues in that period, though asking us to do so by either removing the rack or moving the car to another garage at 11:00 PM was unacceptable. We also expect that, when informed by the hotel staff that they will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resolve\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd an issue, resolution does not entail parking us into a spot we cannot get out of on a city street and refusing to assist in retrieval. Based on this experience, we will not stay at another Lowes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hotel and cannot recommend them to others. SERVICE-2 Besides the inept valet staff that allowed our car to be parked-in and refused to offer further assistance, service was generally fine. The one exception was the hotel bar and restaurant, where we waited over fifteen minutes to be seated, then left after waiting another twenty-minutes to see our waiter. (Only five other tables were occupied at the time.) FURNISHINGS AND CLEANLINESS The hotel was generally clean. The furnishings were fine, though there sometimes worn condition makes claims of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153luxury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd questionable.

There was a mini bar, plus a kitchenette (Keurig coffeemaker with several teas, coffees and hot chocolate, microwave and mini fridge) and a large and sparkling clean bathroom. The room also had a small walk in closet with two plush robes, ironing board and iron. You can eat breakfast in the restaurant (which we didn't) but there is complimentary fresh fruit and coffee available, which came in handy. We were sightseeing most of the time and only at our hotel basically to sleep, but anytime we needed service from the hotel, it was attended to promptly and professionally. The library bar is a delightful place to wind down after a busy day in NYC--with its comfy couches, great service and snack menu, it's perfect! Also, I needed to ship something back home, and the concierge made it happen, no problems. The hotel is in a great location---an easy walk to Central Park (check out Sarabeth's Kitchen on Central Park South for brunch--delicious) and in the other direction, to Bloomingdales and the other great shopping on 5th Avenue.

The service here is very efficient and friendly, a bit more so than some other large/business type hotels in NYC. The room service meals are very good (the scrambled eggs are remarkably \"tender\", although that might seem like an odd term to use). If you have a chance to eat in the \"Library\" (the Cafe-type restaurant), try Joan's Salad, a salad with unusually good dressing, and a LARGE portion of freshly grilled salmon. The taste combination is amazing. (This is a full meal, or a great starter if shared.) Many of the rooms used to have kitchens, which were very nice for those leftovers from various fine restaurants in NYC. The renovations a few years ago changed that space into suprisingly large and luxurious marble bathrooms, with huge glass showers ;-) To the best of our knowledge, these rooms tend to be on the LEFT SIDE as one walks down the main hallway (sorry; I forget how the room number go). These rooms are usually also a bit larger. => It's worth asking for them, although they cost more. (One note: in some rooms, these glass walls leave the toilet peculiarly exposed in a much larger bathroom.) The location is great: On Park Avenue, a bit quieter than some of the busier streets, but just a block or two from the shopping on Madison or Fifth Avenue. (The Fifth Avenue shopping area starts about 3 blocks south of the cross street, but the Madison shops and restaurants are just around the corner.)

It was o-kay. Something was lacking in terms of Loews special service whcih made it just another hotel in NYC (which is known for average hotels). Overall we had a great time because we focused on the pluses rather than the cons. PLUSES: great location, easy walk to everything, we had a large suite which looked good, food was high quality, gym was efficient, room service/housekeeping/porter were very friendly. Quick response time on housekeeping requests. CONS: Check-in staff not warm & inviting but disinterested and insincere - going through the motions. Absolutely NO VIP greeting for Platinum. No prior email contact before arrival (customary with Platinum members), my email request sent earlier to concierge requesting a special amenity be sent to the room with a congratulations note was ignored & I had to make a 2nd request. It arrived (which was appreciated) but without the note for my child so she didn't realize it was something special for her. She was also given an infant's toy instead of age appropriate toy at check-in. Doors in the suite wouldn't close without major slamming (all warped), kichenette was great but had no supplies (no plates, silverwear so it couldn't be used)!!! Bathrooms did not offer any special suite toiletries as other Loews properties do. Turndown not provided on 1st night (even though it was requested), done on 2nd night but other than moving the pillow off the bed and turning the sheet back nothing else was done. Long wait down in the breakfast restaurant both mornings. Summer fun program for kids was not well thought out (all kids should get a prize - a lollipop would have been sufficient!!) so not worth promoting and not worth us coming back in time for (as my child had repeatedly told us all day that we had to back in time for the kids fun activities at 4pm). SUMMARY: As a fan of Loews Hotels, I love to stay in Loews because of the 'extra' service, attention to detail, fun factor, spoiling of my kids that Loews are renowned for giving but I didn't have that at the Loews Regency. As a platinum member, I got my complimentary suite upgrade which I greatly appreciated but not any VIP service. I did have a perfectly fine hotel with very nice food in the restaurant when I actually could get to a table. It was clean & efficient and if that is all you want then I highly recommend it but then the Hilton & Sheraton also gave me a decent stay for a fraction of the cost.

My first impression of the room was good since it was quite large compared to the rooms I have had at Renaissance Parc 57 and W Midtown East. However I did notice that the interior is worn and dated.

The Upper East Side location was exactly what I was looking for: close to Central Park and far away from the tourist haunts of midtown.

If you stay here, walk the neighbourhood - explore the side streets, do Lex, 3rd, 2nd etc - you will get a better feel for what living in NY is all about. Other guests were of various ages and nationalities, lots of families, it was clear that there were lots of repeat visitors who see the Loews Regency as their 'home' in NY. Transport options were good - plentiful taxis, subways on Lex or 5th, or buses. My room was spotlessly clean, albeit slightly dated. The room was at the rear of the hotel, so although there was no view, there was also no traffic noise. However, the plumbing was pretty noisy - I was very aware when guests in the room next to or above mine ran showers/baths. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. I didn't eat in the hotel as I wanted to try out the restaurants on 3rd or Lex - there is a great variety, to suit every budget. The housekeeping staff were lovely, nothing was too much trouble. Concierge were also helpful and knowledgeable. Mohammed, who took my bags up to my room on arrival, gave me recommendations for movies and got me a cab for my departure was an absolute star.

We have visited the city 4 times and love all the hotels where we have been guests. Our favorite hotel in NYC so far has been the Waldorf, but being curious, we like to see vist new hotels, hence our stay here at the Loews Regency. The location is quiet, and safe, but for Broadway shows and mainstram tourism, it is a little off the beaten path. Obviously, not a fault of the hotel....HOWEVER... We booked a junior suite, with a bedroom a queen pull out sofa and one and a half baths. Perfect for my husband and I and two daughters, right? When we pulled out the sofa bed, I was shocked that a 4 star hotel would allow anything like that on the property! The head of the bed touched the floor and the bottom stuck high up in the air. It was like one of those anti-gravity machines they sell for lots of money, but my kids just wanted to sleep, not stand on their heads all night! It also looked like something people would put out at a garage sale, and eventually have to put to the curb, because no one would pay for it. Again, not expecting the Plaza, but this is a 4 star hotel. We called and asked to be moved, but apparently the hotel was full, and they brought in two roll away beds which made it impossible to move in the small room and it got a bit ridiculous and we all got the giggles one night with my husband and family jumping all over the beds to get around. There are no ice machines in the hallways. You have to call room service for ice, which is fine, however the first night the coveted ice took 20 minutes to arrive, and the second night, took close to an hour. If you stay at Loews, please anticipate being thirsty an hour before you actually are, and call accordingly. New York was amazing as ever despite the blip from Loews.

I enter the shower to find a 3/4 used bar of soap and someone else's hair in the shower. Disgusting. I call to the front desk, and they relocate us. They're polite but not really apologetic.

The rooms were serviced twice daily inc a turndown service in the evening, which is the sign of a top notch hotel. Very clean and comfortable. The service of the staff is excellent especially the concierge who can tell you everything from which subway train to get to arranging tickets for a broadway show! When you leave the hotel, there is always someone to open the door for you and whistle down a taxi if you require one. Didn't have any food in the hotel as it was shockingly over priced! But the location is second to none. Just a 15 minute stroll to Times Square and 5 mins to central Park and 5th Avenue etc. This was our first trip to NYC and I was amazed by the whole experience. The hotel was out of this world and absolutely amazing but we were hardly in it to appreciate how good it was as we were constantly making the most of the 5 days we were in the city by doing a hell of a lot of sightseeing. We kind of only went there to sleep or get changed! I would highly recommend. For a special occassion I can also recommend visiting the Rotating sky bar for the evening on the 48th floor of the Marriott Marquis hotel on Times Square.

Check-in was simple enough and we weren't waiting too long and first impressions were good.

Being non-smokers I called the front desk and told them that we could not possibly stay there. We had specifically requested a non-smoking room and so without much hassle we were moved to a lovely room on the 15th floor. We were very pleased with our lovely corner room and so we unpacked and freshened up, etc. Just then the phone rang. It was the front desk. We had to move, we were told, as there was a problem with the bathroom and they would need to have it fixed soon and therefore nobody could stay in it. For our inconvenience we were offered $100 voucher to use on food/drinks at the hotel and we were given a room on the 11th floor. It wasn't as nice as the one on floor 15 but it was fine. The bed was very comfortable, the towels and robes were good quality, the carpet in the room appeared very clean and so all in all we were happy. About 4 days into the stay I dropped my earring onto the floor and I needed to pull the nightstand out to find it. I was quite disgusted to see used tissue, clothing tags and a chocolate wrapper down behind there, left there by a previous guest(s). That was very disappointing, obviously the room had not been cleaned properly. It also made me wonder what other delights lurked beneath the bed and behind the other furniture. I did not want to look for fear of what I might find so I just tried to put it to the back of my mind as we had only 1 day left and lots of things to do. However, it did absolutely tarnish this hotel in my opinion.

Initially, we were drawn to the Regency by its great customer service, well-appointed rooms, and safe location. We loved it so much that we called it our home away from home. Sadly, our last two stays here (12/08 and 12/09) have been less than stellar and we're afraid that this will be our last stay for a while (we're checking out today and moving to the Le Parker Merdien). Even as Loews Platinum members (the highest guest loyalty status), we have been treated with little regard (and at times, complete disregard) during our recent stays. Upon check-in this time around, we didn't receive so much as a \"welcome\" or \"hello\" - we were simply asked to hand over our credit card and then given our room key with no explanation of the room type or any type of hotel information. Unfortunately the rooms have gone on the decline as well. As an example, the furniture is very worn, the paint is peeling and bubbling, the toilet is not securely attached, and the bedside alarm and lamp do not even work. As the front desk had not explained the process by which to connect to the internet, we called down and received instruction over the phone. After many tries, we could still not connect at which point we called back downstairs. This time, they put us on hold for almost 15 minutes at which point the line went dead - we had been hung up on! Eventually, we got through to the hotel's IT manager (who was quite helpful) - he gave us the correct instructions to get online and it worked (mind you, these were different directions that the operator had given us earlier). Without going on an on, we want to reiterate that the Regency has been a magical place in the past and, while we're saddened at its recent state, we hope that they can get their act together.

Bear in mind that my wife and I are not rich, travel the world staying in 5 star hotels, or very fussy... but happy with a clean comfortable room. Check in was extremely quick and smooth, and staff were extremely helpful when we asked for directions, taxis or anything else that we requested. We stayed in the superior double room (cheapest on offer), and we thought the room was huge and very clean. The king size was bed was massive, and more comfortable than most beds that I have slept on in any hotel. The decor isn't new or contemporary but the room was clean, as was the spacious bathroom. All bathroom accessories were provided for such as shampoo, soap, body wash, and conditioner. A little dissappointing was the lack of free wifi in the room, but then I'm not on holiday to use the internet. Beside there is a very fast FREE wifi connection in the lobby. As a bit of a fitness freak, I was more than happy with the fitness facilities in the gym, which included a good selection of cardio equipment, as well as weights and gym mats. The walls in hotel are slightly too thin as you can hear noise from the corridors, but it isn't that bad. I thought the locaion was excellent, a couple of blocks from Central Park, a block away from the closest subway which goes straight to Times Square, Spring Street, Brooklyn Bridge. But to be honest you can pretty much walk everywhere from the hotel... approx 15mins to Times Sq. There are also loads of Cafes and restaurants in the area for good breakfasts or dinner. As for the bill... make sure you check it and get a copy when you leave. We never use the minibar at any hotel due to the extortionate prices. On checkout they tried to charge us for minibar usage, but could not tell us what it was we had drunk. When we said we did not use they minibar they assured us that the bill would be corrected. However on our return to England I found a charge of $7.04 on my card from the hotel, for drinking a can of coke from the minibar. It took four emails to the hotel to get the money back. As for NYC... it's a fantastic city for sightseeing, eating and shoppping. Subway is cheap and quick if you don't want to walk, but I wouldn't advise using it after 10pm.

I searched out many hotels in NYC and was looking for a spacious, affordable, and kid-friendly hotel. Based on reviews, Loews seemed to be the best of all worlds, but I was quite surprised to find that the Regency, NYC lacked in all of those respects. First, the front desk staff was disinterested, aloof, and pretty much as snooty as Park Ave. itself. I asked for a room and they pushed for a kitchenette which would cost $40 more per night, and I said I didnt need one. Sure enough, they gave me a room w/ a kitchenette, but didnt charge me for it..bonus, but not sure what the deal was. I requested a crib upon arrival, and when I got there at 6:30pm, we were taken up to the room by an excellent bellman, but the crib wasnt there yet. When i asked the bellman if I should call downstairs to get it, he said that he was going to take care of it. When we returned from dinner around 10pm with my child sleeping in my arms, still no crib! We called downstairs and they finally came by 11:30 to assemble the crib, which took a half hour, while my child slept on our bed. Next, my room key deactivated twice and I couldn't get into the room, and you would think by the second time, they would have sincerely apologized, but the lady at the front desk barely looked me in the eye, let alone apologized. My wife ordered room service one night, and I know that NYC prices are up there, but she got a grilled cheese and a side salad, which came out to $58...come on! Lastly, the rooms were supposed to be spacious, by NYC standards, yet the bathroom was so tiny that my legs stuck out the door when I sat on the toilet and I hit my head twice on the mirror above the toilet, while knocking the toilet phone off the hook every time I entered the bathroom. So, in summation, crappy experience, staff that was unattentive and snooty..all around bad experience!

The observation areas are very clean and the glass walls around the observation deck don't obstruct views like the screens/fences surrounding the Empire State Building. We also tried the circle-line double decker bus downtown tour. We picked up the bus at central park...just a few blocks from the hotel. The kids loved that as well...and they liked hopping off and back on a different bus at various stops. Two tour guides were great, one was a cynical jerk, but hey it's NYC and you never know what you're gonna get. The great thing about the buses is that you can hop off at any time. Cab rides even from downtown were never more than 10-12 dollars and there is easy access to the hotel. Subway entrances are also just a few blocks away. Regency Hotel went out of the way to make our stay enjoyable--they provided umbrellas from the doorman if it was raining. free coffee (delicious) in the lobby in a.m. and free lemonade in the afternoon. The housekeeping staff provided everything we needed right away. It's been a long time since I stayed in NYC and felt welcomed and not simply like I was being \"processed\" through the hotel system. The neighborhood also felt safe and clean.

Second, if you are scouting this hotel for tourism, the location is not supurb, it is somewhat far from the major tourist areas. It is, however, perfect for the Lex and Park area.

My stays are the result of business trips. I've noticed that Loew's, which owns the hotel, has placed its name in a more prominent place alongside the words The Regency Hotel. This month my stay was for one night, over Thursday and Friday, I rarely think of Loew's as a luxury-oriented chain, and I think that's the reason things are not as terrific as they once were at The Regency. The bathroom toiletries are less deluxe; seemingly Loew's generic; whereas The Regency used to provide high-end toiletries. The towels are still good; the bath towel is especially fluffy and large. I was stunned to hear, at around 8 a.m. Friday morning, women from Housekeeping knocking on doors on my floor. That's absurd and much too early. This never happened as recently as 2005. And it should not happen at all. The woman tapped on my door and I ignored it. She even tried the door, but the extra \"chain-like\" security catch was linked, so she couldn't get in. The Reception Desk personnel were friendly, but not quite deluxe. I did not avail myself of the Concierge. The various uniformed gentlemen at the front door were always friendly and provided greetings. They were a little understaffed on Friday afternoon when I needed to get a cab to the airport. The bed was good; the air conditioning/heat fan system worked well. The room was quiet, clean, and pleasant. It was a standard room consisting of a very large and comfortable bed, crisp sheets, dresser, mini-bar (yes, nuttily overpriced), desk, and good size closet. The carpet was fine, although a cosmetic cleaning wouldn't hurt. The view out my 12th floor window was pleasing. I was away from Park Avenue, so the silence was golden. My biggest complaint was with Room Service, which actually blamed a longer waiting period on - get this - the fact that it was raining outside. What? Were they sending out for the food? Food was promised in one hour - ridiculous since the kitchen knows the menu and the foodstuffs are on the premesis. I've always found 30 minutes to be the norm at high-end hotels. I ordered Room Service at around 9:30 p.m. As for the food, well it failed. I ordered a bacon and turkey club sandwich, but it really wasn't a club sandwich at all, but two very large slices of toasted Italian bread with the dull and lifeless sandwich items within. The bread was too thin, thus it was hardish. The sandwich was cut in two sections and was more a panini than a club. My French fries were coolish. Is it so difficult to provide HOT French fries. And I hate cold or cool French fries. The sorbet was fine, well-chilled in a bowl set over ice; therefore it didn't melt as I hate my entree. The chicken soup was good, but not plentiful. And, of course, there was the absurd \"delivery fee,\" which I have found, still find, and always will find offensive. Are we able to go down and get the food ourselves? It isn't called ROOM SERVICE for nothing. This fee is actually an insult. I don't mind the normal 16%, 17%, or 18% tip fee - you live with it, but this delivery fee is so tacky. The Regency has a great location with quick steps to Madison or Fifth Avenue. One big problem is that if you want your own \"corner store\" or \"deli\" service, you won't fnd any along this stretch of Park Avenue or even a block up on Madison. I tried. You'll need to walk over to Lexington or maybe Third. The shops on Madison begin their high-end run, with Barney's anchoring a corner. The Regency is around 62nd Street and Park. Look, I consider myself fortunate that my work allows me stay in deluxe hotels. There are people who never even travel, let alone get to stay so well around the country. But, hotels that promise luxury need to live up to that claim. The Regency is slipping. My room was clean and pleasant. But overall, the hotel itself needs a little boost. High-end means luxury. And that's what I used to expect and once received from The Regency. It should make a return. Better toiletries in the bathroom would be a start. This stay was average, not wonderful.

Several friends have actually come back and thanked us profusely for letting them in on this New York \"secret\".", "Date": "March 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cThis was my 10th stay here\u201d", "Author": "colormemo", "ReviewID": "UR4597376", "Content": "I have stayed at the Regency at least 10 times in the last four years. The staff is so friendly and I have stayed in the average room and in a couple of the suites. The hotel is vintage and therefor all the rooms are slightly different.

When my husband and I first checked in we inquired on the type of room we would have. We had a standard but could buy 120sq.ft. for an additional $40 per night. We decided to check out the room first and decided to stay, figuring we wouldn't spend a lot of time in the room anyways (which we didn't). The room furnishings are nice and for New York standards the room wasn't that small. My only complaint is the bathroom. The bathroom was small and also very warn. The bathroom door was chipped and corroding at the bottom. Another review mentioned a seperate tub and shower, not in this room. Plus there was mold in the shower soap holder. Okay, one more complaint, it was more the norm than not to see housekeeping carts and room service trays in the hall way that was never vacuumed. Our other beef is with the price of room service. We knew it wouldn't be cheap, but these prices are almost gouging. If 2 people ordered 1 hamburger a piece, the price would be $60 and that is without tax and without something to drink - ouch. However, after saying that, our stay was nice. The location is wonderful and the staff, were very friendly, helpful and accomodating. But, next time I think we'll return to Midtown and stay at the Sofitel, where we have stayed before and thoroughly enjoyed it.", "Date": "February 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "annapolis", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Regency\u201d", "Author": "paris1012", "ReviewID": "UR4467579", "Content": "Our first room was small and dark and the bathroom lights did not work.

From the very first phone call to the Regency, to when we left the hotel, we had impeccable service, and an unforgettable experience in NY! Our trip had been planned for my Mom's birthday, and was a surprise to her. We had an executive suite which allowed all of us to stay together, which was ideal. The living room area of the suite allowed all the family to gather for birthday cake after dinner, which was very relaxing and allowed all of us to be comfortable together. Brunch in the Library the next morning was quite a treat, and our waiter, everyone at the front desk, concierge desk, and the doormen were wonderfully solicitous, and provided excellent service.

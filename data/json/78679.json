We had to park a ways off from the room since there was no front area parking. We got back to the room and there was a guy in it. It turned out the hotel clerk gave us keys for another customer's room. Our room was the one next to the man's room. Our room was clean, but the bathroom layout was awful. The bathroom door verily closed with 1/4\" or less door to toilette gap when closing door. The bathroom had some weird wood add on to the bathroom sink that took space and made the bathroom look even weirder. Hardly any parking in the front and if you got a room in the front you had to park in the back because of the restaurant customers. One night I got back to the hotel after 9 pm with my wife and kids and we had to park on the back. The back door that led to the lobby or to the area that ed to my room was locked. A little sign on it stated the door got locked at 9 pm. We had to walk all the way around the hotel to get to our room. This was not nice on a cold and rainy night. The jacuzzi did not heat up. When I complained about the door and jacuzzi I was given a hotel review form. I'm not sure that they really cared about my complaint.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "Clarencemurphy", "ReviewID": "UR126052245", "Content": "The first night my friends and I arrived to LA, we stayed in inglewood.

The japenese garden theme is done nicely. There is even a bridge over water with goldfish and a couple of small KOI in it. It is also nicely landscaped. The pool was sparkling and big. It also was 11 feet deep in the deep end. Diving possible! The breakfast was great. They have a Japanese restaurant on site which is very high end and expensive so we did not eat there. However, in the morning they use the same restaurant to serve a complimentary hot buffet breakfast complete with potatoes, scrambled eggs, bacon, turkey sausage, waffles not to mention all the usual continental breakfast items like toast, cereal, fruit and pastries. Definitely a nice place to eat breakfast with big, oversized leather booths and tablecloths. There is also a nice patio you can eat on. The room was clean but cramped feeling in the closet and bathroom area. The bathroom was definitely the worst aspect of the room. The sink is sandwiched between the toilet and the bathtub/shower. There is a tiny counter area around the sink and an 8\" or so strip of counter behind the toilet. If you have something up there and it falls, guess where it falls into? If you are on the toilet and someone tries to open the door, you get bumped by the door completely. There is no room to spare in this bathroom. And it is a one at a time bathroom as no one can use the sink without interrupting someone showering or on the toilet. I thought there was only 2 towels so I went and got two more from the pleasant desk clerk. Then, while taking a shower, I noticed the towel rack in the shower at the end of the bathtub way up high that had the two missing towels on it. I will have to say, though, that the towels are very thick and BIG. However, they do not have \"pool towels\" so you have to use the same ones. The plumbing gets a \"D\" in this property. The shower head's adjustment was broken so you only had a whimpy stream of water. Also you could not have the water all the way in the shower so water was also coming out of the bathtub spigot at the same time because that pull out knob would not pull out all the way. Also the sink knobs turn in different directions so it makes it confusing to turn the water on and off. The plumbing is loud. We were watching TV and heard a weird high pitched sound. We thought it was the TV but if turns out it was the sound of the pipes through the wall as someone else in another room was probably showering. The beds are full (double sized) which made it a bit tight for 4 people (2 adults and two children) The TV was in a beautiful Armoire and the room had a microwave and fridge. The freeway is right in back of the hotel. We were in an inside facing room so the noise was not too bad but it must be horrible to be on the backside by the freeway though. Since the room was clean, the staff was professional , the breakfast was good and the pool and hot tub were sparkling, this is an acceptable place to stay. However, it is not without its flaws but I really don't think we could have done much better in the area. We once stayed at the Universal Sheraton and that place was not impressive either at double the price of this one. Whereas some aspects of this hotel rate at an A+, others are about a D- so this place gets about a \"C\" from me.", "Date": "September 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cDated, damp, smelly\u201d", "Author": "lovetojourney", "ReviewID": "UR38605227", "Content": "We were stuck at this motel for 3 days. Unfortunately we had no choice as we had to be within walking distance of family in North Hollywood (long story). The postion was good for us in that respect. However the motel is situated between a busy road and the Ventura Freeway, so the position should never be good for anyone else! Thankfully the constant traffic noise was drowned out by the noisy airconditioner. This place really needs to be stripped down & completely renovated. The adjoining rooms we had on the ground floor overlooked the nice pool which in turn was overlooked by the carpark and the road (NO privacy whatsoever). The rooms each had 2 double beds which were actually very comfortable. The sheets & towels were clean and replaced daily. The maids did a good job with the limited facilities. Last decorated in the 1960's when dark decor and smoking was fashionable, the supposedly non-smoking rooms stunk and one room had permanently wet carpet outside the bathroom door. All our clothes had to be washed when we finally left this place - so bad was the revolting smokey & damp smell. We arrived early after a 14 hour flight from Australia. The rooms weren't ready yet so the Manager kindly invited us to have breakfast while we waited. Breakfast is included in the room rate and was totally inedible. I spat out the rubbery waffle, the hot food looked as if it had been there for weeks. We avoided any further breakfast there. The Manager was not surprised when we complained about the smell and the wet carpet. He claimed he was unable to move us (perhaps there was nowhere better??) but did reduce the quoted rate which was only fair. A couple of good things - there was a fridge, microwave & coffee maker in the room (necessary for making our own edible breakfast!) and the wireless internet was efficient and free.

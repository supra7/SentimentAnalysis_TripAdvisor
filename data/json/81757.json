I dont normally have time for writing reviews but this hotel was a great stay, great value and felt really safe. The beds were crispy and clean, the bathroom were tidy and crispy. Our rooms smelt great and breakfast was big and long. We just spent 5 weeks in the US and stayed at some more expensive but far worse horror hotels in Long Beach and one in New Jersey. We loved the fact you could not hear the noise from the road out front and that the floors we stayed on were only accessible by security card and had no access from the outside world. The pool was not in use due to renovations which was a little disappointing but the beach was close by and this hotel is really handy to everything. I just hope when Best Western takes over the value stays. Location wise we did not know San Pedro but we now love it. 1 highway to LA central and close to everything, close by LA standards anyway. We plan to stay again as long as Best Western does not up the prices to suit the grandeur of the old school classy building. Felt like we were staying in Beverly Hills from inside.

They did such a good job of planning and timing that our stay was not interrupted by any construction noise. The room was excellent, clean, and comfortable. Breakfast was good, and they provided a free shuttle both to and from the cruise ship.

They have a free shuttle to the port. You could even walk, but it's a pretty good hike with luggage. The decor is dated, there's peeling paint in the bathrooms, and a bit of a musty smell throughout. The fake classic art give it a bit of a Disney Hollywood Hotel feel. The free breakfast is decent and you can get plenty to eat. Didn't check out the pool/spa or exercise room. We had 2 rooms on the 3rd floor...the one on the street side of the building was noisy with little sound proofing and lots of street noise all night long. The one on the back side had a view of a cement wall and a parking lot above the level of the window. There is free wifi--only 2 bar signal in our room, but still it was free and helpful.

Pretty much the same as one of the hotels stay and dine packages I think. I was pretty excited after seeing the great reviews on here. The Roosevelt delivered. First of all this place has the best location out of any of the Seattle Hotels I have stayed at. We did quite a bit and everything was within 2 blocks. It was great! We used the Valet with no issues. I will note most valets at least offer to help with bags and such which these ones didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Not an issue for me, as I usually just get my own anyway. Check in was very friendly. We arrived prior to check in but was glad that a room was available. The check in staff even gave me a choice of several floors which I thought was a nice touch. We took the highest floor available. We had a deluxe King Junior suite. Not a great view, but we were up high so that was nice. Overall, I was very impressed with the room. Large living area with sofa and desk, bed was comfortable, and a flat screen TV that rotates towards living area or the bed. The only downside to this hotel and their rooms are the bathrooms. Although I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t book a room based on bathroom, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to lie, I was not impressed. Very small, the shower had a hard wide spray (not adjustable). I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a tall guy so I am used to not having a spacious shower. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look up at the vent above the shower, could be dust and stuff there from the 1980\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. It was gross looking. Anyway, as I stated, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t book on the bathroom, but for you picky travelers, I just wanted to note it. I am guessing had we upgraded to a Jacuzzi suite it would have been bigger. The room also had a small coffee pot and coffee and a separate sink area which is nice. This room is great, especially if you are going to spend any time in there. Many Seattle hotel rooms, you would get cabin fever due to small rooms, well, not the case here. We had lunch at the attached Bar & restaurant called Vons. It was incredible. They had great food and a great beer and liquor selection. I was impressed and Vons is a must do in Seattle now. We used the dining credit for Il Fornaio which is right across the street in the mall. It was good and I will write separate reviews on the dining. Checkout was easy and quick and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait too long to pick up the car. As a side note, I did not experience slow elevators as other stated. Keep in mind, this is an old historic hotel and there are only two elevators, so not much can be done about that. Get a low floor if you are that picky about it. I was really impressed overall and the Roosevelt is one of our new favorite Seattle Hotels. It has great location, spacious room, friendly staff, and worked out great for us. I do a decent amount of traveling and also do some travel blogging. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to share our experience with everyone. I hope they keep up with some of the specials such as Groupon and the Stay and Dine. Great opportunity for new fans like us! One side note: hey Brandon, I would love to see the Roosevelt on Facebook and Twitter. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see anything except West coast hotels on Facebook. I also really like the emails you get ahead of time. No need to confirm when they remind you of the upcoming stay as well as a thank you email after you leave.

The room was very quiet even though we were only steps from the elevator, and there was no street noise at all. Slight niggles: some nooks and crannies suggested that cleaning hadn't been quite as thorough as one might hope - dust on top of a few less commonly seen horizontal surfaces. The tea/coffee service was incomplete with several choices of sugar and sweetener but no creamer. The bar was packed to the gills on a Saturday evening and we had no chance to try their martini selection.

We had a small glitch with our reservation when we checked in, the problem was fixed and the front desk was very caring and concerned. Great service rises when there are problems. It is a lovely older property that is run by Coast Hotels and it is in a perfect location. We were assigned a corner room on the 11th floor overlooking the city and Pine Street. My wife could see the department stores, malls and great shopping from our window, so the location was very convenient for her to just step outside and go shopping. There were many nice places to eat and Von's which has an entrance inside the hotel was a nice place to get drinks and a small meal for a reasonable price on our first night there. Just across the road was a Mall that had a variety of stores and a whole floor of restaurants. The Market and the monorail stop are down and I mean down the road. You can walk to most of the Seattle attractions and the monorail ($2.00 one way) takes you to the Space Needle and park about a mile away. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Duck Boat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tours has a stop right outside the monorail stop and it is a great way to see the city and get on the water.

The walk back up the hill is, as others have mention a little trek but you can always call a cab and for $5.00 be back at the hotel. We did both. The oversized corner room was well appointed, a king size very comfortable bed, sitting area, huge flat screen TV, free WiFi, desk, ottomans, a smaller bath with older but very clean functional fixtures and another bath with the one of the largest jacuzzi baths I have ever seen. It was put to good use and it worked great. We had more than enough towels and bath accessories. There was plenty of closet and storage space. Bathrobes and slippers were hanging in the closet and they provided bottled water. ($4.00) We did not use the fitness center and I am not sure if they have a pool.

The Roosevelt hotel is conveniently located right next to the Metro station in the Nordstrom mall and the ride-free time is pretty decent.

If you take the bus, be sure to hold onto the pass that the driver gives you because it is a day pass for a certain number hours that saves you fares. Also, the blocks aren't nearly as large as they seem on the maps, so walk everywhere you can. You could even walk to the Space Needle from the Roosevelt hotel on 7th Avenue if you have 15-20 minutes to spare.

Oh please. They don't even have a sign that ONE elevator is working on any of the floors. It's like they want to hide the fact that it hasn't been working for 1/3 of the year already. One elevator for 20+ floors is ridiculous. You share the elevator with any and all hotel staff and wait 10-20 minutes for it (not knowing why unless you asked since there are no signs or apologies on any elevator!). I think the worst was when BF and I were told that we booked two queen (more like full) beds by the manager, Alicia. She was the worst. She told us to our face that we booked the two queens when we booked the one king bed. I asked her for proof, a print screen, anything that supported her statement that us, a couple, would book two queen beds and instead she told us to call priceline ourselves. She is the worst hotel \"manager\" I've ever encountered. Her young minion that looked like he was 12 was similar. He told us to go book a hotel elsewhere and good luck finding one on Fourth of July weekend. I will never be staying here and I highly advise that everyone avoid the lack of professionalism and service, hotel management all under the age of 25 and who act like it and one working elevator for 20+ floors.

It's literally one block from Washington State Convention & Trade Center, where I had a work related conference. I stayed 4 nights, 5 days. Plus it's directly across the street from the Gray Line Seattle Downtown Airporter, only $17 round trip, to and from the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport main terminal. Believe me, when you are tired from running around all day, having a hotel you can practically crawl home to is a blessing. Plus it was close enough to take breaks back at the room during the day. The concierge/front desk was nice enough to hold onto my luggage the last day of the conference, even though I checked out that morning, so I didn't have to haul it around with me all day. The room was unexpectedly tiny, but sufficient if you just want a place to crash at night. The bathroom was so small, you had to close the bathroom door before using the toilet. Maybe not a big deal for men, but women may find themselves not being able to reach the toilet paper after sitting down if they left the door open. The shower was so small, there was no room to bend over inside the shower space. I'm 5'6\" and I had to lean out the door to wash my feet and legs. No tub, just the small shower stall. The good thing is that the shower set-up encourages you to save water. You have to turn the water off to soap up since there is no place to get out of the shower stream while in the stall. I had a room on the back-side, away from the city street. The good things are that it was quiet and private (only a brick wall straight across from the window). The bad thing was that it was directly over the vent to one of the greasy food restaurants. So, you had a choice. Either have the window open and smell old grease, or have the window closed and have a nice, white noise background sound from all the fans and vents that were in the area. The food situation was challenging. There was no supermarket, mini-mart or drugstore close to stock up on munchies and water. There was a Starbucks (surprise) directly across the street, so I got a big plastic cup I used the whole visit as well as paying too much for juice and water. There is a Bartell Drugs on 5th & Olive, but it was out of the way. I did pick up a few things on the 3rd day. Luckily, the conference provided food in the evening of most days, but I was on my own a couple days. Since I had eaten at the San Francisco one, I ate at Ruth's Chris Steak House, about one block away. Von's Grand City Cafe is off the hotel lobby and it reminded me of a TGIF or Applebee's. Service was terrible, but it was close. Other alternatives I noticed within one block, I didn't check out: GameWorks (bar/junk food), Cheesecake Factory, Fox Sports Grill (down stairs), Dragonfish Asian Cafe. Overall, the concierge and front desk were very helpful. Two small annoyances. When I arrived, the front desk clerk was chatting on the phone and trying to check me in at the same time. I didn't know whether he was talking to me or the person on the phone. Second, I had a package of extra stuff I had bought such as books I wanted shipped back home. Even though I made all arrangements to have it go out on Tuesday, the package was still sitting at the hotel as of Thursday. It only went out then because I called to ask about it.", "Date": "October 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "austin, tx", "Title": "\u201cThey overbooked us and we had to move way out of town!\u201d", "Author": "sciencefan", "ReviewID": "UR5725738", "Content": "I had booked and prepaid for this hotel. I confirmed 2 days before we arrived, late check in guaranteed. We arrived after a long drive from Vancouver only to find there was no room for us. They did arrange for us to stay at another hotel in Seattle, miles away at Lake Union; evidently there were no other rooms available in the downtown area. The check-in agent seemed put out to have to relocate and accommodate us. He did arrange for us to have a car service with one transfer downtown. It would only take 5 minutes for the car to arrive. We moved hotels and called the car service, only to be told it would arrive in roughly 90 minutes. This was supposed to be the cap-off of a long 10 day vacation, and it turned out to be a horrible experience.

During my two day's stay here I spent at least 3 hours over phone to talk with them, and the feed backs are: sir, there might be somebody using microwave .....sir, why not move your laptop around the room, sir, you are in seattle so I cannot do anything from here, sir, I have been talking with you for 45 minutes, ...(not my fault!), and I have to change my room to get a better signal. I am sure nothing is wrong with the WiFi on my laptop (I am a WiFi expert) and actually one of them admitted they have trouble with their network and give me one day free service, but the next day they denied that they have any problem with the network when the problem came back again.

I chose the Roosevelt primarily due to price and proximity to the convention center (1 block away). Having read previous reviews, I knew it was an older hotel and was prepared for some quirks. I was pleasantly surprised by the cozy, well-appointed lobby and my comfortable corner room. The size of the room was more than adequate for a single person. The bathroom only had a shower but that didn't bother me. The room was very quiet, perhaps because it was in the back of the hotel away from the street. The staff were courteous and helpful.

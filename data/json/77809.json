For my purposes, the location cannot be beat. Shopping is good and you can walk to the fashion district, Chinatown, Toy District etc. As a female traveler, I feel very safe here. There is plenty to do and see without having to deal with parking problems and expenses. After seeing my room, a coworker changed to this hotel. I have found the rooms I've been in to be clean, comfortable and functional, at a reasonable price - otherwise I would not have returned. There is a 24 hour Vietnamese restaurant next door and a daytime breakfast/lunch restaurant adjoining the hotel. You are 2 blocks (less then a 3 minute walk) to the Grand Market which is open daily until 6 pm - it is filled with a variety of food stands, fruit stands and a store where you can buy a variety of items - groceries, pots - pans and hygene items. The Hotel staff is excellent, and can communicate in several languages. When I had to set up an after hours meeting and needed privacy, they arranged for me to have a private room with a conference table and internet with no notice. All I can say if you are not happy with your room, let the staff know - I am sure they will fix the problem Negative items include the TV service, which can cut in and out at different times and the internet can take some \"tweaking\" to get it to work.

It is NOT the Hilton chain, or the Sheraton's chain - but, if I wanted that sort of hotel, I would go there. So, please when deciding on what sort of hotel you want don't rubbish the hotels that give you good service and are in an ideal spot (transport wise). True, the Kawada is looking tired, it is also true that the rooms are small, but they have a laundromat, ice machine, drinks machines, and an excellent \"safe room\" and the staff are terrific. No, they don't have the wonderful uniforms that the chains have, but, I am not looking at that. What I want from a hotel is a clean bed, a safe room (locks all work) and when I request something, I expect it done. That is what the Kawada has. The most appealing aspect of this hotel is that it is on the transport hub. All kinds of buses run 1 block from the hotel. Taxis, rail (right across the street), and seniors bus transport (for 25 cents American) to anywhere downtown. The \"Alleys\" is within walking distance, the Jewellery centre 2 blocks, and 2 blocks is the fruit and vegetable market - and what a wonderful display of food! As far as being in a safe area - I am travelling alone and I walk around at night in that area and I feel safe. I have not been mugged or questioned, and I am a senior. (Perhaps they feel sorry for me!). I will always stay at the Kawada and for the price - it is a real bargain. The staff are terrific. The problem that I see for the Kawada is that it has no restaurant (or coffee lounge). But there is a pizza place not far from there and the reception staff will give you a list of businesses that will bring in food (hot) for you.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hillsboro, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely not what you'd expect\u201d", "Author": "RaeRaeSama", "ReviewID": "UR121993827", "Content": "First I arrived in the dead of night and even though I had a reservation, I was forced to pay for an extra day for 6 hours.

It is a block from the superior court and the county administration buildings, which makes it an ideal location if you have busness at either place. Two blocks the other way is the Ronald Reagan State Building, Two blocks up 2d is the Disney Concert Hall. It's a bit of a climb from the Kawada but worth a look. The rooms are reasonably priced and comfortable. The building was built in the early '20's and received a complete makeover in 1990. The old girl is starting to look like she could use a sprucing up, but the rooms are clean and the beds soft. When I started staying there in 1996, the hotel was nor near anything but fast food restaurants. Now there is a good pizza place and a good chinese retaurant both at 2d and Main, about three blocks away. A block down Hill Street is the Grand Central eating plaza which has several good stands with a convenience store on the Broadway side. There is valet parking. I gave the place only four stars because it is beginning to need a facelift, but it is a really good place to stay. The staff is really nice and helpful. All of the rooms have refidgerators. Many of the rooms have microwaves, and some have kitchenettes. There are fancier places to stay not too far away, but the Kawada is the best value. Since it is right at the corner of 2d & Hill, there is some traffic noise. If you are a litght sleeper, make sure you get an interior room. If you are a heavy sleeper like me, it doesn't matter.

The staff were extremely friendly and obliging with any request we may have had. The small restaurant downstairs provides great meals, however isn't open after 4pm for dinner. There are more fast food and restaurants a block away should you need . I believe that the hotel is opening a Pho City restaurant very soon. There is only one computer in the lobby and I found that there were times that we were waiting for sometime to use it. No WiFi...only wired internet for a fee we were told.

The attorney said she was not fussy and just needed a place to sleep. I went ahead and booked the room for her. She checked in and ran out screaming once she saw the room. She told me she absolutely could not stay there. They attempted to make a queen size bed by pushing two twins together. Half of it was made, the other was not. The sheets appeared to be dirty. The room did not smell good. The room was so small that this petite woman could barely walk around the bed. The rate was $109 per night. She said she would not have even paid $20 per night for this kind of room. Of course, the cancellation policy is 24 hours in advance so they said that we would be charged for the room. We had to speak to the general manager, John Marko, to request a refund. He defended the hotel saying it was completely booked and that every other guest found it satisfactory enough to stay. He said there is a roll away twin underneath and that is why the beds were formed like that. He kept saying it is the canellation policy and we are going to be charged regardless. I told him I understand that is the policy and asked him to make an exception due to the experience the guest had.

This property has no crime 20 years, I mean since the owner has purchased this property and remodelled building as hotel, I heard. Five story old building has no bugs inside. Isn't it very funny? The cleanliness is much much better than five star hotels such as Ritz Carlton, GrandHyatt, etc, because of good housekeeping staffs, and because the top management people is, like TOYOTAs/HONDAs, stepping down to the level of staffs and talks with them; which US auto makers would not do.

There was a vent fan above the countertop, indicating there was a stove/oven in the room at some point. The room was incredibly dingy, poorly lit, and small. The bedding was a scratchy comforter and white sheets. Nothing fancy, but they were probably the best part of the room. The convention rate included free in-room Wifi, but the wall-mounted Wifi panel fell apart in our hands (although the connection still worked) when we touched it.

The shower was sufficient, although the water temperature would suddenly and drastically change (from hot to hotter) while I was showering. We had a rental car which was valet parked for $13/night. I think they parked it at a secure lot next to the hotel, but I'm not sure. There was an inexpensive public pay lot less than a block from the hotel, but it wasn't secure and we didn't feel safe leaving our car there. The hotel is actually pretty well located right off CA 110, and it was easy to get to I-5 as well. It rarely took us more than 20 minutes to get where we were going, but we were mostly driving at off-peak times. This hotel isn't really in a great location in terms of exploring the city on foot, although if you go about a mile away down the road, there's a pretty fancy shopping area. One block behind the hotel was a cluster of fast food places, but there is no convenience store, drug store, or other place to buy toiletries anywhere within a couple blocks' walking distance.

Unfortunately this downtown area has more than its fair share of homeless people calling it home, and because the street are often otherwise deserted, you do feel very conspicuous walking around searching for a convenience store (there aren't too many!). Rooms are small and the decor is dated (very 80s). Our window had a nice view of a brick wall. The shower wasn't too powerful, and overall the bathroom didn't feel too clean. The service was reasonably polite but not particularly helpful. For travellers unfamiliar with LA and want a bit of excitement, don't stay downtown. Business travellers on a tight budget would find this suitable.", "Date": "October 21, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Kawada Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d77809-Reviews-Kawada_Hotel-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$74 - $101*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">200 South Hill Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">90012</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "77809", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/15/b0/15b0e5862285234f80c50bf0af23940a1large.jpg"}}

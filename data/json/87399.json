The Fairmont feels like a country club and the warm service reflects this aesthetic. You are treated as a special guest. At Christmas time the lobby featured one of the tallest and most beautiful Christmas trees I've ever seen decorated with lights, ornaments and starfish. The hotel also offered a menorah lighting for Jewish guests which we participated in with other families. The rooms are beautiful and are all suites with living rooms as well as bedrooms. (We took two rooms which was an enormous amount of space for the four of us.) The pools are very clean and plentiful, swim-up bar and poolside dining are available and good. One highlight of our stay was a massage on the beach in a spa cabana--decadent and relaxing. The beach is beautiful with calm water and good service ( chair and umbrella set-up) though no food service, which was disappointing. You had to get your own drinks and lunch was only served around the pool area. For dinner, the hotel's fine restaurant was very, very good, and to sit outside under the stars and have the wonderful food and wine was magical and memorable. My husband and I had a romantic meal alone one night and brought our daughters (10 and 14) another evening. Maui is a sunny, pretty, happy island. We went on a fun snorkeling excursion and got up at 4 am to watch the dramatic sunrise over Mount Hakealaka (though we did not bike down). But the best days were spent at the beach and enjoying the pools. There is a path connecting The Fairmont to The Four Seasons and the Grand Wailea. We walked to the Four Seasons one day for lunch.

Fast forward a few decades and things are decidedly more extravagant. At the Fairmont Kea Lani, I learned how far luxury has advanced. You can sense something special is about to happen when you drive through Wailea on your way to the resort. The grass seems greener. The aroma of flowers is stronger. White egrets flutter about manicured lawns. Then...the Fairmont, Hawaii's only all suite and villa oceanfront resort. Lush gardens tumble down to the sea. Heart-melting Pacific Ocean views await. 2 activity pools are connected by a 140-foot water slide. Another pool off to the side for quieter pursuits. At your suite, you enter a richly furnished living room. The suite is tempered with earth tones. An airy, clean-lined aesthetic prevails. Insider tip: Book one of the suites higher up for a more spectacular view of the deep blue sea, and the romantic sunsets. Shortly afterward, the welcomes arrive. Cards from the front office. The 5-star service is impeccable. I don't know who makes the mattresses, but sleeping in the bed feels like sleeping on a cloud. It's only appropriate that the bed is on a raised platform. The rainfall shower opens directly into the main part of the bath but is contained in a separate tiled area. Designer bath products for tub bathing are welcome accompaniments. Escape to the expansive balcony. Lounge on the chaise and indulge in the cherished concept of doing nothing. Or...grab pen, paper and order up your favorite cocktail. This is the perfect environment to lay out the chapters for your next mystery novel. Romantics will want to check into one of the oceanfront villas. Complete with private plunge pool and exquisite views of the Pacific. Amenities and activities abound. How about pampering yourself in one of the spas? One unique treatment combines exfoliating volcanic pumice with purifying ginger, olena, wasabi, lemongrass, mahimahi tea and tropical oils. Or kiss away an afternoon on the sandy beach. Take advantage of a full range of ocean activities: snorkeling, sailing, kayaking, stand-up paddling and scuba diving. Outrigger canoe trips available daily. The resort's signature restaurant is Ko(sugar cane). Ko features a mix of cultures and flavors. When renovations are complete, the area will be blessed by a local Kahu(Hawaiian minister). In the meantime, I indulged by dining at Nick's Fish House. The name does not convey the high quality of the meal I received there: A heavenly crab cake, succulent rack of lamb and a slice of decadent New York cheese cake. Go ahead. Treat yourself to the hedonistic way of life. Check in and prepare to be pleasantly fussed over. This is a resort worth leaving home for.

ARRIVAL My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 and I arrived at the Kea Lani at night. Our expectations of this trip were at their peak because we were here not only to review the hotel, but also to be married on the beach and honeymoon in the exquisite beauty of Maui. Arriving at night had its advantages; the glow of tiki torches lit up the wandering paths and deeply set the palm trees and Hawaiian evergreens in shadow. Later I observed that every night at dusk, a runner lights the Kea Lani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hundreds of torches by hand, often with a following of excited children. The grand entrance, I noticed immediately, is open to the air on two sides, clear to the ocean behind the hotel. A valet and greeter welcomed us Hollywood movie-style with leis for us both. My fianc\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was a deep brown nut-strewn one and mine a stunning and sweet-smelling strand of pink and white fresh flowers. Check-in was friendly and fast and within minutes we were escorted to our room. Even in the dark, I could tell this hotel was special. LOCATION The Fairmont Kea Lani resort is on 22 acres, fronting Polo Beach in the Wailea area of Maui in Hawaii. The grounds are, bar none, the best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen. Their tropical beauty maintains an ideal balance of manicured and natural beauty. ROOMS Every room at the Kea Lani is a one-bedroom suite. This is as ideal for couples as it is for families. If your family is a little larger, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re traveling with another couple or you just crave the vacation home feeling, the resort also has large private two- or three-bedroom villas steps away from the ocean. The villas have full kitchens, tons of space and private lanais with a plunge pool and grill. I pay particular attention when I travel to whether or not a hotel room has the comforts of home as I find this makes a tremendous difference in how much I enjoy myself. The Kea Lani is the first hotel or resort I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve reviewed that has ALL the comforts of home in my list. Each newly-remodeled suite is spacious with at least 840 square-feet of room to relax. The sitting rooms here make excellent use of space and sport a sofa bed as a bonus. Leftovers from the delicious on-site or local restaurants can be refrigerated in the mini-fridge and heated up in the microwave. Each room has a private lanai (balcony or patio) with comfortable furniture. The beds are heavenly soft and I left the sliding door open to enjoy the sound of the waves hitting the beach every night as I slept. The bathrooms here have an amenity I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never seen in a hotel before, a clothes hamper. It is the extra touches here, like the hamper, that help make the Kea Lani special in a sea of luxury hotels in Hawaii. The roomy, tiled shower without a door is also a favorite made possible by the tropical climate. Double pedestal sinks and huge mirrors with good lighting complete the room. The Kea Lani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suites and villas are tastefully decorated. They feature colorful Hawaiian art and modern design without overdoing the tropical theme. The sofas are comfortable and the media capabilities, including nice flat TVs, ipod docks, speakers and wireless internet allow for quality working (if you must, but don't even think about working if you're here on your honeymoon) or peaceful down time. THE ALOHA SPIRIT Rarely do I find a resort that does such a good job of welcoming its guests. In Maui, everyone is family. At the Kea Lani, everyone is long-lost and much-loved family. Because my visit was much longer than usual, I was able to interact with many staff members, every one of which was friendly and personally interested in my stay in a truly genuine way. The number of people who went out of their way to see to my comfort was astonishing. I also had the opportunity to see this same experience between the staff and other hotel guests. If for no other reason, the exceptional aloha spirit here is a reason to choose this hotel. CULINARY EXPERIENCE The Fairmont Kea Lani has four restaurants to choose from, allowing for casual or elegant dining, depending on your mood. The food is outstanding and not unreasonably priced. For guests seeking the ultimate romantic dinner, I strongly suggest private cabana dining at Ko, the Kea Lani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool-side restaurant. This dinner is absolutely perfect for a wedding day (as was my experience), an anniversary, or a proposal. The customizable four-course dinner can include the most delectable sushi I have ever tasted, called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oishi,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and fresh Hawaiian fish baked to soft and buttery perfection. When you combine this with the fastidious service and intimate setting, it is dining perfection. OUTRIGGER CANOE EXPERIENCE When you visit, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to take advantage of the on-site activities at the Kea Lani. The website does not go into a lot of detail, but the concierge will fill you in on choices, times and prices. My favorite is the outrigger canoe experience. Two experienced, knowledgeable and fun guides take up to four guests on a canoe ride off the shoreline. The guides entertain with Hawaiian tales and local facts while they do their best to teach guests how to row in sync. While none of us in the boat ever did catch on to harmonious rowing, we were lucky enough to have the once-in-a-lifetime experience of hearing the music of a mother, baby and escort whale as they actually swam under the canoe. MY RECOMMENDATION Do not miss this adventure! The Fairmont Kea Lani makes my list of the rare resorts that earn all five of my review stars.

Always busy but expected at a busy hotel. Lunch, drinks and dinner are expensive, but so is everything else nice on the island! Maui is not cheap! We had an incredible dinner at Nicks with amazing fresh fish, great service and a beautiful view. I loved the low key vibe at the hotel, with couples and families.. There was nothing pretentious about the hotel.. Just nice people. I felt comfortable and felt like I could relax.. Unlike the Four Seasons... I payed $95 for a mediocre blow dry at the salon and $25 for a drink. Yikes. Lastly, to keep in mind when booking this hotel, is the high season.. Spring is definitely the best time and value..

I wouldn't even rate it as a 4-star, definitely a solid 3-star with nothing luxurious, average accommodations and service that needs a lot of improvement. First of all, the resort is simply old, with run down amenities and poorly cleaned. I couldn't help but notice dirty mirrors all over the resort, dusty shelves, stained pillows in the lounge area and dirty silverware in the restaurant. After a while it became disgusting to know that Fairmont charges almost $800 + tax in January for an ocean suite during a full blown construction of a restaurant while guests have to carry disinfectant gels to wipe hands, silverware and everything else that comes in contact. Check-in personnel always looked bored and unmotivated, rarely smiled and looked irritated if any guest would approach with a request of some kind. We traveled in a group of 6 and I spent quite some time in the lobby waiting for the entire group to gather up thus having plenty of opportunities to observe the behavior of front desk. Pretty disappointing for a resort that claims to be a 5-star property. Take a 10-minute stroll down the beach to the neighboring Four Seasons and get completely blown away by the most attentive, friendly and amazing customer service offered by Four Seasons not only to their guests but also to visitors who just stop by for a short visit. Next time I will definitely stay in Four Seasons and would highly recommend anyone to consider it over Fairmont. Now moving on to the accommodations. Rooms are spacious with large bathrooms, no complaints here except that even ocean facing suite is so far away from the ocean that you will never hear even a distant sound of the ocean. Instead, most of the ocean suites are facing swimming pools so what you will hear late at night and early in the morning is a swim pool pump that either cleans the pools or pumps the water, I have no idea what this pump does but it is really irritating. Taking a nap in your room during mid-day proved to be quite challenging because rooms appear to have super thin walls so you either hear screaming children by the pool or blasting TV in the room next door or a cleaning crew dragging chairs in the suite above you. The hotel is kid friendly so you will see and hear a lot of children 24 hours a day no matter where you are. I don't have problem with children and it didn't really bother me, but if you are a kind of person who like peace and quite or a honeymoon couple on a romantic getaway, don't expect anything romantic or peaceful at Fairmont. On the other hand, if you are a family traveling with children, Fairmont would be perfect as your child would most likely find tons of friends within 10 minutes of arrival. Restaurants on the property are extremely overpriced and not delicious. Besides charging ridiculous prices expect to receive a poor, slow service. Ordering a small bowl of soup that they charge $18 arrived with a plastic spoon with an explanation that they \"run out of regular clean spoons\" so your $18 soup during dinner is served with a cheap plastic spoon. That happened twice during our stay. After second time noone ordered soup anymore because it is kind of ridiculous to come down all dressed up to a fancy restaurant for dinner and get plastic spoons. Beach area was so-so and not really inviting or clean. I don't think they clean the beach daily, more like weekly. They have employees working on the beach who suppose to bring and install beach umbrellas if you order one. On one such occasion, the Fairmont employee brought an umbrella and while digging a hole in the sand to put the umbrella in, he was continuously either talking on his cell phone or spitting on the sand around the umbrella. All of this while we were standing, waiting and observing him spitting in the sand. I have no further comment about this. In summary, I would personally never visit Fairmont ever again, at least not at this location and would seriously re-consider my future visits to any other Fairmont. Perhaps they were a great brand in the past, but over the years all of this have changed and they no longer can be called a 5-star property. So unless you are getting seriously discounted price to stay at this location and not paying more than $200/night, I would skip this resort all together and stay elsewhere.

Food on property was ridiculously expensive, and quality was questionable. I don't mind paying $50 for dinner, but please, give me a quality meal. And God FORBID you are a smoker!!! We booked our trip, and booked a smoking room. With ZERO warning, we arrived, only to find they had converted the ENTIRE property to NON-smoking. YAY for you non smokers, but please, we really are humans after all! The Fairmont has decided to allow 3 'smoking areas' on the 30+ Acre property. They have made sure they are about AS FAR from civilization as you can get! Do NOT try to sneak a smoke on your lanai...they have rooftop patrols! It is a 20 minute walk to get from your room to a designated smoking area. All in all...about 45 minutes round trip!

When we booked the room, we were assured that all the rooms are the same. They are, inside, but the \"very nice\" garden view we were expecting based on what we were told when we booked turned out to be a parking lot, over the HVAC plant, and right by an elevator that the bellman admitted was under construction during the day. When we asked to move to a quieter spot, we were moved to a room next to a loudly humming electrical room adjacent to an ice machine, by yet another elevator, and overlooking a spot where there was a loud corporate party going on. I have to assume that was some kind of FU from the desk staff for daring to complain. After a sleepless night, we were moved to yet another room that, while quieter, still had a relatively poor view. Despite repeated requests, they never were able to come up with a satisfactory room for the entire ten nights we were there. Perhaps it was because we had pre-paid, and they knew there was nothing we could do about it. Or maybe it was that they had overbooked with obnoxious corporate parties.

We were with a large group from work, and we all had a great time. The rooms are HUGE with separate sleeping and living areas. The bathrooms is enormous with a cool open shower and separate bathtub. The king bed was comfy, linens were high quality, the overhead fan was perfect, and the turndown service each night was awesome - we came in after dinner each night to the lovely sounds of Hawaiian music on the tvs. Every staff member we were in contact with were exceptionally friendly and helpful, especially the young lady who checked us in. It's a shame I can't remember her name, but she was very gracious and accomodating. The adult pool had a few kids around, but it was quiet and peaceful each day. The pool bar served great rum drinks .. a bit pricey but hey, you're on vacation in one of the most beautiful places on earth! We took walks each day, ended up at the Shops at Wailea one day and had lunch at KAI Wailea sushi bar. This was probably the least enjoyable part of our vacation ... we waited 10 minutes to be seated, even though there were only 3 other people in the entire restaurant. Unfortunately, the server seated us right next to another couple, even though .. yep, the restaurant was EMPTY and we would have loved a little privacy. In any case, the Sapporo was refreshing, and we enjoyed lunch plates. The food was ok, nothing spectacular. We also had sushi at Sansei in Kihei... loved it so much we went back another night. The sushi was fresh and delicious; the cocktails and sake were perfect, and we had a fun time singing a few karaoke tunes. We didn't expect the karaoke, so it was a ton of fun! Had lunch at Moose McGillycuddy's one afternoon and enjoyed pork quesadillas and healthy-sized bevvies. Sat at the bar and had a great time chatting with the bartender who's wife and newborn popped in for a hello. Nice, nice folks. The place was charming and it gave us a break from the higher cost food and drink at the Fairmont. We also visited the Maui Ocean Center and Aquarium- great time, beautiful layout in the park and the staff was very informative. We went in the evening for a special function, so not all of the exhibits were open, but the aquarium itself was awesome. A definite must-see when in Maui. The first few nights of our trip were spent in Lahaina, and it was nice to get the contrast between there and Wailea. Both spots were amazing, but we definitely enjoyed the laid-back atmosphere at the Fairmont Kea Lani.

The grounds around the free-form main pool look down a gentle slope to a spectacular beach -- a memorable sight. Even when the hotel was full, there were always plenty of lounge chairs. The adult pool really meant it. Half the people there seemed absorbed in their Kindles and barely went into the water. Some who did get wet barely moved. For a swimmer, it was heaven. In contrast, the main pool at the Four Seasons resort nearby lacked the Fairmont\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s magnificent view and felt surprisingly closed in. At the other luxury competitor nearby, the Grand Wailea, the main pool area offered endless water slides and might thrill a 10-year-old more than an adult. But the Fairmont offers more than a good swim. Except for a few villas, accommodations are all spacious suites offered for the price of rooms in some places. The suites seem to be very similar, with location determining the cost. Though the living room furniture is a bit dated, the bed was exceptionally comfortable. The large bathrooms have separate showers and tubs and two sinks. Soundproofing must be very good; in a whole week, we were never even aware of a neighbor. Some of the cheaper suites overlook parking lots and the like. We decided on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153partial ocean view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd suite, which seemed to be the sweet spot in terms of value. Our suite (617) actually offered a very generous portion of ocean view, especially from the terrace. Every terrace \u00e2\u20ac\u201c OK, lanai \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at the resort seems to be about the same size, large enough for a chaise longue, a dining table and chairs for four. The resort also has a convenient upscale deli. Most days we prepared our deli lunch in our kitchenette and ate on the roomy lanai , enjoying our generous slice of ocean view and saving a nice piece of change. The resort serves an abundant breakfast buffet in a beautiful setting overlooking a pool. The list price is $30 a head. Though the resort doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to promote it too aggressively, the same thing is available as a prepaid package for about half the cost. For dinner, we had very good meals at the resort. Visiting the Four Seasons, we had even better dinners at Spago and Duo -- for more money, of course. A welcome bargain was a pleasant dinner from the deli enjoyed on our peaceful lanai just after sunset. Other money savers: The resort invites you to join the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fairmont President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Club.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The price is right: nothing. But among other benefits, you get free Internet access, which would otherwise cost $14.95 a day. Also, each residential floor of the resort has its own free washer and dryer. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really need a car. Cab fare from the airport is $55, but for another $10, the resort arranged for a car service to meet us. (The return trip was $55.) The Fairmont offers a free shuttle service to nearby locations, but many, such as the Four Seasons, are only a short walk away. We rented a car from the Avis desk at the hotel (about $80 for the day) to drive to Hana. The famous drive is indeed spectacular. More experienced travelers told us you could get most of the benefit by driving only half way, which we did. Some guidebooks advise starting at the crack of dawn to avoid traffic on the difficult winding road. Perhaps that is wise advice in the busiest season, but we ignored it and found the traffic was quite manageable. From start to finish, service at the hotel was efficient and exceptionally friendly. A couple of emails sent before we arrived were answered promptly. More generally, Wailea itself is an excellent choice. It really is in the dry and warm part of the island, which is crucial; you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to Maui for the opera A few quibbles: As in most hotels, the bathrooms could use more hooks and towel racks. The pool area could use a few more umbrellas for shade, and a picky traveler might welcome a restroom nearer the beach. Though a renovation project is supposed to be completed by April, it caused a some irritating noise at the adult pool. But overall, the Fairmont was close to ideal.

Rooms were spacious; two rooms, and clean. The bathroom is quite large and the walk-in shower was nice. My husband and I just kept feeling like it is a nice hotel, but not as luxurious as other Fairmont's (in fact the most disappointing). The other's we have stayed at are in Seattle, Whistler, Vancouver, BC, and Bora Bora. So, those are all very nice properties so maybe that is our problem with the Maui location. The architecture is strange, very middle eastern and the hallways reminded me of a Best Western or something. When you walk down these VERY long hallways, all you see at the end of them are EXIT signs and a door. No decorations on any of the walls and usually you would find a table or chair or vase or something at the end of the hallway. We got an \"ocean view\" room and do not recommend paying the extra price. The hotel is located pretty far back from the beach so it's not like you can hear the waves crashing or anything. You can see the ocean from all the rooms except the ones in the very front of the hotel. Definitely not worth paying more for a full ocean view. Our deluxe ocean view room (we moved due to noise in our first room) had a great view of another hotel and if you looked to your left you could see the ocean but the majority of the view was of that other hotel (Polo Club?). The best view is from the beach so just go there! :) The pools were nice, a lot of families having a great time going down the slide. But, again, I expected an attendant at the pool that would lay out your towels or get you settled with towels and bring you a drink (as the other hotels did) but the attendants (other than the pool waiters) just rolled up towels and left them on a table for you to grab yourself. Not a big deal but not as \"fancy\" as other Fairmonts. My friend actually ordered a drink from the adult pool and waited over an hour for it. There is a nice beach and we could watch whales jumping any time of day. The food is very expensive but it's like that all over Maui. A cheeseburger by the pool is $20, the drink on special is $10.

They are in the middle a very modest renovation, including their celebrated restaurant Ko, and it was noisy at times and unfortunately our meeting room was near the renovation. On site food at Rex's Fish Market was marginally above average. All in all, a terrific spot and while our experience was far from perfect, worth the price.

This suite type was recommended for families but I would say it's great for anyone who doesn't want to constantly walk through the lobby in their swimsuits. We walked the oceanside path every morning, and contrary to other reviews that say there are too many kids, the pool areas of the Grand Wailea and the Four Seasons were far noisier. Amenities (free snorkels and boards, free wireless with pres club, free parking) were great. Early seating menu at Ko was very affordable (for Maui). Pool areas were lovely, especially the slide. We spent almost no time at the adult pool since it was tucked far away from everything and right under the restaurant. The upper kids pool was relatively quiet. I found the staff very aggressive in cleaning up abandoned chairs littered with towels from the beach and the pool so seating was always available (contrary to other reviews). For cons, I would say that the carpet could have been a touch cleaner; there was dark buildup around the baseboards, and our room was consistently serviced quite late in the day after lunch which was a little inconvenient for napping. I did not find the furnishings dated. The hot tub also could have been policed a little better--since the weather was somewhat cloudy, you could find up to 10 unsupervised children in there, which is strictly against the posted rules. Everything else was a pro--having a fridge was great and the keurig pod coffee machine was wonderful.

There are so many big mirrors in there that you may learn more about yourself than you want to when you get out of the shower.

It was our third visit to the Kea Lani in the past six years, and out first family vacation in three years. I know the island of Maui very well and have stayed at a number of 4- and 5-star resorts across the island over the past two decades. Now, as a parent of two little girls (ages 2 and 5), when choosing hotels, the challenge is to find the right balance between luxury and family friendliness. We don't have the opportunity to take family vacations very often, so our hopes and expectations were very high. I'm delighted to say that the Kea Lani delivered on all fronts. Recently refurbished, the accomodations are fresh and beautiful and spacious, which gives everyone in the family some much-needed elbow room.The landscaping is lush and vibrant and the resort's three pools offer something for everyone -- a very large split-level pool with a waterslide and swim-up bar, a small shallow pool for toddlers to splash around in, and a peaceful adults-only pool for those who want a bit more tranquility. Both the accomodations are the grounds are extremely well-maintained, down to the smallest details. From the time we made our reservation until the time we bid farewell as we left for our flight home, the staff was warm, friendly, professional and very helpful. We definitely recommend taking advantage of the bed & breakfast package. It's a great value. The food and drinks at the resort are not inexpensive, but they are high quality and bountiful. The morning buffet gives everyone in the family a chance to choose their favorites -- and try new dishes, as well. I travel frequently for business and have been fortunate to stay at many luxury hotels. What sets the Kea Lani apart from some other resorts I've visited (in Hawaii and elsewhere) is its thoughtfulness and its consistency. So much attention to detail is given that it truly creates a seamless vacation experience, where all you need to do is sit back, relax and enjoy. The family-friendly aspects of the hotel make things much easier for parents. From the toddler pool to kids' menu options and play area at the main restaurant, these small touches make a world of difference, along with a staff who treat children very kindly, We had a fantastic trip, filled with happy, lazy days in the sunshine.

The presidents club line was nice as we didn't have to wait terribly long before check-in. They even gave us a gift since we were celebrating our 20th anniversary, it was far and a way more than expected. I like the juice they gave us at check-in and inquired about it later to see if we could buy some from the store...turns out its made specially for them but they said to stop by the front desk whenever we wanted and they would bring some out and even went and got some for us right then! We were there between holidays and there weren't lines for anything. There was always at least 2 chairs next any of the pools we went to regardless of the time of day. The beach was great too as they setup an umbrella and chairs (complementary during the remodelling) for us, and there was lots of room there too. We even used the snookering equipment and one time a wave crashed over my wife and I and we lost the goggles and snorkels. She found hers right away but mine were gone. We explained what happened and the staff were very apologetic and informed us that they had to charge us $30 for replacement cost if it wasn't turned in.

The only sign of construction was around the adult pool where there was a wall erected and occasional sawing and hammering but it wasn't bad and sometimes you didn't even know anything was happening. There was also a day when there were painters on the front of the hotel but unless you were walking to your car you didn't even see them. The hallways were clean and had fresh paint and carpeting. Would recommend this place to anyone as I've never had such friendly service anywhere and I've stayed in some very nice/expensive hotels for work. Oh, during the remodelling you can use the service elevator (which is faster and more continent) if that matters to you. My wife called the spa and got right in whenever she wanted and had great service and thoroughly loved it. The ONLY negative would be the parking was quite tight if you self parked so the valet parking may be the way to go if you get a larger rental car. Overall we were completely satisfied and then some. They even gave us a bottle of cold bottled water just as we got into our car to leave.

Our room was on the 7th floor, facing the parking lot. This didn't bother us much as I enjoy being able to watch the sunrises from our room, and we spend most of the day and sunset outside. I slept well in this suite, however my husband complained of noise caused by some kind of generator outside. The initial welcome at the Fairmont is a definite WOW! We were greated by the valet parking attendants (complimentary on the first day), welcomed with leis, and tropical beverages, and we promply escorted to the check-in desk. The bell-boy took us to our room, and gave us a tour and introduction to the resort on the way and also gave us a tour of the features of the suite we were in. The suite itself was lovely, and huge. We really enjoyed our stay until day 3 when I awoke to find a small cockroach on the counter of the kitchenette area!! We had to leave early that morning for an excursion, and when we returned to the hotel, there was a second larger roach in the sink of the kitchenette! I prompty called front desk to report the situation and was transferred immediately to a manager who apologized, had housekeeping come up immediately to attend to the situation by removing everything from the kitchen counter and spraying. The manager also offered to switch our room, but we opted to stay in the suite because we did not want to go throught the hassle of moving half-way through our stay. The next morning we killed 2 more roaches before leaving again for another excursion. The next day the hotel had our room treated professionally. The manager also compensated us with $100 credit to the hotel when I asked for compensation. They also agreed to a 7pm check-out time for our last day. We did see another roach on our last day in the sink when we were leaving. I noticed that housekeeping kept putting the plug into the sink so I wonder if they are coming out of the plumbing system somehow? Overall, depsite the pest control issues we had a really nice time. I think that hotel management handled the situation adequately considering the circumstances, however I do suspect that they knew that there was an issue with this sute beforehand. We did enjoy using the various ammenities at the hotel, however found it to be very pricey. For example, lunch for 2 with an appetizer and cocktails was around $100. Manicure and pedicure came to $115, and room service dinner for 2 without beverages came to $100. The highlight for us in terms of food was Ko and the breakfast buffet. We loved the beach and the adult pool area. I took a yoga class when I was there and found it to be too gentle for the style of yoga that I am used to which is much more vigorous. We visited during construction, however this did not really bother us at all. If if were not for the pest control issue I woul have rated this hotel a 5, however in general I think my spouse and I prefer an atmosphere that is slightly more casual (such as the hotels on the Ka'anapali strip).", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cTruly a beautiful resort!\u201d", "Author": "hms16", "ReviewID": "UR121674416", "Content": "Loved this hotel!

We usually stay in the Lahaina/Kapalua area when we visit Maui but an opportunity to stay in Wailea for the first time.

It was the best trip we have ever experienced. All the rooms are suites and this is a great amenity. The bathroom was large, separate sinks, Roman shower, and best of all, a separate toilet room. Nicely appointed with large screen TV's in all rooms and all the electronic adapter equipment for any equipment we brought with us. The staff was very attentive and timely. The concierge was very helpful and was able to make all my golf tee times as requested and even at a discount from regular pricing. While valet parking was offered (and given free the first night!) we opted for the self parking since we were going to be in and out quite often and it was so convenient. The hotel is perfectly located with its own beach and is wonderfully landscaped. The restaurants in the hotel are very nice and offer a large selection. However, you can easily drive to numerous nearby restaurants and the Shops at Wailea are within walking distance. While nothing is perfect, this hotel is a keeper. The only less than appealing issues for us were A) The food and beverage prices in the hotel were a little high for us, B) There were more children than we expected (early November???), and, C) The parking spaces in self parking are way to small for any comfortable parking.

First off, it is not strictly for honeymooners or couples, there are families here. We were not bothered by that, even after coming off a week in a small (and awesome) resort in Poipu, Kauai. Overall, we had a great time here. Room - By far the nicest room I have ever stayed in. We were on the top floor, facing the ocean, and had a huge balcony. We walked into a foyer, with a full living room/office, a massive bathroom and bedroom, and one of the best views in the place. As a regular business traveler, I have been through the good, the bad, and the great. This room was GREAT - we barely ever wanted to leave the room. We sprung for the full ocean view suite (we got a discount because of the construction which was barely noticeable and did not bother us at all) - the upgrade was worth it. The bed was comfy and the room was quiet. Staff - Everyone, from the valets, to the front desk folks, the bartenders, the pool boys/girls, the concierge, the cleaning staff, and the servers at breakfast was great. We did have one questionable server late one night at dinner, but we can shake that off. Everyone else was nothing but nice and helpful. Activities - They have their own beach, which while it can be crowded, was never so full that we didn't have our own chairs/umbrella and plenty of privacy (even if people were around). There are 3 pools, and even with families around, we didn't feel crowded. Plus, there is a slide from pool to pool. My wife and I are 27, but even we both enjoyed it. Food - The buffet breakfast was a normal breakfast, but it had great selection and good service. Not the best in the world, but a great selection of food, coffee, and juices to start each day. Amenities - We also got a massage at the Spa while we were there, and I can highly recommend that. The price was fair, and the service was great. Location - Wailea was perfect. It did not feel very crowded, had shopping and tons of great restaurants, and made anyone on the island accessible within 30-45 minutes (with the exception of Hana which you NEED to drive to one day). Side note - if the weather is nice, and you decide to drive the road to Hana, please please please... regardless of what you \"hear\"... drive the entire way around the island. We had a Mazda 3 and made it with NO issue. I would also suggest highly the \"Revealed\" series of books... they gave us the info that we should drive the entire way (and go to Haleakala for sunrise) and it was amazing). I could not imagine only driving half (to the 7 Sacred Pools) and turning around. The only thing that should prevent you from going the entire way is rain. Overall, we had no complaints about this hotel and would recommend it to friends, family, and others. The service and staff were great, and the room (its amenities and view) was the best we have EVER stayed in. The price, especially given the construction discount, was fair, and worth it. While I understand this isn't a small place (its a full resort), and its not super quiet (there are families and a decent number of people) - even after a stay at a 40 room resort in Kauai with peace and quiet - this resort was still great.

Cons: The beach is average at best. Also, we have stayed at many luxury resorts before, and have never had an issue with getting water toys (snorkel gear, kayaks, boogie boards, etc.). Other resorts will let you keep these for your entire trip, and is included in your resort fee. Not the Fairmont. Here you have to check it out each morning, and have it returned by 4 to avoid a 20 dollar charge. In addition, they do not have a lot of anything. We were told most days they were all out. Other days, we were told they would not rent them out because of conditions. All this even when we told them we were going off property to another beach. Food and Drink here are WAY overpriced. I have no issue paying $15 for a drink, $20 for a sandwich, or $4 for a coffee if they are at least decent. Everything here was what you might expect from a 3 star hotel. Also, the Happy Hour only includes well drinks, so don't get your hopes up.

We got a good rate at $199, due to the wedding and the renovation specials. Unlike many hotels on Maui, there is no additional resort fee. Self-parking is included. We had a suite (I believe all rooms are suites) on the far end, main floor of the hotel (room M79). We were four friends sharing a room (one couple and two singles), so the suite set up worked nicely for us. The couple had the bedroom and the two single gals shared the sofa bed. Our room was on a corner and appeared to be larger than other rooms at this rate. - Entrance area was huge and included a wet bar with a small fridge, sink, microwave, coffee maker, kettle, cupboards and a closet. - Bathroom was enormous. Two sinks, tub, shower & separate toilet. The shower, while open to the bathroom, was around the corner a bit, so it was very private and worked well (along with the separate toilet) for the four of us sharing the space. - Bedroom was a good size with lots of closest space, a door to the bathroom and patio doors to the lanai. - Living room was also very large, with a pull-out sofa bed, desk, entertainment centre & patio door to the lanai. The entertainment centre came with cables to hook up iPods, etc. The sofa bed, while convenient, was not overly comfortable. Not the worse sofa bed I've slept on, but it certainly wasn't the luxury of the king in the bedroom. - Lanai was a good size with a table & four chairs, plus a lounger. We had a glimpse of the ocean and had greenery directly in front of us. To one side, however, was the service entrance to the hotel. It wasn't a big deal, but it did spoil the ambiance a bit on the lanai to turn around to see cars & tarmac. The renovations at the hotel were a minimal inconvenience. One restaurant was closed, but we did not notice excessive wait times at the other restaurants. There was construction near the adult pool and brunch area, so it it not as relaxing as it could be - sounds of power saws as you are lounging by the pool. But after a while, it fades into the background. The hotel has a number of specials on to compensate for the inconvenience. There is an evening happy hour (4-6) with half price appetizers and select drinks.I also believe the brunch may be discounted at $25 (?) per person (all you can eat buffet). The brunch was good value - lots of selection, fresh food, and plenty of it. We went to another resort for brunch one day, and it was nowhere near as good. The pools are lovely with good service. I had a couple of meals by the pool (mainly meal-sized salads) and they were great. The adult pool has some nice little extras that I didn't experience at the upper pool. Servers brought around trays of fruit, etc. We didn't spend a lot of time on the beach, but it is a short walk from the hotel. Smaller beach, but nice. The snorkeling gear was free of charge (may have been a renovation deal), so we checked out the snorkeling just off the beach (to the right). We saw a huge turtle and lots of fish. Pretty decent, considering it was free and convenient. I wasn't involved in the wedding planning, but it seemed to go well. The wedding was held in a courtyard with a lovely fountain. It worked well for the size of our group. We had a nice dinner afterwards at Nick's Fishmarket. We were very pleased to have the use of a room after checkout. Checkout time was noon, I believe, but our flight didn't leave until 9pm. We stayed by the pool for the day and then were able to use a room for an hour or so to shower & change before our flight.

It was on the north side of the hotel, while the renovation/construction was occurring on the south side, so we heard no noise whatsoever. They gave us a choice of 2nd floor towards the pool, or a 5th floor partial ocean view which could be ready in 20 minutes, and we took the latter. My family really enjoyed this hotel. 2 LG TVs. Mini frig, microwave. At $234 per nite, it was a steal for Wailea. 840 sq feet, 2 TVs, and large bathroom with walk-in shower (no shower door, just a tile wall, which I prefer!). I loved all the little things, from the his/her bathrobes, towel hamper, to the 2 pedestal sinks with a place to hang a hand towel on each end. And, lots and lots of space to put toiletries. His and hers closets, a full length mirror, and dimmer switches on each bedroom light. My husband loved the 2 TVs, and the one in the living room had a box underneath that was a connector box, so you could hook anything up in a flash to the TV. Perfect for people like us, who like to bring gadgets, like a Mac Mini, on vacation. We also had free internet access via the President's Club (free to join - just join before you get there so you can get your free access). They had a complimentary washer/dryer on our floor (I suspect there's one set on each floor), but it was clear on the other side of the hotel - in the noisy wing, so we didn't use it. Buffet breakfast was free for my husband and I. I paid something like $10 for my child's buffet breakfast. Good hearty breakfast with lots of variety, but for me, I got a bit bored with it after the 2nd day. I guess I'm not much for breakfast. My daughter loved the asian steamed buns - on her last day, she managed to eat 7 of them - one for each year she's lived! Lots of fruit, made to order omeletes, and other standard breakfast items. For asians, they had miso soup and rice as well. We had dinner at Ko's (relocated until their new area is completed) twice - via their fixe prix menu, which was very affordable, given Wailea standards - it was $39/pp, and they had a kids menu also. We also took advantage of Happy Hour at the casual Polo Beach Grille and Bar. 1/2 off on appetizers and some cocktails, like the Mai Tai classic I had, which was delicious! Just a few nits...Sofa pillows were smelly - had them removed - housekeeping told me that was due to the feathers. Hmmm.well, so long as they weren't in the room, I didn't care. Lanai was not very private. Also if you stood or sat near the railing and looked down from the lanai, you could see a white elephant - not so pleasant to see in your view. The sliding glass doors to the lanai are very outdated, along with the rug in the hallway. Not sure why they didn't bother with renovating these items. Lastly, during renovation, one of the elevators were being renovated. The other one is very slow. The Kea Lani offered the use of their service elevator, and that was a lot quicker to use many times. The door to the room is very heavy - so be careful if you have a young child. Polo beach, which is primarily used by Fairmont Kea Lani clients, was simply gorgeous. Nice, soft sand, and has a good shallow section before it gets deep - much nicer than Ka'anapali. There was some wind in the late afternoon at this time of year, and that made it a bit cooler than what I would have expected. The Kea Lani was offering free umbrellas, lounge chairs, boogie boards and snorkel gear during the renovation too! The swimming pools were great and one has a slide. There is a pool bar as well. My daughter loved the slide and she and my husband spent time at the pool, while I opted to lounge on a chair on the grass, overlooking the ocean, and that was perfect for me. All in all, we received excellent value. Ordinarily we wouldn't be able to afford this place, but thanks to all the specials, it was within our budget. I understand this place used to be private residences that were later sold to Fairmont, and hence the suite layout. I'm so glad we decided to stay here, as it offered much more space than Grand Wailea or the Four Seasons, which are both just up the street.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Everett, WA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Thanksgiving at the Kea Lani\u201d", "Author": "happysaclvc", "ReviewID": "UR121106619", "Content": "We just returned from our second trip to Maui and the Kea Lani.

The facilities at the Grand Wailea were nicer, but we definitely felt nickeled and dimed there! We had to pay for all of the \"extras\", and the food there was crazy expensive ($2.50 for a boiled egg at Cafe Kula!). Of all the hotels in the Wailea area, the Four Seasons resort is by far the nicest. We wandered over there for many of our meals, and we found the staff to be extremely friendly and attentive.

The hotel is beautiful with lovely gardens, pools, grass areas and a semi-private beach. It was especially nice because we had a room with a fabulous view of the ocean and could hear the waves at night. The only downside was that meant our room was also near the pools and it was a bit noisy at times - especially on the weekends. There were a lot of families with small children so it was noisier than I remember on our last visit. I believe this is partially due to the incredible rates that were offered due to the renovation on the restaurant Ko. The construction wasn't too bad but we were grateful not to be at that end of the hotel. The elevators were the only real problem since one of them was out the entire time but the hotel was great about letting the guests use the service elevator. The best part of the hotel is that all of the rooms are suites and you have a flat screen TV in the living room and the bedroom. The bathrooms are large and well appointed. The rooms have new furniture and have small refrigerators which makes having breakfast in the room easy. We would also have a cocktail on the balcony watching the sunset which is so wonderful. It is hard not to enjoy yourself in such a beautiful location with wonderful weather. We had room service a few nights which was great - good food and service. The food in Ciao Cafe and the pool restaurant/bar were great and the service was always friendly. We had dinner at Longhi's and Tommy Bahama's at the Wailea Shopping Center and enjoyed both.

Our family of 5 (kids age 8, 6, and 15 months) enjoyed our time there as usual. The suites are perfect for families! They provided a crib for the baby in the room and our 2 older children slept on the pull out sofa. If you have a baby, make sure you ask for a pack and play at the pool. They will set it up next to your chairs at no cost. Our older children love the slide at the pool. We have been to the Grand Wailea and no doubt they have better slides but it is a lot more hectic there. We prefer the laid back vibe at the Fairmont. You can sit at the bottom of the slide and watch your children come down in the same spot all day. The beach is great and the resort offered complimentary boogie boards because there is contruction going on. The construction did not bother us because our room was on the opposite end of the hotel. If you want to go to the \"adults only\" pool it might bother you though because the construction is right next to it (and is kind of loud). As far as food goes, we love the breakfast buffet (and so do our kids). We have eaten at Ko and did not think it was that great. Nick's Fishmarket is pretty good but not great for kids. We think this hotel needs another option. Cafe Ciao has sandwiches and pizza to go but there should be a good family restaurant too. We LOVE the new MonkeyPod Kitchen that opened down the street and wish the Fairmont had something like this. We also find ourselves heading to the Cheeseburger place at the Wailea shops a lot.

When we pulled in the bell boys are there and waiting to escort. Told them we were checking in and they ran to get us leis. Helped take our bags out of the car and we were able to go check in very easily. Front desk told us we had been upgraded to a partial ocean view room. I did the simple process of joining the Fairmont President's Club, so we got free wi-fi and free morning paper every day. The bell boy (Royce) gave us a quick tour of the hotel, which was extremely helpful. He showed us the main things, but didn't bore us with the minor details which we would have forgotten anyways. He took us to our room. When we entered the room, the hotel had set up decorative fresh flowers scattered on the floor, champagne on ice, and chocolate covered strawberries on a dish for us as they knew it was our honeymoon (I told them when I confirmed the room 2 months earlier). The room was only on the 2nd floor, so the view was limited. The room is very large, with an enormous bathroom, 2 sinks, 2 huge mirrors, and huge tub. The toilet is in it's own enclosed room off of the bathroom itself. Balcony is very large with a table, 4 chairs, and a lawn chair. The bedroom and living room are separate. There's a fridge, coffee maker, and small sink to make up a small kitchen. The fridge didn't have a freezer, just an area to keep items cooler, or frozen longer. The microwave was nice too. The bed was very comfortable and there's plenty of pillows. Also plenty of drawers and closet space for an extended stay. If you open one of the sliding doors to the lanai, the air conditioner automatically shuts off, and vice versa. I had the thermostat set to 65, but really doubt the actual temperature in the room ever got below 70 until maybe after 8pm. It wasn't a problem though. We didn't notice workers doing any construction, but the site was clearly noticeable to one of the sides of the hotel but only as you looked out from a balcony above it. If you were on the ground you wouldn't have known there was any construction. Never heard any machinery or anything. The Concierge is extremely helpful. They helped book several things for us. You charge the activity to your room (if you want) and they give you the ticket for the event. We did a luau at the Marriott. I guess there was a threat of rain in the area so they moved it indoors so it wasn't all that good. Nevertheless, our concierge took care of all the arrangements and answered any questions about doing activities. Also did the outrigger canoe ride that goes out from Polo Beach right at the hotel mornings at 6, 7, 8, and 9. My wife and I weren't sure what to expect, but it was fun. For only 45 a minute ride, and for free...it's well worth it. The housekeeping was fabulous. They came to the room several times a day. The morning one is maybe 10am-12pm where they make the bed, refresh toiletries, all the basics. Then they come again at maybe 3pm to check on towels, coffee, etc. Then again will come from 6-8pm for their turndown service. Here they prepare your bed for night, leave the radio on some soft music, and leave a card with the forecasted weather for the next day. Weather is always the same though, 85 and partly cloudy. As you know for any hotel, you need to have your \"Privacy please\" card on your door if you don't want to be interrupted because they come to restock and clean everything several times daily. So if you're in your room, put the card on your door handle. You'll never go without towels or supplies, they are on the ball. The pools are great. Because of the time of year, it was never full of people and we were able to get lawn chairs whenever we needed. The pools are open 24 hours so use at your own will! We did just that. We went out a couple mornings before sunrise (still on east coast time) in the pools and hot tubs. There's 2 main pools, an adult only pool, 2 hot tubs, and a kiddie pool. I knew there were 2 hot tubs, but my wife didn't. I didn't know where the 2nd one is, but she found it towards the end of our stay. It's somewhat hidden between the 2 main pools. The hot tubs are huge and very nice. The water slide is also nice. Not too quick of a ride and not too short. Good for people of all ages. The water is nice and warm in all pools. We were in the pools for a few sunsets and that's a treat. At sunset, someone blows into the conch and they go around and light the torches. It's pretty cool. There's plenty of towels set out and 2 stations to rent all of the equipment you may need for a while outside or at the beach. The beach itself was OK. Sand is really clean and soft. The water is really clean, no animals, seaweed, or rocks. The surf is weak so it's easy to swim around. We didn't snorkel, but sounds like there's some good stuff to see not far from where most people swim. Excellent view of the sunset also! We went and got the breakfast buffet 3 or 4 times during our stay. It costs $25 plus tax per person but I'd say it's worth it. There's tons of hot food, breads, pastries, and fruits. Also there's cereals, and an omellette station. Only complaint would be that the food got cold very quickly once you went to your table. By the time I finished eating my eggs, my bacon was cold. They brought you the fresh juice of the day (free), usually a cranberry-orange or alike sort of juice. We ordered room service on our last night and it was excellent. We ordered it right at prime time for dinner (6:30 pm) and the restaurant promised it to our room by 7:15, which is what we expected for ordering at that time. They had it there at 7:00 and the server did an excellent job setting it up on our coffee table in the room. He put a table cloth down, set up all the silverware, glasses, plates, dishes, etc. Sure it was expensive, but they also added a service fee and a delivery fee. It's explained on the menu in the room. The location of the property is excellent. It's away from all of the business of the town of Kihei (5 minutes away) with all the restaurants and shopping. You can definitely tell you are in a nicer area when you enter Wailea. The grounds of the hotel are kept extremely clean. Also you are about a half hour from the airport, but near the airport in Kahului are many other shops and restaurants. We went up that way nearly every day to do this or that. Overall, this was a place of beauty. We got a discounted rate because of the construction, but I would definitely have paid full price.

We had a nice ocean view over the tree tops from our room. Can't beat the huge rooms and huge balcony. Loved the bathroom, and took advantage of the soaker tub. Our room was always well stocked with all amenities (including extra coffee). The staff at this hotel are extremely friendly. The guys at the bar at Nick's were super friendly and chatty. The guys at the beach that helped with the umbrellas and snorkle gear were also very nice. We were also pleasantly surprised at the price of the drinks by the pool (thought the prices would be steeper). The food was good, but not outstanding (we ate at the Polo lounge and Nick's), with the exception of the buffet breakfast. The hotel was pretty quiet until the weekend (when there were a couple of conferences and a wedding booked). Even over the weekend, nothing ever seemed too crowded, and we were still able to relax in peace. No complaints whatsoever for the rate that we'd booked at (we were able to get the renovation rate of about 300/night for our whole stay). This is definitely a 5* property and this was definitely a 5* experience. If you are paying full rack rate, however, some things to note: Before we booked we were aware the restaurant was being renovated, and figured it would not be noticeable. It was very noticeable, and there are also renovations going on with the elevators (which we were not aware of until we checked in). The noise was not an issue for us but it could have been if we were in a different room - ie there are rooms that look over directly into the renovated area. We were somewhat disappointed with the room service food. It could have just been because we had very high expectations. ie- we were probably expecting the best chicken wings, pizza and soup ever because our bill was 85.00 - 12.00 of this which was a service fee?? The housekeeping was good, but not perfect. After a day at the beach I'd got sand all over the shower, and the next evening I noticed that a lot of it was still in the shower. The drink service by the pool was very slow until the end of the day. Not a big deal for us, but may be for others. We took a walk to the other hotels in the area (Four Seasons and Grand Wailea). I'm extremely loyal to the Fairmont brand, so I never considered booking any other hotel. I've had bad experiences in the past at Four Seasons (Prague and Budapest), but the grounds at the Four Seasons Wailea were very impressive. We sat at the bar there and had a salad and glass of wine (both excellent) - the staff were lovely. I could see potentially trying that hotel on a return trip. The Grand Wailea looked more theme park-ish and probably would be more suitable for a trip with younger children/teenagers. I will return to the Fairmont once again to see the completed renovations. Would like try one of the villas, as those look particularly peaceful and private, and definitely have the best views.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful modern hotel\u201d", "Author": "bruingirl", "ReviewID": "UR120182145", "Content": "I stayed at the Kea Lani for 10 days during the summer.I got a great deal through AAA, so decided to bite the bullet and take an adventure.

Two caveats for this whole review - we didn't pay anything close to the rack rate; we got a deeply discounted room. So, some of the things we wrote off because we got such a deal might have bothered us if we had paid $550 a night. Also, we booked in October because it's the shoulder season, which means way fewer people and almost no school-age children. That being said... We got in to the Fairmont at about 10PM; it is about 45 minutes from the main airport in North Maui. The part of the island it's in, Wailea-Makena, is home to all of the nicest resorts (Four Seasons, Grand Wailea) and golf courses. We got there, our car was valeted (everywhere on the island has free valet for the first day in the low season), we were given beautiful leis, and a bellhop gave us a brief tour before showing us to our room. Our partial oceanview suite was at least twice the size of our Manhattan apartment. Some reviewers on here claim the rooms were outdated, but I can't imagine how. Flatscreen TVs in the living room and bedroom, ipod dock in the bedroom, huge marble bathroom with couples sinks/vanities, and of course, the lanais. Everywhere on the island talks up their lanais (read:balconies), but our suite had a big, wraparound deal with separate entrances from the living area and the bedroom area. The beach at the resort is quite nice - soft, white sand, and not too many tourists, because Wailea is upscale and more expensive. Some locals did show up (all beaches in Hawaii are \"public\" but Polo Beach is hard to get to and there's nowhere to park if you're not at the resort), but they were completely respectful. Our daily routine was to wake up at 830, walk down to the beach and reserve chairs and an umbrella, walk back up to the store/cafe on the ground floor and buy breakfast and juice to bring back to the beach, eat at the beach, and then rotate between ocean/beach chair/pools for the day. When we were there, the beach chairs, umbrellas, and water equipment (boogie boards and snorkel gear) were all free. Don't know if I'd have paid for it all a la carte, but it was great to have. We did snorkel on the rocks near the beach at about 6am and managed to see two giant turtles just being turtles. The pools were nice, too. Again, low season = tons of open chairs and umbrellas, so we never had to worry about the sun. There were young children, but they were always with their parents and never bothersome. We didn't actually spend more than a few minutes at the adults-only pool because the main pool was so large and calm. Above the main pool is another, smaller pool with a swim- or walk-up bar, and there's a waterslide which I'm happy to say is quite fun. There are also a few hammocks strewn across the property, which are perfect for lying in with your partner and just watching the ocean roll in and out. Sunset is beautiful from any part of the property; we watched it both from the beach on blankets and from the bar/lounges up near the entrance of the hotel. The main building is built in to a gently sloping hill, and the pools and rental houses on the downslope. That means you've pretty much always got ocean views from the pool/bars. We didn't spend many meals at the resort as we elected to drive around - you need a rental car in Maui if you're staying in Wailea, or almost anywhere else - but we did have dinner at Ko, and it was wonderful. The famous seafood restaurant on the premises looked very overpriced. There's tons of great food all over Maui that can be had for less than $100 a head. What else? The bed was really comfortable, the hotel filled our room with orchids, champagne, and chocolate covered strawberries at my request and did a great job with it, the entire place was perfect. I recommend this place without hesitation. Minor gripes: The beach chairs were not as nice as the pool chairs. If I was paying for them, that might be annoying. Um, I hurt my foot because I'm not used to flip-flops? Can't really blame that on the resort. Must dos: Book the canoe trip! It was so much fun to go out on an outrigger canoe with some locals, paddle out for a bit, and take a dip in the ocean away from shore and see some more turtles.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, CA", "Title": "\u201cAlmost Paradise\u201d", "Author": "TravelDiva50", "ReviewID": "UR119682727", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Kea Lani while attending my son and daughter-in-law's destination wedding.

As I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve unapologetically stated in past reviews, I am nothing if not a bona fide princess when traveling and felt that viewing and hearing a construction site was unacceptable and not my idea of paradise, even for the amazing deal we were getting. Our very friendly and attentive bellman called the front desk, and for an additional c-note we were upgraded to the most glorious suite I have ever stayed in. It was a wraparound suite on the top floor, affording us an unobstructed 270 degree view of paradise. The bed, climate control, linens, fluffy robes, and ginourmous bathroom were all fantastic. Lovely tasteful decor, beautiful pools and grounds, charming and helpful staff. Our room had a mini fridge, microwave and wet bar so we were able to store food and eat some meals in the room which was nice. The pluses far outweighed any minuses, but to be complete in my review here are some of the less up sides. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spread out and some of the rooms are far down very long hallways. EVERYTHING is pricey. All the food and drinks cost a lot. We were able to partake of many of the specials they were offering during the renovation sale, but I understand that normally one has to pay for chaises and umbrellas. And the rack rates are quite high for what you get in a standard or deluxe room. There are a lot of children and families and the resort can be noisy because of that. There is, however, an adults only pool which is very quiet and serene. However, the only hot tubs are located by the other pools and often occupied by groups of children, so if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not your thing, you might want to stay elsewhere. We stayed in the Kilohana suite which was an amazing room and possibly worth it at any price (easy for us to say since we paid about 30% of the rack rate...).

But make no mistake, the Fairmont is an all star luxury hotel and resort. Stayed a week in September 2011 and loved it! This being my third trip to Hawaii. Our stay started off wonderfully as we arrived 10pm Maui time, 4am our time, exhausted. I usually self park to save the valet fees but was so tired I would've given my life savings for valet parking at that point. Pulled up to the Fairmont and the Valets had our name, told me that check in night was complimentary and took care of the car, the bags and even the front desk. We literally walked straight up to our room. Which we were upgraded from a garden view to an ocean view. The suite was huge if a little dated. But I loved the 2 big flat screen tvs, IPOD station, and DVD player. The beautiful marble baths and our spacious and fully furnished lanai. I really enjoyed the mini fridge and coffee maker also. Sat out every morning on our lanai in my Fairmont robe with a cup of Hawaiian java. Also liked the in room WI-FI. Just make sure you sign up for \"Fairmont's President Club\" before you go and it will be no charge. The staff was warm and friendly. I noticed the grounds keepers working early in the morning would shut off their blowers or whippers as we would walk past and say Aloha. The concierge desk was incredible. I broke my underwater camera 2 days into our trip and went to them to ask a good place to buy one. They not only recommended a good place but called to verify prices and stock and then wrote directions on a map for me. We didn't each much on the resort as I always find it pricey and this time was no exception. We did do the buffet breakfast on our first and last day there. It was good and plenty of variety....and their french toast quite possibly the best I've ever had. The pools were great for my 6 year old daughter. She could touch bottom everywhere and loved the waterslide. Couldn't get her off it. And I saw quite a few grown men screaming down it during the week too. The beach was beautiful. Water clear to the bottom. In the morning the water would be warmer than the air temperature and it was just heaven! Never had a problem getting a place to sit either poolside or on the beach. My daughter went to Kids Camp one morning and although no other kids were registered that day she had a great time with Ms. Bonnie. Built a working volcano on the beach and made a wonderful souvenir box with sand from 3 different beaches and shells on the top to spell my daughters name. I'll review some of these places elsewhere on the site however some great places to eat if you have kids....Monkey Pod Kitchen in Wailea and either of the Cheeseburger in Paradise locations. Although the one in Lahaina on the water has a much better view! We also did the snorkel cruise out of South Maui to Molokini Crater. Express first thing in the morning....only boat there for almost an hour. Incredible. Highly recommended. Best souvenir shops...ABC stores. Best clothing to take home....go to Tropix. They carry Maui Built line of clothing exclusively. They don't do internet or mail orders. It's exclusive to those who actually shop in their stores. Bought men's, women's, and children's shorts, t's and hoodies. Love them all and wish I had brought more home with me. All in all the Fairmont Kea Lani did not dissapoint.

The Fairmont was actually not our first choice when we were setting everything up originally. We had our eye on the Four Seasons (which is right next door, as it turns out) but our travel agent recommended the Fairmont and it turned out saving us right at $1000 to stay there instead which was a no brainer. The Fairmont is ALL suites. You can't get a regular room in this hotel so that's obviously a good sign! The first night we got free valet service which was nice after our 8 hour flight from Dallas (we were wiped out). The lobby has a very open feel and was beautiful. Big fountain right in the middle, an awesome view of the pool area and ocean (and sunsets around 6pm), and lots of local decor. The staff was SUPER friendly and helpful! The consierge could pretty much give you any information you could need about local restaurants, entertainment, etc. The guy who helped us to our room (his name was Wilson, that's how well we liked him, we remember his name haha) was really friendly and knew a lot about the area. He shared some helpful tips about what restaurants were a good value in the area, where to do our shopping, etc. The resort was in Wailea which is the Beverly Hills of Maui. It's definitely nicer than Kihei (though Kihei has great shopping and restaurants, we spent most of our money in Kihei) or Lahaina. My only complaint about the hotel was that they were rennovating and had one of the 2 elevators closed down for maintenance so it was quite a wait somtimes for the elevator. Oh and when we told them we were on our honeymoon they gave us a card good for a free dessert and free bottle of wine at the Ko Restaurant (which was nice) but no other upgrades or any other amenities I'm used to for honeymooners... The rooms were the highlight of the resort for us. Yeah the rest of the resort was nice...but the room was just HUGE! It was SO nice. I can't say enough about how impressed we were with the room. I'd say the room was probably about 800-900 square feet!! The entry area had a sink, coffee maker, large mini-fridge, microwave, etc. Then you go into the living room which had a long couch, ottoman, large TV table with flat screen, DVD player, and surround sound stero (very nice Denon stereo system with sub-woofer). There was a very cool charging station at the entertainment system area where you can charge your ipod, etc. and a selection of cables for this as well. I was able to plug my ipod in and listen to our own music on the Denon stereo system. There was also a desk over in the corner of the room as well. Here there is a large sliding glass door to the balcony (BIG balcony with table and 4 chairs as well as a lounge-style chair) with an awesome ocean view (ocean view suite, cost a little more, but WELL worth it). Then you make a right into the bedroom that has 2 nightstands with 3 drawers in each, a dresser with another flatscreen TV, iPod dock alarm radio, and 2 his/hers closets. King size bed (a little bit on the firm side but still comfortable). The bathroom was huge with double vanities, an enclosed toilet (nice little room so you have good privacy), a jacuzzi tub (large), and a separate shower (full marble, big enough for 2 people easily). Just a super impressive room. The hotel grounds were just awesome! 3 pools to choose from, 2 hot tubs, water slide, swim-up bar, etc. The path down to the beach was lit at night with tiki torches, and during the day there is a station open where you can get towels, sun screen, or complimentary boogie boards you can check out. The resort really had EVERYTHING covered. The first day we were there the waves were pretty intense and they had a nice sign with a flagpole so you would know if it was safe to swim or not. The beach was very nice but the water wasn't quite as nice as Mexico (see my other review of Riu Palace). Probably due to the noticibly more intense surf. The restaurants there at the resort were all nice. We ate at all three. Polo Grille is actually by one of the pools and has a swim-up bar. The food is fairly typical \"bar & grill\" faire but still pretty good. They had happy hour from 4-5pm where the drinks and appetizers were half price (which made them reasonable), otherwise the drinks were $12-$20 and the appetizers $10-$25, so the prices were a bit steep. Nicks Sea Market was a very nice restaurant with a good atmosphere, the service was a bit off the night we visited but I sensed that we were coming at the end of the evening and the service is probably better during the usual dinner crowd, and the food was top notch (albeit $150 price tag). The Ko restaurant serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner and is their \"middle of the road\" offering. Breakfast was awesome there (we had the buffet) with LOTS of options and great quality (but the $50 price tag for 2 was a big steep). Dinner was pretty decent but still around $100 and definitely not worth it. We ended up checking out restaurants off the resort more often than not. Matteo's is right up the street from the resort and had AMAZING pizza. They're a little italian place with a great atmosphere and service. The pricing was much more reasonable than the resort. We also heard Cafe O'Lei in Kihei was really good and reasonable as well but we never made it there. We ate at a place called \"Cool Cats\" in Lahaina twice...it was just a great spot with great burgers so we couldn't resist! It's right in the heart of the shopping district in Lahaina (right across from the harbor). There was SO much to do in Maui! We took an all-day trip to Hana and the far side of the island (7 climate zones during this trip, it was amazing). The Ocean Center in Lahaina was pretty cool as well. We took a katamaran over to Molokini crater and did some snorkeling which was awesome! This was really just the best experience I've had vacationing and we plan to go back within 5 years.

We even used the elevators on the other side of the hotel and found them to be slow too. I believe one of the elevators was broken all week. 2) the water pressure in our shower was very poor. Many luxury hotels offer 'shower spas' or two headed shower fixtures- the shower in our room had very low pressure. I believe it was an 'eco' type shower fixture that uses less water- but it doesn't save any water if you have to spend twice as much time in the shower getting clean. Thanks for a GREAT STAY.

I can put my hand on heart and honestly say our stay with the Fairmont Kea Lani Hotel was truly outstanding. Were from New Zealand so coming to Maui was a big decision and happened to come across a great deal with this Hotel via bookit.com; which made the decision even easier. As you enter the premises I knew we were in for a great holiday, so with much haste I parked the beast and made our way to the front desk. We were promptly greeted by Nick who was a pretty friendly chap, (John Cena look a like IMO) who quickly sorted our room, keys, layout of the hotel and what was happening and who was where - top notch service if I may say so. Before he let us on our way, he advised we've been upgraded to an ocean view room free of charge. Nick my friend, you made it for us right there and then. After our winding our way to the 5th floor, we entered our well- presented room. Entry way with a hidden safe, sink, coffee maker, fridge, microwave etc. Living room, comfy long spacious couch with a massive 50\" LG LCD screen, denon home theatre etc and a walk way out to a very large balcony holding breakfast table with 4 chairs and a sunlounger. Bedroom - omg yes! Massive huge king size bed, it was so very awesome to sleep in. It was one of those beds that grab you when you jump in and say to you - ok night night sleep well. A+ for the bed that's for sure! Turn around and what's sitting opposite the bed, another huge LG LCD screen - a mans throne waiting for his king! Bathroom - the bathroom in this place is to die for, everywhere you look is marble marble marble. Walk in shower is like 3m long (again marble!) very open style, spacious. Large bathtub, his and her sinks, towels, mirrors, faucets, taps - the list goes on. Note: The free safe was a very nice asset - well used and gave us peace of mind with large amounts of U.S cash. As for the hotel itself, it has a lot of character with the Fairmont Touch added, kind of dated but I think it gives off a huge sense of history. 3 swimming pools, loads to explore, 3 restaurants which unfortunately seem very over-priced for the food being served but your paying for convenience. Plenty of times we drove to Kihei for supplies or dined out locally as there is some really great little eating places within Maui The biggest plus for both of us at this Hotel are the staff who work here, they really do make this place and I think a lot of it goes un-rewarded at a corporate level. Many times did I see higher than thou executives demanding this and that without so much as providing a thank you or any gratification for services rendered - possibly the signs of true America we hadn't come across yet being a couple from New Zealand. That being said, this didn't sway us in any way - Fairmont you truly have some amazing people working at the Kea Lani and the service they provid is amazing. The conceirge, front desk, in suite dining, breakfast, house-keeping, Valets, bell-boys etc (I'm sure I've missed someone) all of you smile, do your best to help and come across so genuine - you made our 7 nights so well worth the decision to come to Maui, Hawaii!

We went during their restaurant renovation so rates were dramatically reduced which made the trip excellent value. The renovation work was no bother to us at all. Since we were traveling with our baby, having the oversized bathroom and living room/bedroom suite set up was ideal. The hotel was extremely accommodating to us. We had a crib, pack n play and diaper pail in our room, which were all also cleaned daily. They had no problem sending up extra towels and were very accommodating to clean our room on a few moments notice when our daughter was not napping. The pool staff was also very accommodating- there are pack n plays to use at the pool and they blew up and held onto our pool toys for us. The pools were very nice, and we really enjoyed the baby pool for our baby. I wish the water temperature had been better controlled though- it was really too cold for some days. The grounds are fantastic with a lot of nice lawn areas to play in. There is also a paved path along the beach which goes through all of the Wailea resorts- great for running or walking. The beach is beautiful with great snorkeling right there heading towards the Four Seasons. Renting snorkel gear and beach chairs/umbrella was easy. All of the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I also loved that there was complimentary washer/dryer. Especially when traveling with kids, this was fantastic (as much as I hated having to do laundry on vacation). Breakfast buffet was excellent- tons of variety, lots of fresh food, really great. We tried all of the restaurants and the food and service were both great. I had a few small complaints. First, the poolside cabanas are ridiculous. For $75/day, there should be more than just a shade cover. Either the cabanas should really be something wonderful to really entice someone to rent them (with TV, fans, frig/food, more space/shade/privacy), or they shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be rented for a fee at all. The cost of food is obscene, but we found this to be the case everywhere in Maui. We could not even have lunch for under $40. There were also some small things about the room- the cottage cheese ceiling, the furniture, that did not appear to have just been renovated. Several things in our room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work- the TV, the safe, the drain on the tub, the frig- all of these were addressed and fixed, but I was surprised and annoyed that so many little things were not working properly.

There were artists visiting the hotel every day to show off and sell their work, and there were several shops in the corridors to pass the time in. The little market/cafe was nice to have as well.

Rooms are huge, and actually more like mini studios with seperate living room.Rooms are among the biggest in the state. - price : the Fairmont is less luxurious as compared to its neighboors the Grand Wailea and the Four Seasons, but it's prices are much more affordable. - weather : this part of Maui is the most sunny part of the island, so do not look elsewhere if sun is what you're after Some contras : - the beach is excellent, but it is not a white powdery beach as is advertised in some brochures. It is a golden coloured beach. - the resort is very big (as most resorts in Wailea) : this is very good for families, but may be not the best setting for couples - Wailea is very expensive. Food will cost a lot and there are not alternatives (unless you have a rental car and to Kihei in the north, a drive of about 10 minutes) - the resort is very nice and luxurious but does not feel very intimate and even feels a little bit outdated - although it is the sunniest part of the island, it is also the least scenic area of Maui TIPS : - become a member of the Fairmont Club before arrival in the hotel : online registration is free and will give you free internet access during your stay - the drive to the top of the Haleakala crater (90 minutes drive from wailea) is a MUST : unbeatable scenery. And choose sunset instead of sunrise. As such you will not have to get up in the middle of the night, and have the added bonus of watching stars after sunset. Arrive 90 minutes before sunset, so you can still see the scenery in the light (otherwise the crater will be in the shadow of the setting sun). And after sunset, stay another hour to watch one of the most spectular skies filled with stars.

Service is always above and beyond at this hotel. We always feel like we are among family when we visit the Kea Lani. The villas have been remodeled this year and are lovely. They offer plenty of space so it is easy to travel with several family members including children and grandparents or two couples and kids. In the two bedroom villa there are two master suites - one upstairs and one downstairs. In the three bedroom villa you have an additional bedroom with two queen beds. They keep your refrigerator stocked with bottled water and Hawaiian fruit juice and both regular and decaf coffee for the coffee maker. Upon arrival there is milk, a loaf of french bread, fruit, Half & Half, pancake mix, coconut syrup and other items already stocked in your kitchen. The villas have twice a day maid service which includes cleaning up the kitchen after meals or the grill located on your patio. Each villa has their own washer and dryer and detergent is provided. Each villa also comes with its own plunge pool, a table with four chairs and two chaise lounges on the patio which makes for a nice way to relax and enjoy a glass of wine at sunset. The grounds are beautiful. One thing we like about the Kea Lani over places like the Grand Wailea is that the grounds are not as large so you do not have to walk what seems like forever to get from the hotel lobby to the beach.

When we arrived, we had friendly staff and the entrance to the hotel is definetly exciting. We were so excited to get to our room and see the surroundings. 1. The rooms- the rooms are simpley great. Two room suite with a couch, tv, desk, wet bar, and the couch is also a pull out bed. The bedroom is gorgeous with either a king or two double beds, tv, alarm clock, two big closets etc. The bathroom was great. The walk in shower is great and the bathtub is superb. Two sinks, mirrors, seperate room with toilet, and towels plus two bathrobes 2. Restaurants- kea lani restaurant has excellent buffet with pancakes bacon sausage hash browns etc. Omelette station and fruit bar are both great. Caffe ciao was the place we ate the first night and wow did it make a good impression. Only tried ko simply because nicks fishmarket is overpriced and im not a fish guy. Ko was excellent. I prefer the sunset dinner special. The pool bar and grill was great. Takes a little while for servers to get to you but is worth the wait. The swim up bar is also great. 3. Pool and Beach Pool- pool was my favorite spot. Ipper and lower lagoon, 140 foot waterslide, swim up bar, two hot tubs and baaketball net. The pool is great for small familys. The beach is much more calm then pool. Bodyboard rentals are a bit pricey but r worth it. The rest of the beach is just a regular beach. 4. Our experience will never be forgotten.

We were really impressed with the rooms - offering lots of space to stretch out in as well as palatial washrooms with double sinks and separate walk in shower. The pools and beach were perfect - the beach is small, but never crowded. We always found loungers at the pools and the pool staff were really helpful in setting us up. There were plenty of chairs at the beach (complimentary, though umbrellas are at a cost of $10/hour or $45/day). What made this the perfect resort for us was the programs for kids. Our daughter was too young to take part in the Keiki Lani program, but there were daily complimentary activities that she was able to participate in such as hula dancing, jewelry making, face painting and lei making. The \"Kids Under Five Eat Free\" program was also a nice touch, though the restaurants are quite expensive. This program is not available for room or poolside service though. The pools are perfect and are set far away enough from the adult pool so that the adults could enjoy pool time in peace! We bought some groceries from the Safeway in Kihei and ate breakfasts on the Lanai almost everyday. Ko Restaurant was also very good and they offered a prix fixe menu before 6:30 at a great price of $39. The resort offers a complimentary shuttle that takes you around Wailea - they brought us to the neighbouring hotels for dinner (Mala at the Mariott and Ferraros at the Four Seasons - both excellent with great sunset views) as well as to the shopping centre down the street. The gym is a sufficient size with a number of cardio machines (it was never busy when I was there) and is open 24 hours a day. The resort also offers complimentary fitness classes (aquafit, yoga and pilates). We did sunset yoga a couple of times and I found it to be a great class, especially with the Maui sunset and splashing waves as a backdrop. My travel partners also took part in the Outrigger canoeing experience and my husband really enjoyed it - wear swimwear if you go as you have the opportunity to snorkel while out at sea. If you are a President's Club member, your wifi access is free. They also offer President's Club members complimentary bike rentals! The only constructive criticism to offer would be to decorate the stark white hallways (though a reno is soon to be underway). The elevators were often slow as well as full, and the stairs are difficult to find (even some of the staff had difficulty explaining where they were).

We had a lot of special occasion going on - 60th birthday, 30th wedding anniversary, 2nd wedding anniversary, 1 son getting out of the military, 1 son in the military going overseas for 2 years. Our travel agent was very well aware of these situations and she made sure the Fairmont was aware of these situations. For all of these special occasions I expected more of the Fairmont than just 2 \"free\" desserts for the wedding anniversaries. Let alone they got the names mixed up. It's the details that count and for the amount of money I don't expect screw ups. They screwed up one of our rooms - wrong beds. As I was about to call my travel agent, they gave us a different room which was better than the original - a much bigger suite. However, it was somebody else's room that hadn't checked in yet. The room had a welcome card addressed to somebody that wasn't me, along with a plate of fruits, cheese, and crackers. It also had a roll away bed in it. When I mentioned this to the bellboy, he discreetly called down to the front desk and removed the card and bed. But we were \"allowed\" to have the food. But the real clincher for me was the centipede scurrying across the living room floor! It took several stompings to kill it and not by any hotel staff. We had 6 people staying in 2 rooms, and originally were only given 4 \"free\" breakfast buffets. After the centipede incident, 2 more \"free\" breakfast buffets were given. Watch out for the extra tips put on your \"free\" breakfast buffets tickets that you sign. Even though tips are INCLUDED in the price, and you sign the ticket WITHOUT adding a tip, magically tips appear on your final bill when you check out. Scrutinize your final bill BEFORE paying it! The Fairmont does nickel and dime you to death. Nothing is free beach wise except for the chairs. You have to \"rent\" everything including umbrellas, snorkel gear etc. For the price they already charge for the rooms, you shouldn't have to rent an umbrella for the beach. The front staff is not very forth coming on information about what the Fairmont does and does not provide. I found out on my own about a beautiful walking trail down by the beach, ocean and other resorts. We found out from a bartender that the Fairmont provides transportation to and from shops and restaurants outside of the property. This would have been nice to know BEFORE we got our rental vehicle out of valet parking. Even if you make reservations ahead of time and let the transportation department know when you will need a ride, they don't keep your schedule. It's more like first come, first served. When we did use our rental vehicle, it was nice that you could ask the valets for water to take along, and they provided it free of charge. But yet you had to ask, they didn't offer. The front staff is not consistent on their information that you ask for either. We needed to use the business office to check in on our flights back home. One person said we had to pay for it, another person said no we didn't have to. My husband and I each had a spa treatment. I'm not an expert on spas, but I was not impressed, especially by the facilities. The facilities were not especially discreet, you had to walk out into the reception area from the dressing room to another room to wait, then back into the reception area down a long hallway to the treatment rooms. My treatment table was broken at the headrest. I tried to raise it just a little and it completely fell off. This spa was not designed nor was the staff trained to accommodate plus size people. The treatments themselves were ok but definitely not worth the price. My person must have been fairly new because she was very nervous and didn't handle the covers very discreetly. For spa treatments, go somewhere else. All in all, the Fairmont Kea Lani was OK. Location wise, you can't go wrong, it's a beautiful area. The rooms were nice and adequate (especially after the centipede was removed), the bathrooms fine.

Why are there coverings on the windows? It makes it super dark and I don't get the reason. It's not like something wrong is going on in there so why hide it?

This trip we stayed in an ocean view 2 bedroom Villa. The Villa was fabulous. There were 6 of us, three sharing the upstairs bedroom, two in the downstairs bedroom and one on the pull out sofa in the living room. The bedroom downstairs had a king bed , a closet between the bathroom and the bedroom and a bathroom with two sinks, a walk in shower and a bathtub. Upstairs the bedroom layout was similar but with two double beds. At the top of the stairs before entering the bedroom there was a huge walk in closet. There was also a side patio with two chaise lounge chairs off of the upstairs bedroom. Also downstairs was the laundry room, kitchen, dining area and living room which opened to the patio complete with outdoor furniture, gas grill and plunge pool. From the patio you looked out to the ocean. Each bedroom and the living room had an LCD TV, the one in the living room complete with a Blu-Ray surround sound system and any possible connection cord you would need! The beds were incredibly comfortable and the pull out sofa was much more comfortable than what you would normally find. Each day the Villa was restocked with water, juices, milk and coffee. This a top notch property! Every employee we encountered was terrific; from housekeeping who addressed me by name to the pool, the bartenders and the front desk. One night after returning late one person was looking for some Benadryl. The Ciao Deli shop was already closed. After inquiring at the front desk and the gentleman checking the back, he did let me know that Ciao Deli had it and even though it was closed he said not to worry since he had a key to everything! A few moments later security met me at the front desk with a box of Benadryl in their hand with simply a receipt for me to sign. Now that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service! We had no problems getting seating at the pool. We went on the Hawaiian Canoe Experience which is free to guests. I highly recommend doing this. We also took advantage of being Presidents Club members and used the free golf clubs to play the Blue course. We visited the Spa and fully enjoyed our messages. Nick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant on property is top notch. Other restaurants we ate at that were also top notch were Mama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fish House and Capische (we used the Fairmont\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Free Shuttle to get back and forth to Capische).

Still, we'd heard rave recommendations about the property from friends and felt confident it would still be a great hotel. It was a nice hotel, but it lacked that wow factor and true sense of luxury that I expect in a resort like this. If I could, I'd rate my stay 3.5 stars. Overall Aesthetics: It's pretty, but not breathtaking, and is in need of updated decor in some places. I believe they are working on this, though. The entrance and lobby are sort of blah, in my opinion. Service: It was great. The staff are all very friendly, prompt and accomodating. Poolside beverage service is slow (When is that not the case, though?), but that's my only complaint about service. Room: We had an oceanview room, and it was worth it. We ate breakfast on the lanai almost every morning. I loved the space and amenities in the suite-style room. The refrigerator and bar area came in handy. The best part of the suite was the bathroom. It's very spacious, and well-decorated, for the most part, with a huge tub and a ledge in front of the mirror for all those cosmetics we ladies drag along. ;-) Ours was in need of some updating, though. The marble was tired-looking and the bathtub should be a jacuzzi. **Pet peeve: I need a full-length mirror. There were plenty of mirrors in the bathroom and on the backs of the doors, but none of them were full-length. No one wants to stand on the edge of the bathtub, or a chair, or have their legs cut off at the ankles.** Also, there were little details all over the room that needed attention. Vents that needed dusting, door frames that needed repainting, electrical cords that could have been hidden better. That sort of nit-picky thing. The turn-down service in the evenings was great. The attendants come back through and tidy up, turn down the bed and leave the radio on with soft Hawaiian music. A nice touch. Pool and beach: The pool is ok. (I am extremely biased about pools, though, since staying at the Grand Hyatt on Kauai. THAT'S a pool.) The cabanas were a joke, though. If I'm going to pay $150 per day to rent a cabana, I want something with a little style. These looked like those cheap pop-up tents you buy at a discount store. Honestly, the place would have looked better with more umbrellas and fewer \"cabanas\". The hotel beach was cute. Swimmable and a lot of fun for the kids and sunbathers if you don't feel like loading up the car and getting out that day. I had no problem getting a beach chair, but umbrellas need to be reserved if you want one. You can also take the sidewalk and walk to the beach behind the other two hotels. Very convenient. **Tip: If you are driving to another beach, you can rent beach chairs from Caffe Ciao Deli. Also, ask for beach towels at the front desk.** Restaurants: The food and service were both great at Nick's Fishmarket. Ko was good as well, but we didn't enjoy it as much. I recommend getting to either one at sundown, though. Very nice view. I loved the little deli, Caffe Ciao. They have a great selection of sandwiches, coffee, pastries, fresh fruits and cereals. If you're missing your coffee shop from home, you'll like this place. They also sell sundries, wine and gourmet gifts. The breakfast buffet was anti-climactic. So, so average. It lacked in variety and presentation. Spa: Painfully average. The service and both my therapists were great, but other luxury hotels have set the bar way too high for the Kea Lani to compete as far as the facilities and variety of treatments are concerned. Other comments: Valet service and internet service. Please, bump up the price of my room $50 per day and tell me these two services are complimentary. I hate being nickel-and-dimed to death. It sort of spoils the luxury experience. So, overall, we liked the hotel, but would definitely stay at Four Seasons or Grand Wailea on a return trip to Maui before we decided to stay at the Kea Lani again. My honest opinion is that this is a great hotel for a family or for newlyweds who want to stay at a Wailea resort. The suite-style rooms are great for parents with young kids and so is the pool. The price is right for luxury on a budget.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cAwesome room and pool!\u201d", "Author": "christina_c74", "ReviewID": "UR115102664", "Content": "We booked the Fairmont through Amex Travel so this was a package deal with air and car. The Fairmont was a beautiful hotel and breathtaking as soon as you pull up and walk into the open lobby. What drew me to the hotel is that it is an all-suite property. It was me, husband and 5 year old son so we wanted to make sure we had enough room for the week. I originally booked a room with two double beds but they insisted I booked a King. They were accommodating and got the double-room ready pretty quickly. The rooms were spacious and perfect size for the 3 of us. We booked the Fairmont suite which faced a nice grassy area on the southern end (and a wonderful tiny view of the ocean!). I loved that there were double doors dividing the living room and bedroom. The bathroom was HUGE with a lovely soaking tub, separate water closet and double vanity. Very functional! There was a nice partial-kitchen set up with Keurig machine, sink, fridge and microwave. Wi-fi was an extra $14.50/night and even our 3G signals were weak. Self-parking was free but beware, the lot has very narrow aisles and narrow spaces so be careful. I guess they want to make it extra worthwhile to splurge on valet parking. I enjoyed the lanai \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was spacious and had comfortable furniture. I quite enjoyed my morning coffee out there. :) And the grounds were absolutely lovely -- lots of native plants and flowers everywhere. As many other guests have stated, eating at the hotel was expensive (even though our son ate for free). After the 2nd meal there, we realized we would need to eat elsewhere sometimes. We decided that going easy on the breakfast and/or lunch was the way to go so we picked up some light groceries at the Safeway in nearby Kihei. We spent a LOT of time at the pool area. Definitely heed everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advice about snagging an umbrella early in the day (like, 8am) if you require one. The pool was really nice and my son had so much fun swimming all week. The main pool is mostly 3-4 ft so it was very accessible. My husband LOVED the waterslide. The pool staff was super helpful and came around to take drink/food orders which was great. The upper deck pool, where the waterslide entrance was, had a swim-up bar. And, Happy Hour is 4-6! 50% off certain drinks!! :D I agree with everyone that Polo Beach, although close and accessible wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the nicest in Maui. The Fairmont staff was nice all around. I found we got exceptional service in the Polo Bar & Grill and at Ko Restaurant. And the bell service was prompt and helpful. Not sure about the rest of the island as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve only visited Wailea, but we noticed that clouds would roll in and the wind would kick up around 2PM (this happened 5 of the 7 days we were there). So try to get your sunning in the first part of the day. Also, the last two days of our visit we noticed there was an overwhelming fishy smell being blown in from the ocean. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just on our end of the hotel, it was blowing through the lobby and even other parts of Wailea when we were out and about.

Two major complaints: First, instead of providing enough umbrellas for the guests to enjoy shade at the swimming pools, this hotel thinks it is a Vegas princess and decided to cram a bunch of \"cabanas\" (just very large umbrellas and chairs, nothing more) with reserved signs around the pool. If you want one, you must fork over $150 a day. Most of them stayed vacant for the week, whereas the umbrellas were all taken early in the day. Be prepared to bake in the sun. Second, we got very poor service at the Nick's seafood restaurant. We had to ask to speak to the manager because we could not get anyone to come to our table for over 30 minutes. Even the manager took a long time to show up, and he didn't even introduce himself. He gave a weak apology and walked away.

We are Fairmont loyalists due to the fact we usually always receive superb service within a beautiful environment. Kea Lani was no different and in fact exceeded our expectations! To begin; at a very reasonable price we were upgraded from a deluxe ocean view suite to a 2 bedroom ocean-front Villa with private plunge pool, barbeque, full kitchen & 2 full bathrooms & private laundry. Amazing! We were even greeted with a welcome bag of mostly Hawaiian goodies. Considering this was our 1st visit & a \"2nd Honeymoon\" (although our 1st honeymoon was Costa Rica), it fulfilled our dreams! The service, including; housecleaning (exceptional!), turn-down to concierge, room service, valet, restaurants, pool-side, etc. etc. was nothing but top-notch! Yes, it can be \"pricey\" but it is the Fairmont and like they say, \"You get what you pay for\". If one really wants to get \"nit-picky\" our only complaints would be the following: 1) table service @ breakfast (where the buffet is also served) is very slow & the coffee tastes weird. Twice we ate there & both times service was lacking & the coffee was nasty. The servers appeared confused regarding who were buffet guests & who were table service guests. We saw some guests get so frustrated they up & left. We usually stuck to room-service on our private lanai (AMAZING!!!) or made our own or ate elsewhere. 2) I was NOT impressed with my Spa service. We had read in advance some negative feedback about the Spa but we felt we would give them a try due to the fact everything else was so amazing. I booked an 80 min facial & it rated maybe a 3 or 4 out-of 10. I felt the entire time my therapist really didn't connect, talked too much & it seemed she was more concerned about trying to sell me products than provide a relaxing, spa-like experience. She even chose not to give me the facial I requested (although I mentioned it twice). It was far too clinical & sales-pitchy. She even left me over $500 worth of products she recommend I purchase at the desk! I am traveling, what do I want with a load of additional, heavy cosmetics & electrical appliances!!! Ridiculous. I felt I could have washed my face with soap & water, applied my moisturizer to my face & I would have felt better & it wouldn't have cost me a bundle or wasted my precious vacation time. Very disappointing. My husband had an 80 min massage & rated it about a 7 out-of 10. Better than my service. We still have to say...\"The Wickaninnish Inn\" in Tofino, BC is still the spa leader in our book....& we've been to many spas ;) ...3rd & last) Diving lesson: My husband took a diving lesson booked through concierge, in 1 of the pools & he was totally disappointed. He kept telling the instructor that the mouth piece was damaged (bitten by a previous student) & didn't fit correctly but the instructor ignored him repeatedly. Part of the cost was a dive in the ocean following the lesson. My husband wisely declined! Very disappointing for him as this was something he was very excited about experiencing. 4) The carpets in the main hotel rooms/hallways really need updating & the beautiful bathrooms in the Villas need additional LIGHTING. If a woman is trying to put on makeup or a man is trying to shave it's also impossible to see!!! The upstairs bath has natural lighting from 2 windows which helps in the morning at least. Also, there is a real need of additional towel racks/hooks. Also, valet stands in the Villa bedrooms would be helpful as well as a wall mirror situated near the windows in both bedrooms & a small one near the hallway entrance front door. The walk-in closet/safe area needs refurbishing. The kitchen in the Villas should be automatically stocked with champagne glasses (we had to request these from housekeeping) & a pair of kitchen sheers would be very useful. As well, we didn't see recycling containers anywhere in the suites??? We are avid recyclers so we found this a bit disturbing. So that is it!

The Fairmont looks very tired and although they recently refreshed the rooms, the rest of the hotel still needs a remodel.

We had a number of problems - at least one a day - which the front desk managers always gave a little attitude when we brought them to their attention. Also, when you check in, they try hard to get you to pay to upgrade your room, saying they are having a special, etc. They even pull out an iPad, show you the view of the room you booked, and then show you the view of the upgrade. Everything is a fee. It is completely different from the Four Seasons where everything is included such as cabanas, kiddie pool toys, etc. The Fairmont is always looking for a way to charge you for things. Also, eat at the Four Seasons for breakfast instead - their buffet is $5 more, but is fantastic, vs. the Fairmont buffet, which tastes like hospital food. The concierge is hesitant to give you recommendations for off-property restaurants. Each time I asked for a suggestion, they only talk about on-property dining. The kids programming - hula lessons, lei making, ukelele lessons, etc - did not have hotel staff overseeing and instead just had these people show up and they did not seem engaged at all. One person even told us that the concierge manager has changed at least 8 times and they do not run this program well.

The rooms are slightly rundown and smell (but they are large). I realize it's hard to combat humidity, but if every other hotel has it figured out, get with the program. They need to add moldings to the hallways with carpet, there is something just gross about that line of dinge where carpet meets stucco in the hallways. The great thing about this resort is the room layout if you have young kids. We booked a poolside king room on the ground floor so we could go in and out easily after the kids were asleep and during the day. Our rate was just under $700 per night. It will be the last time we stay at this resort. Since we have young kids who are not great swimmers, we LOVE the kiddie pool. We would have done 4 seasons, but their kiddie pool has the little slide which ends in a pool that is just a little too deep for our little ones. We are fine with resort prices for food, etc. but you do end up feeling annoyed about it when you realize how much more you get at the four seasons. The service at the pool is horrid. We booked a cabana in advance for several of the days of our trip and I found myself having to walk up to the pool hut and ASK for stuff all day as we never got service. We ended up canceling the last day of our cabana. NIck's was yummy as usual and they brought out an anniversary desert for us which was very thoughtful. I think it's a great hotel if you have toddlers or babies but if you are on your honeymoon, etc. I think you are better off next door. But come to NIck's for dinner or polo beach to layout :) Oh last note, the fitness center SUCKS. I think they are trying to push the adidas thing in room, but I love being able to work out on vacation and this was just sad. No bottles of water, no towels (they were out), all the cardio machines face a wall. The cardio machines didn't have a cup holder big enough to fit the cocktail glasses of water they had, weird.

The fact that it's an all-suite property is one of the top selling points of this resort. Rooms: The rooms were top notch and I give especially high marks to the bathroom which was very up-to-date and generous in size. The room had a small wet bar area complete with an empty fridge instead of the typical \"honor bar\" that most resorts have. We liked this amenity. The room also had a very large balcony complete with lounge chair and a round table with chairs. Because of the size and direct ocean view of the balcony, we found ourselves spending more time out there than we typically would on a hotel balcony. Resort Grounds and Restaurants: We liked that the pool area had an adults-only pool in addition to the pools that are open to guests of all ages. The beach is very accessible since it's just past the pools and villas. We originally were going to stay at the nearby Grand Wailea before changing our reservation so we spent some time checking out the grounds of it and another neighboring resort, the Four Seasons. We thought the Fairmont was the best of the bunch. The Four Seasons had no beach area and a small and cramped pool area while the Grand Wailea was packed to the gills with kids. We didn't get to see the rooms of either resort so I can't comment on that aspect of them. We had a fantastic meal at one of the resort's on-site restaurants, Ko. The tempura battered ahi sushi roll appetizer was to die for! For dessert, we found the Hawaiian shaved ice with red beans to be a tasty and somewhat healthy choice (compared to other dessert possibilities). We did not eat at the hotel's signature restaurant, Nick's Fish Market. Service: Our only critique of this resort is regarding the service. We had two unsatisfactory experiences with the staff and they both occurred the night we checked in. When we arrived at the hotel, we found the valet staff to be great but the front desk attendant was somewhat unwelcoming of us at check-in; he barely said anything more than \"photo ID and credit card.\" He also seemed annoyed when we we inquired about the difference between two room categories: Ocean View and Ocean View Deluxe. We asked because we may have wanted to pay for an upgrade - it was our honeymoon, after all - but the front desk clerk's attitude and lack of information prevented us from seriously considering this. We did arrive after 11pm so one explanation could be that they don't have their A-staff working the overnight shift. Not long after we got to our room, we wanted to ordered room service since our travel schedule forced us to forgo dinner. I pushed the \"room service\" button and the phone rang about 20 times before I hung up. I called back a few minutes later and encountered the same problem. I then called the front desk who took my order. When I asked why nobody answered the room service line, they explained that the front desk handles the orders late at night but the daytime room service staff must have forgot to forward the calls to the front desk when they left for the evening. Although this seemed like a reasonable explanation, I was surprised that something so basic could slip through the cracks at a resort of this caliber. Furthermore, I got the impression that it wasn't a seldom occurrence, although I obviously can't confirm this hunch to be true. When I called a little later to check on my food (using the \"front desk\" button - not the \"room service\" button) I was told it was on its way up. After 10 minutes I called back to see if there was a mix-up and it turns out they were still preparing it. I expressed frustration about the conflicting answers since it was late at night (12:30am), we had been traveling all day and we wanted to get to bed as soon as possible. What followed was a bit bizarre: the front desk was completely apologetic about the mix-up on our order status (I think it was the same guy who checked us in) however, he called back about 30 minutes after our food arrived to inform us that the meal would be comped. So, in the end, the hotel did make it right for us and, thankfully, these two negative experiences did not define our stay at this property.

Concierge were so friendly and helpful - sending us on our snorkel trips and hikes with clean towels and taking them from us on our return. The food and view at the pool restaurant is spectacular. Highly recommend! Also, Cafe' Ciao is the best place to grab breakfast (Macadamia nut muffins are to die for), snacks and even grab take out and a bottle of wine to take to the beach or your balcony to enjoy sunset. We love the privacy of Polo Beach. The attendants are quick to set up your umbrellas and chairs each morning. When compared to the mob on Wailea beach in front of the Grand Wailea and Four Seasons, the Kea Lani crowd on Polo Beach is far less. Good snorkeling to the right around the bluff as well. The pool was very crowded and it was almost impossible to get a chair, but we spend our days at the beach and let the kids swim in the (always) empty pool at night so that wasn't an issue for us.

Things we liked: Suite layout is great for a family of four as it provides privacy for the parents and a room the kids can have as their own. Loved having a microwave and refigerator in the room. Food at the resort is fairly expensive, so this allowed us to hit a nearby grocery store and have more economical lunches. Lunch by the pool was very good, but $60 to $80 a pop, the cost could run up. Kids were so tired some nights they were fine with something small. Beach is great. Plenty of room, plenty of chairs. Kids loved the pool area and the swim-up bar. Hotel staff was very friendly. Breakfast buffett offered variety and an attentive staff. Nick's Fishmarket and Ko were both very good options. Things that could have been better: It was way too competitive for chairs by the pool. Before 7:00 a.m., most of the chairs near the upper pool were gone. Some went so far as to set up their spaces the night before. So either you need to play along or be resigned to getting a chair somewhere on one of the lawns away from the pool. Most days we hit the beach first but the day we did go to pool it was frustrating to be there at 8:30 and not get a chair, only to see that chair go unoccupied until well after noon. The nightly turn-down service should be done earlier with better communication. We were up early and back to our room after dinner early. The turndown service didn't generally get to our room before 9, which meant we rarely used it. The resort seemed fairly quiet at night which I assume meant others were on an early schedule as well. The few times they did come they didn't recognize that our kids were using the sofabed and didn't set up the bed for them. The Polo Lounge on our first night (March 25th) had awful service. One over-worked waiter couldn't get the orders straight and made numerous errors on our bill. He forgot several items and getting his attention was an issue. He didn't bring my wife's drink, then brought it as we were leaving. Never dawned on him to not charge us for it and we didn't feel like trying to get him to understand the issue. On most nights the lounge was quiet. Not sure if the issue is trying to staff to a generally low level of usage which leads to problems when it is busy or a low-level of usage because of a bad experience when it is crowded,. Thought the room was great, but we never went back to the lounge to sit for a drink because the experience the first night was so bad. Few minor misses didn't dampen our interest in returning.

I had not been to Hawaii in 20 years and she had never been. Originally we had booked at the Westin, but decided to cancel that reservation and book at the Fairmont (knowing that the Fairmont has yet to disappoint). Prior to departing, I notified the hotel that I was planning on proposing while in Maui. They asked if I needed any help with the wedding proposal. I told them my plan and they were immediately on board with it! To summarize, I wanted to arrange a \"fake movie night\" at the hotel and have them convert a ballroom into a movie theatre and show a movie. The movie that would be shown would be the first movie my girlfriend and I saw together (years ago....). 15-20 minutes in, the movie would have technical difficulties and then a slide show (consisting of pictures of us from over the years) would play. I explained this to the hotel and they told me to give them a couple of days and they would see how they could refine/assist with the plan. A couple of days later, I received an email explaining that they would leave a hand written note under our hotel room door 3 days prior to the \"movie night\". This note would be an invitation from the General Manager inviting us to the Friday night movie night. They also told me in the emal that they would essentially look after the small details and that I had nothing to worry about. We showed up in Maui on the 25th and as planned, a note appeared under our door (as promised). After a very special dinner on the Friday, we walked over to the Orchid Ballroom. At the entrance was a man in a suit who asked us if we were there for \"Movie Night\". He escorted us into the ballroom (now converted into a theatre with drapes and velvet ropes etc and chairs etc....). Upon sitting down, he offered us popcorn and drinks etc... She had no idea this whole \"movie night\" was fake. We sat down and enjoyed the private screening (obviously no one else was invited to the movie night). Fast forward a bit - after she \"said yes\", we went back to our room to call our friends and families and share the news and we came back to find a bottle of champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and a congratulatory note from the staff at the Fairmont Kea Lani. I can say this with all confidence that there is no other hotel chain in the world that I would have trusted with this unique wedding proposal. More so, the staff at the Kea Lani were just as excited to help out with the planning as I was to propose! One other quick story - one evening we were heading out to dinner in town and while taking the elevator down to the lobby, the elevator got stuck for about 5 seconds. No big deal, but we felt we should probably notify the hotel. Upon arriving in the lobby we told one of the front desk agents (and he asked for our room number). We certainly did not make a big deal of the incident but rather wanted to give them the 'heads up'. Upon arriving back to the hotel from dinner, we had, not one, but two voicemails from Fairmont staff just checking to make sure we were ok. I know this may not seem like much to most, but I doubt many other hotels in the world would provide this sort of service. A couple of other quick points - food at the hotel is great. Rooms are huge - every room is a suite (bedroom and a living room), 2 TV's, huge bathroom, spectacular balcony/views. Breakfast buffet is fantastic. Coffee in the cafe is amazing. While sitting at the pool, staff walk around handing out fresh pinapple and cold, wet towels. The staff are incredible.

We went to the Orchid on the big island and then came to Maui and stayed at the Kea Lani. Honestly, the Orchid was better and we don't think the kea lani is worth the price. I'm confused about the Fairmont brand in general. I think they are trying to be in class with the best hotels, such as Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons. If you stay at the Kea Lani with those types of expectations, you will be dissapointed. We had high expectations after reading reviews and being past guests of the Fairmont on the big island. We payed a lot and figured that this would be a mind blowing hotel, possibly the best we have ever stayed in. It wasn't. The attention to detail just isn't there for the Kea Lani. Don't get me wrong the hotel is very nice, but if you are trying to compete with the four seasons you have to be at the top of your game. There are so many things \"wrong\" with the Kea Lani that you would never see at the four seasons. It all comes down to attention to detail, like clean the dirt out of the corners type of stuff. The best hotels don't wait until something is horribly worn out or out of date before replacing it, they are proactive. This hotel is not. When trying to be a great hotel you should never let things get to the point people complain before you do something about it. Things should be perfect all the time, for every guest, in every room, in every part of the hotel. For around 500 dollars per night things should be clean and in perfect condition. They just aren't. I know the hallways are about to get remodeled and boy do they need it. They are strangely big, empty, old feeling and super dirty. It feels like you are walking through an old Aladdin themed hotel in vegas. Dirty, ugly hallways walking to your room do not give a good first impression. The elevators are old and have a strange smell. I know there is only so much you can do about \"old\" but there is never an excuse for dirty. Especially in the halls. We stayed on the \"K\" floor and it sucked, if the manager reads this go take a critical look at the hallway and be honest with yourself. It's really dirty. If you compare the Fairmont to the hotels in Kaanapali, it is way better....But also much more expensive. So I'm not sure who they are trying to beat. If they are trying to beat the Hyatt or the Westin, they did, but it's not worth the price. If they are trying to beat the Ritz or the Four Seasons they failed. The food here is very good, but very expensive as expected. We ate off property most of the time. The beach and the Snorkeling is very very good here. I would go back just for the snorkeling to the north of the beach. The workout room is not good. Don't expect to keep up with your workouts here. There are only a few machines in there and no free weights, just your typical hotel rack of light dumbbells. The pools are ok, but way too close to the main buildings. It makes for a lot of noise and it seems like this hotel has a lot of \"bad rooms\", rooms that are right next to the pool or just above a restaurant. We saw people moving out of these noisy rooms all week long while we were there. Thankfully we had a room away from the pools and restaurants. If you get a room on floor 3, or right next to the pool, don't unpack get moved immediately. It seems like the biggest draw of this hotel are the 2 room suites. Just like an old embassy suites setup. They are nice but why should I see black mold in my shower for 500 bucks a night? Lack of attention to detail. My summary is, nice but not worth the price. I would rank this hotel in the same class as the Hyatt in Kaanapali but for the money the Hyatt is a much better deal. If you really want to be pampered and stay in the super ritzy Wailea area of Maui, bite the bullet and stay at the four seasons. Or be economical and stay at the Marriott. The Kea Lani is strangely in the middle as far as quality but at the high end on price. Oh and the Spa sucked. The locker rooms are way too small and have poor amenities. It is almost like the spa here was an afterthought and shoehorned into the hotel. The spa at the Westin is much better and again half the price.

We've seen this beautiful property go through many stages of renovation over the years and we are always eager to see what's new. The new pool deck really IS cooler in the hot sun! Nice work! The lounge chairs were added in an earlier year and they were a huge improvement over the original white chairs. At this point we couldn't be happier with the pools ... so happy in fact, we spent almost all of two weeks spending at least a few hours poolside every day! The pools here are not nearly as crowded with lounge chairs as neighboring hotels and the grounds have all kinds of open grassy space around the pools ... there's just more room at the Kea Lani pools. Fantastic service from the bartenders at both Ko and Polo Beach bars as well. Warm welcomes and great drinks and conversations as always by Marty and Kaz and Tom and the poolside servers as well. The remodeled room, the same Kilohana suite we have had in many previous visits, was a nice tuneup. The new mirrors, the flat screen TV in the bedroom, new drapes and colors were very nice and the new lanai furniture was significantly better than the old pieces. Can't wait to see the fresh paint and carpet updates in the hallways next year. We've renovated enough of our own facilities to know it's a work in progress if you want to continue serving customers so it's no disappointment to us it's being done in stages. The standards of the hotel are such that we expect next year many of the improvements will finally be completed. The concierge desk was, as always, competent and cheerfully helpful. Going to places like Mama's or Sarento's we found ourselves with beautiful tables front row seats to the beaches. Restaurants paid attention when those girls called them on our behalf. Bellmen were hustling for the car whenever we appeared and greeted us warmly by name. Check in took five minutes ... no issues ... we were in our room almost as fast as they opened our car doors. Valet parking the first night is free ... a nice treat to weary travelers. While last year we were less than impressed with the food at Ko this year was a complete reversal. I don't know if they switched up the menu or not but we went back on more than one occasion ... the food was excellent this year!

Again, this was very much appreciated as we were all exhausted and needed a little boost. My enthusiasm was stifled a bit when I saw our room. It was a suite, with ample space for the kids to sleep (fold out Queen couch), but the overall feel of the room was dated and dingy. It had an odor of mildew, and didn't present itself as a very clean room. That uneasy feeling was exacerbated a few days later when my wife and I both got food poisoning. We had only eaten at the resort up until then, so we felt certain it was the food there that made us sick. It is a testament to the staff that this experience didn't ruin the week for us.

Less expensive than it's well known neighbor the Grand Wailea and just as nice. Grounds are lush and tropical, with great pools for all ages. Rooms are all-suite with a small kitchen if you prefer to eat in some nights. If you prefer to dine out, Nick's seafood house on the property is fabulous. If you really want a luxurious vacation, this is a perfect spot. Wailea is the most recently developed area, so everything is manicured and pristine. A little too pristine for my tastes. Driving the streets in Wailea, I almost feel as if I am in a country club....BORING. If you are a golfer, however, they have some excellent courses nearby.The one good aspect of Wailea is Big Beach just down the street a few miles from the resort. If you dare, Little beach (nude beach) is adjacent to Big Beach and is way less crowded. Honestly, I love to experience Hawaii in it's purest form. I enjoy and prefer the North West side of Maui. Lahaina, Kapalua and Napili. For me, Hawaii is about discovering new beaches, trails and wonderful restaurants. I tend to shy away from the overly popular places like Mama's fish house, opting for smaller quaint local favorites.

It was our first time to Maui. We got our flight and car rental on points so wanted to splurge on a hotel. We agonized many weeks between the Fairmont, Ritz Carlton and the Four Seasons. The reason we chose the Fairmont was due to its location in Wailea (weather was suppose to be more predicable in Feb) and that we could get an ocean view room for the same price as the Four Seasons lowest end room. Overall the Fairmont has so many things going for it. The grounds, pools and beach was excellent. The location in Wailea was great, close to other hotels, restaurants and a bit of shopping so you never got bored. I liked the self parking- ie you didn't feel like you had to valet park every time you went in and out like other hotels in the area- ie more freedom. The atmosphere at the hotel was really relaxed and the service on all fronts was great. We went to all of the restaurants that were open and they were good. As part of our hotel rate we got the breakfast buffet included. It was very nice-lots of fresh fruit. But if you had to pay for it each time it would be really pricey. I only have two complaints about the hotel: First was the so called renovations. I am in the design industry so maybe I'm a bit picky on details. The funny part was I thought we got one of the rooms that had not been renovated. But I figured, chill you are on vacation. When we left I asked the front desk when they were going to renovate as I thought how spectacular it would be and we would return again next year. Then they told me that had already renovated. I was a bit disappointed as all I could tell that was changed was the drapes and the furniture. Important things like the carpet, paint, fixtures, fittings, and doors were all in pretty rough condition for a 4.5 star hotel. A lick of paint and some new carpet would have been a huge improvement. Two positives about the room was that it was huge and the full size balcony complete with table and chairs which was really nice in the evening. My second complaint other was how expensive drinks, food and snacks were at the restaurants and cafe. Seven dollars for an americano is crazy! Also all the nickel and diming on the rental of beach umbrellas ($40 a day), boogie boards etc. The pool was filled with reserved only lounge chairs which were very nice and empty because they charge for those too. I tried really hard not to let this annoy me as I was on vacation. But beware don't expect any extras when you pay a premium price for a room. On the positive side if you are not worried about the two items above then the other 10 plus great things kind of cancel them out. Overall it give this hotel a 4 our of 5, but I'd give the rooms a 3 or a 3.5. Please Fairmont change the carpet and paint and I will be back in a second! A bit on the island and location. I loved the location we had great weather, warm, a bit less touristy and quieter than other parts of the island. We took day trips everywhere including the road to Hana- wow. The Ritz Carlton at the north of the island was really nice- quiet and the ocean on this side is a deeper blue- beautiful. We spent a lot of time watching the grey whales- spectacular. We did some snorkeling which was good but not as good as the Mayan Reef in terms of visibility. I'm in love with Maui and now want to see the other islands. We went to the Grande Spa at the hotel next door and it was great. I think if I went back to Maui I might consider the a couple nights in Wailea at the Kei Lani or Four Seasons (which was over the top nice!) and a few at the Ritz Carlton to mix it up.

However, it was in the parking lot above the children's play land and behind a public parking lot as well as a 10 story condominium and outside of the central grounds.. Even with that situation it was not bad until I had to listen to loud engines running constantly because the Tour Buses park back there, the young men ride their scooters without mufflers, people parking and fixing their cars and then late one night someone blowing the loud horn shell right next to my lanai And, the landscape personnel began using an electric hedger right outside my door before 6 am. It woke me and I could not go back to sleep again. . I had requested a QUIET Room, that was a priority. This was also a bad location for a solo female traveler because someone could easily enter this suite especially being next to this public parking lot on a low level.. Noise, Noise, Noise . I called and was told I could move if I paid $220 a night more, I'm already paying a few hundred a night. I was then told I booked a low rate room because it was through Costco, but I was NEVER told that prior to arrival. I spoke with several people at the front desk, not too interested and had an attitude. The manager called me and agreed to move me without an additional cost after I threatened to never come back to this resort again. That was perfect until the third morning when I realized I shared a wall with the ELECTRICAL ROOM and there was work going on from morning until late evening, drilling, hammering, banging against the wall. Oh, and at night there was a big party below me for a corporation and it continued for many hours beyond 10 pm. Remember, I requested Quiet? I have a chronic illness and went there to relax. It was a very stressful week dealing with bad attitudes from employees, rarely a smile nor any hospitality nor concern. The front desk personnel always seemed bothered if I asked a question and acted indifferent and annoyed. The concierge desk was not better. This is the first vacation where I was really happy and anxious to LEAVE ! We have traveled to Hawaii and Maui for over 22 years and never experienced anythiing like this in the past. I will NEVER return to this Fairmont property again. Formerly a Human Resources Management Generalist, I would encourage this hotel to make some changes immediately, provide staff training and perhaps treat their staff better. If I was treated with this disregard then I imagine the staff is not treated well either. So, if you want to pay $500 to $1000 per night maybe you will have a nice room and better treatment but if you want to pay a little less don't expect much. My spouse and I planned to return here in the fall but will never return to this \"resort\" again. The pool is beautiful . The Four Seasons next door treated me extremely well when I was there and I also had dinner at Spago's restaurant which was wonderful. And again I was treated very well as one would expect.

We were originally booked for 8 nights, but had to delay our trip due to the giant snowstorm that hit Chicago. This was our first stay at the Kea Lani and we booked through Costco. When we knew our flight plans had changed I called Costco and they contacted the Kea Lani to see if we could change our reservations. Unfortunately, we were not able to extend our stay because the Kea Lani was booked for the two additional nights we needed, but the Kea Lani did refund our money for the two nights that we weren't able to get there. The Costco travel agent was very excited about this (we had travel insurance so I wouldn't have lost out). The Kea Lani is a class act and the agent said that not a lot of hotels would do that. Even though we had a lot of hassles to start our trip, that was a nice touch on the part of the Kea Lani. We arrived late at 9:30 and we were exhausted. The hotel looked very inviting when we pulled up and check in was quick and easy. We had to wait for our luggage for about 10 minutes and it seemed like forever. The bell man was friendly and had lots to tell us, but I just wanted to get into bed. The room was very clean, spacious and impressive! We were on the far side of the property right next to the elevator in the k wing and across from the loud ice machine, I was a little worried that we would be able to hear everything, but figured that I would sort out any issues in the morning. The way the room is set up w/ the bathroom. closet and hallway/bar next to the hallway it is so quiet! In all six nights we were never bothered by any noise. It was one of the quietest and most comfortable rooms we have ever stayed in. I was also a little worried about my son and daughter sharing the pull out sofa bed, they are age 8 and 10. They LOVED having \"their own room\". They loved everything about that suite. My daughter ended up getting a fever/flu type of sickness so we spent more time in the suite than we had planned and I was so glad to have the extra room. It was nice to let her sleep while I enjoyed reading out on the lanai. We also got take out several nights for dinner when my kids were tired and we ate out on the lanai. We had pre-paid the breakfast buffet for myself and my husband as part of our package. We also paid $14.00 per child on a few of the days we were there, but other times we just picked up breakfast for the kids when we were out. We stocked up on juice, water, beer, soda at Costco and were very glad to have the fridge in the room. We never did use the mircrowave for anything, but it was nice to know it was there if we needed it. Regarding the breakfast, it was nice and we enjoyed the wide variety of items, but I was kind of over it after about 3 or 4 days. I wish the there was a better ocean view from the restaurant. It is a nice buffet but sitting poolside is a non-event in my book. I would love to have an oceanview to enjoy my coffee and watch the sky, surf, and whales. I'm not complaining, but we have stayed at the Grand Hyatt Kauai and the Kea Lani breakfast location pales in comparison to the Gran Hyatt's. I felt like I just wanted to fuel up and get on with my day to go to the beach or walk on the Wailea seaside path. With both my kids getting sick we really didn't plan any dinners at the Kea Lani restaurants. We did get drinks at the pool bar and they were great. I have enjoyed yoga at the Grand Hyatt in a lovely little garden studio and I was curious to check out the fitness center and yoga at the Kea Lani but the location didn't look very promising. I will admit that I didn't actually enter the fitness studio or take a class but thats because I would rather enjoy the views and walk the beach path through Wailea. I couldn't help but compare the Kea Lani to the Grand Hyatt and other properties I have stayed at. I have to say that I would describe the Kea Lani as \"understated elegance\" it just has a certain quietness about it. I found the architecture growing on me, the white is very soothing and the tiled pools are beautiful. One night when I watched the sunset after the rain I turned around to look at the Kea Lani against the pink sky and the green grass and it was really very stunning. Polo beach is beautiful and the sand was very fine and soft, the setting is beautiful but the surf was very big the week we were there so we spent limited time in the ocean and didn't get to try snorkeling or the outrigger canoe that I was interested in. Between the sick child and the big surf we just kind of took it easy and didn't over do the activities. I am already planning my trip for next Feb and I will definitely be enjoying the suite life again next year! I hope that we will be able to spend more time in the beautiful Polo beach next year.", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "williamsburg", "Title": "\u201cdisappointed\u201d", "Author": "badcab", "ReviewID": "UR96178699", "Content": "I called Kea Lani about my Ovation package. I was told that there were vacancies. I then made my non-refundable plane reservations. Flying from Virginia to Hawaii is a lot of airfare that was not covered by the package. I knew that going in. However, it wasn't until all the booking was done that I called the Kea Lani back and was THEN told about the $600 upgrade I would have to pay. I was very unhappy because I had spend $3000 on this package already and had to pay extra for the airfare. I was not told ahead of time that I'd be required to pay an upgrade. However, I do understand that there was a notation on my certificates that might have told me that. I never saw it but I believe it was there. Still, I mentioned the Ovation package when I called for availability and was not told. That was frustrating. However, I chose to come anyway since I had already booked my nonrefundable passage. I stayed my first 3 nights at an Outrigger hotel and came to the Kea Lani on my fourth day. As we pulled into the circular drive (so that I could run in to see if we could check in earlier than scheduled), the \"greeter\" came screaming out to the car (where my husband was waiting) saying, \"You can't park there! You can't park there!\" It was very embarrassing. I said that I was sorry and pointed to the sign that said \"Unloading\" and told him I was checking to see if we could unload. He made us move the car anyway - not in a friendly way. He then, as I made my way across the lobby, screamed \"WAIT!\" I turned to see what the problem was and he was running after me with a lei in his hand that he promptly threw around my neck saying \"Aloha.\" I wasn't in the mood to be \"aloha'd\" at that point. Then we were shown to our room. It was on the 2nd floor above the children's pool. All I could hear was happy children screaming. I went down to the front desk and apologized but said that we couldn't stay there. We didn't need a \"view\" of any kind, we needed quiet. I even joked that if I'd wanted to hear happy screaming children, I'd have brought my own. I was told politely, but firmly, that I'd have to pay an additional upgrade to get a different room. So, instead I asked what the cancellation policy was because I'd just stay the one night and return to the Outrigger. It was quiet and peaceful there. I was told that the \"director\" told the \"manager\" that the Fairmont would keep my Ovation certificates and my $600 if I cancelled or left before the end of my 4 night-stay. This is when I got really angry and asked how in good conscience they could hold my certificates and money hostage. I was not happy with the room, I didn't need a view, I just needed QUIET. I was eventually upgraded for free to a room on the 6th floor. The outcome was adequate but what I had to go through to get that was sub par. I needed quiet because I was recovering from a stress-induced medical condition. This situation did not help me at all. Customer service isn't about forcing the customer into an outburst before you take care of a problem. It's showing genuine care and concern about the problem and trying to compromise on a way to work it out. I'm a reasonable person. I would have taken my certificates and used them at another facility eventually. In fact, I had to cancel at the Sonoma last Christmas due to my medical condition and they couldn't have been any kinder. So I didn't understand this situation at all. The staff bordered on supercilious and snooty. Almost all of them. I don't think I ran into one staff person to whom I felt I could engage in a meaningful, genuine conversation. Your Kea Lani staff may need some education into what it means to be \"helpful\" rather than pedantic and rude. My rental car was vandalized the first night. However, since we did not \"valet\" park it, there was nothing your security would or could do. I have to tell you, the entire resort seemed to be geared toward forcing us to shell out money hand-over-fist rather than seeing to our comfort. There is certainly more, but I hope I've conveyed my dismay sufficiently to end it here. For the record, and for my commentaries about this hotel in the blogging world, I'd take the genuineness of the staff at the Outrigger, plus the quality of the living space (even though their a/c didn't work) over the Kea Lani.

We chose the Wailea area (and enjoyed it), having stayed in Kaanapali years ago. (We visited Kauai first on this trip.) Beautiful location, grand and sprawling grounds and pool areas, received Fairmont President's Club upgraded view as we requested. Can't quite put my finger on it, but for all of its qualities, the Kea Lani just misses being five-star in my opinion. I agree with some of the other comments that the rooms (while very large and well equipped) seem dated in some way, despite the recent renovations. Maybe it's the very tired-looking carpet (even if it is new), maybe it's the bedding (mattress was way too saggy on the edges for a new hotel), maybe we were spoiled by the friendliness of the staff at the Koa Kea in Kauai and didn't find quite the same \"aloha spirit\" at the Kea Lani.

All in all, a fine choice, however, if you're looking for large suite-style rooms (especially for families) and good pools and facilities. We did not check out the Four Seasons or the Grand Wailea, but chose the Fairmont in the first place because of a favorable promotional rate.

It never seems to get old for me. I traveled this time with my husband, our 4 year old son, my brother and sister in law and my 7 month old niece. We stayed in one of the newly renovated villas (#28). This was our first time staying in a villa and let me just say it was FANTASTIC! The 2 story villa had a beautiful kitchen (fully stocked with pots, pans, cooking supplies etc..), a great living area that walks out to an outdoor patio complete with grille and private pool! There are two bedrooms. One downstairs with gorgeous bathroom and one upstairs with another gorgeous bathroom. The bedrooms/bathrooms are very similar to that of the suites. They are spacious and contain all the luxuries you would expect from a first class hotel. My family very much enjoyed the living quarters and made use of all of the space! I would also like to recommend if you do stay in a villa that you have the \"chef\" come over and cook for you! We had dinner right on our patio one night and a Fairmont chef came over and cooked us up some mahi mahi and chicken along with other sides. It was a delicious meal and super fun because we could entertain the kids in our private pool and all eat together as a family. The renovations at the main pools are fabulous! The new marble like tile surrounding the pool is gorgeous. The service at the Fairmont Kea Lani is top notch and the people are as nice as can be! This is my favorite vacation spot and I can only hope to return again someday!! It is a great place for romantic couples as well as a great place for kids!

I love that there is an adults pool with under 18's excluded though there is a huge pool with slide for the kiddies. The hotel is on the beach and guests can use the chairs and towels down there. One thing I've noticed with Hawaiian hotels is that you do PAY for every little extra from the poolside cabanas to the use of snorkels and body boards at the beach *ripoff!* NOTHING is complimentary, not even the inroom wifi.

Plenty of waves, sandy bottom, attentive care from the Kea Lani helping set you up on the beach, excellent views of Molokini and migrating whales. Second, the rooms. This is an all suites hotel. We normally get two connecting suites for our four person family. This gives us plenty of room. Also, the bathrooms are exceptionally large allowing everyone to get ready in the morning without tripping over each other. Finally, the hotel and the staff are just wonderful. The lobby is large, open air and has a classic Hawaiian feel to it. The staff are attentive and seem to genuinely care. I see the same people year after year so it feels a lot like visiting old friends. Bottom line, you will enjoy staying at this hotel and experiencing all that Hawaii has to offer.

What a great time to be in Maui. No crowds, no fighting for pool or beach chairs, and lots of peace and quiet. The hotel recently renovated their grounds, suites and villas and the improvements are fantastic. We stayed in a villa for the first time, but having seen them on their website, I have to say the update is a huge improvement. Everything looks a little more modern, new and well kept. The only thing that needs some work in the rooms is the artwork. They still have these washed-out old South Pacific prints on the wall that just don't go with the decor anymore. However, that is minor. The service this time around was phenomenal. The keiki club for the kids was great and Miss Bonnie was a big hit. There also seems to be some improvements on the pool chair situation. They seem to have gone to a first-come first-serve system with no holding chairs, which works just fine. The slide could stand with a thorough scrub, but the kids didn't seem to notice. Housekeeping staff and pool staff were very helpful and check-in and out was a breeze. There were only two things that I think the hotel should take note of. One, I sent a package through the concierge on the 15th through FedEx. It was supposed to get to Canada on the afternoon of the 20th and I paid a lot of money for it to do so. Unfortunately, the young lady working at the concierge desk I guess did not realize that Canada is a separate country from the United States and thus requires an International waybill. Long story short, the package was returned by FedEx to the hotel on the date it was supposed to arrive in Canada. Rather than calling me in my villa and asking if they should resend it, which they should have done, they chose to resend it. The package did not arrive until the 26th, the day after Christmas because of this. Grrr. Concierge staff represent the hotel and they should be very careful in choosing staff that are not just friendly, but smart and able to handle things for guests. The only other quibble is the their restaurants. The morning restaurant is great and the Polo lounge is good for lunch. However, Nick's Fish Market is only open for dinner, and in my opinion is very overrated and too expensive for what you get. The hotel's dinner and lunch restaurant, Ko, is not bad, but it's stuck in this dark little corner and if it rains they move it even farther inside. We went to the Four Seasons and the Grand Wailea for almost every meal in the evenings. They need to do something, or make some major landscape changes, to make dining a pleasurable Hawaiian experience. It would be nice to look out over the ocean, see the sunset maybe. Still, all in all it was probably the nicest stay we have had there and for a place to stay with family, it is tough to beat.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anchorage, AK", "Title": "\u201cGreat as always\u201d", "Author": "alaska7133", "ReviewID": "UR90028654", "Content": "Second stay at the Fairmont Kea Lani.

Sure the room rate is not cheap compared to some other beachside hotels in Maui, but all in all I feel like we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got our money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth. Pros: 1) Suites are all newly refurnished. They now have nice flat screen tvs, new Denon sound system, new sofa, new lighting and new coffee tables (comparing to the older review photos). Too bad I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a chance to take a picture, but they are all tastefully decorated and very functional. Free ipod dock/speaker in room for your use. Not sure if the carpet was replaced (the one in my suite was a light beige color) but it was clean and room service vacuumed everyday. Our babysitter from NannyConnection.com commented on how the new furniture looks so much better than the old ones. She also said the Kea Lani has the most tasteful X\u00e2\u20ac\u2122mas decoration of all the Maui hotels (she has been to enough to know \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and I actually agree with her after visiting several other hotels) 2) Wet bar / empty fridge / microwave oven came very handy for feeding children / eating takeout. Housekeeping will provide cutlery/plates for free if you call and ask. There is also a coffeemaker + electric kettle + coffee mugs on wet bar. There is also a free ice machine + free self-service laundry machines (not coin-op) on every floor (you need to buy your own laundry detergent though) 3) Service in the hotel was very friendly and spot on. Concierge, bell staff, pool/beach staff always offered to help unsolicited when they saw me alone with my toddler (offer to help carry grocery / personal items) Poolside waiters always showed up and introduced themselves once we have settled at the poolside loungers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s friendly, efficient service, but not over-the-top mind-reading service like the Four Seasons. (It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ok by me, since the room rate also reflects that) 4) Room is very well laid out, with huge bathroom that connects to both living area and bedroom. It works very well for families with young children who need to nap/sleep early. You can use the bathroom discretely at night without waking up the children. 5) Lanai is also very well laid out. A big round table for 4 allows al-fresco dining on the cheap. Also a great place to enjoy wine/champagne at sunset. (There is a real pimpin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 wine store in Wailea if you want high-end wine, for cheaper wine Kihei Safeway has a good selection) There is one reclining lounger in the lanai as well. If your room has a bad view (the lowest rate rooms face the parking lot) there are a couple of large picnic tables on the lawn area should you want to eat takeout food outdoor. We used it twice (enjoyed coffee right before hitting the pools) for breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see anyone else using them at all! 6) We had a standard ocean-view room (not the deluxe ones), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s set back a way from the beach, but at night if we opened the lanai doors we could still hear the crash of the waves quite clearly 7) Cribs and high chairs are free of charge to use in-room. 8) Expansive grounds. Unlike the Four Seasons and the Grand Wailea, the Fairmont does not pack loungers on every inch of real estate. It has a lot of manicured lawn area for children to play / run on. 9) All 3 freshwater pools are newly refurbished. They did not feel crowded at all during our stay; in fact one morning we had the lower family pool all to ourselves! 10) Poolside umbrellas are free (even though you need to rent a poolside cabana \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I think they provide free fruits / ice if you rent a cabana). There was no shortage of free shady poolside spots during our stay. We were not charged for the use of beach umbrellas since it was low season (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I was told) There is a free cold water dispenser by the pool hut (so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to buy bottled water if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to). There is always a pool guy making rounds offering free cool towels, free pineapple skewers, etc. 11) Technically all beaches in Hawaii are public, but given Polo beach is a small beach (compares to other popular ones), very few non-guests go there. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost like having a private hotel beach. Quality of sand (very very fine, no water shoes needed) and water are the same as the other beaches. There is no trash at all on Polo Beach. 12) No resort fee. Self-parking is free and the lot is a very short walk (literally 30 seconds) from the lobby. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have towel cards like some hotels, you can take as many pool towels as you need and return them whenever. (They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t nickel and dime you on the small stuff) Cons: 1) Restaurant food was not that tasty considering the price they charge (I am ok with paying more for convenience of dining in hotel grounds but I demand quality). We had one breakfast buffet and one lunch at Ko. The breakfast buffet at Fairmont was very lackluster for $30pp. If you are going to pay that much money anyway, you might as well go to the Four Seasons breakfast buffet next door (quality of food + service was outstanding there) Same with Ko, the food was ok but the service was terrible (busboy spilled water twice on the table). For the same price the lunch at Ferraros beats it by a mile. We got room service one night and the quality of the fish dish was very lackluster as well (although delivery was prompt). We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dine in Nick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fishmarket so cannot comment. 2) TVs and Denon A/V system are brand new and have HD capabilities, but they only connected them using standard component cables, so we were watching HD DVDs on a HD TV at standard def! Very minor complaint but the Fairmont really should fix this! 3) Free in-room internet only for 24 hours if you join the Presidents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Club. Enough to send/check occasional emails but not to work. Wi-Fi in lobby is free though. Cell phone signal is a bit weak in-room and stronger at Polo beach (I think the closest cell reception tower is actually located at the Four Seasons) 4) You need to swim around the rock outcroppings (almost to the Four Seasons side) in the ocean to get good snorkeling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c again it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s such a minor minor nit-picking Some prior complaints I want to address: 1) Self-parking space is tight \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Over-exaggeration. The actual spaces are standard size, but they are set parallel to each other (not at an angle like most supermarket parking lots in the west coast), so it requires the driver to have some minimum driving skills (i.e. how to back up a car properly) to be able to park. Those spaces would be considered generous in size in NYC 2) Caff\u00c3\u00a9 Ciao food prices are high \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Well you are paying for the convenience of not leaving the hotel. I thought they were acceptable ($3 for one large tasty muffin and $3 for a cup of coffee, also quite tasty. Think Cali Starbucks prices). There is free self-parking and a free empty fridge in room, you are welcome to drive 10 mins to Safeway or Foodland in Kihei to stock up whatever grocery items you need to save money 3) Beach is small \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Yes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smaller than the other more famous beaches like Wailea, Kama'ole I/II/III, Makena Big Beach, etc, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still pretty darn big (stretches across the entire front of Fairmont + Polo Beach Club condo). Honestly how much ocean/sand does one person need? 4) Ugly architecture \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Really a matter of personal opinion. We visited the Four Seasons, Grand Wailea, Ritz Carlton, Hyatt and they are all very cookie-cutter, architecturally. At least the Kea Lani has got its own style. The only truly architecturally Hawaiian hotel in Maui is the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. We got over the only real \u00e2\u20ac\u0153problem\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (lackluster restaurant food) by eating out more (which we would have done anyway, for the sake of variety). In particular \u00e2\u20ac\u201c takeout at Coconut Fish Caf\u00c3\u00a9 / Caf\u00c3\u00a9 O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Lei, ahi poke at Foodland, formal dining in Capische, Pacific\u00e2\u20ac\u2122O, Longhi, Ferraros and Haliimale General Store all deserve honorable mentions. All in all, this is a great hotel to stay at \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I highly recommend the Kea Lani for families with young children. For families with older children, you might prefer the Grand Wailea for its crazy pools and slides. For couples sans bebes Four Seasons will offer you more pampering.

To say it was exceptional would be an understatement. I had selected it over the Four Seasons and the Grand Wailea due to recommendations I had read, both on this site, as well as several travel publications. My wife could not have been happier. The two room suite was perfect, and we had a glorious view of the grounds, with the beach and ocean in the distance. EVERY staff member went out of their way to ensure that our every need was met. Of particular note for excellent service was Eric, the car service driver, who provided several outstanding recommendations for dinner plans. Although the Fairmont was expensive, it was well worth the cost. From the pool staff who were constantly checking to see if there was anything they do do to make our visit more enjoyable, to the pool side waiters who seemed to remember your name after your first request, the staff was exceptional. Be sure to ask about the complimentary canoe ride provided by the staff each morning. It was one of the highlights of our visit.

Great suites, nice grounds, and a good beach\u201d", "Author": "SilkyRichmond", "ReviewID": "UR84851680", "Content": "Overview: Pro`s - Great suites, awesome beach, luxury feel. Con`s - Pricey for ocean view rooms. Check-In: * Upon arriving at the Kea Lani, you definitely are greeted with a feeling of luxury. The lobby is very nice and we were given leis (kukui nuts for me and real flowers for the wife). While I was at the desk, my wife was also offered a cool glass of pog. They were nice touches and an enjoyable start to your stay. * We had booked an ocean view under the renovation rate and were advised they had upgraded us to a deluxe ocean view. I asked the clerk to show me on the hotel grounds map where the room would be and was shown a nice room on the 6th floor facing directly out to the ocean. Room: * The room was very nice and had a fantastic view. The balcony is huge and has sliding doors to it from both the living and bedroom spaces. * Rooms are a good size (around 900 square feet) and are set up in a neat square pattern. You enter into a little foyer that has a wet bar area and fridge. Off to the side is a door to a big bathroom and directly ahead is the living space. The living space then connects to a bedroom that can be closed off and you can also access the bathroom from the bedroom. Feels like a little apartment. * Our room had a nice big couch and desk in the living space. Desk was handy since I had to do a bit of work on my trip (yes I know, very lame). Good size tv`s in both the living space and bedroom. * Bathroom was also very nice with double sinks, big bathtub, water closet, and a nice open shower area. Pool: * Only the adult pool was open as the other pool was being renovated. This made it pretty tough to find space unless you got down there fairly early. But they did set lots of chairs and cabanas elsewhere around the grounds whcih was good. * The pools are set quite far away from the beach area which is a bit disappointing. Some other resorts do have them set a little closer which feels nicer. Beach: * Beach was very good and has a secluded feel to it. As all pools were not open, they were providing beach umbrellas and chairs at no charge. Beach attendants would set them up for you and place a clip with your name on them. You could leave, but if you didn`t return in about an hour or so, they would be recycled to someone else. It was a good system and it was nice to see the attendants being diligent to keep tabs on use. Too bad they didn`t also enforce this system up at the pool. * Also was nice that they were not charging to sign out boogie boards and snorkel equipment. Parking: * Parking lot did fill up later in the evening, but we were always able to find a spot. This was very convenient and it made it easy to zip into Kihei or down to the Shops at Wailea for dinner without having to worry about not being able to find a spot. Food: * Places are pricey, but its Wailea and a Fairmont and is expected. But the little cafe does have decent prices on some very good sandwiches. Conclusion: * We loved the hotel. Your room feels very cozy and like a little home away from home. * We definitely would recommend this hotel to a friend. We would even consider returning and staying in a non-view room where you are still getting a good sized room at a fair price on a luxury resort. ** See my reviews of Hotel Wailea and Westin Maui for comparatives", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Fe, NM", "Title": "\u201cStill a Crown Jewel\u201d", "Author": "Rannynm", "ReviewID": "UR84807316", "Content": "This was my first stay at this all suite luxury hotel that is undergoing quite a bit of renovation this fall - starting with the pool and extending to all its rooms. The renovation was definitely needed and will make a great improvement in this already great property. It's difficult to compete with the extraordinarily excellent service at a Fairmont hotel and the Kea Lani is right up there. People remember your name, what you like and don't like. It's almost like staying at a small boutique hotel. We loved our room. Having a suite is always a pleasure and this one comes with a small kitchen area as well which we took advantage of, stocking up on wine and munchies so that we could enjoy those on our balcony at sunset before venturing out for dinner each evening. The only small complaint I might have was that the carpet seemed quite tired and I understand that it is the one thing they are not changing in the remodel - a mistake in my eyes. I loved the double closets, the separate shower and bath. My partner disliked the bed. He is fussier than I and found it lumpy and uncomfortable. In terms of location, Wailea offers a traveler a first rate experience. There are no condos there unless they are privately owned so there isn't a lot of tourist traffic in, out and around them. I love the \"boardwalk\" pathway that extends along the beach in front of all the other hotel properties. It's a great place for a morning run or walk. Food at the hotel was pretty good - better than most hotel food but we preferred to get out to other restaurants not hotel owned most of the time.

We booked online and got the renovation sale price of $189.00 a night. When we got to the front desk at 6:00pm (after our flight landed) we were told that the hotel was very busy because of the sale. We mentioned that it was our honeymoon (even though we mentioned it during the reservation process) and the attendant told us we were very lucky to be staying at the hotel for that price. I felt very patronized by the comment and didn't appreciate it. We were put into the lowest level room facing a street that is noisy and were disappointed. She said that given our rate, we didn't qualify for any upgrade or view. The Fairmont did nothing to recognize us as honeymooners and we felt slighted and insulted. The room itself is very nice with a separate bedroom and a bathroom that is just as big as the bedroom. Yes, the furniture is slightly dated, but it's very charming and clean. Hawaii is not a modern place and the bamboo/rattan furniture is definitely part of the experience! The mini-fridge and microwave are essential. Make sure to stop at the Safeway grocery store to stock up on drinks and lunch. They have the best prices for food on Maui. WiFi is offered for $15 a day and there is a DVD player in each room. The bed was very comfortable and having a separate bath/shower was convenient. The Breakfast buffet is $25.00 per person and is very good. I would suggest going once at least. There are omelettes, eggs benedict, breakfast meats, pastries, fruit etc. The only other place we ate at was Ko and it was marvellous. We really enjoyed our dinner there are the 3 course menu at $39 is a very good deal for what you get. Maui is notoriously expensive for meals and I found the restaurants in the area to be quite pricey. Going into the town of Lahaina for dinner gives you some more options if you don't want to pay $40 a plate. The beach is beautiful and there are very helpful attendants available to help you set up umbrellas and chairs. There is also some snorkelling equipment and boards for rent as well. These are all complimentary and are a great added value to the hotel. There are plenty of umbrellas and chairs to accommodate everyone. Overall, Wailea is a beautiful location at the Kea Lani offered us a great room. That said, I would not have paid more than I did for the experience I had. I would have been disappointed had we spent more.

It was really great, and certainly met if not exceeded all my expectations. We got a great room rate/car rental/daily breakfast pkg since they were renovating pools. I was a little concerned bc I thought two pools would be open but only one was open when we arrived, but in the end it worked out bc we actually spent more time out and about at other beaches rather than at the resort pool. As a little bonus, the second (lower-lagoon) pool opened the day before we left so we had a 2 days to enjoy the newly renovated larger pool + keiki pool. Nice to have cold towels and fresh pineapple slices served to you at the pool, too! We traveled w/ a 16 month old, which is why I chose the FKL over others in Wailea area --- suite w/ mini kitchenette! You definitely get alot of bang for your buck at this luxury resort. I wouldn't call it \"5\" star-luxury, but certainly 4, if not 4 and 1/2. The staff is really exceptional, from the front-desk, to bell, to valet and housekeeping. The housekeeping was terrific at maintaining our room 2x daily and providing us w/ extra towels (also daily) since we had 3 adults in the room. Nice comfy beds and the bathroom is \"gi-normous!!\" My son also had a chance to feed the koi fish one morning, which was really neat. Kids just love that! Also, \"keiki\" under 5 eat for free at most of the restaurants. The staff refers to you by name, which is nice and personable. The front desk gave us a little \"Keiki Lani\" sand bucket w/ shovel for my son, which turned out to be his best souvenir from the trip. I really didn't come across any rude staff during our stay. Everyone was extremely nice and accommodating. I really liked that they would always ask, \"is there is anything else we can help you with, Mrs.....?\" and they actually were sincere about it!! The resort never felt crowded, though it was \"a full house\". I believe it was because a couple of floors were closed off (renovations?) so, it was still at only half capacity. We had an ocean-view room on the 3rd floor were we had awesome views of the sunset everyday. There was noise daily (except Sun) bc they were working on the upper-lagoon pool, but since we spent most of our day away from the room, it wasn't really a problem for us. Polo Beach is nice, though small. We actually didn't spend time there (waves were too big for our little one) even though rental equipment was free. We visited Ulua Beach down the street in Wailea, and drove all the way out to Napili Bay Beach two times bc we find this beach w/ golden sand and crystal blue waters quintessentially, \"Hawaiian.\" In comparison to other Wailea hotels: we stayed at the Grand Wailea on our honeymoon and really enjoyed it, but at that time (in 2008 - early recession) it was not crowded, so it was FAB. However on this trip, the GW it was a \"zoo.\" We walked over to the GW from FKL via the nature path (about 20-25 min walk) and it was just swarming w/ people, there wasn't an empty chair near the pool, it was loud and hectic. It more resembled a Las Vegas resort in the summertime, which I don't look for when I visit Hawaii. I guess that's why people like the FKL. It's more serene than the GW, and better priced than FS. We really enjoyed the breakfast buffet, which was included in our package for two adults. Even though we paid for the 3rd adult, it still turned out to be a better deal than eating out breakfast every morning plus is SUPER-convenient. The buffet has everything you can want for breakfast and the fresh guavas and pineapple were amazing! So are the juices. Some reviews below have complained about \"the birds\"...which yes, are a bit of annoyance. But by day two we learned to cover our food w/ a napkin anytime we got up to go to the buffet and our food was fine. All in all, the poolside breakfast buffet was still and nice experience for us. We didn't eat at any Nick's or KO, which I now regret. The Ciao deli is overpriced, as expected. We ate out in Kihei (tons of reasonably priced eateries/restaurants ----- Cafe O'Lei has great food for decent prices), and at the Shops at Wailea. Also, Joe's at Wailea Tennis Club is great. The free laundry machines were very helpful if you are staying for several days. Parking is a bit of a pain (ridiculously small spaces and very hardly any aisle). However, I remember that was also a problem for us at the GW. They do give you complimentary valet for the first day. Overall, I felt that the positives far outweighed the drawbacks. I did not experience any \"nickel and diming\" as a result of the renovations, beach umbrellas/ beach gear were free. I also had no need for internet, which is extra (I had a tech-free vacay!) If you need to print out your boarding pass, they will let you do it for free at the business center. Bottom line is: I feel I got what I paid for!!! Would definitely come back! PROS: - NO resort fees, - NO extra-person fees IF less than 4 people/room. - mini-kitchenette, HUGE bathroom/suite - amazing location - polite, accommodating staff, great service - peaceful, not crowded. - nice pools, well-kept grounds - they offer a \"hospitality suite\" to use for approx 1 hour CONS: - internet is not free, unless you have presidents club, which is free AFTER your first stay at any Fairmont.", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cBig disappointment\u201d", "Author": "zoepoe_10", "ReviewID": "UR83768570", "Content": "The Fairmont is renovating and it can't be soon enough.

However, after my stay as a guest, I wish I had not wasted my money on the Fairmont. I prefer a \"luxury resort\", but in this case, a condo in Kihei or a hotel in Lahaina would have been comparable in terms of the quality of the rooms. And they would have been a FRACTION of the cost. The only thing that sets this place apart from regular hotels or condos in Maui is the lobby. I admit it is grand and beautiful. The pool is pretty too, but I'm not one to travel to Maui to stay in the resort pools. So everything beyond the lobby was extremely dissapointing. Parking: I have to stress that the parking lot is ridiculous. This resort is not cramped for square footage, but the Kea Lani parking lot is structured as if Fairmont couldn't afford to give it's guests one more inch of turning radius in the lane to park into a narrow door ding causing stall. Every time we drove back to the resort at the end of another fabulous day exploring and relaxing and having fun, the parking lot would just annoy the living daylights out of me. You have to shoe horn your car in. For the lack of a better word, it's just lame. It's so cheap feeling for this supposed \"luxury resort\", an complete indication of how Fairmont cuts corners. Rooms: A few minutes after we checked into our room, we realized that our bar area was swarming with ants. I called the front desk and instead of offering to switch us to another room, she promptly said she would send up housekeeping and ended the call. Okay, fine. We'll try that first. Maintenence comes up with a can of bug spray and a cloth and sprays the entire entry of our room and wipes up. Except now, our room is full of fumes and smells so strongly of bug spray, it's making me feel sick. I had both balcony doors open and the wind was strong, but still, the fumes were stronger. I asked the guy if ants is a problem in every room, and he said yes, \"this side of the hotel has ants, but that side doesn't\". So I called front desk and told her about the fumes, and she curtly says (words seem nice, but tone was rude with annoyance), \"What would you like me to do about that??...Would you like to leave the rooom while the smell dies down?\" I said, \"No, can you just switch us to a new room on the other side of the hotel where there are no ants?\" She says she'll check and call me back. While I was pacing around the room waiting for her call back, I realized how dirty the room was. The floor was unvaccuumed for I don't know how long - it had an extremely thick coat of dust. There were dead moths by the balcony door. The hamper in the bathroom had a bunch of toe nail clippings in there - DISGUSTING. The room is not luxurious. The furniture and decor are old. The bathroom grout is cracked all over. The shower fixture is something you would find in a motel. Breakfast Buffet: The breakfast buffet area is swarming with birds. The guy at the table next to us said it best. \"You feel like you're in an Alfred Hitchcock movie.\" There were birds perched all around all the guests just waiting for someone to get up so literally ten or more of them can land on your plates and peck at your food. It's gross and very UNSANITARY. These birds are fearless and will sometimes even go for it while you are sitting there eating. We, as well as other guests, were constantly keeping watch for them and shooing them away. The waiters aren't fast enough for the birds, so throughout our meals, we witnessed tables next to us covered with them as soon as the people left to get more food before the waiters could remove the plates. Granted these are wild birds that the restaurant has no control over (is it unlawful to put up some kind of a bird detracter?), but it makes for a very unpleasant dining experience for the guests, and I don't see the hotel doing anything to change it. The grounds: The grounds need maintenence! The signs around the pools and jacuzzis are all faded and barely legible. The walkways and steps around the pools are dirty, cracked and unmaintained. The outer walls of the villas need to be pressure washed and coated with new paint. The \"luxury\" villas currently look like apartments in a developing nation. I would definitely NOT call this a \"luxury resort\". It might have the facade of one (the lobby), but after my stay as a guest, I very quickly found otherwise.

Hawaiian hospitality did not disappoint! Service Having just returned from Maui this past weekend, the experience was synonymous with Fairmont's high level of service. The service at the Kea Lani was similar to the Fairmont Masai Mara's ~ which has become my benchmark service experience. Being greeted by friendly and genuine valet and bell staff offering leis and a cool mango-guava concoction sets the tone for your stay. Details are not missed including a mini tour of the facility when you're brought to your room, as well as an extensive overview of the room's amenities and features. The staff we interacted with were 99% friendly and those we encountered more than once had excellent guest recognition, always greeting us by name asking specific questions about our day. Although this detail is somewhat expected at a resort of this caliber, the conversations were genuine and caring, unlike some other resorts whose staff just ask to ask, and don't care about the response. Grounds The grounds and buildings' Arabian-like architecture are stunning. Large grassy areas and strategic placement of the hotel's main structure and pools make for an expansive sense of space. Three pools offer kids and adults separate 'play' areas and the beach is just the right size with waves the perfect 'family' size for body boarding and other ocean activities. Included Most resorts in Maui charge resort fees, but Fairmont does not. Everything is included, from self-parking (first night free valet), to morning yoga, to beach umbrellas to guided outrigger canoeing. Renos Currently the resort is going through extensive renovations to all three pools and guest rooms. They finished the adult pool renos during my stay and I was among the first guests to indulge in the refreshed pool area. The renos don't make the pool look much different, but the new quartzite stones surrounding the area are lovely and don't heat up in the sun. Other Hints & Tips: - A lot of people complain about the hotel's internet charge. FYI - the Fairmont's free-to-join guest loyalty program offers members free internet access at any of their hotels and resorts worldwide, take the 3 mins to join to avoid paying $14.95 per day. - Yes, the food at the resort is expensive...but you're staying at a Fairmont Resort, what did you expect? There is a Safeway a 5-min drive away, the resort's cafe offers a host of sit-in or grab-and-go items and the Shops at Wailea (1-min drive from resort) has an ABC store and Whaler's General Store/Cafe with lots of food. The poolside bar's food is decent but not great (believe it or not, the Marriott's poolside bar has way better, fresher food). - The Kea Lani is an all-suite hotel (each rooms sleeps at least 4) with the opportunity to partition the spaces. Yes, the decor in the rooms is not the freshest out there, but they are renovating.... - Apparently, there are 5 complimentary washers and dryers at the hotel.... - The Fairmont's complimentary transportation/shuttle service (within Wailea) is such a fantastic perk (available at most fairmonts). We were driven to and from dinner every night. - The poolside cabanas cost between $75 - $100 to rent daily (include water, spritzer, pop, fruit, magazine...)", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "2", "Service": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LA", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel needs a Total Renovation\u201d", "Author": "cranstongoodfellow", "ReviewID": "UR82170692", "Content": "I belong to the Fairmont President's Club; we stayed here not only because of that but because this property is one of only three in Wailea: the Grand Wailea (huge, many crazy pools and slides; maybe fun if you have kids - we don't); the Four Seasons: lovely, a little LA, but newly renovated and very nice) and then the Fairmont. While the Fairmont is technically the newest of the three properties, it has not been renovated since being built in the 80's, and it REALLY needs it. To their credit, Fairmont is renovating the pools as we speak - we booked an enormous, corner suite with an amazing ocean view and huge terrace for half price because of the renovations. But even the savings was not enough to make up for the general dumpiness of the hotel. The location is by far the best of the three hotels; it's the last in the row with sweeping grounds, large trees (some sort of pine, weirdly) and a lovely large beach - gorgeous. But the hotel is just so in need of sprucing (walking in the dark, cavernous halls was like being in a large concrete parking garage) that I cannot at this point recommend it. And even when they do upgrade it, the suite I mentioned above looked out over the beach, yes, but also out over the rooftops (hideous brown ones) of some structures below. Whose bright idea was that?

On the beach you can get an umbrella and chairs for no extra cost. My favorite beaches on Maui are not exactly kid-friendly as I prefer the beaches with bigger waves. Now that I have a kid, Polo beach was pretty good for his age (3) because the waves are small. Wailea beach is probably even better for kids since the outside reef keeps the water still but Polo beach is not crowded at all (which I hate about Wailea beach) so it is great to just get a chair and watch your kid play in the sand or play with your kid in the waves.

My only requirement was that I wanted to relax under an umbrella on the beach. We also wanted our 3 children to be comfortable and to be guaranteed a room close to ours. We found the perfect choice by staying the Fairmont Kea Lani in Maui and opting for a villa. We paid extra to be closer to the ocean and it was worth every cent. We had magnificent views, could hear the roar of the waves to lull us to sleep and could run out to walk along the shore spur of the moment at night. Our villa had two bedrooms, two extremely roomy bathrooms (as large as the bedroom!), a nicely equipped kitchen and living room all situated on two floors. We used the upstairs as the master because it had a very large walk-in closet and had a balcony/lanai. A wonderful bonus included in the villa is a washer and dryer which came in handy so that our family of 5 could always have a fresh bathing suits. The villa has a nice little 'plunge pool' off of the villa's furnished patio. We could have not asked for a better layout for our group! My only complaint about the villa itself is that washer was extremely noisy as if it wasn't in balance but I never got around to call to let management know about it. The beach is simply beautiful. If you want to use an umbrella on the beach you will be charged for it and they need to be reserved in advance (we quickly learned this the first day) but it is well worth this to guarantee that you won't be disappointed - if they were free they would go immediately I'm sure. You are also charged for any 'rentals' such as snorkels or boogie boards. I would have really liked it if they had had a bar set up near the beach because there were many times I would have liked a frosty drink but that is a small complaint. There a couple of pools - one large and noisy one for families (we never used it) and one quiet one for adults (our older girls used it in the afternoon when the wind picked up on the beach). One thing we really loved was this Caffe Ciao Deli on the property because you could dash in and get something to take out and even purchase items only found in gourmet markets. It was definitely an upscale deli! We ate breakfast on the property every day in the restaurant and it was delicious although the service was slow if you opted to order off of the menu instead of using the buffet. We could have saved money and cooked in our kitchen but really one of the perks of having a vacation is to not cook and to eat out every day. We did find out that if we had dirty dishes in our villa that the cleaning staff did them for us - a lovely surprise! We visited other properties (including the Grand Wailea and Four Seasons) on the island for dinner and always congratulated ourselves on really having found the best place to stay. It is a visually stunning hotel and the grounds are impeccably maintained. The staff was always courteous and helpful - I got the sense that they really cared about our comfort. We saw several weddings performed while we were there and honestly this is a wonderful destination wedding venue.

The plunge pool worked great for our 3 year old, and the older kids had easy access to the beach and pool. * The selection of restuarants and shops were really great.

Cons: * The free lounges by the pool get snatched up by jerks who put there stuff down and then leave for hours at a time.

The cleaning crew did an awesome job each day. The adult pool was very comfortable -- great place to read a book all day. The beach is wonderful -- clean, roomy, etc. We pretty much avoided the on site restaurants due to excessive cost, but loved the cafe for easy takeout. A few tips: 4 pm by the adult pool is half price appetizers but ends very quickly. Definitely sign up for Presidents Club before you go and ensure it's noted on your reservation -- if even for the free wifi. If your rental car is bigger than mid-size, self parking will be a challenge due to stall sizes and very narrow lane. All in all, the Kei Lani is very comfortable with touches of lux, a great value.

The lobby is impressive and the staff polite and helpful. The cafe/deli is a godsend for families as it sells fresh milk, single-serve cereal and other basics so that you can cater in-room for breakfasts and lunches. The microwave in the room is also excellent - we often had take-out from the Ko restaurant or the deli and were able to warm it up for our son the next day. The pool options are great especially for a long stay and it was nice to know that there was an adult pool option for those who wanted some time away from the families.

I will review the hotel and share some tips on how we made our trip economical but with touches of luxury. The reasons I chose Kea Lani over other locations was the 1 bedroom suite (separate living room from bedroom - a little privacy from the kids at times), it's price ($340/night), and it's location being in Wailea (upscale and quiet). The Kea Lani definitely has a very impressive entrance and lobby/terrace area. We were greeted with leis and in addition my children received beautiful necklaces. We booked a garden moderate room which did happen to have a partial view of the ocean and mountains ($340/night). There is a refrigerator and microwave in the suite. We also purchased (next time I will just pack it) a single burner and skillet (purchased from ACE Hardware) and food from Safeway. The hotel suites are in line to be updated the end of August. Presently they are tastefully decorated in a green/mauve color scheme. The new decor will be more of an earthy color scheme. Everything was very comfortable with our unit. The cleaning crew did a wonderful job of cleaning every day and also stopped in for a turn down service in the evening. My only gripe would be our socks did get dirty from the carpet. My husband and son's gripe was that we did not have wifi for their iphones...they said you would need a room closer to the lobby. We did bring a laptop and the internet was $14.95/day. The large balcony was a nice plus as we enjoyed many meals overlooking the beautiful views of Maui. There are 5 complimentary washers/dryers at the Kea Lani which I did utilize several times (you do need soap which can be purchased at the hotel or Safeway for $1.50 for a small box of Tide). We always had breakfast in the room, except for one day enjoying the breakfast buffet for $100 for our family. We had lunch in the room as well unless we were on traveling trips to Haleakala (ate at Kula Inn - great views and reasonably priced) or Hana. We made dinner in our room as well except for 3 nights. Those nights we ate at Matteo's Italian restaurant ($75/for our family and we had dessert - outside with great views looking over the golf course), picked up great baked chicken and pulled pork and avocado sandwiches at the Whalers General Store at the Shops of Wailea, and ordered pizza (Dominios - Delivered to the hotel - not my favorite but the kids loved it!). We also enjoyed the ice cream waffle cones at one of the Kea Lani stores and at Lammperts (sp?) at the Shops of Wailea. The pools were very nice and my children enjoyed the water slide. We didn't use the pools but 2 days since we have a pool and water slide at home - so we were more into the beach. We brought our own snorkling equipment which we used at Wailea Beach and saw many fish and a very large turtle, and lots of coral. The surf at both the Polo and Wailea Beach were fun for the kids to use their boogie boards and ride the waves. It was convenient to park your car yourself if you didn't utilize valet parking. We enjoyed many evenings sitting in the lobby overlooking the pools and ocean and listening to a fantastic guitarist and had a drink (about $15/drink). If you like to walk, there is a wonderful paved walking path between the ocean and the resorts that extends from the Kea Lani passed the Shops at Wailea.

After considering the Four Seasons, the Grand Wailea, we decided to try the Kea Lani as a compromise - not as expensive as the former, and not as humongous as the latter. That is what it turned out to be. There were some concerns because some reviewers noted lines for the pool and the drab furniture. On the furniture, the reviews were right -- some of the furniture was drab and could use some remodelling, but the fact is for a beachside resort, it appears they need furniture that would last all the sand and seawater that guests would bring to the room. Overall the suites were adequately appointed and there was no disappointment. The room had a small sink, microwave and empty fridge, which was great for my son which allowed us to keep all his food in the small kitchenette area. One minor issue is that the beds appear to be exceedingly high. My 4 year old son sleeps Asian-style on the floor so it took him a bit to adjust to the high beds (after some unfortunate falls). The pools are great. There are generally three pool areas and during the times we went for a swim, it was not excessively crowded. There is a great water slide, but they didn't allow my son to ride it as he was too young. Breakfast was included in our rate and so we had the breakfast buffet every morning at the same restaurant. Not much variation between different days in terms of food offering, which made breakfast not necessarily something one looked forward to. Generally I spent the five nights at the Fairmont thinking that something would come up that would make me regret not having booked at the Four Seasons next door. Thankfully, nothing of the sort happened, and so I am relieved. A close call happened during check out when the lady at the front desk was apparently having some difficulties with the computer system and apparently triple charged my card for the same USD 800 for my room tab. Thankfully, the manager, a Mr, Matt Smith, stepped in an assured me that the matter would be settled after I left and that he would check with the hotel's bank to make sure that I was properly charged. I have now returned home and checked with my credit card company and it turns out all the false charges have been deleted. I think if the charges were incorrect, this review would have turned out to be very different. The only detraction of note was that on the second day of our stay, my wife reported cockroaches in the room (I have to say I never saw any). She duly reported this to housekeeping and neither she nor I saw any cockroaches thereafter. On the plus side, the Kea Lani has a couple of Lincoln Navigators parked out front, which are used as shuttles to the nearby Shops at Wailea and hotels around there.

The Fairmont Kea Lani is a nice enough property, though clearly it is a refurb of some other hotel chain (given \"Kea Lani Hotel\" is still stamped on the sliding doors). The lobby is beautiful, as were the spacious bathrooms and the grounds in general. The valet/car service/bell staff were equally wonderful as well. Now for the not-so-goods: 1) The rooms are just a tad dated; not what I expected given we were a) in the prestigious Wailea area and b) this was The Fairmont! 2) We seemed to have a minor issue with little mosquito/gnat thingies in our room. Possibly due to being oeanside (well, at least partially)? 3) The food at Ko unremarkable, though the price is quite remarkable, if-you-know-what-i-mean! 4) $10/hr for a beach umbrella - from what I hear, all the resorts do this, so guess I can't whine too much; but, please, just up my daily rate to cover this cost...what is this daily resort fee for? 5) Water - looks like it used to be complimentary (emphasis on the \"used to be\") 6) When we asked about a late checkout, we were told \"Sure, it's $150 to stay until 3p\" \"Any other options?\" \"No, so sorry, no other options\"...Really? I wasn't born yesterday. Of course, we asked someone else and they secured an hour extra for us for no charge 7) Day 3: Wake-up call at 5am. \"Uhh...I think you have the wrong room; we didn't ask for this wake-up call!\" \"Oh, okay, please disregard!\" Please disregard? Can someone please tell me how to DISREGARD a 5am wake-up call??? 8) My personal favorite. I had a raging headache, so called the front desk to see if they had any aspirin/ibuprofen. \"Yes, we sure do, but it's only for emergency purposes. Now is this a REAL emergency, or are you just looking for some aspirin?\" What the...?! Did she think I was on a recreational scavenger hunt for aspirin?!

My wife and I traveled to the Kea Lani on a wedding package and we were married at the resort. There were two nights in a deluxe oceanview suite included in the package, and we also purchased an additional three nights at the hotel in a lower room category. Upon our arrival, we were cheerfully greeted and given leis. We were upgraded to the deluxe oceanview suite at no extra cost and without even asking. The suite was nicely decorated and very roomy. The bathroom was just wonderful, with a large marble walk in shower and garden tub. The bed was extremely comfortable and the sheets of high quality. There was a flat screen LCD television in the living room of the suite but only an older box television in the bedroom. A small refrigerator and microwave were also in the room. I thought the furniture in the room was of good quality, however the patio furniture was extremely cheap. I would have thought that a hotel the caliber of the Kea Lani would invest in better patio furniture. The service that we received from all of the hotel's staff members was excellent, from the bell staff, to the courtesy car chauffeur, to our wedding coordinator. It was customary for the employees to greet you with an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aloha\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when you walked past them in the halls or on the grounds. Speaking of the grounds, they were picturesque and very nicely manicured. In all, a great location to have a wedding. I especially liked the adults only pool, as I don't much care for being around screaming children splashing all over the place when I'm trying to relax. The pool chairs were comfortable and staff members routinely walked around to take drink orders and bring by cups of water (and pineapple). At the beach there is an attendant who sets up your chairs for you. I also liked the relative privacy of Polo Beach. It is not connected to the main Wailea beach, and although all beaches on Maui are public it does not seem as crowded as Wailea beach. My wife was very impressed with the staff and the quality of her bridal hairdo that she received at the Juvenal hair salon at the hotel. The pacific terrace was a beautiful place for a wedding and the staff was great during the cocktail reception that we had following the ceremony. Nick's Fishmarket was where we had our reception dinner, and everything there was also excellent (I'm posting a separate review of Nick's as well). The worst part about staying at the Kea Lani was having to leave. I would suggest anyone thinking about staying at the resort to join Fairmont's free President's Club, which gets you things during your stay such as complimentary internet access and use of golf clubs (which rent for about $50 at the local courses in Maui). I know that a lot of people compare the Kea Lani to the Four Seasons, and I'm not sure that it's really a fair comparison. A comparable room at the Four Seasons is about double the rate at the Kea Lani, so it's understandable that you're going to get more for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd such as cabanas and beach umbrellas.

There are also areas of the property like the lanai's (terraces) that are not as clean as they could be but.... Having said all of that we had an OUTSTANDING time at this property. I Loved the room, our view (a garden view overlooking the whole property plus a view of the ocean from the terrace), the amount of space between the living room, extra closets, huge bathroom, snack bar area. The grounds were immaculate, the 3 pools were perfectly set up - the kiddie pool was great although the Grand Wailea kiddie pool with sand tops this one. Polo beach was so clean, the lounges, the awesome main lobby, the 1.5 mile walking path - I could go on about the property. Every person on the staff was excellent from the point of check in to check out. We traveled with our 23 month old daughter and I reserved a pack and play and would you believe it was in our room fully set up when we arrived - if you travel with children you know this is not always the case. They even set up a diaper genie! There were no early morning cleaning service experiences where you have to ask them to come back, in fact they cleaned our room at 6pm one evening by our request. When we checked out not only did they allow us to stay until 2pm (our flight was leaving at 9pm) but they offered a hospitality suite to use while we stayed on the property for showering/changing once we checked out. The Concierge team was amazing in knowing not only the basics of sights to see but they really catered to our specific interests in traveling with a toddler. It was truly a peaceful oasis, beautiful property with outstanding service. Having visited the 4 seasons and Grand Wailea while there, no question the Faimont was the best choice for us. I would give this place a 5 but they honestly should upgrade a few elements to be considered a 5. Finally Wailea was also a good choice for us but it is definitely out of the way from most off property restaurants and other towns.

Our last visit just a over month ago. We have stayed in Ocean front suites, partial ocean view suite, the 2 bedroom Ocean Front Villa and twice in the pool \"walk out\" suites. All the rooms are suites with large bathrooms and a decent bedroom and a living room with pull out couch. Our kids all sleep together on the pull out and they are totally happy with that. Now we are \"sold\" on the pool walk out rooms and will not stay in any other room. We usually take another family or extended family and have them stay in a suite there too. The walk out to pool rooms are \" Specialty Rooms\" and they sell out very quickly. In my opinion they are the best for families like us with little kids. My kids are 9, 6, 4 and 5 months. So \"technically\" one of us is in another suite. This is our favorite hotel in Maui. It is comfortable and in a beautiful location and the beach is right out your door. Literally, if you stay in a Villa or a walk out room. More later about why we prefer the walk out over the Villa. The hotel has a fabulous views from the lobby. Like a postcard beautiful. The minute you get there you feel good. They give you a lei and a cold drink. And an warm Aloha welcome. OK.. so the low down.. as I put it. The Good, The Bad and The Ugly: The good: I love this beach! It has never been crowded even when the pool is packed the beach seems to never have too many people on it. You can walk from the hotel and especially the rooms I mentioned above. This is the best part. You walk on some grass down a cement path down about 15 stairs and Volia! Sand! It's heaven! The pool is not huge like some of the other hotels in Maui. We like that. It isn't small either. I call it manageable. I feel like my kids can go down the water slide and run, um I mean walk back up the stairs and I can feel like they are not going to get lost. There is a swim up bar and the same staff seems to have worked there forever. All super friendly and super kind to the kids. The restaurants have excellent food, but I prefer to eat with a view while in Hawaii and none of themon site have much of a view. Nick's Fish Market has wonderful service but your view is of the pool. I think a peek a boo of the ocean. I would go there when it's dark out so you can see all the tiki torches lit up all around the property. That makse it pretty. If you go at Sunset it is not worth it. But it is fun to be outside at sunset because a man runs around and light the tikis. He is hawiann and clad in a little get up and that would be it. the kids love it. He literally runs from tiki to tiki with a torch in hand. Like a pied piper with a bunch of little kids chasing him. The other restaurant is called Co. Good food, stinky view, outdoor cafe style with very uncomfortable chairs and wobbly tables. However, excellent service. The breakfast is actually in another area. Again, decent food. Average buffet but no view. Lot's of little birds fly around because it is open. Watch your plate! Lastly there is a store cafe with pizza parlor. It stinks. Plan to eat at the overpriced buffet unless you want to eat off property. Eating off property means rounding up all the kids, car seats and stroller.. so we grin and bear the \"no view\" for breakfast and lunch. Oops... almost forgot there is a small restaurant by the pool. Food is ok but limited menu. It gets \"old\" fast. Like one day and you are done with that food. The kids of course think it is super cool to eat food at the swim up bar and will order a million smoothies if you don't stop them. Waliea has a ton of good restaurants so the concierge can help you get a table at Serrento's on the Beach (Nick's sister restaurant) or Five Palms for breakfast. Also fun to walk to nearby hotels. The food at Four Seasons is good food, but again I don't like the views. A fun and beautiful view restaurant is Humuhumunukunukuapua'a at the Grand Waliea. I would not eat at the shops of Waliea unless you are there shopping and happen to be hungry. We like Tommy Bahama's restaurant when we shop. Every one raves about the restaurant downstairs \"Longies\" but after several tries we prefer Tommy's. Cheese Burger in Paradise is another restaurant at the Shops (a few blocks from the hotel) and every time we have had poor service there. The bad: Hate to say it but the rooms need updating. This is not a huge factor for us so we really don't care that the room looks the same year after year. They did repaint the lobby recently though. lol Restaurant service is excellent but all other service is pretty average. The spa is not luxurious at all. If you want to Spa.. stay at the Grand or even The Four Seasons. The shopping in the hotel very limited and not fun. The Ugly: The time we stayed in the beachfront Villa was well.. so bad I can't write about it or you might not want to stay at this hotel. It was gross. I forgive them for the unclean, broken down, stinky ( I mean it) Villa because they made it up to us. Don't they get it that anyone paying for a Villa expects it to be really luxurious? I would rather sleep in a hut (minimal and simple with no phone and no TV yet \"Clean\") at Kona Village then these smelly Villas. We stayed away from the hotel for quite a while and then came back for another try and now we are hooked on the \"walk out to pool suites\" which really are walk out to pool and run to the beach rooms. So since the hotel made it right after a disaster week in the Villa. We still love this hotel. They should just tear down the Villas and redo them. Really they should. It would be nice if they gave all the other rooms a face-lift too. Ok.. there you go! Have fun and don't forget the Sunblock. They ran out at the store of the kind we like (spray on) and they don't have many choices for diapers or wipes so stock up. The ABC store at the \"shops down the road\" doesn't have good diapers or wipes either so bring more than enough! Ok.. good enough. Book it now.. but save a \"walk out to pool\" Suite for me!", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena", "Title": "\u201cMy worst hotel choice in many years of world travel\u201d", "Author": "teachgeron", "ReviewID": "UR66346664", "Content": "Stayed for three nights in May. There to celebrate my daughters fortieth birthday. Problems began at check in when staff person indicated we were booked into a suite with king bed when I had reserved two double beds. Problems occur all the time in life but it is how they are handled which makes the difference. Staff person after much hesitation indicated they could make the \"change\" but could not tell me how long that would take. Her attitude was one of annoyance and unconcern. Took a seat in the lobby and room was available in about 20 minutes. After some touring, returned to room to take a bath only to find that the closure for the tub was not working. Spoke to Elise at front desk who presented with annoyed attitude and reluctantly offered to send maintenance person. Declined this offer and requested a change of room. After some time the room was changed which was quite interesting since the hotel was far from fully booked. My basic review of this hotel can be summed up by The Good, The Bad and the Ugly. 1. The Good - Beautiful physical structure, luscious grounds, lovely pools. There is free self parking on site within close walking distance. The layout of the suite is excellent, microwave and refrigerator are an asset. The bathroom had been renovated and had a great soaking tub, two facebowls, plentiful towels, very nice bathrobes. The furniture on the balcony is adequate for watching the beautiful ocean view. The beach is wonderful and very private. 2. The Bad - The hotel seems to be living on past reputation. All of the furniture in the rooms and the public areas are old and seedy looking. The electronics should be an embarrassment to The Fairmont business. The televisions are big box, small screen appliances; unbelieveable in 2010. Even moderately priced hotel chains have big screen LCDs. A complete renovation is more than in order. There is no elegance or luxury to this hotel. It is overpriced for what is offered. 3. The Ugly - Except for the bellmen, the staff was not friendly are welcoming. The hotel did nothing to acknowledge my daughter's birthday. We did not feel special, valued or appreciated during our stay. Our visit did not offer the luxury or comfort one would expect from this category of hotel. As a result of my disgust with this hotel, we spent most of our time traveling and spending money throughout the rest of Maui which we enjoyed tremendously. It goes without saying that I would encourage you to look elsewhere if you are seeking a luxury hotel with quality staff and service in Maui.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwalk, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGreat Family Vacation at the Fairmont Kea Lani\u201d", "Author": "Rubybiercans", "ReviewID": "UR65767531", "Content": "We just returned from a wonderful vacation at the Fairmont. We looked into many other hotels on Maui, including some located in Kaanapali and other hotels in Wailea. After walking through the grounds of the Four Seasons and Grand Wailea, we were very pleased to have chosen the Fairmont. As other reviews have noted, the Fairmont's beach is more private (and nearly as big) as the beach in front of the Four Seasons and Grand Wailea. We also preferred the grounds/lobby of the Fairmont, which seemed more relaxed and less \"over the top\" than the two neighboring hotels. A few additional impressions: 1. Service was very good and seemed genuinely friendly without being too much. 2. This is a great choice for families traveling with young children. Our (approximately) 5 year old ate free at most hotel restaurants and spent several days in \"kids camp\" which she loved. There were a number of families traveling with children of a similar age, which was nice for our daughter when she played in the pool and beach. I don't think that the number of children at the hotel would detract from an adult-only vacation - we would be happy to return even if our daughter was not traveling with us. 3. As others have noted, the rooms are quite large and represent a great value compared to other hotels in the area. We were in a Deluxe Ocean View room on the 4th floor and were very happy with the room, the view and the price we paid (through Costco travel). Yes, the decor of the rooms would benefit from some updating, but on the whole the rooms are extremely nice and on par with other luxury hotels that we've visited recently. 4. The grounds and pool are beautiful (lots of shallow areas for kids) and the beach is the best we saw in the area. 5. The hotel's location in Wailea is great - close to many good (but not cheap) restaurants and shopping. In addition to the good restaurant offerings at the Fairmont itself and other hotels in the area, we particularly enjoyed watching the sunset over dinner at Capische and listening to live music on the porch at Mulligan's on the Blue (which had surprisingly good food for an Irish pub). For a less expensive change of pace, one of our best meals of the vacation was at Amigos in Kihei - a modest restaurant in a strip mall with some of the best Mexican food we've had in a long time.

Overall it was a great stay, but like a lot of the previous reviews state, the hotel needs some renovation, it needs to bring back the sparkle! May is a great time to go--the hotel was very quiet, so we were surprised at the high fee for an upgrade. But what was more disappointing was that our honeymooning friends weren't upgraded either. I don't get it--if you want the guests to come back, and the hotel is half full, why can't you upgrade? However--that said, the rooms ARE nice, I'm mainly talking view here. The large suite-style rooms are great, especially useful for families. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. And yes--large bathroom! If we're nit-picking here, yes the rooms could use a freshening-up, the lanai furniture needs to be replaced, and it's time to remove the large TV cabinets and replace them with plasma/LCD's. You can't call yourself a luxury hotel in 2010 and still have box-set televisions. But did I come to Hawaii to watch TV? Nope. A great feature of these rooms is the microwave and refrigerator. Stock up at Safeway before you arrive! Turndown service could be improved--I remember when we stayed the first time we received a treat--chocolate, flower petals, a Hawaiian prayer etc (wasn't a honeymoon or anything) I believe it's the small details which set luxury hotels apart, and it just seemed that some of these details were lacking. Service was great. Not over-the-top Four Seasons great, but still there are some wonderful people who work here and they were always kind and helpful. No problems with housekeeping, they were excellent. Also--there are free washers/dryers, just ask and the front desk will tell you where they're located. They're nothing fancy, but they do the job. We didn't use the concierge. Valet guys are great too. Pools-Three large, clean, beautiful pools. (And I hear they're getting worked on soon?) Great family pool, adult pool, and for those of you who want a swim-up bar, that's there too. Service is good by the pools too. That might be different during high season, but we never had a problem and the staff was efficient. Beach-Great beach. Family-friendly...small waves, great for babies/toddlers. The great thing about this beach is that yes, it's smaller than Wailea Beach next door, but it's isolated from other resorts, no sharing w/other resorts, and the public tends to go to Wailea Beach. It's just as pretty--just not as busy. However, charging hotel guests for a beach umbrella is absurd. The chairs need to be replaced and service at the beach needs an improvement. Not bad--but def not as good as it could be. But it's a beautiful, clean beach., with spectacular views...yes, even sunset views. We had a great meal at Nick's Fish Market. Fantastic service and food was delicious. Buffet breakfast in the morning was fresh and tasty too. Yes the birds are annoying, but try to sit further inside. The hotel's hands are tied because the state protects the birds, there's nothing they can do. But it's not like dozens of pigeons land on your table---the workers shoo them away and it's small birds that usually...usually...wait til you're gone. A bit annoying, yes, but breakfast was delicious. Fitness facilities--Needs improvement. Definitely not up to par for the size and quality of the resort. They need a larger space and newer equipment, cardio machines, yoga space, etc. However, it was clean and everything was functioning well, so it did the job. Just not as good as it should be--like there's no one staffing it, handing you water/towel, cold washcloth, etc. Oh-a note to walkers/runners--the hotel is in a great spot for walks and runs--Wailea is beautiful. Not a busy, touristy area---it's just perfect for a run at dawn, which we did every morning along the ocean path. Other random things: --self park is free! no hidden fees there, and no, it's not a long walk to the hotel. --the pool areas and gardens/ landscaping, etc need some work, but I hear that they are renovating and polishing up those areas. However, the pools themselves don't look like they need work, they were clean and sparkling, so don't think the pools are a dump--I think they're just trying to spruce up the whole area. And in general, the grounds and gardens are stunning, and the workers do a good job of maintaining it! --some reviews noted drab hallways, chipped paint, etc. Yes, this is true--while the structure of the facility is gorgeous--white Grecian-looking, open air lobbies/fountains, etc the halls to the rooms need a freshening-up. But please don't let a less-than-sparkling hallway ruin your vacation, it's hardly noticeable and frankly---just a hallway! --Make sure you join President's club before you leave for your vacation. You get freebies like free in-room internet. -they have paddle board rentals for $40 an hour, $80 for 2 hours w/one hour lesson. We wanted to do this but never got around to it. (they have other rentals too) --there is a good little cafe/sundry shop if you need it. Pricey, yes, but if you want to grab a Corona on the run, a sandwich, or some advil, gelato, or a good cup of coffee...there is a place to do that. We did not bring our 3 small children with us, but we saw many families enjoying their stay--and they were not loud by any means. If you were there on a romantic trip you could easily be far from children at the adult pool area, and the beach is large enough to have your own cozy area to yourself. Because the grounds are so spread out, there are lots of areas to lounge. Overall we had a great stay--no problems at all. But was it over the top? No. A pleasant stay, no real complaints, but it could be better. If they put a lot of TLC into the place and bring the \"Wow\" factor back, and kick the service up a notch, I'd probably stay here again. I prefer the Four Seasons, while my husband is perfectly happy at the Kea Lani. And because we received such a great deal on a package to stay at the Kea Lani, there was little debate...especially if we'd save a few bucks in this bad economy!

We had trouble deciding where to stay (in the end, it was between the Four Seasons and the Fairmont) and I am so glad that we picked the Fairmont. Our room had a deluxe ocean view and was located on the 6th floor. We couldn't have been happier with our view of the resort, pools and ocean. Our suite was roomy, clean and very functional. We could have paid slightly more at the Four Seasons (right next door) for a nicer, more up to date room, but we were glad to have to extra space and a large balcony to spend time on. My only complaint about the room was the bathroom. We had a nice big tub, but no jets and the nice walk-in shower didn't have any type of step or ledge to rest your foot on to shave your legs. (I know, this is petty). The hotel was quiet at night and the staff was all very friendly. Everyone said \"hello\" to you while passing in the hallways and everyone made us feel welcome. The pools were all very nice and not over crowded. There were times when you maybe couldn't sit exactly where you would have liked, but you were never without a chair. The staff at the pools were great - they brought cold water, slices of pineapple and cold washcloths around every so often. We spent the majority of our time at the adult pool which was very relaxing. Breakfast was included with our stay and the buffet was great. The variety of food could please anyone and everything always seemed to be fresh. It was nice to sit pool side and enjoy breakfast every morning. The only drawback of sitting outside was that the birds were pests. It you left your table or plate unattended for only a second, they were eating your food! The staff tried to keep them away, but didn't always get there quick enough. We liked that we could come and go from the hotel as we wished and didn't have to vallet park if we didn't want to. Although the parking lot was a bit of a walk from the hotel and the parking spots were extremely tight, it was nice to not be nickel-dimed with daily vallet charges. There is a deli type restaurant in the hotel which we went to on multiple occasions to get a snack, a sandwich for lunch or even dinner one night. We loved that this was available to get good food that was a little bit more reasonably priced than the hotel restaurants. We felt very at home at the Fairmont and completely loved our trip to Maui. We felt that staying in Wailea was the best spot on the island for us. It was more upscale and not as \"touristy\" as some of the other areas. Other areas of the island can be really windy and Wailea seemd to have great weather when even when it was cooler or windier on other parts.

Once we got passed the front desk, we were onto enjoying the beautiful grounds of the hotel. All the staff, concierge and pool side attendants were quite nice and friendly. We thoroughly enjoyed the pool area and the private beach. The pool area was perfect for our two year old and also fun for us- as we could venture up to the swim up pool bar and enjoy some adult time while my daughter played with her grandma. The resort is expensive-but you should not come to this area if you are not willing to pay. I believe Wailea is a much more upscale area compared to Kihei and Kaanapali. We felt it was worth paying a little more to not feel like we were being overrun by teenagers and millions of kids. We will certainly stay here again and look forward to the updating they will be doing on the rooms this fall. This is the best kept secret in Maui-you could never get a one bedroom suite at the Four Seasons for what you pay at the Fairmont.

You don't have to pay for a pool umbrella, but make sure you reserve one, before you go to breakfast. The pool guys do a really good job and provide you with fresh towels all the time.

It is great to have everyone together including the kids. We spent Saturday and Sunday lounging around the pools, swimming and listening to the humpback whales song underwater (in the ocean) and letting the stress of the last very busy 4 weeks just melt away. On Sunday morning, I rented a kayak and ventured out on the placid ocean hoping for a whale encounter of the close kind :) A mom and baby did come by fairly close to me and it was a thrill. Sea kayaking on sit on top kayaks in the morning hours here is stellar. I had 2 excellent turtle sitings and gave my upper body a good work out (my arms are sore today!).

I know they want people to eat at their restaurants, but these things make my stay more pleasant overall and more likely for me to come back. Check-in was quick and the staff are overall very friendly and attentive. The resort is not cheap to stay at, and lunch generally ran us nearly $100 a day for four (that is simple fare around the pool). Still, the food is good and fresh and if we wanted there were cheaper alternatives out there. We chose to hang out close to home and pay a premium. There was a Christmas buffet that was offered while we were there and it was quite good. Also, Santa arrived by outrigger on the beach and met with all the kids on Christmas Eve. That was a nice touch. This was the first time we used the Keiki Club for our two children (5 and 6) and they loved it. I would have preferred to see a bit more outdoor play, but with lots of kids I can see the rationale for keeping them in a safe and contained environment. This was also quite expensive, but what a wonderful day we parents had lounging in the peace and quiet of the adult pool. Highly recommend. My only real complaint, and honestly it's minor and somewhat petty in light of real problems, is the pool chair system or lack thereof at the resort. If you want you can rent a cabana for an outrageous sum of money, or hang out right next to the cabana in a free-of-charge lounger. However, getting a lounge chair is next to impossible. The official line is that you can't hold chairs and if you do reserve some, you can't hold them for more than two hours unattended. There is nothing more frustrating than taking your kids to the pool for the day and not being able to sit near them when they swim. All around are empty lounge chairs with towels indicating that they are being used. However, they sit empty all day sometimes. We grabbed a couple chairs one day not even realizing someone had \"saved\" them. He and his wife showed up THREE hours after we had been sitting there and demanded we give them back to them. As if they had actually invested any time in using them. I say, first come first serve. If you leave, you forfeit. That should not be a problem if everyone else is under that same system. I would love to have the best seat in the house too, but that only works when you pay for them. Free chairs should be open to all. That, or get some more chairs. At the Four Seasons next door you can stay in a cabana or lounge chairs free of charge - or as free as anything is when you pay the amount of money both hotels charge for a room. I mean for $700+ a day don't you think a lounge chair or cabana should be thrown in for good customer service? I hate being nickel and dimed. Still, don't want to end on a negative.

If you are going to snorkel, try to go south side of the beach and south the rocks where you may have chance encounter with green turtles feeding. Staff is wonderful and attentive. Rooms are clean, although slightly dated. However, the suites are spacious. Beds were wonderfully comfortable. Did not try the restaurants on site as we took advantage of having a rental car and drove to the nearby town of Kihei for all sorts of restaurants. If you like golf, it is close to Wailea and Mekena. Definitely, try Mekena North Course....view is actually much better than Wailea golf course.

If we ever return to this hotel I think I would spring for the ocean view although I don't think my kids would care. The rooms/suites were very roomy and lovely. The bed was extremely comfortable and the housekeeping staff was top notch. They never disturbed us and our suite was always cleaned when we got back and at night the beds were always turned down and room cleaned. The hotel itself is beautiful and well maintained. The staff was very nice and very accomodating. The conciemrge staff was very helpful and there were plenty of them. There are 3 pool areas. One is just adults the other 2 are for all. There were a lot of kids there but it was not a problem. Most were well behaved and having fun. It is a little tricky with the chairs at the pool although there are a lot of chairs. You have to get down at the crack of dawn to scope out a good lounge. Then you put some stuff on them and go to breakfast. They have a 2 hours rule but I never saw that enforced. You could always get a lounge at the beach but umbrellas at the beach cost $45 per day. The pool umbrellas are free but are hard to get and don't really block out the sun. They could use more help at the pool but the workers there are really nice and attentive when they are available. The beach is also very pretty and they keep it very nice. The hotel is expensive so be prepared to spend $$$. The drinks at the pool are a fortune and don't have much alcohol in them. We ate at two of the restaurants at the hotel Ko the first night which was very good and Nicks for New Years eve. Nicks had a priced fix menu with good selections but the price was crazy at it did not include drinks. The food was quite good though. All in all the hotel was great and we would definitely consider staying there again if we go to Maui in the future.

We had a small issue with the room and they upgraded us again when we moved - so we had an ocean and pool-facing room, facing the sunset. We were walking distance from a semi-private beach and very close to Wailea and the shoppes there. The room was a full suite where the bedroom had a separate closed door, and there was a \"living room\" with a couch, chairs, desk. A huge advantage is the wrap around \"lanai\" (balcony) with lots of chairs. In addition, there was a sink and a refrigerator and coffee maker. The bathroom was HUGE and had widely-spaced separate sinks, a walkin shower and a separate tub. The towels were thick and soft, and the pillows were great. The bed was a little harder than I like (I like the top-end Marriott better). The pools were great fun (a separate adult pool) and we had no problem getting chaise lounges. There actually is a swim-up bar in the main / family pool (which some might see as misplaced but having had three kids on vacation before - not this time - I can surely see the need for a drink). I had an outdoor, poolside massage that I would HIGHLY recommend. The rooms were clean and quiet and smelled great and had no mildew issues. We spent so much time on snorkel and beach and shopping trips that we did not take full advantage of the hotel.

The cabanas at the pool cost $75 per day. The location of the adult pool is such that there's basically no shade unless you rent a cabana. The cabanas at the Four Seasons are free, btw. 3) everything's extra - newspaper, wifi access, no courtesy bottles of water. It's well worth the extra $100 for a much better experience. 4) The \"full ocean view\" suites look out at the building across. You see partial ocean from inside the room and more if you're on the balcony. 5) The food is typical terrible hotel/resort fare at pretty high prices. The coffee at the breakfast buffet is litterally undrinkable.

I don't mind paying a higher price tag, but only so long as the quality is there. At the Fairmont Kea Lani, the quality is not there.

We were fortunate to stay in the off-season so the property was not busy and we really felt we had the place to ourselves. Most of the reviews are accurate as to what the hotel offers so here's my take on making the most of a stay at this wonderful property: Arrival/Departure - there are airport shuttles but we recommend you rent a car unless you plan to stay at the Fairmont for the duration of your trip. There's lots to do and see in Maui and I'm told bus service is inconvenient so bite the bullet and rent a car - you'll be happy you did. Rooms - all-suites means every room has a bedroom with seperate living area. I believe all the rooms have sizeable lanais. The layout, amenities, and comfort are amazing. High-speed internet (free for Fairmont Club members) and iPod docking stereo available. If you can afford an ocean-view all the better, but if not, don't worry about it you'll be more comfortable here than going to a lesser property because of the view from a room. Go for it if you can shell-out for a private villa: you only live once! Food - quality and service are top notch, but pricey. All rooms have a fridge so we bought lots of fresh fruit and breakfast/lunch food and took care of most of these meals ourselves. Stop in at Foodland or Safeway in Kihei and remember to get their discount card the first time you're at the till. Big savings. prepare to pay lots for drinks, especially pool-service. We spent most of our time by the beach and took our own booze with us each day. No problem. If you only have 1 meal at Kea Lani make sure you go to Nick's Fishmarket. The other restaurants are excellent but Nick's is world class. Their sister restaurant in Kihei is also delicious: Sorento's on the Beach. Other Maui restaurants to try: Wok Star in Kihei (a wonderful suprise, great red Thai curry), Sansei in Kihei (good sushi), Mama's Fish House in Paia (broke the bank here but worth it - go for lunch not dinner or you'll miss the view.) Activities - the Fairmont offers a weekly schedule of onsite activities. We did yoga 4 days in a row. The gym is fully equipped. We didn't go to the spa. The on-property highlight was definitely the snorkelling. You can rent gear there if you don't have your own. Swim out from the property to the right (toward Four Seasons) and if the water is calm enough go to the 2nd and 3rd set of rock outcroppings and there is lots of fish. We swam with turtles every day!

There's a kitchenette right when you walk in with an empty fridge (we stocked up at Walmart ahead of time), sink, microwave, etc. The bathroom is huge and it was really nice having a separate living room from the bedroom, both equipped with nice TV's and DVD players. The Lanai was gigantic and had an awesome view of the adult pool area and ocean. We were staying there with our toddler and the hotel provided a nice crib. The restaurants were all great, especially Nick's Fish Market which was one of our favorites. (We went with our little one and they brought him lots of fun snacks). The wine list was huge and the food was incredible. We really liked lunch at the Polo Lounge next to the \"upper pool\", but the prices were kind of steep. (Try the nachos!) The regular breakfast dining area was closed for renovations, so the daily breakfast buffet was moved to a function room near Ko. Didn't love the location, but the food was pretty good. I liked the little market they have there, was convenient to be able to run down and get things that we needed. The beach and the pool at Kea Lani are both perfect. I've read reviews about the beach being too small, but it is a lot bigger than we expected (And it's not shared with other hotels like at the Four Seasons!), we ended up spending every afternoon playing in the waves and making sand castles. The pool is really nice, but could use an update at some point in the future. The waterslide is fun and we were glad that they had a shallow \"baby pool\" where our little one could play with other kids his age. The staff around the pool is always walking around with fresh pineapple and offering drinks to all the hotel guests. As for negatives about the hotel, I was disappointed with the fitness center which is really tiny and not well-equipped. The parking lot (which is free) has a weird layout making it difficult to park when it's really full. We had problems with our room keys not working and it was annoying that the breakfast room was in a weird place, but this seemed like just a temporary thing. Overall, the staff was first class. The girls at the concierge desk were always willing to go above and beyond and helped us with lots of restaurant recommendations. Only bad staff was the mean bartender at the bar outside Ko - would it kill you to smile once in awhile?

We also loved the buffet breakfast everyday, however, we would not have eaten there if it were not already included in our room rate. It was 30 dollars a person, not worth it otherwise! Birds were waiting for you to leave your seat to feed on your left overs. It was pretty obnoxious, especially when I was the one sitting there when my husband went up for seconds. The staff was very prompt in removing plates, as they knew about this problem. The hotel was crowded with children but we hardly noticed since we spent most of our time at the adult pool. Sunsets could not be beat! This was by far a memorable stay and the nicest hotel we have ever stayed. We hope to come back soon but it is quite expensive. I recommend staying in September or October when all the kids are back at school, that is if you are staying on a honeymoon. Also, we highly recommend booking the free outrigger canoe excursion! This was one of our favorite things we did and it was only a short 15 minute trip. The man who runs this was amazing. He taught us Hawaiian language and history. We paddled out pretty far and then he provided us with goggles and we all jumped out into the ocean. We had already taken a snorkel trip to molikini but this was pretty fabulous and it was free!! Sign up as soon as you arrive, it books up fast! Pros: *Beautiful grounds * Adult pool *Yummy drinks *peaceful *Beautiful beach *outrigger excursion *Waliea is the best spot to stay in Maui! It's definitely more of a ritzy area compared to Lahania. *friendly staff *breakfast buffet Cons: *Many children *expensive room service and restaurants on the grounds *expensive drinks by the pool. $12 to be exact. *Don't waste your time eating at Mulligans at the Grand Waliea. There was lots of hype about this place but our service was absolutely terrible and we were clearly not the only ones complaining! Not worth it for the food or price! *Rooms smell a little musty on the bottom floors. *", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Monica", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our stay - nice grounds\u201d", "Author": "cruisernut", "ReviewID": "UR45708883", "Content": "We stayed in a one-bedroom suite and the room is large and comfortable for a family of four.

Given a free up upgrade to semi ocean view, but was in a regular garden view and the view of the grounds was quite nice. Over sized bathrooms were great allowing room for more than one to use at the same time i.e. a shower and a tub, two pedistal sinks, plenty of room in the suite. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The location is excellent with a nice sandy beach out front and small rocky - reef type point on the edge. There is a good walking path that fronts the beach side of the hotel that allows you to walk just off the beach and along the other resorts near by and access the other resorts and beach areas. The hotel grounds are roomy and very well kept. The lobby and lounge area are also very nice. Had a fellow playing music each evening in the lounge, he was good. This is not an inexpensive hotel, nor area. All the other resorts along this strech are also somewhat pricey and the area as a while relects that. Streets, medians and all are perfectly groomed, with a couple golf courses too. There is a nice shopping area up the street with a mix of shops and 3 restaurants. Stores do range from modest T-Shirt type stores to upscale clothing and jewlery. We found the breakfast (buffet) over priced at $30 per person, for $30 dollars you should get more than an omelette station, waffles and pancakes were premade and in their buffet serving dome. I would also like something other than a 4oz glass for milk and juice. The upper pool side cafe food good in my opinion, service was good also. We ordered a burger that comes with fries to split . They brought it out, half on each plate with a full portion of fries and pickle on each plate... which I thought was nice touch. Also had Ok hot dog, good onion rings and good salad on other occasions. Didn't try the two formal resturant at the facility. We did find that the deli - cafe it had some meal type items posted on a board outside. Well we had spagettii, cesear salad and garlic bread that was very good. Come to find out, it comes from one of the formal resturants that is next door. So you got great food, for a more reasonable price. Service lower pool side was very friendly, but sometimes slow. Pool cafe and surrounds did have daily drink specials Mai Tai one day, strawberry Daquari's another for $10. Great - Location Service (mostly) Staff (all very nice and more than helpful) Decent deals on food and drinks if you look for them. No charge parking. Just Ok- Little nickel and dime for stuff like cost of cabana pool side or umbrella at the beach and things like that. But if you got an umbrella they would bring it to where you wanted set it up with towels and all, so just for a couple hours it was fun and didn't really break the bank for $20. Not so good - Price of Buffet Breakfast for what you got. A premium TV channel (HBO-Showtime) would be good for the price. We selected the time of year so most children would be back in school and this was generally the case. I think most (and there were not very many) kids were from Australia and New Zeland. I could see where this would be a popular place for families and there could be lots of kids during other times of the year. Suites had microwave and small fridge, to keep things reasonable hit the Safeway 10 minutes up the roads for snacks and drinks. Other dinning options within 15 minutes included everything from local food to fast food to very fancy dinning. Overall, this was a resort and priced liked it, but generally you did got what you paid for. Enjoy the facility how it fits you, watch them meal prices and extras if it matters to you. If you don't want a bunch of kids around, don't go when schools out. This is a great place to stay, you just have to make the most of it... how it will best suit you. For whatever reason there was never anyone at the beach or pools once the sun went down. The pools are open 24 hours a day(which was great), not the water slide though as it requires someone to keep an eye on things for safety. A couple evenings we had a pool pretty much to our self. The beach is easily accessible and we had it to ourselves a couple times too. Hotel was about half fully, but still couple hundred people, but no one really at pool - beach at night. We- Day 1 - (arrive) Just hung around hotel area. Day 2 - Volcano Crater and evening time around pool - beach Day 3 - Hana Highway Day 4 - Beach (surf was up) and Luau (off site) Day 5 - (depart) Scuba trip and pool area Our flight out was at 8:45pm and hotel had suite that you could use for an hour or so to freshen up (wash - shower...) after the days activites and before the flight out.", "Date": "September 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County", "Title": "\u201cMade Our Special Occasion, Special\u201d", "Author": "outof714", "ReviewID": "UR42281352", "Content": "We just returned from 7 nights and days at the Kea Lani to celebrate our 5th anniversary. Arrived on the last flight and the lobby was empty at 11pm, but upon entering our rooms we discovered that we had been upgraded to a Deluxe Ocean View with a wonderful Anniversry gift from the staff. We had our 2 year old in tow and they had his crib all set and ready for him to wind down. it was a great arrival after 7 hours of flying. Room-Great for families with sitting room and master. Bath is wonderful with separate shower and bath. Double vanities are great and the walk in shower allowed our toddler to experience his first. Great 42 inch LCD in living room, but no HD. DVD was a life saver for the little guy and stereo is nice Denon unit. Beds are very comfy with pillowtop mattress. The lanai is huge with table for 4 and a lounger. Spent a lot of time out there as son napped. View was amazing as we could see the sunset and hear the waves crash with the sliders open. Wet bar, microwave and mini fridge are huge help with a little one to make his breakfast and quick meals. Outlets-First off, the Keiki program is great. Kids under 5 eat free at all outlets at hotel!Tried the Kea Lani for breakfast the next morning. Was being renovated so we were at a ballroom with outside location. Prices are moderate and the buffet is the way to go. Great selection and Omellete station. The birds are all over the seating area though. be careful if you leave food at your seat! Polo Grill-Great burger and ahi. The location is by the upper pool and has great views of the property. Darn good MaiTais here as well Luana Lounge-Happy hour scene is really nice. Great Sunset and the Pupu selection is wide. Try the tempura skewers or lumpia Koa-Our fave! Great local flavors. The Sake Mojito is the winner here. The groups faves were the Ahi on the rock, Fried Rice, and ahi tuna crunch roll. Seating is all outside so can get warm if the winds stop. Nicks Fishmarket-The best service around. They gave us a great view table even with a little guy with us. This is the place to be pampered. I dont think there is a miss on the menu here. Very Pricey though! In room dining-Cant beat a meal on the lanai. Great for after a long day around the island. Service was fast and on the spot. Set it all up even a table cloth on the lanai! the dim sum sampler was tasty. Cafe Ciao-Great place for a quick coffee and pastry. Also has some neccessities and came in a pinch when we ran out of milk. Had gallons of milk alon with other items you may have forgotten to get at your Safeway stop in Kihei....top dollar though! Beach- Polo beach is super convenient and never crowded. The waves are mild and our toddleer loved running in and out. Hotel provides lounge chairs and has a small rental booth for scuba, surf, unbrella rentals right there. Staff was awesome. Great place for sunset too! Pool- Great pools! Lots of lounges and cabanas (cost?) available. Lounger towels for the chairs and pool towels are readily available. The toddler pool is great and my little guy was able to walk around waste high with no fear. The adult pool is a nice getaway and the poolside service is convenient and not overbearing. No chlorine is used, saline system of some sort so you never smelled like a pool. The waterslide is super fun but not too long. The swim up bar is pretty popular in the afternoon. Off Site Dining- Lots of great dining around the Island. We had our reception at SeaWatch 5 years ago and went back to celebrate. They are in the midst of a takeover from the General Store (Bev Gannon) so it wasnt the same. Im sure it will be top notch in no time. SanSei-Sushi in Kihei...this is the spot! Go Sunday or Monday and your order before 6pm is 50% OFF! It was premium fish and done really well. We would pay the regular price here the quality was that good Kihei Cafe-Great breakfast spot, and not too expensive. Great biscuits and gravy, fried rice and corn beef hash. great local scene too across from the beaches of Kihei. Maui Brewery-We are big fans of the Kona Brewery on the Big Island and hoped to find something similiar. It was a bust as far as the food goes. The beer was good though but not as finished as Kona. They had a Chipotle Ale that was really tasty and different. Kula Lodge-great place upcountry on the way to Haleakala. The views of the valley are awesome. The brick oven pizza is the best we had during our stay. Random Stuff- Self Parking is free and a short walk (20 or so for valet). We had the red-eye out and the staff was awesome to give us a late late check out. The beach walk is a goot jaunt. Check out the Four Seasons and Grand Wailea.

With regards to meals, it is expensive, but keep in mind that children under 5 eat for free at a few of the restaurants, which made it more reasonable. Additionally, one of the restaurants, Ko, is offering a special for a three course dinner for $39/PP which is also a very good deal. We also went into town to eat at Pizza Madness which was very reasonable and offered great pizza. Overall, this hotel is excellent for familes as the rooms are huge. My wife and I were able to let the boys go to sleep early in one room and still enjoy the evening in either the living room or the lanai. This is the primary reason why we chose the Fairmont and it definitely exceeded our expectations.

The first time was for our our 10 year anniversary... but we decided it would be great to bring the kids back. The rooms at this hotel simply can't be beat when traveling with kids. The suite set up is perfect and allows everyone to have space. We really took advantage of the mini-fridge with the kids -- breakfast in the room everyday which is helpful. My husband and I still went down to Caffe Caio each morning to get lattes and a scone but it's nice be able to keep snacks in the room. There was also a microwave. Yes, things are expensive. If you've done any research at all then this shouldn't be a surprise. There are lot's of ways to cut corners without feeling like you're depriving yourself on vacation. We brought a little cooler with us and took it to the pool everyday. We filled it with various drinks & snacks (water is complimentary at the pool in large coolers -- bring a water bottle so you can refill). Eating off property for dinner will help out too. We ate at KO one night and thought it was delicious. We also got pizzas from Caffe Caio one night and brought them back to the room. They were also really good. They messed up one of the pizzas and I felt like it wasn't handled well so I called and talked with a manager. They immediately made another pizza and delivered it to our room and paid for the pizza. I was impressed. Don't believe all the comments on here about rude staff. The front desk was a bit stiff but I noticed that the day shift was friendlier than the evening staff. The Valet and Bell Staff were amazing! So friendly and upbeat! The pool staff was very accommodating in my opinion. We rented a Cabana with our friends ($75 for the first day with the second day being free and it includes a fruit plate each day and complimentary sodas & juices all day long) which was awesome! With the price of drinks it felt like we were making money off the deal :-) Not to mention it was reserved each day so we didn't have to get up early to reserve a spot at the pool. My complaints are minor. The music in the lounge is WAY too short... just when we're returning from dinner and thinking about maybe having an after dinner drink the musician would be packing up each night (plays from 7-9). The lack of \"Hawaiiana\" is really, really lacking in Wailea. We could've been anywhere tropical. I was really missing that Hawaiian feel -- mostly through the Hawaiian music. There really wasn't any playing. Like I said these are minor! Last tip... pack a picnic, get some pool towels and go sit on the lawn in front of the Villas to watch a sunset one night! We did a wine and cheese picnic one night, the kids tossed the football and it was one of our best nights! Great photo ops. Overall I wanted to write a review because I think this hotel is the best overall option in Wailea for families. I'm sure the Four Seasons is lovely but to have a room over there like you get at the Kea Lani you'd pay thousands a night. We got a deal through Costco that was amazing!

The rooms are perfect for families, a seperate bedroom and large bath room, with seperate toilet. The shower is a bit annoying because it is not enclosed, just a step up from the tile floor and 2 year olds love to play in it and turn the water on and off. The rooms were very clean and well maintained, plus the large balconies provide one more place to go to se[erate everyone in the family. The grounds are very nice and well maintained, the pools are busy, but chairs were always available, even though people go down at 7am and leave their things. At abvout 12 noon, they clear off some chairs, so that is a good time to head down and get some reserved chairs that just opened up. The Nick's Fish Market is not very good in comparison to Mama's Fish House, while they have great service (Always a full drink), they are snooty and if you dont plan to order cocktails and wine, they make odd faces and snide remarks. The food is not all that great in comparison to Mama's, some dishes are great, other, not so much. For the price, drive to Mama's and enjoy the whole package. The Fairmont as quite attentive to guest needs and even goes out of their way to greet and acomodate customers. However, they had issues with the phone systems voice mail and never told any guests, instead many guests had to call/go down to the front desk looking for a \"package being held\", only to be told of the issue. All it took was either a call or letter in each room explaining the situation. If you have a family and want to stay in Wailea, this is your hotel.

There are alot of perks including free wireless internet, use of a loaner car, free golf club rental, free use of adidas athletic wear, among other perks. Overall, in my opinion the Kea Lani is the best value in Wailea.

The location is great. The resort is on Polo Beach which is a small nice beach, but you can walk to Wailea Beach or drive to Big Beach in Makena. The pool was OK but nothing great - the kids enjoyed it although it seemed crowded at times. The adult pool looked nice but we had kids so we never used it. You have to reserve cabanas by the pool (we didn't), but chairs are free if you can find them. At the beach, umbrellas and boogie boards must be rented but the chairs are free. The grounds are very nice - our kids enjoyed the tiki torch lighting and feeding the Poi fish. The room we had was a suite which was good with children. The bathroom was huge, but lacked privacy (too many mirrors and no separate area for the toilet). The lanai was large and comfortable. We had an Oceanview room on the first floor which overlooked the adult pool and was nice. I wouldn't splurge on more expensive rooms - they showed us the next room rate up which would have added $1200 to our bill and didn't offer any better a view. The hotel appeared to be very clean. Washer/dryers are available for free which was very nice - you just need to buy detergent and bounce sheets. With kids and a long stay, this was beneficial since we could pack less. The concierge was helpful, but beware that you are paying additional if you book thru the hotel. We realized that when comparing rates with other people at various activities. If you know what you want to do, I suggest booking yourself to save money. For food, the grill by the upper pool was good and we used it for lunch many days (and the service was very good). We tried Ko's one night and the food was amazing but the service was awful. We did one breakfast but the service was awful and the birds were quite annoying. We used the cafe many days - it is expensive but it was a cheaper alternative for some meals. We did note that cookies that you could get at the grill for $7 were at the cafe for $3.50 which annoyed us once we noticed this. All in all, the hotel was very nice. The staff is friendly and the location is good. It is expensive, but most of Hawaii is expensive.

The property has lots of open space with absolutely beautiful grounds. The pools are lovely though there are not enough cabanas and people seem to reserve chairs early in the AM--kind of obnoxious, but seems to be the Hawaiian resort thing to do. We ended up renting an umbrella at the beach every day and it was very relaxing. We ate dinner at Nick's Fish Market and were not wowed, though it was a festive atmosphere. In my memory the prices are about the same for Ko but the atmosphere was a little too low key for the price. If we did it again, we would not have breakfast included. The buffet is overwhelmed by birds who have become very smart. When parents leave their toddlers at the table to return to the buffet the birds sweep in. The birds descend as soon as the table is vacated--whether to leave, greet friends, or return to the buffet. We would have opted for the coffee and breakfast options at the nice little store in the hotel. We ate lunch at the pool bar each day--the staff was delightful and the food very good. In the evening we enjoyed drinks in the lobby bar and wished there had been a food option there. (We loved the restaurant at the Four Seasons--Ferraro's Bar e Ristorante.) The fitness center was well equipped. One day we were there and the place was scorching. There were many calls to the hotel operator but no a/c. My husband is a runner and enjoyed the path that ran along the beach in front of all of the resort hotels. We also walked the path several times and decided that the Kea Lani was the prettiest and place along the walk.

Everything was more expensive at the hotel, but Kihea was so close that we did quite a bit of off-site shopping (and eating). The main advantage was the room: sofa bed, microwave, fridge that was empty on arrival, and very large lanai. None of these were extra charges. Because there are so many deals right now, with the free breakfast and free night, it was very worth the stay at this beautiful, friendly hotel. Great: We received an upgrade on check-in.

The poolside lunch service was great and the guy (I think his name was Matt?) was SO nice and helpful, not just to us but to everyone. He knew everyone's names and was really just a fantastic employee... so friendly. I don't think we even ventured down to the beach, we loved the pool so much!! I saw some people commented about the price of food, we did not eat dinner here but I did not think that the lunches and breakfasts were that bad. We got breakfast each morning at the coffee shop and they had fantastic muffins for maybe $3-4 each. The poolside lunch was about $20/entree which is pretty standard for poolside food. I loved the size of our suite... it was huge and we had a huge balcony also. Lots of closet space. Housekeeping did a great job also. Negatives: we were a little disappointed that we did not get leis at check in, and no one asked if it was our honeymoon, as the other hotels did. Also, the place is definitely dated. The lobby is just gorgeous and so is the adult pool, but if they could rehab this place they would probably get a lot more business. I read something that said it was last redone in 2001 and I was honestly surprised even from that. The rooms do look like they are from 2001, but many of the outdoor areas look MUCH older than that.

It holds your spot all day in a nice shady location, plus you get unlimited water and non-alcoholic beverages (again, very kid friendly). * The Spa is fantastic! The Lomi Lomi massage was one of the best I'd ever had...well worth the money. * Skip the Hair/Nail salon. It has nice Aveda products, but that's about it. * The rooms have dorm-size refrigerators and microwaves, so buy snacks at the local grocery store to keep in your room. * Ask about the drink of the day...usually delicious and a few bucks less. * The kid activities on the lawn are pretty lame, except for the lei making. This was a blast (and free). My daughter made a huge lei and wore it around for days. * Everyone needs to go down the water slide...very fun for all ages!

We originally booked a deluxe ocean view suite, but ended up spending a couple of nights in the suite then upgraded to a 2 BR ocean front villa for four nights. There was a last minute vacancy in one of the villas and we negotiated a great rate (the villa rate includes a rental car from Avis). Our take on the suite was that it was nice to have all four of us in the same room (and not have to pay for 2 rooms) but with the pull out couch and roll away bed it was a bit cramped. The bathrooms are very spacious (separate tub & shower) and there was a mini bar fridge, coffee maker and microwave. Nice balcony with ocean view. The villa was like staying at a completely different hotel. Similar to a 2 story townhouse, the villa had 2 very large bedrooms (one on each floor) and 2 very large bathrooms. I believe the living area also had a pull out couch. The kitchen was small, but had everything you need for a week. The full size washer/dryer was a godsend for a family of 4. The large patio area had a dining table with 4 chairs, 2 nice chaises and a very nice gas grill. The best part....the 3 ft deep plunge pool! All this within a few steps of the beach and a great ocean view. We ended up cancelling some dinner reservations so we could grill dinner and hang out on the patio in our swimsuits. There's a Safeway nearby in Kihei and several ABC stores that sell groceries, etc. It was like renting a condo but with the resort ammenities (terrific resort pool with waterslide). The Kea Lani is a great choice for a family -and if it's in the budget- a villa is definitely the way to go. We visitied several other resorts in Wailea and across Maui and felt that Wailea had the best weather. Kapalua was way too windy & had rough surf. The Four Seasons was lovely, but the pool looked small compared to the Kea Lani's (no water slide either) and the beach wasn't quite as private since they share a beachfront with the Grand Wailea. The Grand Wailea is the other end of the spectrum- an over the top mega resort with an enourmous water park. If I had pre-teens or teens that could go off on their own in a water park then this would have been a blast- but my kids are 5 & 8 and it was just too big & busy for them- and there are height requirements on some of the slides. Another note about the Kea Lani- my daughter is on a restricted diet and the staff was absolutely wonderful about her needs. Kids 5 and under eat free at the Kea Lani, and even though her meals were free, the chef went above and beyond. On our second morning we went to the breakfast buffet (very good selections) and the manager remembered us right away and put in a special breakfast order with the chef. When we moved to the villa the food & beverage director sent over a brand new toaster for us to use so that the old toaster wouldn't contaminate her food. Little things like that make a vacation more relaxing for a mom! We've stayed at \"more upscale\" reosrts (Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons,etc) that aren't as accommodating. 2 other tips about Maui- don't miss Mama's Fish House for dinner and Hali'imaile General Store is great for lunch on the way up/down from Haleakala.

Lovely check in with fresh leis, and fruit juice, staff is all very friendly and welcoming. Suites are very large and comfortable, huge spa like bathrooms, comfortable beds, and our lanais had perfect views of the ocean, could even see whales! Our last two nights I decided to break the bank and ask how much to upgrade to a 3 bed villa. The occupancy was very low at this time, hello recession! So I paid 500 extra per night to live the high life. Now I am spoiled forever! The villas are splendid, private plunge pool, which was very warm, without the pee of the kids pool! The washer and dryer was handy, (again 4 kids) full size fridge and microwave and stove top. Only after coming back from Safeway with pizza, did I realize, no OVEN! oh well. Also had a barbeque. Handy because as expensive as the rooms are, the price of food at Kea Lani, even HIGHER. A hot dog at the pool, $9, fries at the pool, $8. We went to Safeway and loaded up, the moderate suites have a bar fridge and microwave so you can at least get drinks and snacks. The resort offers free shuttle (via very nice Suburban) to the shops at Wailea. Hit up the ABC store if you don't rent a car. More reasonable than the the deli at Kea Lani. Renting a car is so worthwhile, the sights of the island are amazing, the drive to Hana is a must see. And at the very least, you can drive to Kihei which has normal priced restaurants. The food savings will cover the cost of car rental. This hotel has seen some better days, the doors need refinishing, the couches are a little tired, but the views and the luxury of the resort overall, make it worth blowing the kid's inheritance.

The decor is a bit shabby and could use a makeover - we had some very strangely upholstered armchairs that didn't really seem to fit, and the paint on the ceiling was chipping a bit. The hotel grounds are immaculate. The adult pool was relaxing (and quiet), however we tired quickly of the costly add-ons. $12 for a poolside drink, $20 for a sandwich.

The great thing about this hotel is that all the rooms are suites which is fantastic if you have kids. And this was a nice aspect. I was disappointed, however, the first room we were assigned to had an overwhelming smell of mildew (perhaps a common problem in an environment like Hawaii--- however, at five star prices, I expected better). We asked for another room and were given a comparable room which I thought smelled ok, but later realized the mildew smell was just more subtle. The other thing that was really disappointing was that the caulking around the edge of pool had that black mold stuff in it, like you find in an old bathtub. I was really kind of grossed out by this and it made me not want to hang around the pool, kiddie pool too, which of course our son wanted to spend the whole time in. Basically, it seemed like the pools needed to be redone and the resort just hadn't spent the money to do it yet. We had a good time at the resort anyway. But if I had to do it again, Id skip the suite and get one a room at the Four Seasons next door, we had a drink there and it was really spectacular. We still talk about the mojitos we had there. I think their golf-view or garden view rooms are pricewise comparable to our \"partial ocean view\", which we had to lean out over the side of our balcony to see the water anyway. And to be at the Four Seasons would have been worth it. We did use a hotel babysitter to take care of our 2 year old one night and we were very pleased with her.

The suites are spacious and the huge lanais are our favorite part, especially if you have an oceanview room. I do have to agree that the charge for a beach umbrella is quite cheesy and the Fairmont would do well to do away with this charge as it does anger alot of their guests. Also the cabanas are very pricey but we found lots of pool chairs and free umbrellas so it was not an issue with us but they could probably do away with many of them since they seemed to be used by so few guests and thus just are there taking up too much space. I also feel that if they priced their drinks poolside more reasonably that they would find more guests would purchase but we as well as many other guests just took care of most of our own refreshment needs. Other than that we found service to be very good, yes there did seem to be more mingling amongst the pool staff this last visit but to be honest it wasn't all that busy and there is only so much they can do for you.

In past years, we had stayed at the Four Seasons in this neighborhood. We got a good deal for a room, but that was the only thing that was good about our stay. The room was fine--not as luxurious as some say, but certainly comfortable. The views were OK, but nothing spectacular. But the property's weak point is its service. We had a problem with our room at check in, and I thought we got it resolved, but the new room was worse--and so we went back to the original room. The front desk staff was unpleasant, and basically yelled at me, saying that there is no comparison with the Four Seasons, and basically saying the only room change he would discuss was a paid upgrade. We called his manager, got an apology, and a (sort of) nice amenity. And that was the extent of the service. The property was not crowded, but the staff was pretty non-existent. On multiple occasions, we saw groups of pool/beach attendants just chatting, while the pool area was not being kept up. Used towels were everywhere, and so were food and drink plates and cups. No one came around to offer to help with chairs, towels, or even food. At the beach, there is a charge for an umbrella ($9/hour), and this on a beach with no shade. Similarly, the hotel rents cabanas by the pool. Even so, none of this guaranteed service. And, in fact, when you add up the cost of the beach umbrellas and cabanas--the Four Seasons is a much better deal, since you get service, umbrellas, cabanas, and nice service with a smile to boot. At this property, no one bothered to say hello at any point or even acknowledge that there were guests around. The staff just looked unhappy or, at best, indifferent. Customers seemed to get in the way. But the real eye-opener was on our last morning. We complained to the President's Club staff about the service, citing specific examples--they offered us a free breakfast. When we went to get it, we were promptly seated and then no one came to take our order for over 15 minutes. So I complained to the hostess, who was deeply embarrassed, moved us, and then made sure we had a server who paid attention. So the stay ended as it had begun--with indifferent service and a lack of attention to detail. We were glad to leave when we did. The property could be really nice with minimal renovation but a lot of attention to improving the service.

It was nice to have a refrigerator and a microwave. We stopped at Wal-Mart and picked up some items to have in the room on the way from the airport on arrival.

The adult pool is beautiful: royal blue and gold trim and the lounge chairs are wide and very comfortable. You have to grab your own towels from a stack. There is no assistance. At the beach there are lounge chairs but the hotel charges for an umbrella at $9/hr. Many of the sports activites cost. All this at the Four Seasons is free. The beach is staff is young and stupid. Simply just ignore them. They have no idea they are dealing with people who are paying $700/night. The hotel is all white and modeled after the Las Hadas hotel in Mexico. After our stay the hotel is ugly and an embarrassment to the Islands. There is a lot of concrete and open spaces for functions with fake green grass. The KO restaurant is over priced. An order of Lumpia is $17; however, service was excellent. Tried Nick's Fish Market. The staff is run by kids. No clue about wine and they try to impress you with their verbal description on specials. Food was awful and for the prices very dissapointing. Bread was stale!

We liked the suite-like room, which give you more space if you are traveling with kids. We had an ocean view room and it is really worth it's money, because the daily sunsets are awesome! The service was nice and friendly. Just the turndown service arrived always a bit late for a family with little kids: 8 p.m. - so we had to schedule it for an earlier time. The furniture is a old fashioned but it was in good condition, the rooms also have kitchenette and big balconies. we always prepared a quick cereal/milk/coffee breakfast in our room, had it on our balcony and then headed to the beach. So we felt very comfortable there. We liked the spacious grounds and pool area that is easy to overview, and we appreciated the easy beach access. Polo beach is really nice, if it is not crowded - so better do not travel there in the high season. You can do snorkeling, kayaking and even watch turtels. Do not rent your equipment at the booth down on the beach: if you want to go kayaking or paddel surfing just go to the booth in front of the Grand Wailea (it's just a 5 min walk over the beach path fronting the resorts) and get all your gear for half the price. Same thing with snorkeling: get your gear at Maui Dive Shop in the Shops at Wailea for half of the price Fairmont charges you. It is also cheaper to buy a beach umbrella at Long's, K-mart or so than to rent one from the hotel just for one day. We also hated to do self-parking - but at least it was for free. We appreciated that kids under five eat for free at the resorts restaurants. But the food wasn't that outstanding when you don't want to eat the fast food/sandwich stuff every time. The Deli shop doesn't have a good price/foodquality ratio, too. But most of all - save the money for the breakfast buffet. It was included in our roomrate for the first days of our stay, so we took it but we would never pay for it seperately. It's expensive (30 bucks) and even the food selection may be good, you can't enjoy it because of the many birds flying around your table and trying to pick a crumb. They are really a plague and the hotel isn't doing very much to \"protect\" their guest against them. Birds are hopping over the buffet, where the offered dishes aren't covered to prevent the bird's piking! To say it clear: if you like birds pooping on your breakfast plate (be sure that happened to us) and picking the raisins out of your muffin when you just sip your tea, then go ahead and have your breakfast there. We found it more than disgusting and as I said I cannot understand why the hotel doesn't do a thing. Once we had breakfast at the Fourseason next door just to see if they also got this serious situation, but see - they don't! The food on the buffet was well protected, they had plate covers just in case you had to leave the table to get another butter or so. And if a lonely bird appears a waiter immediately took action and made him leave. That's what I expect from a 5star hotel.

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels and most are what you would expect, exceptional service, beautiful grounds, luxurious rooms ect. The only part of that that the Fairmont Maui has is the beautiful grounds. The rest of the hotel is a 3 star rating at best. They charge 5 star prices though. Our first morning we ate at the buffet (the food was good) but we thought $30 each for a breakfast buffet was a bit much. And don't do the valet parking, most of the 5 star hotels we've stayed at have complimentary valet parking, the Fairmont charges $18 a day without telling you, there's no signage and no mention of a fee anywhere except on your bill. We booked the largest room they offer at the hotel and were very disappointed. The room is said to be 1100 sq. ft. but felt very cramped. In the bedroom there was about 18 inches between the end of the bed and the cabinet holding the old large tube TV. The furniture in the living room was old and outdated. We had a large wraparound balcony with a beautiful ocean view (very nice) which I now realize was part of that 1100 sq. ft. they quote for the room size. The only problem was the green lizard we had visit us on day 3. You wouldn't think we would have those type of guests on the 7th floor. And don't leave anything out in your room that's edible or you will have hundreds of small spider ants as inside guests as we did.

Some reviews have mentioned feeling \"crowded\" by the pool or at the beach, but we never experienced that at all -- everywhere we went, from the pools to the restaurants to the beach, it seemed we had plenty of room to ourselves. Perhaps the hotel is more crowded during the summer months, when more families are traveling -- but this time of year it was perfect.

Everything was very clean, but the furnishings and drapes could be updated, and the mattress was quite firm. The bathrooms are modern and huge with separate shower and bath and 2 sinks. The hotel is big but not overwhelming and never felt overly crowded. It has the feel of an old Hawaiian plantation, very open and airy, with large open grassy areas and easy access to the beach. We never had any problem getting a chair at any of the pools or the beach. The adult pool is great for swimming- never crowded- and all pools are open 24 hours. The waterslide was a lot of fun. The food at the restaurants was pricey but good (Nick's) but there is a nice little cafe with more reasonable prices and good coffee drinks. The hotel is a short walk from the Four Seasons and the Grand Wailea, and we did go check those out to compare. The Four Seasons is definitely a step up in appearance and has the feel of a modern, 5 Star resort, but perhaps at the expense of feeling a bit more generic and perhaps smug. The game room and fitness center are both a big step up from the Fairmont, and they have free internet which is not available at the Fairmont. You will have to pay for self parking here, not at the Fairmont, and there is no resort fee at the Fairmont either. A coffee drink here is smaller and more expensive as well. The pool was clearly more crowded, with really no empty space and chairs packed in everywhere, and seemed to be more suited for adults than kids. I did notice more single people around the pool, whereas at the Fairmont it was mostly young families and honeymooners. The Grand Wailea is absolutely huge and has the feel of a Disney water park.

When we were picking a hotel, we were debating between the Fairmont and Four Seasons and the Grand Wailea. Ultimately, we chose the Fairmont for a variety of reasons, some based on our friends' recommendations who have stayed at all three. What won us over was the fact that all of the rooms at the Fairmont were suites with a front sitting room and a separate bedroom. It was great to come back to our room at the end of a day at the beach or at the pool and relax in our room without having to jump into the bed. The bathroom is GORGEOUS. I've seen New York apartments that could fit in there! It's wonderfully appointed and the soaps, etc are absolutely refreshing. The service at the hotel is amazing. We were greeted with cool towels, juice and leis - tremendously relaxing and welcome after a long long flight! Everyone, from the room service and cleaning staff, to the bartenders and front desk staff, were amazing and friendly. They are SO good with honeymooners - everyone kept calling me Mrs. LastName - it was so fun. The dining options at the hotel are also fantastic - pricey (but what isn't in Maui), but delicious. We spent one night just restaurant/bar hopping at the hotel and had a great evening. The Fairmont beach is FANTASTIC - heads and shoulders above some of the others in Wailea, mostly because it is exclusive and doesn't get a lot of the public beach traffic that many of the other beaches have. It doesn't have some of the amenities as some of the others do (padded lounge chairs on the beach, guys with sunscreen greeting you before you hit the sand, etc) - but for the privacy, it's worth it. There is also great snorkling right off the beach and you can rent gear right from the hotel. We went out a few times.

The resort is extravagant. We loved the free yoga, and just missed the free canoe rides multiple times --bummer (honeymooners = not punctual, apparently). We took advantage of the free car service to go to the shops at Wailea and buy juice, snacks, and rent fins (we brought our own snorkels and masks). Definitely a good choice. We snorkelled straight off the beach three times, and went further south (again, via car service) once. We took the car service to the Four Seasons for an amazing dinner. (Oh, wow. Sunset, perfect beach views, we watched a wedding, and the food and wine were spectacular. We were sated.) Walked back along the lit ocean path afterwards, and then went for a swim in the deserted but lit pool -- amazing evening. Meals and pool side drinks were impressively expensive (maybe not for Maui/resorts, but compared to Seattle they were something else). We'd budgeted ahead of time and just tried to ignore it. Pineapple slices and cold towels brought around at the pool were lovely. Pool people watching was quite amusing. Views were amazing. Food was quite good, if expensive, and occasionally exceptional. Coffee and a bagel from the ground floor cafe was the way to go, but the full-service brunch was a yummy alternative. Loved the pretty bathrooms in the rooms. The grounds were amazing.

While we checked it we were presented with leis, fresh juice, and cool towels - lovely! The bellman was very friendly and gave us tips on the hotel and things to do in Maui. I just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand the few reviews saying this hotel was rundown?! How could you possibly say this hotel was rundown? I saw no evidence of anything worn, broken ,or old? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where these people are used to staying but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to stay there! We stayed in the north section, room #617. I liked the room layout. Our kids (9&12) were with us so having a separate bedroom was a must. The furniture looked new and nice, as did the bedding, the carpet, etc. The bathrooms are very nice (huge & marble) as was the lanai. I loved our view, even though it wasn't oceanfront I think I preferred it because you could see the ocean one-way and Haleakala the other. And it was quite, no pool noise or conference people noise. We ate breakfast out there almost every day to the sounds of the birds. I really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine spending extra for an ocean-view room. We found we were hardly ever in our room. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d normally be up and out by 7:30 or 8 to enjoy the cooler morning and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be back until after sunset (which is ~6 pm). I would rather have the extra $200+ a day for an ocean front room to spend on eating out and other activities (spa, helicopter, etc.) The only drawback to the room was the beds. The sleep sofa wasn't comfortable (most aren't) but the king wasn't much better. Didn't bother us too much until we moved later in the week to the Westin and slept on the Heavenly Bed to compare. The beds were MUCH better at the Westin. (And the Westin doesn't charge $30 a night for a rollaway as does the Fairmont. They provide a rollaway Heavenly Bed for free - our 12 yr old liked that after the sleeper sofa.) Pools were great and the kids loved every minute. And the beach was wonderful - my favorite part. I read some other reviews were people complained that it was small but I LOVED it. It was secluded and beautiful - light sand, black lava rock, and the views! I much preferred the Fairmont beach to Ka'anapali later in the week. It was very peaceful and private. We snorkeled right off the beach and saw the best turtles of the trip. We rented our gear from Snorkel Bob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (much cheaper than the resort) and kept it all week. Only other negative for this resort are the food prices. REALLY expensive!! I was expecting expensive but $22 for an omelet is out there, especially when you are a family of 4 and there for 9 days. We only ate one meal at Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Ciao on our last night. It was good but nothing life-changing for the high price. We bought groceries (which are expensive enough) and ate breakfast and a lot of lunches on our own. We also ate in several restaurants off the resort in Wailea and Kihei. Resort cocktails were $12-$16 a piece. We had a few then bought our own at the ABC store. However, I did think the coffee from the resort coffee shop was reasonably priced and very good. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. Example: when I called for extra pillows they were at my door in minutes. When my child got sick at 12:30 am one night (yuck) I called the front desk and they had fresh linens at my door in minutes, removed the soiled ones, and even offered to come in and make up the bed. The gentleman was very gracious and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make me feel bad. We did have trouble accessing the internet in our room. It was a free service as members of the Fairmont club, but we were never able to get it to work (could be on our end) but we were able to access it in the outdoor bar area via WIFI. Overall, this really is a grand hotel. I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone. Wailea is lovely and felt like pure paradise. As mentioned, I liked South Maui a bit more than West but the whole island is great. I mean it is Hawaii after all! A bad day there is better than a good day almost anywhere. So if you are stressing over choosing a resort, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Every one I saw looked amazing so it would be hard to go wrong.

By the way one of the most amazing sunsets also. Everytime we went somewhere (Haleakala, Road to Hana, etc.) the staff always asked how was the trip???? It just seemed that they cared about you a little.

We stayed at the Kea Lani two years ago (in the villas) and loved it. This time we also stayed in the villas and still enjoyed it very much... POSITIVES: location - we prefer Wailea to the other areas of Maui size - the resort is not a mega hotel and doesn't feel too overwhelmingly crowded even during holiday times cabanas - you have the option of renting cabannas at the pool or umbrellas at the beach if you don't want to worry about getting up to save a spot food - restaurants/food are on site if you choose not to cook as opposed to condos accommodation - villas offer excellent size accomodation for a bigger family and the plunge pool/patio is hours of fun for the kids layout - villas are close to the beach and very convenient to get in and out of, front and back door right onto hotel grounds, no elevator hassels resort layout - excellent, lobby, grounds, beach staff - mostly friendly and accomodating (not all but most) family friendly NEGATIVES: -cafe ciao restaurant..average food/service-high prices -pool loungers are getting very tired, and uncomfortable, feeling the metal through the pads. -hotel seemed more crowded this time as opposed to spring break two years ago, still not unbearable, but busy - wailea in general is feeling more touristy than it did two years ago - to be expected i guess. -breakfast restaurant did seem a bit nutty at times and the staff there seemed to take forever to serve us even though it was buffet - all they had to do was drinks?? we often went elsewhere. -villa kitchen cabinets could use an update and no the living area is not huge, it's quite narrow, but we tend to be spread out between the patio/pool and three tvs..so it doesn't bother us...our utility room/laundry room, was extremely noisy - i.e. sounded like there was always loud laundry going even when there wasn't, we had a water back up of some sort in there they had to come clean up on an evening when we had company so there was maintenance traipsing through with clean up vac and towels etc during our BBQ. It bothers me to think they are just neglecting these minor things because they can (quite frankly) and they know the tourists will keep on coming. Overall we do love the Kea Lani VILLAS and will continue to stay there because we haven't found anything to match the experience in terms of space, plunge pool and convenience, but if i were booking a regular room or two and wanted a pampered overall experience I would give the four seasons next door a try. We went there for dinner twice and remembered why the four seasons always stands out so much compared to most hotels...they just take everything up a notch in terms of service...they have a kids menu, a teens menu, an adult menu, oh let us bring your kids something to nibble on before dinner is served, they must be hungry, it's too long for them to wait..impeccable service both times and this was their casual restaurant..as i said if it weren't for the villas...I'd be steppin out on the Kea Lani just to see if the grass is greener on the other side.", "Date": "April 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "McLean, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cNot what we expected\u201d", "Author": "MBLMcLean_Virginia", "ReviewID": "UR14745224", "Content": "Reading a critical review of a hotel I usually take it with a grain of salt and think the writer is a littly cranky or just thinks being hyper critical is being descerning .

The average highway motel has better bedding these days. For the money Fairmont charges, the beds should be top-notch. In addition, our room was terribly noisy. We could hear housekeeping carts rolling on the tile hall floors all day and part of the night. In addition. if the sliding door was opened, the children's noise from the pool below was loud, so the a/c was on nearly all the time. We ate at Cafe Ciao, which was very expensive for their \"casual\" restaurant. We didn't try Nick's Fishmarket, preferring to eat off the grounds for most dinners. Lack of regular maintenance shows. One night we had the inconvenience of the water being turned off from 10pm-6am in the entire resort. I had 2 excellent massages at their spa--definitely recommend that.

The hotel is not only beautiful, it has a warm, relaxing atmosphere that you never want to leave. Even though the hotel was fully booked, it never felt crowded and service was not delayed. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. One morning we woke to a flat tire on our rental. The valet and front desk were quick to assist and shuttle me to Avis to retrieve another vehicle. The shuttles by the way aren't the usually smelly hotel vans. They use a Cadillac sedan and a Ford Expedition as their 'courtesy shuttle' vehicles to the surrounding area. That same morning my boyfriend lost his wallet. Again, the Kea Lani staff sprang into action and in less than an hour security delivered the wallet to him. A guest had found the wallet on the walkway that connects the hotel to the Four Seasons and left it at the front desk. He was pleasantly surprised to find his cash ($460) and credit cards intact. We wished we could have personally thanked the individual with a gift certificate for dinner to Nick's Fishmarket, but they did not leave their name. Nick's is wonderful, by the way. Be sure to make reservations for the patio at sunset. The Polo bar is also a great place to take photos at sunset. Although the bartender was busy trying to close up for the evening, he stopped to ask if we wanted him to take our picture. This is typical of the wonderful service at this hotel. The beach is incredibly relaxing. You can rent snorkel and scuba gear beachside as well as kayaks. Whales also frequent the area this time of year - there were so many sightings it seemed as if they are part of the staff. We visited the other hotels in the area but none better than the Kea Lani. It is really nice that you can valet at any hotel in Wailea for no charge. Not true at the West coast hotels. Naturally, the Four Seasons is beautiful and their service is impeccable - yet it did not surpass the Kea Lani. The Grand Wailea, a/k/a the \"Big Unfriendly\" is another story. It is massive and rambling. We tried to go to the beachside restaurant to watch the sunset and ended up lost in a maze through the kiddie pool area. The return to the lobby was more confusing. By the time we found our way back, we just wanted OUT! As an aside, we are not directionally challenged. We once put 1700 miles on a rental in Costa Rica, where there are few road signs. Yet we needed GPS at the Grand Wailea. The rooms at the Kea Lani are spacious, which gives them the edge over the Four Seasons. Just like the hotel, you feel comfortable in the room the minute you arrive. Unlike many of the chain resorts, the Kea Lani has personality which is unique to its location. This is accomplished not only through beautiful decor, but through their amazing staff. One of the hazards of traveling for work, is waking up in a Westin or Marriott and forgetting what city you are in. When you wake up at the Kea Lani, you know you are in Maui, and you smile.", "Date": "February 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Moody, BC", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Stay!\u201d", "Author": "happytravels38", "ReviewID": "UR13081782", "Content": "We had an absolutely fabulous time during our recent stay at the Fairmont Kea Lani.

Most of us (well drillers) are hard working business owners who do not have \"fancy\" tastes - but we do know a nice place (and a good time) when we see it. This is that place. To start with, the whole area (Wailea) is posh - full of very fancy resorts and expensive homes. You probably could not go wrong at any of the resorts. They all looked very nice from the outside (although I can say that the rooms at the Kea Lani are twice as big as those at the Grand Wailea). The beach, asphalt beach and street-side walk and landscaping are great at all of these places. Also, if you like one beach better than the other - no problem, they all appear to be public beaches (with chairs owned by the resorts and saved for their customers). You will be amazed at all of the \"beautiful people\" on these beaches (and the number of not so beautiful people who have got some big bucks). On to the Kea Lani itself, the grounds are just beautiful. They are lush and well kept. The lobby itself is wide-open and classy. The staff (all of them) are about as friendly and helpful as can be. Our maid service was especially outstanding. Each room is a two-room suite - with a large patio (accessible from both the living room and the bedroom). The bathroom also has doors from both rooms and is especially large. It has both a full bath and a tiled walk-in shower that was very nice. Each room also has a small fridge & microwave built into a cupboard area that is large enough to store a week's worth of food. The king-sized bed that we had could not be better. It is obviously a quality mattress that was not too firm or too soft (which would've given me back problems). The living room had a couch and a work desk. If I could change one thing about our room (and all the rest, most likely) it would be to update the decorating in this room with newer carpet and couch that show more of an island spirit. It did not take away from our appreciation of the room though as it truly was a nice room. The resort has three pools - an upper pool with a bar and a waterslide connecting to middle pool (largest pool) and a separate pool. It is a little odd that the pool with the swim-up bar is the same pool that has the waterslide. In other words, the kids pool is also the adults pool and the totally separate pool is the \"quieter\" pool. All were nice looking - although I did not swim even once as I can do that at nearly any hotel. We spent most of our free time around the hotel at the beach and using the beach walk to walk to see the beaches of the other resorts (a very nice walk). I snorkeled every day (saw lots of cool fish and several very large turtles). I think drink service was better at the pools but I think most of the people hanging around the pool were more into that service than those that were enjoying the ocean/beach. As I mentioned earlier, service is excellent at this place. Although they never reach out their hands to ask for it, you do feel obligated (rightly so) to tip often. The Kea Lani does offer free (plus tip) transportation to places in the area (not sure what marks the end of the area). We rented a convertible for our trip (recommend it) and they have plenty of free parking on site. My wife and I had a great time at this beautiful place.

Really, what would you expect in one of the ritziest vacation destinations in Hawaii? We did find the hotel was filled with families and kids but it never really bothered us at all. In fact, we found it kind of lightened up things a bit, gave the place a bit of sincerity instead of stuffy and overdone. Incidentally while we're on it, while I liked dinner at the Four Seasons (Ferraro's - worth a reservation) I did find it to be stuck-up there - just a bit too rigid and overdone for us. Food quality at Fairmont was excellent. I am kind of shocked to see some people having problem with Nick's Fish House? You would really have to be watching and waiting for a screw-up to have a less than stellar meal here. Grounds were absolutely stunning. Pools weren't overly crowded and service pool-side was great, responsive. Even the Fairmont Store there had a great deli and array of staples if you needed them. View from the room was excellent.

When we entered it appeared that this room had not been used in a while because it was very warm, the air was stagnant and there was a musty, damp smell there was also a slight dampness to the older carpeting. I have very bad allergies and react negatively to this type of smell so it was unacceptable for me to stay in this room. We called down to the front desk and spoke with the manager and they seemed to be accomodating enough because they immediately moved us to another room. Although this one was now cooler it still had the above mentioined stench (and now my usually smell-less husband was able to smell what I was talking about). By this time I was getting very upset and upon further communication with the management they were going to clean a third room for us and have us come back later to see or more accurately smell the room. We waited for approximately 1.5 hours to go into the new room and when we did there was now a terrible floral smell on top of the existing musty, dampness which was already present. At the end of the day we decided not to stay at the hotel which was a very upsetting decision given the all the planning that went into the trip.

We booked our honeymoon about 6 or 7 months in advance and got a pretty decent deal. First thing to remember is you are in Hawaii everything is more money... and my advice is if you are going to make the trek over there then do it right! I researched a ton of hotels on the internet and in trip advisor on Maui. I kept hearing great things about the Wailea area and about the Fairmont. When we were ready to get serious about booking we went to Liberty Travel to book everything. Keep in mind I did my homework and found rates online before I went in there so I knew what the \"best rates\" were. The travel agent actually found a cheaper rate ( approx $50 cheaper a night). She booked us in the parking lot or street view room. When she did this she told us that almost always you are upgraded to a better view and pay the cheaper price! (She was correct we were upgraded to a pool/garden view... but I have to say even the parking lot view if we had it would have been fantastic!) When we arrived at the Fairmont it was gorgeous everything was perfect. We were greeted with smiling faces and fresh flower lei's that smelled amazing! We were given the key to our room...on the first floor in the 170's... when we opened the door we could hardly contain our excitement! The room was great!! Every room at the Fairmont is a suite and has 840 square feet of living. It had a fridge a microwave and mini bar area, a living room and work space area, a large bedroom and a HUGE bathroom! Oh and did I mention the extra large lanai?? it had sliders from the living area and from the bedroom. It was fantastic and CLEAN!! The Fairmont property is great, right on Polo beach with its beautiful soft sand and gorgeous views of some of the other islands. The pool areas are wonderful there is even an adult pool area that always had chairs available. The attendants were always there to help and there was also always someone there to take your drink and/or food order. The service was great!!.. We were given cold towels periodically and pineapples were passed around as well...delicious! I really cant say anything bad about this property... Wailea is the most beautiful area in Maui... though it is a 45 minute ride from Lahaina and Front Street it is much more lush and beautiful than the northern area. Wailea is a bit more \"ritzy\" so you will find things to be more expensive... for instance buffett breakfast at the Fairmont is $30 a person... its a GREAT spread but pricey... if you want to go up the road about a mile to the Wailea shops there is a Longhi's there that has a fantastic breakfast for about half the price!! so there are definitely deals to find... We also ate on the property at Nick's Fishmarket. The food was excellent.. we suggest the snapper it was awesome!!.. the other resturaunt on the property cafe something (cant remember) was just average. It is a bit pricey and the food was not nearly as good as Nick's so I would skip this place... head over to the Wailea golf course next door to the Sea Watch restaurant... they have excellent views and GREAT food!.. dont forget to have the Kona ice cream pie at the end.. YUM!!... When you are in Maui some things we suggest doing... the Trilogy sunrise trip over to Lanai!.. It was worth every penny.. (about $140 a person). This leaves out of the Lahaina Harbor about 45 min from the Kea Lani... it includes breakfast and lunch and some snacks. It's a catamaran ride over to lanai to check out there beach do some snorkeling eat some great food and get acquainted with the locals and there \"little city\". It was fantastic!! This was probably our favorite day of the trip. We also did the Eco Adventure zip line tour in Haleakala. It was pretty decent and fun! If you are a beginner then this tour is great if you are an advanced zip liner they offer one in the west Maui mountains that is supposed to be better. We also did the Old Lahaina luau. Everyone has to go to a luau when on the islands... though the food was not the greatest the drinks were included and the entertainment was good. The people were friendly and put on a great show in a gorgeous location off of Front Street in Lahaina. Another thing my new husband wants me to mention... if you are a golfer and want to golf Kapalua be prepared to wait and encounter rude people. While the property is amazing and the views are unbelievable the staff there is less than par!... For a great golf experience and a great course try 18 holes at the Wailea Gold Course right across the street from the Kea Lani... the course is gorgeous and the staff is friendly!

We were very excited for our stay, as we have heard and read great things about the size and luxuriousness of the resort. Unfortunately, once we arrived, we were disappointed with the resort, specifically the pools and overall room quality. Our biggest issues were with the room. We anticipated large luxurious rooms, but once we were finally brought up to our room (it was not ready when we arrived, as we were early), we were disappointed. We walked through the room, and thought it was large with a great bathroom, but the furniture, upholstery and carpeting all seemed outdated and worn through. At times it also seemed as though the air conditioning was not working well and the air in the room felt a bit damp or musty at times, as did the couch the few times we sat on it. Once I got up and my shirt was slightly damp! But worse were the un-welcomed guests we discovered on our first day. As the bellhop was putting down our luggage, we saw a small roach. I pointed it out to the bellhop and he just said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, okay.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Then he stepped on it and my husband had to clean it up himself with a tissue. We were not thrilled to see a roach, especially since we were on the 5th floor. But we were both exhausted from traveling and hoped that it just got in from the outside (it was near the lanai door) and did not complain. The second one I did not know about. My husband saw it the next afternoon, after the room had been made up. Apparently a small roach was crawling across the pillow but he did not tell me, as he did not want me to throw a fit. Then, two days later we saw another roach on our bathroom floor. At that time, my husband went to the front desk to complain. The woman he spoke to said she would make sure housekeeping thoroughly cleaned our room and that we would not have to worry about it again. The next day, we saw another one but this time it was outside one of the rooms around the corner from ours, fortunately, it was our last night at the hotel and we were leaving the next morning. When planning our trip, we knew we wanted to stay in Wailea. Several friends,travel books and advisors suggested the Fairmont Kea Lani, as they had stayed there years ago and spoke highly of your facilities, rooms, and pools \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which were a big factor. The cost was a little more than we had wanted to spend, but decided it would be worth spending the extra money. We were also considering the Marriott, as it was a little less expensive and had newly renovated rooms. However, we were told that one of the Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pools would still be under renovations during our stay, so we decided to splurge on the Fairmont. Unfortunately, when we arrived, we were told that one of the pools was currently under renovations and would not be available for use, as well as the water slide. The concierge did not seem very surprised when we stated that we were not informed of this prior to our visit. We were not happy that the pool was not available but did not make a fuss since the other two pools were open and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just spend more time at the beach. We did spend a bit of time at the pools that were open, mostly later in the day. We were surprised at how crowded the pools were at that time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c usually around 4 pm. The adult pool was full and we were unable to find an open chair nearby, so we went to the other pool instead. There were a few kids, who were fine, but there were not many open chairs available. At both pools, we noticed there were quite a few cabanas that had open chairs but we were not allowed to use them unless we paid $150. We found that to be ridiculous. We could understand if it was earlier and we could make use of it all day and others were being used. But 1 out of 8 or 9 of them were in use and there were hardly any open chairs otherwise. Not to mention, the chairs around the pool were old, dirty, and some were falling apart. At one point, the woman next to us suggested we get extra towels to put on the arms of the chairs, as she did, since the arms were so filthy. We felt we were getting nickel and dimed on everything (I think we paid $25 for a small turkey wrap and small iced tea!) Overall, we enjoyed our trip to Maui but we were extremely disappointed in the quality of our accommodations for the amount of money we spent. We expected a high luxury resort and rooms and we were shocked to end up in rooms that would be found in a 2-2.5 start hotel, not a 4 or 5 star hotel. If we knew what we were getting in the beginning, we would have not booked our vacation at the Fairmont; we would have booked at the Marriott or another resort within the same price range in the Wailea area. Although we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve have heard great things about the Fairmont chain overall, after this experience on our honeymoon, we probably would not stay at or recommend a Fairmont hotel or resort in the future.

I attempted to get an upgrade at check in and they indicated the hotel was at capacity even though it didn't look or feel to me like it was at capacity.

At other Fairmont hotels I have seen a hotel employee at the bottom of the waterslides to keep people safe. I'm not sure why they don't do it here. The food at the swim up bar restaurant ( I cant remember the name) was really good. As you can expect, drink prices are outrageous.

I have slept on better beds in Sydney and India and will need to upgrade to the more comfortable 5 star pillowtop beds but again no complaints. It was comfortable enough... Highlights was the pool bar. Being a virgin to poolbars and giggling like a kid when I saw it, it didnt disappoint. The pool was amazing so didnt end up making it down to the beach. No opportunity to try breakfast but the overnight room service was ordinary with pizza looking like it was brought in from somewhere else and the wrap feeling like it had been in the fridge for days. BLACKOUT !! Consistent with the other post, the hotel is NOT at all prepared for emergencies. The storm was not at all that serious but was enough to take out the hotel. Thankfully we checked out the same morning as the power outage but received no apologies or compensation for the outage.", "Date": "December 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose", "Title": "\u201cAn amazing property\u201d", "Author": "BVIlovers", "ReviewID": "UR11688085", "Content": "This is my second trip to the Kea Lani and not my last.

I almost dont want to review the property and have more people discover it :) It is surperior to the crowded and too big Grand Wailea, which always gets the top accolades but I suspect they have a better PR department and advertising budget. The Kea Lani rooms are all suites, all nicely apppointed with huge bathrooms, perfect for families as everyone has a space, separate TV area for the kids and a tasteful kitchenette. The kids pool is large and never crowded, making it fun for adults too, if you want more space you can rent a cabana, we do everyday and you get complimentary drinks and fruits, as well as magazines. The slide is great fun for all ages. I find the pool staff a little aloof, last year was better than this year but they are still helpful. The beach is small, and has gotten busier over the years as people from outside properties learn about it. Fabulous boogy boarding and calm enough fro children. You can also rent umbrellas here and the beach staff is superb. kudos to all the staff, all smiling and helpful, booked all our excursions, helped the kids. The Kids Camp is so much fun the kids look forward to it. They watched videos one night and had popcorn and pizza while we went to Nic's for dinner.

Not prepared for Emergencies.\u201d", "Author": "resortexplorer", "ReviewID": "UR11488612", "Content": "It was my first trip to Maui with my fiancee, and I was very eager to impress her. Perhaps my expectations were unrealistic. We had a late arrival (about 1:00AM) and the front desk clerk was rather bland in his personality, not the first impression I was expecting. The rooms were very nice, and spacious, and I had one of the better views in room 474. The resort was nice, but smaller than what I was expecting. It could definately use a facelift here and there. The lower level staff was very respectful and curteous, However, the staff that had the most contact with the public was just OK. I had a particular bone to pick with the lady taking reservations at the breakfast buffet. I noticed a line being formed so after adding my name to the list, I followed the crowd and lined up. She told me that there was no need to make line, because her system was based on a first come first serve basis, and names would be called. About 25 folks were seated (the ones making line), and a new line of about 30 more came and my name was not called. When I approached her to ask if I understood her correctly, she forcefully told me: \"Sir, you are all going to get in, you need to please wait and be patient\". The problem is I never got a chance to say anything to her. She must have read my mind or something. She was cold and unresponsive. I felt like Adam Sandler in \"Anger Management\" when the flight attendent told him to calm down. Not cool! I just walked in and politely ( I had been polite earlier also) asked one of the waitresses about their seating system, and she finally had us seated. We had a storm that came thru on Wednesday, and we lost power to the entire resort. I was surprised at how unprepared the staff was to deal with this issue. There were only a few generators working and they were only for the lobby and other hotel areas. The rooms were pitch dark, and there was essentialy nothing to do. Even their selection of board games was rather dissapointing, and of course they wanted my credit card to borrow a worn out incomplete game of Rummy-O, that I was unable to use do to the fact that the instruccions were not in the bent tin box. The food was bland, except for the food at Nick's Fishmarket, which was expensive but good. Once the resort lost power, the cuisine went from bad to worse, and the service went from bland to outright unfriendly, even hostile in the case of the waiter who refilled my friends glass of whiskey with water, and then blamed my friend for not informing him about it. A simple I'm Sorry, we'll get you a new one\" would have sufficed. Overall, I felt that the storm and the lack of power were the main reason why all these problems were intensified. The staff seemed totally unprepared for this emergency, and the pressure was surely on them from management. A little preparation ahead of time would have gone a long way to prevent these wrinkles in their customer service. It's necessary to mention that the resort next door, lost its power also, but the generators kicked in and all rooms had at least some power. Many folks got stuck in elevators because no one had the foresight to block access to elevators running on limited generator power. I hate to think how my experience would have been if there had been a serious emergency (ei: tsunami, fire or something else). I would advise anyone planning a stay to check on weather conditions prior, and hope and pray for beautiful sunny days with no problems. Maybe like that the Kea Lani Resort might be better, as long as they are within their comfort zone. Overall, I have received service like the Kea Lani Resort's at some Motels. Not bad, but not that impresive either. Its more like the Motel Kea Lani, not a Five Star Resort. And no, I will not book my upcoming wedding at the Fairmont Kea Lani Resort in Maui.

We did the road to Hana early one morning, but I would HIGHLY recommend that anyone who goes to Hana stays the night there at the Hotel Hana-Maui. What a special place. We also loved Lahaina and the beaches on the west. Maui is definitely more developed than Kaui and has a little less magic in my opinion, but it is fun to see the surfers out on almost any beach!! The shops at Wailea are great for shopping! Also, there are some reasonable restaurants in the area if you do not wan to pay $50+ a person for dinner.

The hotel staff was superb in greeting us as we arrived. They immediately took care of all our luggage and other items as we proceeded to check in. They offered to valet the car regardless of the whether we chose to valet (self park is free and very convenient) or not. They provided very quickly tags for the luggage and car and off they sent us to the explore the hotel grounds and check-in. When greeted at the check-in desk, the employee greeted us by name and already had our reservation pulled up and discussed any special needs or events we were celebrating. She indicated that our room was not ready yet, but went ahead and selected a very special room for us on the top floor with an incredible view. She had my cell phone from my reservation process and sent us away to explore the grounds and have some lunch. The check-in process was excellent and one of the most pleasant experiences at any hotel I have visited. Once contacted that our room was ready, we received our keys and proceeded to our room where our luggage was already being delivered. The room was an incredible location on the 7th floor and had the most amazing views of the entire property and ocean. The room was a very large suite with great amenities. The foyer had a spacious closet with iron and board and perfect for storing luggage. The space also had a hidden microwave and refrigerator with space for storing snacks and other items. This area also had several AC outlets for chargers for mobile devices that always typically clutter up other areas of a room. The living area had a very comfortable sofa with great lighting for reading and an awesome view through the glass doors. The room was equipped with an entertainment center that housed a large TV, surround system, DVD player and extra speakers. The remote was very intuitive and worked all of the electronics with the single remote. Although the TV was not a LCD, it was a very high quality Sony system. The room also had a very comfortable desk for working at a laptop with a phone and high speed internet access (for a fee). The balcony was very large and expanded the full length of the bedroom and living area. The balcony was equipped with a round glass table with four comfortable outdoor chairs. The balcony also included a chaise lounge chair and table. The views were incredible from this room and every day provided an awesome location to view the sunset. A nice feature was that when the sliding glass doors were opened, it automatically turned off the air conditioner inside the room. The balcony was very large and provided an incredible atmosphere to have morning breakfast or any meal while viewing outdoor activities and recreation. The sliding glass doors also had full screens to experience the incredible weather without any bugs (which are pretty rare in Hawaii). The bedroom was very spacious with excellent furniture and decor. There was plenty of storage space in the 2 closets and drawers in all the furniture. The bedroom had a TV, two clock radios, and phone. Another nice feature of the room was the mirrors on the closet doors. One of the closets was fitted with a wall safe that has a Medco key entry. My only real complaint about the room was the size of the safe, which was quite small and limited on what could be stored in the safe. This is one of the first rooms that I had experienced with a key entry safe. The hotel provided additional safe downstairs for guests storing valuables, but was very inconvenient. I did not feel as safe with a key entry as a digital code, but that is probably a personal preference. The bed was very comfortable, but quite firm. The bedding was excellent and there were a variety of pillows from hard to soft to provide flexible and configurable sleeping comfort. I was expecting the bed to be more comfortable, but after one night of sleep, we got adjusted to the comfort of the bed. The bathroom was awesome - period. One of the best layout and functional bathrooms that we have experienced traveling. The shower was spacious and open which meant no door. It was excellent! The bathtub was very large and had a large mirror over the length of the bathtub. The room was configured with two white pedestal sinks. There was a large mirror across the full front length of the bathroom that provided my wife and I both access to mirror anytime in the room. The additional door from the foyer provided access to the bathroom without having to enter from the bedroom. A portable mirror with light was also provided. There were plenty of AC outlets along with a hair dryer. The hotel provided plenty of towels for use and they were refreshed during daily cleanings and nightly turn-down service. We absolutely loved and enjoyed our hotel experience at the Fairmont Kea Lani! The grounds were impeccable with 3 pools, outdoor cafes and restaurants. The hotel has plenty of walkways and the grassy areas are some of the best you will find. The outdoor chairs were comfortable at the pools and plenty of towels were provided to guests. The pool cabanas were very expensive ($150 per day) and were available due to low demand for their rental. The hotel also provided outdoor poolside massage service. The beach was very convenient, but not very large. The beach was private for the hotel and was not crowded, but was not very conducive for beach walks due to limited size. There is a 1.5 mile concrete trail across the beachfront of some of the Wailea hotels and properties. Although the Four Seasons is regarded as a top 5 star property, I would rate the Fairmont as high from our experience and also the incredible grounds as compared to the Four Seasons. I have not stayed at the Four Seasons and cannot compare the entire hotel experience, but we did like the Fairmont's grounds, location, pools, beach, etc. better that the Four Seasons from our walks by the properties. If we are fortunate enough to visit Maui again (twice in 5 years), we will definitely stay at the Fairmont Kea Lani again.

The Kea Lani is limited to dealing with Avis, so that's important to note for next visit. We were greeted with leis, a cold cloth and an icy guava/orange juice drink. The bell boys then loaded our luggage and us into golf carts and drove us all over the property to get aquainted with the area and the amnenities. Soon we were at the main pool drinking Lava Flows at the swim-up bar where bartenders Dane and Noe took great care of us all week long. The service here is amazing. From the front desk to housekeeping, they treat you like family. No snob factor here. That's refreshing for a 5 star resort. The concierage booked many reservations for us several weeks before we arrived. The Old Lahaina Luau is worth the drive to Lahaina and really invokes the spirit of the Islands. On property, Nick's Fish Market was terrific, as was Caffe Ciao. My favorite dinner on the island was at Mama's Fish House in Central Maui. Pure Hawaiian Deliciousness. We stayed in an ocean front 3 bedroom Villa. Be sure to request one in the front row (numbers 1-12, I believe). The view from the private lanai was spectacular. We also used the BBQ and the plunge pool. The refrigerator was stocked with juices, milk, soda, fruit and other goodies. The turn down service included slippers, a fresh orchid on your pillow and a cold bottle of water at each bedside. They even emptied the dishwasher and tidied up the kitchen every evening.

Though the lobby is impressive, the rooms feel STICKY, musty, and generally not well cared for. I've read some of the other reviews that indicated how \"big\" the rooms are and although it is an all suite hotel, the rooms give off a distinct 1970s vibe. Decor and furniture look old and worn, bathrooms were only moderately clean (I found several long hairs twisted around the sink knobs), and the hallways outside the rooms remind me of a mental institution. The hotel itself appears to be a cross between a Moroccan inspired theme park and old and outdated Hawaiian decor. For over $400/night, I do not think this hotel lives up to the rate. At $200/night, this room would feel reasonable. We've eaten at both the Polo Lounge and had room service. I would classify both experiences as below average with a sandwich that included potato chips as a side costing upwards of $30. Overpriced and poorly delivered. Everything is served in plastic cups here and makes you feel a bit like you're at a frat house pool party. On a positive note, the beach (although very small) is lovely and the water is quite kid and adult friendly. I was irritated by the fact that we had to pay $10/hour to rent a beach umbrella. The sense that you're being nickel and dimed by your hotel CONSTANTLY is rather unsettling. This is our first time to Maui and we really regret choosing the Fairmont.

The room was really big, plenty of room for our family of five (although I wished the beds were Queen, not Double - pretty small for my tall husband). The pools were beautiful and not crowded at all (probably because it was the fall)! The water slide was closed, but they provided an inflatable water slide for the kids. The beach was nice - we saw big sea turtles often! The hotel also offers free laundry facilities, which was wonderful. (Buy your detergent at the gro store, not the hotel sundry shop).

The bottom line is that you will not go wrong with the Grand Wialea, Four Seasons or the Fairmont so don't stress. People who have had bad experiences I feel are just hard to please in general or it was flat out a fluke. From the moment you pull up, your car doors are opend and the bell captain unloads your luggage. You are then greeted with a lie and guava juice. Check in is friendly and fast. TIP: Join the Fairmont President's Club as you will earn points and get free in-room internet and access to the business center. You can also check in through the speacial President's Club line, if there are any lines at all. TIP: If you are from an area with an ocean anywhere near then a deluxe ocean view room is not that important. Get a ground floor room on one of the pools. We had room 116. Your door opens right up to a manicured grass area that surrounds the pool. Grab a couple of loungers under an umbrealla and come and go as you please back and fourth to your room through the patio. Get up in the morning, make a pot of coffee, open your sliding glass door and walk down to the beach to watch the waves for a few minutes. Relax, you're in Maui. The enitre staff is awesome and just as good as Four Seasons or the GW. If you want your car, call down to valet and it will be waiting for you when you walk up. If you want a later turn down service, simply write houskeeping a note and they will accomidate you. Nick's - Okay, this was my only negative but maybe they just had an off night with the food and service. Both were lacking. Our favorite restaurants were Spago and Duo.at Four Seasons. Ask for tables outside on the patio and go right before sunset. They make some mean mojitos in the Four Seasons lounge if you want to take one in along with some live music before dinner. Pool Loungers - Okay, I lied...this is my other bone to pick with the Fairmont. The pool longers need to be updated so that they are on par with Four Seasons and GW. Grab a couple of towels and a cocktail and you will soon forget about the loungers. The actual pool is better at the Fairmont but nothing tops the GW pool. All are luxury. TIP - Go to the shops at Wailea and hit the ABC store for water, mags, snacks, etc. It's inexpensive there and fun to walk around. Icecream at Lamperts is awesome too. TIP - Cheap eats in between Sapgo. Hit Maui Tacos in Kihei or Denny's for breakfast. If Woody Harilson can go there, so can you. Get Tacos to go and bring them back to your room to eat them on your patio. Hope this helps. Fairmont is awesome and you wont be disappointed unless you are just really hard to please.

They do offer to bring a meal packed for you to grill to the room, which we should have done. We found the entry and grounds to be well manicured and beautiful. The hotel is white stucco and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear dirty to us. I think salt water and humidity can cause the stucco to look more aged, but the hotel is not in disrepair as some comments suggest. We watched the sun set from the open air lobby bar most evenings. Beautiful view. The hotel is hillside with a short walk to the beach; the villas are the closest to the beach. The hotel has an adult pool and a family pool. They were refurbishing the lower family pool and slide while we were there, but that still left an upper family pool as well as the adult pool open. The adult pool is ideal for those who want to relax in quiet and for honeymooners, etc. There is a beautiful walking path along the beach that stretches from the FKL to the north end of Wailea. It is a great way to start the day with a vigorous 4 mi. RT walk and to check out the other hotel properties along the way. The restaurants in the hotel are excellent. Breakfast is choice of their buffet or off the menu at the Kea Lani restaurant. We had lunch most days at Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Ciao which is an outdoor restaurant near the adult pool. The food is very good, especially the tomato bisque and the calamari. For dinner, we ate at Nick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fish Market which is the best dining we have had on Maui. Ambiance: Romantic and a beautiful outdoor setting with tiki torch lighting and a beautiful view for sunset. Service: impeccable. Food: outstanding. You must have the snapper with parsley mashed potatoes. The menu is so appealing that a decision on just one item is difficult. Another plus about going in September, we always got a table at Nicks. We used the complimentary car service provided by Kea Lani to visit the Shops at Wailea and had an excellent lunch at Tommy Bahamas (located at the Shops at Wailea). There is also a Ruth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris, Longhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Cheeseburger Island Style at the shops. As this was our fourth visit to Maui, we chose not to rent a car and just hang out for a change and it worked out well. The staff was prompt in driving us and picking us up, a nice tip is always appreciated by the staff. We used Wailea Limousine to and from the airport and found them to be prompt, polite and very friendly. As a general note to first timers in Maui, Wailea is a more upscale area and is about an hour away from Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anipali and most activities (except for Haleakala and Hana). So, if you plan to do a lot of planned activities such as boat trips, etc, you could end up doing a lot of driving. In the mornings you will find yourself in the middle of Maui\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rush hour on this drive. If it is your first time to Maui and/or you have kids West Maui may be the best choice (Kaanipali and Lahaina). Although, you will find that area very busy with traffic and crowds in comparison. From check-in, dining, in room dining, room maintenance to check out we found the staff to be extremely warm and helpful. If you can, plan your trip after Labor Day when all the kids go back to school. It is quieter at most places and you are more likely to get upgrades. We always go in September and find that service and all is always better when the hotels and restaurants aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t packed to the brim.", "Date": "October 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wayland, MA", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at the Kea Lani\u201d", "Author": "rodeo2244", "ReviewID": "UR10029117", "Content": "We stayed at the Kea Lani when it was added as an overflow hotel to a conference at the Grand Wailea.

The staff was friendly and the grounds were very well kept. It's a great hotel in an area loaded with high-end hotels! Between the Fairmont, Four Seasons and Grand Wailea, the GW had the best kept grounds hands-down but everything else there seemed rather average when comparing these three hotels. The Four Seasons was very crowded when we went over to that property, but is worth seeing since the artwork and designs are pleasing. Quite frankly, I think it's overvalued as I'd much rather have the suite at the Fairmont or the large grounds to walk at the Grand Wailea and I would not stay at the Four Seasons if I did have the option to choose again, it just seemed crowded and closed-in (no privacy). Besides, we were mostly floating around Maui and Molokai during our stay as do most people, so it's best to balance the value in my opinion. The bathrooms at the Fairmont (as well as the balcony) really make the room and the stay quite comforting. The kids pool at the Fairmont is separate and the presence of kids was minimal, unless we went over to the kids pool to use the water-slide (it was wild). Breakfast buffets at the Fairmont are really nice to have in the morning, I understand that sometimes breakfast packages there are the way to go (we had this) as the cost to be nearly $60 a day per couple, but the spread is quite nice. There's a gourmet cafe at the hotel to shop for other food items that might complement your meals. Coming from New York, I actually did not find the gourmet shop or other areas of Hawaii to be expensive, but if you're not familiar with New York or Southern California prices, you could potentially think it is. My only complaint about the hotel would be when we arrived, the bell staff was unable to take our bags to our room, as they were either short-staffed or just too busy as we waited 5-10 minutes before taking them ourselves, but it was not a huge deal for us. For dining out, I would recommend Nick's Fish Market at the Fairmont if you stay or don't stay at the hotel (our favorite), Huma Huma at the Grand Wailea and Mama's Fish House (on the north side of the island at the beginning of the Road to Hana, which is awesome).

The hotel could not have been any better, period. I read another comment saying the grounds are small, and the pool was small. It was larger than the Four Seasons, provided more room, a swim up bar, and many more lounge chairs. I did not use the spa or work out facilities, but I did use the beach, and pool areas and they were kept up wonderfully with incredibly nice staff. I got a breakfast package and i would recommend it. Otherwise breakfast is almost 30 bucks a person, I prefer to get it for free myself. Beyond the price, it was great, a full pot of coffee, omlets, fresh fruit, pancakes, french toast, it was great. We ate at Nicks, cafe Ciao, and the Polo Beach Grille. Nicks was incredible for the price, not as bad as I thought. IN fact, Cafe Ciao was just as bad as Nicks, and Nicks has much better food. Beautiful setting as well and views. Wailea is a great area, not too many people around, including at the hotel, and it is beautiful. I will also say that the staff was incredible...we were honeymooners and they had a bottle of champagne and fresh chocolate strawberries waiting for us in our room and gave us the best seat in the house at Nicks, for a sunset view...not only that but everyone said congrats and called us by name. The beach was incredible, crowded, but not that bad and the staff was amazing. We had plenty of room to lay out and take a few walks, sunset was amazing. Also...for activities we did the Snorkling trip at the hotel south of the Fairmont, it was nice, smaller food portions, but nice and the fish and tirtles were great, so was the staff. Also, went to a Luau at the Renicance, it was nice, overpriced, but all of them are...the prices are tough. Definately recommend going to Lahina for cheaper places, especially the Lahina Fish Co, it was OK...and even Tommy Bahama at the Shops at Wailea (Wed night live music) was cheaper and good.

Our room was large but the decoration was quite old fashioned. The bathroom was lovely but I thought the sofa's in the living room were better suited to a 3 star hotel in the Costa's. Our room constantly felt damp which we put down to the over zealous air con! We were lucky to be facing the beautiul fountains and thought we had a great spot. However, we were awoken at 4am on the first night of our honeymoon to the sound of water pipes banging as someone was showering upstairs. The next morning we told reception and the lady's response was \"what do you want me to do about it?\". Charming. We were eventually moved to a room where the standard was less adequate than the room we had just left, i.e view of a brick wall and a very small bathroom!. I told reception that I did not want to stay in this room but we were then told that all of the rooms at this level were taken and we would have to pay so many hundred of extra dollars a night for the next room up. At this point I felt very let down. My husband 'expressed our disatisfaction' of travelling thousands of miles, paying $600 a night to be woken up by their shoddy plumbing on the first night of our honeymoon. An occasion we can never replicate. We didn't want a free upgrade, we just wanted a room that was the same standard as the first one, with pipes that didn't rattle at 4am! We then asked to see the manager and were swifly placed in another room with a lovely view of the sea and a lovely big bathroom. This aside the resort was nice and big. Three pools to choose from was great, especially the adults only pool. A bit shocked at the $100 price tag for the cabana's especially as they were free at the Four Seasons. We dined at Nick's Fishmarket on our first night but were not that impressed. My husband's lobster was overcooked, however, my scallops were fantastic. We thought that the lady coming round taking pictures of couples was a little tacky for a resort of this standard and she was fairly pushy in her manner. We had lunch at the Polo Grill a couple of times which was very nice. The beach here (Polo beach) was nice and secluded. We snorkelled just round by the rocks and saw lots of turtles, fish, eels and even a white tip reef shark. At this point I promptly swam back to shore even though I know they are really quite harmless! Be careful here though as the ocean gets very rough very quickly.

The pool needed to be cleansed throughly. We had daily maintenance, however it was pretty built up with residue. The bedrooms in the villas are large and the bathrooms are great. There is a huge closet upstairs that seemed to be an after thought. The living room area and kitchen are not accpetable for this standard of hotel. We found it to be quite run down and in need of a major updating. There is a couch and 2 chairs, the floor is tile with an indoor outdoor rug. The furniture is worn and the decor is thrown together. The kitchen has grantie countertops, but the cabinets appear to be the originals. There is very limited cooking supplies, pots, pans etc.. The floor is tile and is in need of repair, lots of dents. Eventhough the staff did clean daily, we still did not feel like the place was clean. It's just showing age from lots of people staying there and it is not good. As we have a 1 1/2 year old we booked a day room before our flight home. The rooms inside of the hotel were much nicer than the villas. If you do not need a kitchen, this could be an option.

However, the Grand Wailea looked too crowded and cattle-call-ish for us, and the Four Seasons would not allow us to book a Partial OV room with our 2 kids - they required 2 rooms or a $1000 per night suite (which we were not willing to do)!! We are soooo glad we chose the FKL. The service was top-notch, pool was beautiful and relaxing, yet fun for the kids (water-slide, basketball hoop). The breakfast buffet was great, but we actually got a few boxes of cereal and utilized the in-room refrigerator for an easy breakfast on the lanai most days, and saved ourselves $100 a day that we of course spent on other things - like a pool cabana (fabulous) and nice dinners. Dinner at Nick's was the best we had on the island - much, much better service and menu than at the Grand W. The best thing about the Fairmont are the very large rooms that are perfect for a family - it was like getting a suite without paying the $1000 per night!!

We arrived on an early-afternoon flight and drove directly to Wailea. I knew check-in was late afternoon, but hoped that we would be able to get into a room before 4pm. We arrived about noon, checked our bags and registered. The front desk clerk took my cell # and said that we would be called as soon as they prepared our room. We had lunch at Ciao, service was great, food was OK. We killed a 2nd hour strolling the grounds checking things out. We have stayed at the Grand Wailea but wanted to stay at the Fairmont this trip having heard good things. The grounds, pool area, landscaping, etc... don't hold a candle to the Grand Wailea, but I don't think many places in the islands do. We checked back in at the front desk at about 2pm and were told \"Check in is at 4pm\". At about 3:45 as my kids were melting down I asked to see a manager. She was apologetic and within minutes led us to our room, a deluxe ocean-front. The front desk clerk that I had dealt with was completely indifferent, it was obvious that rooms had been available earlier than 4pm. In fairness the rest of the staff was very good to excellent for the duration of our stay. The hotel is clean and well maintained. The ocean view was fantastic, but I thought it was unusual that there is a condo complex close to the water that is included in your view from this property. One of the wings of the hotel would have views staring directly at this other building... We had an excellent meal at Nick's, the premier restaurant, dinner was approx. $275 for 2 adults, 2 teens. The rest of the food at the resort was just OK. You expect meals in the islands to be expensive, but I thought $28 per person for a mediocre breakfast buffet was too much. There is a deli-coffee-bakery-little store place where you can buy small meals & snacks. You'll get a much better breakfast at Longhis if you walk (fairly long walk, or short drive) to the Shops at Wailea. The Shops, by the way, is a nice center with everything from a general store to a Tiffany's. Good breakfast, good cheeseburger-lunch-type place, swimwear, sunglass & clothing stores, Lapperts Ice Cream shop, too. My overall impression was that with a pre-tax room rate of $775 per night, $45 per day for a beach umbrella and expensive dining & drinks the Kea Lani is a 2nd tier hotel charging top-tier prices. It is a very quiet, low key stay, not much going on. If this is what you're looking for it is a good, not great hotel.

If you are used to second tier hotels, this property will probably be great for you. If you are used to staying at the top hotels, you will be very upset what you get for the price.

We waited for 2 hours for the room, after being told that there were no upgrades available - without even checking. Had a medicore lunch at the pool restaurant with weak service. While there, we noticed maybe one server walking around the pool. We booked a full ocean view room for a hefty rate and told them that this was a honeymoon trip. Once we got our room, we realized that the view was once of an ocean...45 degree BUT it overlooked a construction zone - dirt mounds and all. It was the weakest room that I have ever been put in for that kind of money. We called the Four Seasons and booked a room there. This is probably the worst part of the story...when I went down to inform them that we would be checking out, the guy ONLY said, \"OK, we hold a two night deposit and we will send a bellman up to your room in five minutes.\" That is it! Not a question about what was wrong or if they could do something. NOTHING, just see ya. Upon our arrival to the Seasons, they immediately upgraded our room to an ocean front, huge room and sent champagne later in the evening. The scary thing is that price was the exact same! The property is utterly beautiful and food is great. You never need to leave the grounds. The Fairmont, however, could be fine for a large family. All the rooms are suites and they have a large water slide etc. At teh same time, if you can afford it, the Four Seasons has an amazing rec room for kids complete with a video game room.

The Four Seasons was in our budget and we seriously considered it, though my aunt kept swearing we'd love the Fairmount. I was nervous about going with the Fairmount because I knew the Four Seasons was rated as the number one property on the island. I was made even more nervous by the reviews of some people here. But let me tell you, we loved the Fairmount from the moment we arrived. We chose a suite rather than a villa because we'd just spent a fortune on our wedding and didn't want to dig that hole deeper. We still wanted something higher end, but not over the top expensive.Our room was spectacular. The lani is enormous -- stretches the length of the entire suite from bedroom to living area. It has a chase lounge, full-size dining table and four chairs (we ate multiple meals out there). Ocean views as far as the eye could see with views of the pool and torch lighting ceremony below at night. The bathrooms are just amazing -- marble everything and bigger than most people will see in a hotel. The cleaning staff was fantastic -- everything was always clean and tidy every day. The rooms were quiet -- we never heard people on either side of us. The food at the resort was good, and they have a cafe/store where we often bought and split a hot sandwhich for lunch, or a salad, brought it back to our room and ate on the lani. The staff is amazing -- they do everything you would expect at a high end resort -- set up your chairs on the beach, lay out your towels, set up the umbrella. Even the younger staff was courteous and friendly. The lobby is beautiful -- ocean views from the minute you arrive. Comfortable chairs by the bars. Great location on the island. We had no complaints about the rooms. We cannot say enough good about this resort! We were thrilled that we saved the extra money by staying at the Fairmount instead of the Four Seasons -- we didn't feel we missed out on any luxuries. It gave us that much extra spending money to blow on shopping (The shops at Wailea, ladies,) or dining out and entertainment. Do yourself a favor and find the Waterfront restaurant near the Maui Ocean Center. The best seafood in Hawaii -- hands down; Zaggats agrees. It's a hidden little place, but has stellar service, the most delicious ways to prepare your fish, and charming views of the boats docked oceanside. They also have several non-fish choices. The Seawatch is seconds down the road and it's a well priced restaurant with breathtaking views of the ocean and golf course -- good breakfast food.

We walked along the beach and checked out both the Four Seasons and the Grand Wailea. Four Seasons grounds and pool are no match for the Kea Lani and Grand Wailea was just too busy with sunbeds in rows as far as the eye could see. Kea Lani grounds are spacious set back a little from the beach. We felt we definitely made the right choice. Good trips with the kids are the Tropical Plantation and Iao Valley. You can do both in a day easily. All our kids really wanted to do was stay at the pool and beach.

Back then, this place was the epitome of luxury. We were in awe of the pristine white buildings and lush green grounds, and the rooms were impeccably appointed with gorgeous furniture and marble bathrooms. Kip, who greeted us on our first day there, was one of the most personable and helpful bellmen we'd ever met. On our most recent trip last summer, however, we were less than impressed. The grounds are still beautiful, but the accomodations leave much to be desired for such an expensive hotel. We booked two rooms, a deluxe ocean view suite and a regular ocean view suite. Oddly enough, the \"deluxe\" ocean view barely had a view at all due to some overgrown palm trees. After numerous calls to the front desk and two room switches later, we finally got the view that was promised (which was quite lovely). But the rooms themselves are definitely dated - in particular, the furnishings and wall treatments are in dire need of an upgrade. Also, the elevators consistently smelled musty and we did not experience the outstanding customer service we had become accustomed to in years past.

We rented a cabana one day which costs $100 for the day, but you get free fruit, water and soft drinks. Which by the pool you're going to spend that anyway. I bought some lunch one day at the deli and it was pretty good. We went to Nick's for dinner one night and it was ok, but not great.

Second, there was a free washer and dryer, complete with detergent, right on our floor. We werent in a villa, just the regular rooms, but to have this added convenience right there was terrific!

This was our third trip to Maui and the first to this property. I had considered the Grand Wailea as we wanted a suite for our family of 4 - our travel agent, knowing how much we appreciate a less crazy kind of trip, encouraged us to consider this property. I'm so glad we did! I'd read some iffy reviews and wondered how we'd feel -- but our attitude was simple -- we were on vacation with our kids in paradise - as long as the hotel was nice and the staff nice, too we knew we'd enjoy it -- and we sure did. We arrived very late after a delayed flight, so missed the leis on arrival -- but the kids were delighted to get them the next day. We were very impressed with the beautiful, open lobby and quick check in. Staff was extremely accomodating, which we appreciated after travelling from Indiana. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The pools are lovely and well kept as well. I run every morning and really enjoyed the path from the Kea Lani down to the Renaissance (saw whales from it several mornings!) and I liked the chance to check out the Grand Wailea and Four Seasons. The Grand Wailea was a zoo -- people were staking out chairs at the crack of dawn and I noted staff policing the groups to keep folks from getting a bit crazy -- which shouldn't be necessary. The chairs are stacked one on top of each other too, which reminded me of Atlantis (we were there for spring break last year). We sure didn't need that. The Four Seasons is nice but not nearly as open in feel as the Kea Lani -- it won our raves hands down. Yes folks stake out chairs at the Kea Lani, too, but it's not nearly as bad. You can rent a cabana for the day (which means a higher level of attention) or find an umbrella (we did that) and folks do move around from beach to pool etc.. There were quite a few families but what would you expect? If you want an adult only vacation then I'd look at the Four Seasons or one of the condos throughout the island. Our hectic lives (my husband is a heart surgeon) mean that when we vacation we don't mind paying for quality - and we expect it. This hotel lived up to it and then some. The mini fridge conked out on day 1 - within just 5 minutes of calling there was a new one at the door. One evening we returned a bit early from a whale watching cruise to find housekeeping (and by the way there are two staff per room) finishing turndown. They were very nice and made a point of asking if we needed anything else -- using our names -- THAT impressed us. My daughter liked the orchids on the pillows. We opted for the breakfast buffet - the kids really liked that though my husband and I aren't big eaters - but the fruit was fabulous! Lunch for us was around the pool and the kids again liked the menu (again, my husband and I tend to skip lunch). We couldn't get a reservation at Nicks earlier than 8:30 pm so we visited their other restaurant, Sorrento's , which is down the street -- it was very good. Our favorite dinner restaurant was Pacific O's in Lahaina -- the best fish we had by far (we are seafood fans) This time of year is prime whale watching season, and we went on the Pacific Whale Foundation's cruise, which was terrific - they really know their stuff and you can tell they are passionate about what they do. We stopped counting at 14 whales! We'd read tips about stopping at Safeway for sodas and snacks - we did that and filled the mini fridge - beats paying the small fortune for sodas time and time again. Save your $ for the great shopping at Whaler's Village or the Shops at Wailea! I would encourage visitors to sign up for the President's club -- you'll find that you get free internet access (vs. 14.50 per day), speedier check in and check out, plus you can earn rewards after a 10 night stay -- and it's free to sign up. I needed to check email each day so that free sign up was a great thing to do -- do it before you leave and make sure your travel agent gives the hotel your number -- and bring it with you in case that person forgets.

It was my husband's retirement celebration so we booked a 3 bedroom villa for our children and granchildren: 5 adults and 3 little ones. My husband and I (how smart are we?) had an oceanview suite in the hotel. Everything was wonderful. The staff is so accomodating and friendly. We really felt like it was home. The pool area was perfect for us. We walked over to the Grand Wailea a few times and it was so big and so busy. We could keep track of everyone at the Fairmont pool.

Everything is so expensive and we too have traveled extensively. Our first trip to Safeway for breakfast things, juice, beer, wine, milk and snacks was $400. We shopped again for steaks, baked potatoes, and salad for 7 people and it was another $200. Be prepared. Things can be 3 times as expensive. When we were checking out, I noticed many shell shocked people checking their bills. Lava flows are $13.00. One afternoon, my husband, my sons in law, and my son racked up a bar bill of $200., not proud of that but it's the truth. For us, it was the trip of a lifetime and we thoroughly enjoyed it.

We stayed at this resort from Feb 17 to 26th 2007. I have stayed at every Wailea resort in the last ten years on this stretch, the Grand Wailea, the 4 seasons, the Marriott, and now the Kea Lani. We really enjoyed the rooms, they are absolutely huge. We booked two deluxe ocean front suites, about $800 per night, took my in-laws and two of three children. My wife and I paid the whole bill, six first class airline tickets and two deluxe ocean front suites, almost $24,000, so we are not afraid to spend for a vacation. I say that so you are aware of our budget, we are not bargain shoppers. You never know when reading a review if the person writing it is used to meager accomodations and is then blown away by a resort experience. Check-in was very quick, with baggage service also very quick. We were greated with leis and cool towels, and after 13 hours from Ohio, and then another two getting out of the airport and to the resort, it was very welcome. The rooms again are very spacious, nice bathrooms, with two sinks, large soak tubs and a walkin shower, no door on the shower for privacy. The room has awesome balconies, or lanai (sp), we really enjoyed looking for whales from the lanai. We were in room 408, and also had 404 rented. The rooms do have a nice sized fridge, we would recommend getting soft drinks away from the resort and keep in the fridge. We didn't want to go to Costco like others recommend, the shops at Wailea have ABC and Whalers General, you can get soft drinks for $3.69 for six cans, beats paying $4.00 per can. We don't sweat the small things, but I won't throw money away either. The breakfast buffet is really good, however after eight mornings gets old, and if you are on the package they would not let us order of the menu. Lunch was generally at the Polo Grill, the service leaves something to be desired, the staff seams a little distracted. When the place wasn't that busy, we sat for at least ten minutes before our order was taken a couple of times. We did not eat at the resort for dinner, after breakfast and lunch there we needed a break, so we went offsite. The Italian place just down the road across from the shops at Wailea is incredible, we went there twice. Can't remember the name now though, but the location is the old pro shop of the Wailea Blue golf course, try it you will like it. The pools are very nice, and bathwater warm. Plenty big for all the guests, and the water slide is just ok, nothing spectacular, but we've been to Atlantis is the Bahamas four times and that will spoil you as far as pools and water slides go. The resort is loaded with families, so if you are a couple looking for peace and quiet, try the four seasons. If you have kids, this is definately the place I would go, it isn't the zoo the Grand Wailea is, we went down and walked through the Grand again, and I was glad we were at the Kea Lani. However my wife and I were at the Four Seasons last February, and we missed the resort, we will go back to the four seasons again next year when we go alone. The Kea Lani did nothing wrong, it is a fabulous property, but when we go alone we have found our place and when we take the kids we have found our place.

Even though we were paying $480 a night - we were told that we'd have to pay another $180 a night for the better view. Booked for 6 nights, I was astonished that they priced it so cost-prohibitively when otherwise the room would go empty. We then checked with the concierge about about golf and scuba outings. They did have our tee-time scheduled, but made no arrangement or presented options for scuba even though we called a week in advance to get a dive trip arranged. We heard nothing about the dive the next day so we called to check on status. They advised us that all boats were full (a fact we learned was simply incaccurate when we ultimately booked ourselves on a dive trip the day after). We actually pulled out the yellow pages to look up dive shops since both the concierge and activities desk were basically incompetent. It actually gets worse. We lounged by the pool on a couple of afternoons and found them cluttered with used towels, plastic water bottles and completely devoid of any staff. When you're paying $12 for a rum and coke slushy, you certainly expect to get it without walking up to the bar and flagging a waitperson. Really . . . gets even worse. We decided to golf again (at the Emerald Course - which was definitely a highlight of our trip and highly recommended). Concierge arranged our tee time and we asked that they have the bell staff bring my husbands set of club and a loaner set of clubs (compliments of the hotel - nice) to lobby. We pulled our rental car around and the bell staff placed both golf bags in our trunk. When we arrived at the golf course and pulled out the loaner set for me, we realized they'd actually given me another guests clubs. We then contacted that hotel to have them retrieved and another set brought over. When the driver from the hotel arrived, he stepped out of the car and said to me \"you should have checked the bags before putting them in the trunk.\" Really . . . he said that to me, even though I had nothing to do with placing the bags anywhere, and even it I had, he was totally unprofessional and rude. I couldn't believe it! For prices this high, there are much better options down the beach - like umm, the Four Seasons.

There is a kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool and a separate adult's pool, which was perfect for a young couple with no kids. Servers come by and take your drink or food orders so you never have to leave the pool or your lounge chair. They also sometimes come by with pineapple slices and cool towels. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heaven!! Also, try the breakfast menu at the Kea Lani Restaurant. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delicious! The suites are quite spacious for two people and could comfortably fit four. The pictures of the suites on the website are accurate. The furnishings and decor are somewhat dated in that it looks like it was designed with a 70s style in mind. But I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too hung up on that. You still get all the modern conveniences and comforts: refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, large comfy beds, etc. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re someone who wants more modern looking rooms, then you may be happier somewhere else like the Four Seasons. However, you should note that the standard suites at the Fairmont are larger by at least 200 square feet. Housekeeping is fabulous and the rooms are kept super clean. The hotel has one free washer and dryer on each floor. They get taken quickly so you need to get there EARLY. If you decide to stay at the Fairmont, you must sign up for the President's Club. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no charge to join and as a member you get a lot of free perks: daily newspaper, high-speed internet, usage of the gym. Also, take advantage of some of the complimentary activities the hotel offers. They have kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activities, a morning yoga class for guests (which I took advantage of). Of course, to get such first class treatment and accommodations, it costs you. But it's worth every penny. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to go back.", "Date": "February 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "alchu", "ReviewID": "UR6811973", "Content": "We just spent 2 weeks at the hotel.

I was impressed that after meeting or talking to you once, all the staff remembered your name. We booked a garden view and I was going to inquire about an upgrade but my husband wasn't feeling well after our very turbulant flight so we took the room assigned to us. I was so glad we didn't switch. We were on the first floor with a patio lanai that opened onto a large grassy area with lush tropical plants and overlooked a great fountain. We could just exit our patio and walk to the pool or beach without having to walk back down the hall, up the stairs and through the shops and deli area. The kids club was right next door but didn't pose a problem for us as we were out most of the day and then the room was empty at night so there was no one next to us. Even though we were set pretty far back from the beach, we could still hear the crashing waves at night. The one downside about the beach is that it is soooo small and pretty packed during the day, but big beach is about 1 mile down the road and we found a nice small but uncrowded beach less than a quarter mile down the road between some new homes that are being built. The resturants and deli are a bit expensive but I expected that, and the food and coffee drinks were very good. The hotel also had an in house bakery and i would definitly suggest picking up dessert in the deli - heavenly! I loved our room, it was large and well appointed, but the bathroom was my favorite part. Because the room was a suite, it felt more homey to come back to at the end of the day with plenty of room to spread out and relax. Everything looked new and very clean and well maintained. We were also there when they were doing alarm testing and they said they would start at 8 am, but we didn't hear anything till much later and it was not a big deal at all. As for wear and tear around the hotel, I didn't notice any. The Four Seasons is next door and I personally did not like it near as much, so glad we picked the Fairmont. I have stayed at other Four Seasons properties and found the hotel and staff to be comparable at the Fairmont. As for the clientel, Four Seasons has a more well known reputation I think and draws a higher matinence crowd, Fairmont seemed much more laid back and unpretencious. I could go on forever, I LOVED IT! one last piece of advice for travelers, don't plan too much. We didn't do 1 thing we planned to (volcano, road to hana etc.) Once you get there, just enjoy the Aloha spirit and go where the day takes you.", "Date": "February 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed out Stay\u201d", "Author": "ESH07", "ReviewID": "UR6789389", "Content": "Stayed at the Kea Lani from Feb 6-11th, 2007. Overall the hotel is great. Lobby is open air and breezy, service impeccable and the rooms are all a very generous size (around 800 sq feet). Here's a breakdown of my opinion...... Rooms: I arrived to the hotel sick with what I thought was a cold and turned out to be pnemonia so you could say that I spent a lot of time in our room. All rooms are suites with large bathrooms, separate large tub and walk in shower. Rooms have two televisions, small refrigerator, microwave. Rooms were cleaned daily and were immaculate. The cleaning people were so nice, and even brough me tea and chicken soup one morning when I didn't leave the room. Each evening the rooms are refreshed with new towels, overall, turn down service was wonderful. Our rate was $325 and I really felt we got a great value. Service: Overall service at the Kea Lani is great. Concierge, bell hops, and pool staff were all very helpful and attentive. There is food and beverage service at each pool, I found the service at the adult pool to be slower than at the \"kid\" pool and the upper level pool. Throughout the day, people come by with large pieces of pineapple...such a nice (and easy) touch for the hotel to do. Food: You must eat at Nick's Fish Market (make a reservation or eating at the bar is great too)....it is truly outstanding. It's worth the $$$ as well....and you should know that you will pay through the nose for food at the resort. This is where I didn't feel we got a value (aside from Nick's which is awesome and worth it). The Kea Lani has pool side service for lunch as well as the polo beach grill (same menu and prices as eating poolside) and sandwiches were upwards of $23/each. There is a deli that we ate at a lot, which wasn't cheap, but you could get a sandwich or breakfast foods (it's sort of a gormet deli, so you can get everything from cereal and bananas to yummy cheeses, tuna and chicken salads, pizza,fruits, etc) to lunch to snacks and beer. I would say for breakfast and lunch we spent most of our money here and felt we got great food at a better value. Pools and Grounds: Clean and nice, but teaming with people. Very kid friendly resort. There is a kid pool where the majority of families are, as well as an adult pool which is (obviously) adults only. I actually found this pool to be somewhat boring. The \"upper\" pool was our favorite, and we found it to mostly consist of adults. Great service up there too. Overall, this is a very busy resort, don't come if you want quiet...there are people everywhere! Beach: Beach was nice, not very large, this isn't a resort you come to to \"walk the beach\". There is a beautiful, winding nature walk (for lack of a better title) that winds around in front of many of the other resorts in Wailea (Four Seasons, Grand Wailea, Rennaisance). The walk is great for exercising and checking out some of the other hotels in the area. Beach itself (in front of the Kea Lani) is free of rocks and good for swimming and boogie boarding. The surf is moderate and it doesn't get very deep. Because I don't like the crazy, busy resorts I don't know if we'd return. The value for the rooms (in high season) at $325 I thought was reasonable, but the cost of food or doing ANYTHING else was so expensive....then again so is most of Hawaii in general! I have to say that while my review of the hotel is accurate, because I was sick I really didn't get to go around and see much of Wailea or Maui, so it's hard for me to comment on more. I did make it over to the shops at Wailea (large open air shopping Mall and it's great and worth the trip (you can walk on the nature path or along the road fairly easily). My husband played golf on two occasions and LOVED the Emerald course (about 5 min from the hotel by car).", "Date": "February 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "BC Canada (best place on earth)", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Property and Outstanding Services\u201d", "Author": "BCgurl", "ReviewID": "UR6787611", "Content": "This property is first class all the way.

We stayed 4 days at the Fairmont Kai Lani corner suites and 3 days at the Ritz. Unbelievable view in an incredibly spacious suite. But for $1000+ a night, I expect that. Lobby is spectacular. Service is for the most part first rate. Nick's Fish Market is incredibly good. But the hotel lacks things you expect in a true five star hotel. if we had not spent $1000 a night, I would probably overlook the following: 1. Lots of wear in common areas and in wood in rooms. Paint smudges, dirt etc. The concrete around the outside pool and gardens is worn and full of dirt. Walls are dirty and smudged. The hotel has a tremendous amount of heavy wood trim. Its all aged terribly. Cracks, scratches, peeling. The cabinets in our room look like they needed replacing five years ago. Same with the wooden elevator trim. Apparently all rooms were renovated recently. I suspect for budget reasons, they skipped redoing the wood. At the rates they charge, that is not acceptable. 2. Internet access for wireless has been out for 30 days. I mentioned to the manager that wasn't really in keeping with what they should have and she shrugged her shoulders, politely smiled and apologized. 3. A notice arrived in our room that audible smoke alarms would be going off from 8 am to 3 pm every day of our stay, as part of maintenance. So far we haven't heard them so maybe its away from us. But why would they start this at 8 am? 4. Room service items left out by maid after clean up were not picked up all day. 5. Sound proofing could be better. You can hear plumbing and some noise from surrounding areas. Having said all this our room is unbelievably nice. But its also a corner suite with the best views. My guess is that we could get similar views at other hotels at this price. All very little things but given the price unacceptable. We walked throught he Four Seasons and unquestionably the common and pool areas are much better maintained. Its ironic that the service and condition of the Ritz was better than the Fairmont. The reputation of the Ritz in Maui suggested the opposite but our room there was impeccable, albeit dated in decor. Everything worked.

The room was wonderful, clean, and the king size bed very comfortable. The bathroom was perfect with a large marble walk-in shower and a very large tub. We enjoyed having a fridge and microwave in the room as we went to Safeway and got some breakfast rolls and bagels and had them with our coffee(in room) on the balcony which had a full size table and chairs. Pure Heaven!!! One morning we actually watched several whales and their calves frolicking not far off the beach. BEAUTIFUL CREATURES!! Take your binoculars!! The buffett at the Fairmont was also very good as was the food at\" Nicks Fishmarket\". Great service there too!!! The hotel has three pools(one is an adults only) and we could always find a lounger near the pool. We enjoyed the personal service here too such as the cold washcloths and the fresh pineapple. Only complaint here is that they allowed people to reserve loungers practically before dawn and often times those people wouldn't show up for hours. Or, one person would stay with about five chairs and hold them all day just in case rest of family joined them.

Their Tahitian Prawns are better than any lobster I've ever eaten!!! Prices are reasonable and portions are generous!! Their lava cake is \"to die for\"!!! Mamas Fish House was also excellent.

The huge 800 sq ft suites are much more economical than getting 2 rooms at the Hyatt or The Grand Wailea.

We bought a little box of detergent and were able to wash and dry our swimsuits; AND we went home with clean clothes! 5) Free activities: free yoga classes, free kayaking and scuba classes, free entertainment (torchlighting ceremony and live entertainment in the lobby.) 6) The humongous bathroom and the bath amenities!

My mother-in-law spent some 'alone' time reading in the extended lobby area which had a comfortable lounge area that overlooked the grounds. She said she felt like she was in paradise. We had all our needs met and then some. I also want to make a comment about the spa. One afternoon my husband pulled a muscle in his back and the following morning, he could barely get out of bed. The spa took him asap that morning and did a great job on a massage for him. He felt so much better afterwards! The trip to Haleakala was fantastic, our day trip to Hana was also beautiful (go to see the black sand beach!), I recommend the Old Lahaina luau, playing golf at Kapaluah, and if you like sushi, definitely go to Sansei's! I also recommend the pineapple tour and going to different floral gardens around the island. There is one on the way to Hana called the Garden of Eden that is beautiful and another called Enchanting Floral Gardens that drove my mother-in-law around in a golf cart so she wouldn't have to walk. Next time, we'd like to go to another island since we've been to Maui twice, but I just wanted to give the Kea Lani another well deserved positive review. I simply LOVE that hotel! It's smaller than the Four Seasons and the Grand Wailea which I like. I don't want to feel lost in a sea of people. I'd recommend it to anyone!

My husband played golf 3 days and my kids and I loved the pool. I signed them up for the kid's camp, and it was merely a converted room, so I decided to opt out of the full day I signed them up for, and pick them up at noon for lunch. They were so mad at me! They had an awesome time searching for lizards, doing crafts...They went back for a second day! I missed them, but I had a great time at the adult pool! Although it was Thanksgiving, we did not have too difficult a time finding chairs by the pool. On the day I did have a hard time, we asked someone to move one for us, and it was there in a jiff. Thanksgiving in Paradise (Fairmont's dinner), was magical. After 5 days, we went to the Hyatt. I upgraded to the top floor corner suite. The kids loved the pool, but it in NO way compared to the Fairmont. The Breakfast was yuck, and we had to wait in a line going down the stairs for 40 minutes. I also stayed at the Westin, which was better then the Hyatt, but the room are tiny. When we go back, we will stay at the Fairmont.

Our Fairmont Hotel stay did not disappoint! We stayed at the Four Seasons resort next door on our honeymoon a few years ago and thought it was outstanding. We decided not to stay there this time because of the reconstruction going on there. We decided we would try the Fairmont property this time. My husband and I were warmly surprised how helpful and accommodating the staff was at the resort. We loved the spaceous rooms. We also enjoyed the open shower/bathtub design. Even the little ledge along the bottom of the sliding glass door did not bother us. The bed was a bit on the firm side for us, but not a big issue. We took advantage of the sunnyside room package and loved the buffet for breakfast. Even saved the leftover muffins/fruit for later snacking. The refrigerator and micro wave oven were convenient devices to use during our stay. They even adjusted our bill when we realized that ordering over the menu was not included in the sunnyside package deal, they still applied all our breakfast costs as though it was. The facility and pools were elegant and serene. Loved the quiet beach with gentle surf! We especially enjoyed the Pro Dive outfit that helped us with all our scuba diving needs at the lower pool. The Dive Masters were both professional and knowledgeable! I even earned my scuba diving certification in just three days because they made it so easy and comfortable to go at my own pace. The excursion (off property) dives planned by the Dive Master were perfect for both my husband and I! The restaurant, Nicks Fish Market, was decent and the fish was well prepared and fresh. We are from the Wine Country area north of San Francisco and know something about good food. The big difference being that the prices are significantly higher at a luxury resort on Maui. Worth a dinner none the less. We were also accommodated with a great table location on the two nights we dined there. note: The restaurant at the Four Seasons \"Fagarros\" is our favorite place for dinner! Great views of the ocean and a wonderful menu! The Fairmont Hotel will give you a complimentary drive there if you call the concierge desk. Disneyland it is not!

The rooms are huge two room suites and well appointed, and the kichtenette was a big plus becasue we ate breakfast on the balcony almost every morning. Somebody complained about the open shower but we loved it. There have been some complaints on TA about renovated vs unrenovated rooms, but all the rooms I saw were renovated so that shouldn't be an issue when booking. The great thing about the Kea Lani is that the three pools offer something for everyone. We spent most of our time at the hotel hanging out at the upper pool which has a swim up bar that overlooks the ocean. The pools and beach never felt over crowded and the service we received was excellent. One of the best features of the Fairmont is the canoe adventure which is complimentary to all hotel guests. It was a great way to experience Hawaiian culture first hand and get close to the sea turtles, sea urchins and other fish life. While we were there, we celebrated our first anniversary at Nick's Fishmarket in the hotel. We were given the best tyable in the restaurant, and when we went upstairs after dinner our suite had been filled with rose petals (see pictures).

I was really disappointed with the Fairmont. Since the Four Seasons were doing renovations, our travel agent told us about the Fairmont. He mentioned that the Fairmont was an elegant hotel, not a family hotel. I did not want to be in the middle of large families with children. I wanted a quiet vacation to spend some quality time with my mother. Well, it ended up like being in the middle of kiddie DIsneyland. Since the hotel is built around the large children's pool, one has the feeling of being in the pool with the children. For 3 mornings in a row, a man brought his 4 year old to the pool. As the child screamed for the father's attention because the father was working on his computer, the whole west side of the Farimont was awoken. Mind you it was 5:30 am. I found that the service was good at the Faimont, but did not merit the prices they were asking for. The grounds were beautiful but the pool area was a bit chaotic. Lots of used plastic glasses wating to be picked up. I also found it appalling that after it took me 18 hours to arrive at the Fairmont, they asked me to pay 10 dollars an hour for a beach umbrella. Now, how classy is that??? I agree with the other reviewers that the Fairmont is in dire of renovations. It seems a bit used...the paint, the cottage cheese walls hallways... The Spa is fine. A bit small but I was happy with my $145 massage. The yoga classes will keep you in shape. I went over to the Four Seasons to have dinner and to check it out. I was really sorry to have not booked my vacation there. I would of rather of stayed at the Four Seasons, even during renovations than return to the Fairmont. The Four Seasons was elegant without being snobby. It is definitely above the rest .

(this made our travelling nightmare so much better) - Quick and prompt service to our room with very friendly staff. - Room service was remarkably fast and still really good. The view from our room looked out over the pool and the ocean. Absolutely beautiful!! - The landscaping and upkeep of the grounds is spot on. - At night, a man blows into a conch shell and lights all of the tiki torches on the grounds. It really sets the mood at night. - The tour desk is very helpful in assisting you on picking tours. They offer really helpful and good advice. - The location of the hotel is ideal. Its right near the shops at Wailea and there are many great local restaurants around the area. - The pool staff come by with fresh pineapple and cold water. Great service!! - The room was amazing. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The bathroom is huge and the tub is big enough for two. Extremely soft bath robes are also provided. - There is a large selection of teas in the room. We loved the pineapple/orange tea. - The lobby is open air and gorgeous. - The pool is refreshing and the water slide seemed really cool. Dislikes: - The shower has no door or curtain...its just open...its a little awkward. - The restaurants were on the expensive side (but that is the type of hotel that it is). We ate off the grounds most nights. We also ended up going to the local supermarket and just buying stuff for lunch for ourselves and it saved a lot on our budget. - You have to pay for the chairs and umbrellas.

This was our 2nd time staying there. We got a wonderful ocean view suite. We stay at the Fairmont because all the rooms are suites, and with our 2 kids, it gives us the breathing space we need. We return to the Fairmont because it is not overly crowded and we've never had to fight for lounge chairs by the pool. It never feels \"touristy\" with a bunch of people crowding you like we've witnessed at other resorts. Lawrence (President's Club manager) made us feel welcomed and the room service was done twice a day. The on site food there is average, but much better than the Grand Wailea (which we always check into for 2 days at the tail end of our trip so the kids can access their pools and slides). The Fairmont offers free transportation anywhere in Wailea. We really didn't even need our rental vehicle as they \"cheuffered' us everwhere! We took advantage of it to go to the Shops of Wailea a few doors down. We walked over to the Four Seasons for a massage and also took a nice stroll over to the Marriott for a Luau (probably our last as we've already done two of them in the last 4 years). There is a nice sidewalk located behind the resorts and beach. The breakfast buffet was much better at the Fairmont, than at the Grand Wailea. We recommend eating at Tommy Bahama's, Sansei (for sushi and japanese cuisine), Spago's (at the Four Seasons next door), and Mama's Fish House (what a nice view if you request a table by the window). Bubba Gumps is a fun place to stop in for a bite if you are in Lahaina doing a little shopping on Front Street. We love the Wailea side of Maui as it is less windy and they don't get as much rain. If you want to snuba/snorkel, we recommend Aqua Adventures as it is family owned and holds no more than 35 people on their boat. The service is much better and they don't pack you in like a bunch of sardines on another boat where we witnessed people fighting for water space as they were snorkeling! Air Maui is a great experience if you choose to do the helicopter ride. We felt like we were on the travel network! We capped off our trip at the Grand Wailea for the kids, but knew (as we've stayed there before) it would be a down grade for us as far as room space and service. They were quite busy in the pool area (as expected, even though it's off season), compared to the Fairmont. You are not waited on as often by the pool. Not a big deal, but they come around more often at the Fairmont to ask you if you need anything. Plus at the Fairmont, you are offered fresh pineapple and chilled face towels by the pool. Not so at the Grand Wailea, but understand that it's a bigger resort, and they also hold large groups for conferences. They do have a nice spa though. Our kids always enjoy their water facilities with all the slides, rope swing and pools.

We have had a superb time and have really enjoyed our stay in this excellent hotel. We booked on Ocean View Room which in our opinion is worth the extra. The view is beautiful and just adds that little extra to the room experience. Our room was a refurbished one and very nice, clean and comfortable. The hotel is occupied by lots of couples having a romantic break and lots of families. In my opinion, the hotel does a good job of catering to both sets of client. We have spent most of our time round the family pool but it is certainly not a kids playground. A lot of couples spend their time here as well hving fun on the water slide. There is an adult only pool as well. Although the hotel is quite full, there is no sense of crowding and it has been easy to get sun loungers etc. The service is first class and nothing is too much trouble for the staff. When the breakfast team found out about my wife's allergy to wheat they were off finding gluten free bread off their own back - so helpful. The hotel has wireless internet (you need to be a fairmont presidents club member to get it for free - a quick enrolment required). Wireless is only available in the foyer and out by the pool.The rooms have a cable connection. Thr grounds and foyer of the hotel are very nice indeed, well looked after and a nice feeling of space. We walked along to the Four Seasons and Grand Wailea. I liked the Four Seasons and that would be a good choice for a couple. The Grand Wailea by the pool just felt so overcrowded compared to the Kea Lani that my wife immediately was put off it. Dinner at Nicks Fish House at the Kea Lani was a highlight for us. A wonderful meal. Well worth a trip is Mama's Fish house on the other side of the island on it's own private beach. Book early for this experience. Maui is lovely, Wailea is expensive but we loved it. So many temptations in the shops and if you are a lover of art then this is the place for you with art galleries everywhere seliing many fine pieces.

The Fairmont is a nice hotel. Please let me start out by saying that we usually stay at small hotels, 60 rooms or less. The Fairmont has somewhere around 400. We knew this going in as we had a special occasion to attend at the hotel. Although the rooms are large, clean and have a nice bathroom they are very average. The beach was great but very crowed. The adult pool was nice and quiet, no kids were swimming and playing marco polo. Reserving a cabana by the adult pool was a very good idea and we did that while making our reservation with the hotel. I recommend that if you are going to rent a cabana you request one that is pool side as they do have other cabanas not so close to the water. We had a great dinner at Nicks Seafood restaurant in the hotel. The wine list was extensive and we were able to have a wonderful botthe. Keep in mind our dinner for 2, after tipping, was almost 600.00. We did have 2 bottles of wine with dinner.

Hakkone in the Prince Resort - Great sushi and tempura. Extensive Asian menu. Great red bean ice cream Activities: Warren and Annabelle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Magic Show in Lahaina - Great show. Not your usual magic show. You are served pou pou platters and drinks while listening to piano before the show. The show itself is hilarious and worth the cost. Parking can be validated for 4 hours at the show. Recommend booking well in advance (show books up 7-8 days before show) This is the only magic show I would go back too. Wailea Shopping Center - Great shopping for upper end stores (LV, Fendi, Gucci) and other stores. Tommy Bahama, Tori Richard, Gap, Benetton, ABC stores are here. Feast at Lele (luau) in Lahaina - This lu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122au provides food and dances from four Polynesian areas (Hawaii, New Zealand, Tahiti, and Samoa). Great variety and loved the Samoan fire dancer. Notes: There is a Costco, K-mart, hardware store, surf shop, and Krispy Kreme Donuts located near the airport. Everything is more expensive in Wailea and Lahaina If planning on driving the road to Hana, plan on 3.5 hours each way driving time from Lahaina.

The room was spacious enough for our whole family to spread out in. We have 3 children (2, 4 and 6 years old). We ordered the rollaway bed (which they charge $30 for). My oldest daughter slept there. Then we took the advice of other members and ordered the foam pad for the pull out couch. My 2 younger daughters slept on that. The room was very clean and the bathrooms are AMAZING. The snail shell shower was terrific. We requested, but did not get, a renovated room. But, from what I could tell by peeking in rooms that were renovated as we passed by, we weren't missing a whole lot. The lanais are very large and the lip on the door referred to by other members didn't make any of us trip or stub our toes. I guess we all just pick up our feet just in case when we walk outside to a deck or patio. Anyway, we did the breakfast buffet and it was wonderful. Anything you can imagine they have for you. Wonderful fruit, juices, pastries, omelets, pancakes and on and on. That kept us satisfied until we had an early dinner (with the kids being so young they play hard and get tired early). HOWEVER, the \"bird situation\" is very bad. Request to sit inside (which is still open air, but has a roof) and COVER your plate if you have to get up or it will be covered in birds. Really gross, but the birds don't go in by the buffet area. Just protect your plate and table. The beach by the Fairmont was quite rough while we were there, but the beach in front of the Grand Wailea and Four Seasons was perfect for our kids' ages and a short walk or drive. The water was clear and warm and the bottom was sandy. Perfect Hawaiian beach (at least for our needs). We had so much fun playing in the pools at the Fairmont and then going to the beach each day. I thought the service at the Fairmont was excellent. I do think, however, if it had been myself and my husband without the kids that we would have chosen to stay at the Four Seasons. The Fairmont is the best in Wailea for kids. On the flip side, the Grand Wailea seemed to attract a real \"water park\" crowd (think the Griswolds) and we were glad we didn't stay there. See my other review on our experience at Humuhumunukunukuapua'a at GW. The staff at the Fairmont was great. They have a car waiting to take you anywhere you need to go in Wailea (shopping, dinner, etc.). They respond quickly if you call for a ride back. Very nice people.

It's incredible to have found a hotel that is really all about the guest! Our reservation was last minute in a \"moderate\" room (840 square feet) which would put most competitors' product to shame and I do mean most five stars! Deluxe doesn't start to explain this place -- imagine if I had requested something better than their lowest graded room. At this Fairmont, you really feel special, almost celebrity-like, they actual care that you came to their hotel and want to impress upon you that you made the right decision. We were cautioned that our view would be just OK, but in Hawaii, even an island view can be idyllic. The service at the Fairmont is impeccable, the architecture unique and now I have learned is Moorish and Hawaiian, combined, not unlike the parts of the historic Royal Hawaiian Hotel on Waikiki Beach. Nick's Fishmarket was good, yet not over the top, as was the breakfast buffet.

The rooms are nice, the color of the draperies was very loud and floral and therefore weird. The pools and the common areas are the weak points. The hallways are lit with flourescent lighting and they're dim and spooky. The flooring is Wal-Mart ceramic tile. And I believe they use flourescent lighting in the main lobby. We compare this to our recent stay at the Grand Wailea and while the rooms there were much smaller ( no suites) the Grand Wailea was way more opulent in the grounds. The cabanas are $75 a day and reserved a year in advance, but less than half of them were even used. Paid for but not used. So that was kind of weird. The lounge chairs are standard \"Target\" issue loungers, and are so uncomfortable that we only were able to relax on them by laying upside down so the metal bar doesn't kill your back. The pools are smallish and 80's. In short, the rooms are great. Huge, opulent with freaky drapes. The grounds are 80's and you feel like you are staying at a Hampton Inn in Schenectady when you walk the hallways. Oh do take advantage of their car shuttle service. They drive you anywhere in Wailea, and pick you up too. Honestly, I would stay at the Fairmont but try to fenagle a wrist band and use the pool and spa at the Grand Wailea.

I was a little nervous because I had read some mixed reviews in the weeks before I left. I will try and give you an honest opinion of the hotel. First off, most services at the hotel are expensive, but I think most people are prepared for this before they go. After all, it is a five star hotel (definitely worthy of that rating). Chris Rock was a guest while I was there. Sure, some of the pricing is a little over the top. I dont think they need to charge $18 for a hamburger or $27 for the buffet breakfast, but they got you, and to their credit, there are other less expensive options available at the hotel. They have a really nice coffee shop that you can have bagels & coffee for $5 if you want. As for dinner, the restaurants on premises are not really any more expensive than most others on the island. We ate at Nicks at the hotel, Sarrentos, Spago at the four seasons (talk about expensive), and the seaview at the golf course across the street. Its hard to complain too much about the pricing when you are eating dinner overlooking the pacific and dolphins are jumping out of the water. There is a reason it is expensive. We went to a luau at the marriot, it was good, not great, but it was what I expected, and we had fun. Some of the complaints I read about the hotel from other reviewers seem a little trivial. I requested and received a renovated room, and it was absolutely beautiful. I read complaints about the lip on the sliding patio doors, and I have to tell you, it is a ridiculous complaint. Open your eyes and you wont hurt your toes. Yes, there are a lot of kids in the main pool, and it is noisy, and they do let you throw balls around and play water basketball. They also have a huge, quiet, adult only pool, so I dont really understand how anyone can complain about that. With that said, the hotel is certainly family oriented, and the four seasons would be better if i was honeymooning. The grounds of the hotel are really beautiful, the beach is really beautiful, the staff is very friendly and accomodating. The only glitch that we had was that we requested a pool cabana a month before our arrival, and they lost our request. To be honest, we really didnt need it.

We stayed at the Ritz Carlton Kapalua for the first 6 days and the fairmont kea lani the next 6 days. We will never return to the Fairmont - even if they comp our stay. It was worse than horrible. We arrived at the fairmont at 2:30 - room not ready (as was the problem all week with guests checking in). The front desk gal put us in a room on the 4th floor overlooking the kids pool and over the lobby that had no view. We paid for a deluxe ocean view room. After protesting she arranged a room on the 5th floor - again the entire view was blocked by palm trees and it wasn't available until 6pm. I actually walked in on a guest still in the room at 3:30. After that didn't work out the front desk manager arranged for us to stay in a room on the 6th floor in the far tower closer to the four seasons hotel. We finally got in the room at 6:30. We walked in and the room was FILTHY. There was urine around the toilet, mold all over the bathtub and shower, the air filter was black with stuff hanging through the grate, the tile was clean on the walls and black on the floor (I ran a washcloth over the grout in one area and it came off completely black), the lamp shades had at least 5 layers of dust, the bed was short sheeted, etc. They returned to clean the room 3 times and when we left 6 days later - the urine was still hugging the grout around the toilet, the mold was still around 2 sides of the bathtub and in the shower, and they short sheeted the bed 3 out of 6 nights. After arriving from the Ritz my entire family was upset. The Ritz was immaculate, the staff more than friendly and accomodating, the grounds clean, every lounge chair given a terrycloth pad with towels, etc. The fairmont has lounge chairs by the pool that have no padding left in them and wont give you a terrycloth pad to help cushion unless you rent a cabana. Maid service was erratic - sometimes not cleaning the room until 4pm or later. The staff was \"trying\" to be friendly (and it was obvious). The bartenders short pour the fruit drinks at the pool. The parking is worse than AWEFUL. They are forcing guests to use the valet parking at $15 day plus gratuity. They should just make it all valet and list it on the website as such. My best advice is stay at the Ritz Carlton for less money - more discounts on golf - better tennis facilities nearby - friendly relaxed environment - and for less money. Ritz provided bottled water in the room, in the lobby, complimentary while the fairmont charged $3 bottle each. The cost of the room at the Ritz was $200 less per night (and that was on the concierge level!). If something isn't on the menu in the dining room - they will make it or get it for you. My daughter wanted chicken noodle soup (no problem), my husband wanted a certain type of cake (they offered to make it for the next evening). Wherever you choice to stay in Maui be sure to check out Aroma D'Italia in Kihei for AWESOME italian food and Fred's (also in Kihei) for fun relaxed atmosphere and really good mexican food. Both restaurants very reasonable.

With that said, The Kea Lani met all of our expectations and then some. We booked our room 6 months in advance, and I called a month prior to our arrival to ensure our \"deluxe oceanfront\" was in fact oceanfront. I now realize there are some rooms that are billed as oceanfront and may only have partial views - but the deluxe rooms were certainly all oceanfront (see pictures). The staff was unbelievable. We arrived at 1pm and got right into our room (I realize this may have more to do with luck then the staff). The pool staff was great as well. We didn't go near any pool but the adult pool - the staff at the adult pool was great. Drinks are expensive, but that's to be expected... the service was fast and courteous. We ate at both Cafe Ciao and Nicks, and ordered room service one night. All the food was fantastic and I can't complain about the service in any manner. We pre-booked a poolside cabana prior to our arrival. I did so based in part because some of the reviews on tripadvisor mentioned a crowded pool. The adult pool was never crowded - so we probably didn't need the cabana, but it was a nice touch nonetheless. The other pools looked crowded - but not nearly as bad as the pool at the Grand Wailea. We walked the coastal trail one day and stopped in the GW and the 4 seasons. 4 seasons looked nice - but you would have to give me a free room to stay at the Grand Wailea... what a zoo!!!!

The staff eager to bend way over backwards to make you happy. Did I mention trade winds....It was way way warmer in Chicago and we didn't miss that at all as we were enjoying our Chocolate rum smoothies at the swim up bar.

We would swing between the pool and the beach and we just let them know and they would watch things for us. Highly recommend the surfing. First -what to wear for surfing lessons: Important-wear rash guards that cover your whole arm. For bottoms where the border shorts that come down to the knee if you can get it. You know that whole look of Billibong. From football we used under armour. The boards are styrofoam and they scratch as you are learning to work the board. You might come away with mean little rashes. Otherwise, buy it at ABC cheaper. My daughter who is a swim team strong swimmer-was up and on her board in one hour. I opted for the private lesson. Shop around and find the company that will pick you up and drop off. Make sure you get what you pay for-these surfer boys are good but unorganized. Your kids will love this........trust me on this. I believe that these two properties are neck and neck in ratings. I would choose who ever had the best deal for your needs. Side Note: My latest top and best hotel is the Fairmont Orchid. We spent four nights there staying in garden rooms with amazing views of mountains and golf courses. Left there wanting to do more but had to pull our selves away kicking and screaming. This is a classy and simply elegant hotel that has been lovingly cared for. The volcano tour rocks.....in more ways than one....Do a combination of the above hotels mentioned and you will be happy you did. Food is expensive. Try sharing meals and having salads instead. It's too hot to stuff yourself. The Safeway on the Pilani free way down the road has a good selection of wines and beer and mixers. The Kea Lani has a refrigerator so that way you can save.

We arrived the Hotel at around 2:30 p.m. The front receptionist was very polite & friendly. We reserved a Partial Ocean View Suite Sunnyside Breakfast Package & were extremely delighted to receive a double upgrade to a Deluxe Ocean View Suite. The lady said our room was not ready and she would call us on our cell phone. We rec'd her call at exactly 4 p.m. It would have given us a much better impression if she actually said our room would not be ready until the official 4 p.m. check-in time. The suite was like the size of 2 connecting rooms. The \"Full Ocean View\" was magnificent. The washroom is big & has a utility box which include useful items like cotton balls & buds, mouth rinse, small packs of Woolite, sewing kit, etc.. On our third day of stay, when I opened the utility box, a small cockroach was there! I didn't want the cockroach to crawl around, so I wrapped the whole utility box with layers of towels and put it into a laundry bag. Both Housekeeping & Front Reception didn't seem to care much and no one come to pick up the box for until at least 15 minutes. There was no apology, nothing was done, and the utility box was not even replaced. On the fourth day, when I opened one of the closet, another cockroach was there! Again, no one seemed to care. Breakfast at the Hotel was of acceptable quality with reasonable variety of choices. We especially like the egg/omelette freshly made to your order. The chef was efficient and the line-up was never too long. My son & I loved their Miso Soup. Service quality varied dependent on the server. I made reservation for a Cabana before my trip, but decided to cancel it. It seemed awkward to have to pay for shelter when you have already paid for your stay. The same is true for umbrellas at the beach. Tips for your stay: 1. Join the Fairmont President's Club for priority check-in and free internet access. 2. If you arrive early, visit (a) Costco (right outside the Airport) for mac. nut souvenirs (their prices are the cheapest), wine, or boogie board (around $20). The Hotel's Polo Beach is excellent for boogie-boarding. Both adults & kids will love it. Hotel rental is $8/ hr or $20/ day; or/& (b) Saveway (on the way to the Hotel). 3. If you do want to check-in early, after you check-in (you will, most likely, not get your room b4 4 p.m.), go to Shops @ Wailea (close to the Hotel) instead of hanging around at the Hotel. Have a nice lunch at Longhi or get some water, snack, etc. from the ABC Shop there, instead of hanging around at the hotel. 4. Spago, at the Four Seasons, has nice ambience and okay food. Reserve a table at the Lanai via OpenTable (for dining points). Spago has kids' menu and kids receive an appetizer pizza free. If you have 2 kids, you probably only need to order one kid's meal. The Fairmont Hotel has a driver who can drive you anywhere in Wailea free. We took the service to go to Spago as we did not want to drink & drive, and used the same service from the Four Seasons to go back to the Hotel. 5. Mama's Fish House at Paia had the best food and service among all the restaurants we tried in Maui. It was right by the sea, and thus the scenery was also great. 6. Old Lahaina Luau was a 45-min. drive. Food was mediocre as in most dinner shows. Atmosphere was good, but service was poor. I regret not choosing one which was in Wailea area. My son loved the Hotel.

My advice: don't arrive a minute before the so-called \"guaranteed\" check-in time (4:00), and, if they offer you an upgrade, don't expect it to be ready when promised. Given that we were paying $650/night for the room, I was infuriated! The desk clerks were unapologetic. The desk manager was courteous, but he didn't finally turn the upgraded room over to me until just minutes before I needed to go back out. He also comp'd us a dinner at Caffe Ciao ($75 for pizza, 2 glasses of wine, bottled water, and a dessert), but that did not make up for the missed promises and the delay - and, when I checked out, the dinner charge was on the bill! I had to relive the whole situation with the desk clerk before the charge was removed. Based on past stays at the Grand Wailea and Hyatt Kaanapali, we expected a level of \"aloha\" that was lacking at the Kea Lani's desk. The desk clerks and concierges always seemed to be on the phone or avoided making eye contact with waiting guests. The bell and valet staff, however, were pleasant, prompt, and always eager to help. Our 1-BR suite was clean, pleasant, quiet, and comfortable (except for the sofabed) and had a distant partial ocean view. The DVD player was not working, but an engineer came right away when we called, and, after fooling with it for half an hour, ended up replacing it. We thought the nightly turndown service must be a joke. The maids seemed to wait until we'd put out our \"do not disturb\" sign before putting one of those little \"we couldn't get in to give you service\" signs on our door every night, no matter how late we were up. We had booked a \"sunnyside\" package, which included a bountiful, tasty breakfast buffet. The Grand Wailea and Hyatt's buffets are served in beautiful surroundings, but at the Kea Lani, the rather small, narrow breakfast room is next to a pool, and it gets messy and crowded. The Caffe Ciao deli serves up good sandwiches and desserts, but it's overpriced - $36 for a turkey sandwich, 2 bottled drinks, and some crackers, a meal that runs less than $15 at the Whaler's General Store in the Shops at Wailea. The Kea Lani's dining options are convenient, but they're not a good value. Restaurant service is strictly on \"Hawaii time\" (slow). We had an excellent meal at the Grand Wailea's Bistro Molokini, an open-air restaurant with a beautiful ocean view, for about the price of the breakfast buffet at Kea Lani ($56 for two). We also had a great dinner at Tommy Bahama's Tropical Grill in the Shops at Wailea. We won't stay anywhere but Wailea when we're on Maui - Kaanapali and the whole Lahaina scene is much too crowded, too much traffic - but I doubt we'll stay at the Kea Lani again. It didn't live up to our expectations. I only mark it \"above average\" because the suite accommodations are such a cut above the typical hotel room.", "Date": "July 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cIdeal for families -- like home, but better\u201d", "Author": "sfwork", "ReviewID": "UR5411566", "Content": "Maybe there are older rooms and newer rooms?

It's the little things: Like at the breakfast buffet (which is fabulous) the waitresses would give us plastic containers so we could take extra fruit for the kids to eat later; the pool attendant that blew up our son's swim raft with an air tank; the man who installed two bed rails literally 10 minutes from the time we called to ask for them; and the car attendant who played with our kids until they went wild, and the other random staff members who gave us spot-on tips for eating and exploring around the island. And finally, the facilities: the pools are lovely, great for kids, the beach was BEAUTIFUL and had great attendants that brought you towels and umbrellas if you needed them. Also, all throughout the water areas there was drink and food service and on more than one occasion a person came around with cold pineapples. Hello, can you say luxury. I'm sure the Grand Wailea or the Four Seasons has these same services, but it takes me back to the rooms -- they are really suites, so once we put the kids to bed, we could close the bedroom door and watch a movie, or enjoy a drink, or just hang out without huddling under a blanket with a flashlight.

I'd request this room again (room 209). Room service was exceptional and prompt (even early one day and called in advance to ask if it was OK to deliver the food). Housekeeping did a fantastic job as well. The only complaint was tiny brown ants on the desk and wet bar......not a nuisance but definitely not acceptable for a Fairmont! I felt the staff was terrific other than the concierges.....they could have an attitude at times..... We ate both at Nicks Fish Market and Cafe Ciao. We all LOVED Nicks including my 5 year old who got a bowl of goldfish crackers to munch on while he waited for his dinner. The service was amazing and the food impeccable. Cafe Ciao - while we were disappointed to find out we could no longer take pizza back to our room, we were pleased with the food. The service however was awful. We had to ask the busboy for our son's dinner that our waiter (with zero personality) had forgotten..... oh, well. We ate at Joe's and found it to be incredible - one of our best meals on Maui! If you snorkle, some of the very best snorkeling was right off Polo Beach in front of the Fairmont. To the right an awesome reef with huge beautiful fish and a few small turtles and to the left great tide pools but that's where the giant sea turtles \"hang out\". It was amazing to watch. We were in waist deep water and the turtle swam right up to us!!! Also worth the walk - \"White Rock\" and worth the drive \"5 Graves, 5 caves beach\". It's a black rock beach but once in the water - WOW!!!! We also drove up to Makena Beach - right in front of the Maui Prince Hotel and if you go to the rocky area to the left and swim out and then towards the cove it's awesome! I LOVE Wailea. We were in Kaanapali for the 1st 5 days and at the Fairmont for the last 5. I love that each resort has it's own little cresent of beach, I love that it's more laid back, I love that the hotels are more \"removed\" from the beach and I love that the weather is hotter and less rain. Overall, we were all VERY pleased with the Fairmont. Would I stay there again? Definitely. I feel it's worth the money to have a beautiful suite with a microwave, fridge, and enormous bathroom as opposed to a very small hotel room (I've seen the 4 Seasons and for what we had you'd pay $1,000 a night for what we had for $515).

We had been staying at kanapaali previously and thought it would be nice to explore wailea. The hotel is beautiful, the architecture is interesting and it looks like a cross between an arabian nights fantasy and a greek villa. The lobby has a bamboo garden and chinese stone sculptures, very serene. Our room was very large, bed was good with soft pillows, bathroom was fantastic with huge tub. Everything was clean and housekeeping was prompt and immaculate. We stayed on the top floor and had a 'garden view' which faced the hills, I think it was probably better than paying extra for the ocean view (I can't imagine how much of the ocean you would end up seeing anyways). Food is very expensive at this hotel, so we bought our own bottled water, juice, banana bread from costco. Internet costs $15 a day and sometimes the connection doesn't even work- fortunately we weren't charged for this. I think its strange for a luxury hotel, the grand wailea next door had wireless internet, so did the two star condo we rented in kanapaali. They should get with the program. Cafe ciao had very good service and some healthy dishes, tasty salads. I liked the bento box at the polo lounge, especially the coconut prawns. I noticed the pineapples sold in the hotel store was 3 times more expensive than it is in safeway. Pools were nice but extremely crowded. Even the adults only pool was crowded and barely anywhere to sit during mid day. Cabanas have to be rented for $75 a day. the other pools were infested with screaming children. Kids were everywhere, even in the restaurants late at night. This was quite a shock given how pricey the hotel is and the number of weddings and honeymooners that go there.... definately not as romantic as I'd thought. The beach at the hotel is so-so, quite small, better to walk down the nearby path to neighbouring beach or drive to nearby Big Beach and nature preserve. some amazing animals and birds there, and excellent snorkelling nearby. We bought our snorkelling gear at the Kmart in kahalui for $15 which worked out well, considering snorkel rental is $8-9 a day at the hotels. Shops at wailea were interesting as well. i'd recommend going to Lahaina for souvenirs instead because the same goods are priced much cheaper there. Kiehi had great restaurants including Sensei for sushi. Everyone at the hotels, shops and restaurants in this area were very friendly and welcoming. Definately an upscale area.

Our last 3 nights were in Wailea at the Fairmont Kea Lani(the first part of our trip we stayed at the Hyatt in Lahaina which was great!) Our experience at the Fairmont was good. We tried to check-in at 2:30 even though we were given a 4:00 check-in time, and though we were initially told our room wasn't ready they quickly found a room for us and told us we would be upgraded from partial ocean view to an ocean view suite. The suite itself was nice. Large marble bathroom, tub, shower, 2 sinks, separate living room and bedroom. I don't believe, however, that we were upgraded to an ocean view room even though that's what we were told. It was more a partial ocean view, which overlooked the adult pool, grounds, the detached suites, and then the ocean. I didn't complain only because we booked a partial ocean view anyway. The pros of the Fairmont Kea Lani was the beach, which was beautiful and not too crowded, chairs included; the pool bar and grill's smoothies were very good; Nick's Fishmarket restuarant had excellent food, service, and atmosphere; it wasn't really too crowded at the hotel compared to some others; and the breakfast buffet was good. The cons were that it was very expensive and having stayed in Maui before (including the Hyatt Regency for the other part of our honeymoon), you can stay at other hotels less expensive for better or equal accomodations. Other cons were that housekeeping was erratic in terms of cleaning times. The second day of our stay, we were out of the room all day and came back to relax in the room around 4pm and it still hadn't been cleaned. It was a little annoying to come back to a dirty room. We really wanted to relax, and housekeeping did come, but we didn't want to leave the room, so they cleaned around us, and didn't do a great job, because they were trying to clean as fast as they could and get out of there. The next morning they were knocking on the door before 8 am and we were still sleeping. We did notify the front desk when were going to be out, and they said they would send someone to clean, but when we came back 2 hours later, it still hadn't been cleaned. So, it was frustrating having to deal with that, when we really shouldn't have been worried about it. Also, the rooms seemed to have thin walls. You could hear the housekeeping carts going down the halls, and the last night we were there, people checked in the room above us and you could hear them walking around, etc. Also the beds were uncomfortable(after being at the Hyatt we were spoiled with their comfortable beds). The gym was very small, and hot. The grounds were well kept, but really nothing special. Overall, we were happy, because we were on our honeymoon, nothing could have ruined our amazing time together. Wailea is a beautiful area, and we are definitely goiing back to that part of Maui again.

This year we planned to take our kids ( ages 12 & 14 ), and after much research and debate, we decided to try the Fairmont Kea Lani because all of the rooms are suites, and they come equipped w/ a frig. and microwave. We absolutely LOVE the Four Seasons so this was not an easy choice, but we were glad we made it. Let me start by saying that if you are going as a couple, I recommend the Four Seasons. Their service and facilities are just unbeatable! However, if you take your kids, the Fairmont is a great choice. FOOD We saved alot of money on breakfast and lunch by buying foods at the local market and keeping our frig stocked w/ bottles of water and drinks that would have cost $2 to $3.00 each. We did go to the Costco, but I recommend just going to the Saveway instead. The Costco was a zoo when we were in there, and most items come in bulk. We did eat at Nick's on our last evening and it was great, but very expensive. We enjoyed the deli and Cafe Choi alot. The tuna and chicken salad in the deli is great as well as the pizza . We thought the $6. per slice was rediculous until we got it the first time ,and it was at least the size of 2 slices. It fed two of us! We ate at Bubba Gumps in Lahaina one night for the kids. I don't recommend it. Fun place but terrible food. Lunch at Longhi's in the Wailea Shops was really good . There is also a great Cheesebuger place in there. For a great meal , go to the Four Season's Pacific restaurant. ACTIVITES The bike trip down Haaleakala was awesome. It was my 14 yr. old son's favorite activity after surfing. The road to Hana was not enjoyable for my family. The scenery was beautiful, but the kids got bored real quick! If you are prone to motion sickness, take dramamine before you go!! We went to the luau ay the Royal Lahaina Resort. It was the least expensive on the Island. The food was ok , but the show was fun for the kids. Next time I would pay a little more. GO SNORKELING!! The kids saw alot of tropical fish right at the resort's beach. Renting equipment from the resort is too expensive. Go to snorkel Bob's or bring your own. Surfing was fun. We drove close to Lahaina for the best waves. We also enjoyed watching the windsurfers on the north beaches. Resort We received fresh flower leas and a nice fruity drink upon arrival. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms are nice and big and pretty, though not really luxurious. We did have ants a couple of days so keep food wrapped tight. Our room # was 209 and we will probably request it again. it had a bit of an ocean view, but also had a little yard where we fed the birds in the mornings. Make sure you get a renovated room.

As for food, the room service is pricey and if you order a bottle of wine, make sure if it's a half or full bottle. The room service menu isn't specfic with the bottle sizes and prices. The hotel also tacks on a room delivery charge. Cafe Ciao was delicious but don't bother with Nicks. Unless you book weeks in advance, you won't be seated on the patio, and then your shuffled inside by a rude hostess and a wait staff that seem to be on crack. You can never get their attention and they are constantly running away from you while you're asking questions. Plus, the food isn't that great. Fish was dry and steak was over cooked.

We had a pool suite which is perfect for families as you can walk out of your room right to the pool (no dealing with elevators or long hallways which is great when you have kids). The room was huge and the bathroom exceeded my expetations. The tub was huge but we didn't use it. The shower was wonderful especially for washing our 20 month old daughter. We had 2 double beds in the bedroom and a pull out sofa in the living room. The sofa bed was terrible but I called housekeeping and they brought up an eggcrate mattress pad and then it was fine. There was plenty of closet space and the entertainment center was the best set up I've ever seen in a hotel. Full stereo/dvd/vhs set up. The wet bar/micro/fridge area was small but useful enought to heat up left overs and make baby meals. It's not a full kitchen so we didn't expect full utensils, dinnerware, etc. It also had a coffee maker with enough coffee for all three adults each morning. We rented a cabana for the whole week. I booked it a month in advance which is necessary to make sure you get one. It's $75 a day which when considering the price of the room is not bad (the Four Seasons is free but a comparable room is over $1000 a night). The cabana staff was wonderful except for one day is was less than stellar but I spoke to one of the managers and they comped us a free day. Again, they took great care of making sure we were satisfied. The upper pool is quieter than the lower pool and the kiddie pool is great. We didn't go to the adult pool. The pool bar and restaurant are located in the upper pool. It was nice being able to just walk a few feet out of our room to the cabana. The beach was nice but it rained the day we went down there so it wasn't enjoyable for us. We stayed at the pool. You can rent an umbrella for $30 a day (again it might be free at other hotels but they include it in the higher room rate). We ate at Cafe Ciao most nights and the food was superb. We ate at Nicks one night and of course it was excellent as usual. Nicks is your average 5 Star restaurant with excellent service, great wine list and fab food. We spent the $20 for the photo just for fun!!! The best part of our trip was when we called for a late check out on Saturday. As presidents club members we get a late check out anyway but since our flight wasn't till 10pm we wanted a later check out. They allowed us to check out at 7pm that evening without any extra charge (I've paid extra at other hotels for late check out). The walk to the Shops was a bit of a hike and I would only do it again if we were in better shape. The hotel has a driver that will take you anywhere in the area for free so we used that for trips to the Shops. All in all our experience was positive and we will be booking another stay for 2008. We stay at Fairmonts frequently and have always had great service and an excellent experience. This hotel, even though it is all suite should not be compared to a timeshare where you get more of a condo so don't expect full kitchen set up. It's just a much larger hotel room with some nice conveniences. If you want a condo experience then rent a villa or stay elsewhere.

It would have been nice to have it free\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6we were after all paying over 400 a night for a room and we were spoiled at our previous resort (Hapuna Beach Prince) with free valet. We knew this coming in to the resort though so while it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a surprise to us we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize just how much we would miss it. Upon check in I informed the Fairmont that it was our Honeymoon\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I got a congrats\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.end of story. Once again, I knew the Fairmont didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything special for HM er\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s but having gotten a nice bottle of champagne at the HBP and a free upgrade we were once again spoiled. ROOM: The room was FANTASTIC overall J We loved the size of the room! HUGE! The bathroom was very nice but once again didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t live up to the HBP. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like not having a door on the toilet and while at first thought the open air shower seemed like a great idea- having used it for 4 nights, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like it. The reason was that we liked to have our room air conditioned like most people\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6however, when you take a shower most people like to have the warm air of the shower surround you. With there not being a door the cold air is right there\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I often got cold while taking a shower- not fun. Also- there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough space to put all our shower stuff so I had to step over to the ledge of the soaking tub to get some of my shower products- also made for colder showers. The shower pressure and hot water was great though! The deep soaking tub was nice- my husband and I soaked in it once with bubble bath- lots of room. The double sinks are also nice to have. We had a renovated room and the furniture was brand new. The bed was the most comfortable we have ever slept on- so comfy that we plan on calling the hotel this week to find out what kind of bed it is- we want to buy it! We went with a room without a view b/c we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to spend more than 500 a night. When booking we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the view would matter but having come from the Hapuna Beach Prince premium oceanfront room- it mattered\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.A LOT. Once again, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprised\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6we knew what we paid for but we were just spoiled by the other room- which was 200 bucks less a night too. POOL/BEACH: The beach was nice, but once again, can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t compare the Hapuna Beach\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.the beach was rather small and the sand wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as soft. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend much time here. The pools are the one area that outbeat the Hapuna though! We rented a cabana one day and the service was SUPERB. We were catered to the whole time\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.we felt like royalty- 75 bucks but I HIGHLY recommend it! We ordered one about 4 weeks before we left to make sure we got one. The slide was fun and even though there were children around- the adult pool was just that- only for adults and therefore very quiet and relaxing! So relaxing that I fell asleep in our cabana for an hour. FOOD: We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really eat here much- we got lunch by the pool one day which was one of the best hamburgers I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6for 18 bucks it better be We also went to Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Ciao a lot for snacks and sandwiches. We would have gone to nicks but the views couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t compare to the other places we had gone- you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the ocean- just the pool area so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the point in spending 200 bucks on a meal without a good view. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the food is superb and the service is supposed to be beyond compare but we decided to skip it. We also missed our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd breakfast that we had at the prince hotel- sure we could have gotten the breakfast package here but it was very high in price. On a side note- Yes, you can order pizza and have it delivered\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.just pick up the phone book in your room- at first it was hard to find b/c they put it in a fancy case- no yellow phone book for this place! Heeheehee\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.Ours was in the side drawer next to the bed. OVERALL: To be fair, we REALLY scrutinized EVERYTHING here. Having come from the Hapuna Beach Prince, which was fantastic, it was easy to be VERY picky at the Fairmont. The things we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like were nitpicky\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.the view (we knew what we paid for), no free valet (once again, we knew this), the shower (had we not had such a great shower at HBP we would have loved this shower), the views at the restaurants (we knew this too before booking), the beach (once again hard to compare to HBP)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..anyways, you get the point. We had a great time here, we just had a better time at a resort that was much less $$$ and we felt that we got so much more for our $$$ at the previous resort. In the end, it was our fault. We just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that we would miss things like a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a view, free valet, an amazing beach, a room with a view\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.we wanted the feel of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153true 5 star resort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and I thought that if we skipped out on some of the above items that we could get the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fancy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd feel without the high cost. Had we done valet and the breakfast package with a room with a view we would have easily hit 600 a night\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6double what we paid at the HBP. We came here for the beauty of the resort, the size of the suites and the pools- particularly the availability of an adults only pool and the things above didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappoint us- it was the other things that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know we wanted that we were disappointed with. Would I recommend the resort? SURE WOULD!\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend it to anyone that couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford the room with a view, the breakfast package, the valet\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.basically, if we had 600 a night to spend we would come back to this resort and I bet we would LOVE every inch of it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but we went to a 5 star resort on a 4 star budget and ended up disappointed.", "Date": "May 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "arizona", "Title": "\u201cFun time...some problems\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5224510", "Content": "We greatly enjoyed our stay despite a few problems. The Kea Lani is in the Wailea area of the island, which was much nicer than most of the other resort areas we saw. The Wailea is very upscale, while nearby Kihea seemed to be a cheap hotel row crawling with teenagers and unpleasant drunken locals hanging and hollering out of their cars. The Fairmont property is impeccably maintained, and the views are spectacular. All public spaces were beautiful and connected to nature, and very clean. The pool areas were clean, open and offered free lounges and umbrellas. There are cabanas available for daily rent, and they had the audacity to charge for an umbrella on the beach ! The kids loved the slide, and spent most of the day in or around the pools. We did not take advantage of the \"kids program\" and we were not aware prior to our arrival that there was an age requirement for admission. We did use a local babysitter one day for our three year old, and she was awesome ! $16/hour seemed a bit steep, but since he loved his time with her it was well worth it. Upon check-in we were assigned a room with 2 twin beds, a side-angle view of the ocean and a direct view into the neighboring condos' living rooms. Not exactly what we expected as a married couple that still sleeps together. When we expressed our disappointment to the front desk agent, it was apparent that he was not interested, because an alternative room shown to us was on a lower floor with a view of the pool and an outdoor dining area. He also said that we were not guaranteed any specific bed arrangement, even though our reservation through Apple Vacations designated a king bed and ocean view. Never heard that excuse. Despite the offer, we opted to wait until the next morning after some guests had checked out, to see if there were other room options. Indeed, a very helpful and concerned Luz found us a great room that met our expectations, and did not require a mile walk to the pools etc. Housekeeping was great and friendly, but there were some negatives on the room: the balcony floors were so filthy that the bottoms of our feet were black after walking outside for a minute.......there were no utensils/plates etc needed to take advantage of the fridge/microwave/coffeepot set up in the suite. We were encouraged to call room service for that stuff, which was interesting because every time they brought food up to the room there was a $4 charge, but they were happy to walk a fork or spoon up for free ! Otherwise, their food was way overpriced, but tasty ($6 lemonade at poolside...$16 sandwiches...$4 room delivery charge plus automatic 18% gratuity...$5 single scoop ice cream....$22 breakfast buffet....etc). Dont know how this place compares to others in the area, but we met many return visitors who couldve gone anywhere yet claimed the Kea Lani was the best of all.

If you are going to eat a nice breakfast, lunch, or dinner, I would highly recommend going to Seawatch (a five minute shuttle ride from the hotel). The view of the water and the grounds (it's on a golf course overlooking the ocean) is great. We had amazing eggs benedict for $11 which was the avg of most items. Very reasonable compared to $27 buffet at hotel. We wish we would have gone here several times for breakfast. We did also have lunch one day and it was very good as well. Sarrento on the beach is really good and you can reach out and touch the waves! They have a photographer w/ the option to buy your photo (they take it on the beach) which is a nice touch. Rent a car and go to Lahiana for the day. Great shops and worth the time! Alli Nui was a very nice sunset cruise for adults! We also had dinner at Spago's and it was very good (red curry my fav).

My parents treated my fiancee and I to the trip and we were all staying in the same suite because the hotel said that the suites comfortably slept 4 adults. While the hotel did in fact have a sofa-bed, it was the worst and most uncomfortable sofa bed I have ever slept on (hard as a rock, our feet hung off of it at least 6 inches, smaller than double bed, etc.) We ended up moving the \"mattress\" onto the floor after the second night. The bathroom was spacious and well appointed, and the lanai / balcony was a good size too. Hotel grounds are beautiful and well maintained - everything is lush and tropical. Kids are everywhere... except at the adult pool which was peaceful and had attentive poolside service. Poolside food and drinks were good, but of course overpriced (like every nice hotel). Cafe Caio offers a slightly cheaper alternative and has an assortment of food and beverages (we got breakfast there some mornings - coffee, yogurt and bagels). The biggest downfall of the Fairmont is the Spa Kea Lani. It is very obvious that the spa was an afterthought at this resort. It is in a space designed for a retail shop, and, as such, it is extremely small and lacks the features that one expects at the prices they charge and at a resort of such prestige. There is not even a relaxation room to wait in or relax in before or after your treatment. The locker rooms are VERY small and the whole spa only has around 7 or 8 treatment rooms. My mother and I also went to the Four Seasons spa (right next door) and this spa charges around $10 less per treatment and has a much better facility. If you are interested in having a spa treatment, I would highly recommend the Four Seasons spa over the Kea Lani. The spa at the Grand Wailea (the soon to be Waldorf Astoria) is also very nice, but it charges $30 extra for non-guests. Don't miss out on Nick's Fishmarket - one of the best meals we had in Maui, and they same owners have a place down the street called Sarento's, which was also very good.

We were told that they would call us when our rooms were ready on our cell phones. We went to find some food and beverage, but had to walk all the way to one of the pool bars, as all the other places were not open until 5:00pm.

There were birds everywhere eating scraps of food and making things very messy if you know what I a mean. I ended up with bird poo all over a jacket and purse. And that was trying to keep it sheltered!!!! We get our room and it was nice. However, when I pay over a certain dollar amount I expect to have a mini-bar available. Maybe I'm in the minority on that one. The accoustic ceiling was very dated. We all ran our feet into the big lip on the sliding glass doors there OUCH!!!! The fan click clacked the entire time, bed and pillows were not comfortable. Bathroom, was nice and big. We also had a hard time with the internet acess, but lucky for me I travel with a spare ethernet cable and was able to plug into the wall. There were what seemed like a million kids on the property. We had indeed traveled with our son who I signed up for the Kids Program for two of the four days. He enjoyed it very much, the staff was great with the kids. And it was a nice break for him to be able to hang out with some kids his age and expend some energy!!! It was also nice for us as we were then able to indugle in a few spa treatments for my husband and myself. The spa was small, the treatments top dollar. They and the facilities were not worth the price. I have had much better for less. The food was not great either, and we did leave the property to eat all of our evening meals.

This experience was by far the worst of any hotel we have ever had, except for a previous stay at this resort several years ago. We kept trying and now we finaaly learned to stay away. I called this resort a few weeks befoe we arrived just to find out what section of the hotel we would be in. We like a quiet area and suggested that. They gave us a Kilohana signature suite. I was told that we were in the 01-02 section, which is a Kilohana. It was an upgrade but not worth the $700 a night we paid even for an ocean view. Upon check-in we got some real attitude from the woman at the front desk. We have always found them to have an attitude even if you are very friendly. We aksed her what room we were in and she said she had an ocean view for us. My husband and I just looked at each other. I told her that I had called previously andI was told we were in the 01-02 suites.She became flustered. She asked us what room we had last year and we told her we were in a kilohana room 401. She then decided SHE was going to upgrade us to the kilohana. I aske d about my husband smoking a cigar on the lanai and she nastily told us that \"there IS NO smoking in the kilohana suites\". I asked when they changed the policy and she said it had been that way for quite some time. hhmmm...he smoked on the lanai last year and they provided the ashtray. We asked to speak to the rooms director. After an hour he appeared. We asked him why the front desk had us booked into an ocean view instead of the kilohana we were told we were going to get. He had no idea why she would say that because he blocked off our room personally. We decided to sit in the lobby lounge so my husband could have a cigar before going for a drive until our room was ready. We got there VERY early as we needed to escape from the Kapalua floods. We wern't expecting to get an early check-in. At about 11:30 the rooms director came out to us and told us that the guest had checked out a little while ago and that our room would be ready in 1- 1-1/2 hours. He put a rush with housekeeping on it. He told us to be discreet with the smoking. We were ready to take a nice ride but decided to go get lunch and then get to our room. We came back from lunch about 1 1/2 hours later but the room still wasn't ready. We waited for another 1/2hour and asked to see the rooms director again. When he finally appeared he said it should be ready any time. Another hour went by and we were steaming by this time. We asked to see him again. He actually told us that the guest that checked out had gone back to his room to lounge around! If he put a rush on the room, why did houskeeping wait for two and a half hours before going to clean the room? We travel enough to know that once you check out your room key is invalid. Allrighty then, are they going to play us for stupid? We finally got to our room at about 4:00 PM (not 1 minute before check-in time) Last years room was decorated in nice, pretty, bright florals. This room one floor down was all in very dark green and dark mustard colored rug. It was dreary. We went out onto the lanai and noticed that it was very sticky. You could see where juice or soda hadn't been cleaned up. When we went back inside our feet were literally black on the bottoms from the lanai. That was gross enough, but my husband went to open the bathroom door and there was a lot of a sticky substance on the edge of the door. eewww! The noise was intolerable. The place was full of conventioners and thier families. These kids were animals. The people above has their kids playing on the lanai, screaming and yelling as early as 6:00 AM. They were actually dragging the furniture on lanai this early. The people downstairs had at least two babies screaming most of the time. We had kids in the hallway playing basketball in front of our door and we had parents watch as thier little monsters played and splashed people in the adult pool! I realize that the suites doors are very heavy but all we heard day and night was slamming doors. I mean hard slamming. The resort really should fix the doors. I had gotten hurt going out onto the lanai because the slider has a 3-4\" lip on it (i am not used to the old fashioned sliders like these) I tripped and cut and bruised my toes and twisted my back. I didn't say anything to anyone about it. I asked for a heating pad about two days later and they asked what happened. I told them and they were all hush, hush from then on. I am not in the habit of suing people and I was rather the clutz, but it would have been nice if the manager would have asked if I was OK. We asked to be moved because of the noise issue. He was going to put us in back of the Polo Beach Club. We decided to leave at this point. We went elsewhere and had a wonderful stay without any complaints. My warning is that if you are not a conventioner with family in tow or a family of eight then you may want to go elsewhere. I don't know what happened this year.

The kids loved the main pool which includes a slide and two hot tubs. For adults, there is a separate adult pool that offers all the serenity you could want.

That surprised me. I had to go back to the room and get the towels. 2) When I'm paying $500+ per night, I don't like being charged $9 for a mask/snorkel. We also paid $18 for a boogie board. This seems petty on Fairmont's part. These things should be all inclusive. 3) while there we decided to book a cabana by the pool only to find that all cabana's are booked thru April. So if you want a cabana, book it well in advance of your arrival. Overall, if you have a family, you'll find that the Fairmont is probably the best hotel in the Wailea area because all rooms are suites. If just my wife and I were going, I'd probably book the Four Seasons (they don't cater as much to kids).", "Date": "March 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monte Sereno, California", "Title": "\u201cKea Lani No Ka Oi\u201d", "Author": "David_Edward", "ReviewID": "UR4628259", "Content": "I have had the pleasure of staying in some of the finest rooms available in the world. I travel extensively (New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, Rome, Madrid, Hong Kong, Bali, etc.) and have had the pleasure of staying at the Kea Lani twice in the last 10 years. It ranks up there with the very best of them. My first time at the Kea Lani was in 1996 in one of their two bedroom / two story ocean-front villas. The villa itself was spectacular with it's own private splash pool, kitchen, laundry and split-level floor plan. If you are travelling as two couples or as a family I would highly recommend the villas. On this most recent trip (March 11th - 19th 2006) I spent all of my 8-day trip to Maui in one of the Kea Lani's \"Kilohana Suites'. 1100 square feet, enormous wrap-around lanai, spacious sitting room, marble wet-bar, modern clean and eminently functional marble bathroom and one of the most comfortable beds I've slept in outside of my own home. The service, from the valet parking / bell desk to the front desk to housekeeping is par excellence. We were in the main building which not only afforded a spectacular panoramic view of the impeccably manicured / landscaped grounds and both pools but afforded us the ease of a two-minute trip from the front desk to our room. Spa Kea Lani is a beautifully appointed and professionally staffed facility. My girlfriend and I enjoyed side-by-side 80 minute massages and I have to say they were likely the best we've ever had. Not sure what some of the other reviewers were talking about re: the public areas being a bit \"tired\". The hotel was built in 1991 but the rooms have almost all been renovated and the public areas are as gorgeous now (if not more so) than they were when I first vacationed here in the mid-90's. The Four Seasons is nice but did not strike me as anything truly special. If you are travelling on a budget, the Kea Lani is not the place for you. But if you have the means and the sophistication to appreciate the very finest things that life has to offer, the only places to even consider when vacationing on Maui are the Kea Lani or the Grand Wailea (right next door.) (I know some would argue for The Ritz Carlton Kapalua but their resort really does look tired and in dire need of a major face-lift and I don't play golf!) Even though the Kea Lani was *completely* booked during the time I was there, I never once had the slightest bit of difficulty finding a perfectly positioned lounge chair nor ever felt the slightest bit \"crowded\".

Jasmine, you saved our trip. I will write a letter to management on your behalf. Oddly, the receptionist was completely worthless. It is hard to find fault with a place when it is booked to capacity. it was just so busy there. and they are still refurbishing some rooms so not all the rooms are available.

I loved the packets of Woolite they stock for you too...they really came in handy for quick washing. My only real complaints are: no dimmer switch for the lights in the bathroom (we just bought candles at the grocery store instead), the faucet on the shower didn't let you control temperature and pressure...it all worked as one which was kind of frustrating at times, and buying excursions through the activites desk has quite a bit of a mark-up.

The complimentary canoe paddle each morning was very memorable. A must do! We rented kayaks and crossed in front of the Four Seasons and the Grand Wailea.

We took the beach path to the other resorts- the Grand Wailea was very busy, pool chairs on top of each other and the Wailea beach was crowded. We were happy to return to Polo beach and the Kea Lani. As for children, maybe because it was during the school year but we only saw toddlers- they have their own pool. Never saw a child over five. I think if you have teenagers the GW would be more enjoyable as we saw more kids over there. The adult pool at the Kea Lani was quiet and relaxing- a great place for a poolside massage.

I was highly disappointed. They offered to move us to another room, which we did, but this room was not refurbished and looked like something from a '70s garage sale.

All it is is a bunch of shops that the cruise ships drop their passangers off to see and for those who don't know better to stay there. The Fairmont was easy to get to from the air port, approximately 30 minutes away, but then again so are all the other sides of the island. The beach area is nice and clean with plenty of chairs to lounge in. The tour desk is a bit pricy so go to Boss Frog's or Snorkel Bob's, you can book excursions much cheaper through them and rent snorkel gear, boogie boards, etc by the day or week. We did that for Molokini Island and the sunrise bike ride down the volcano.

For those who regularly stay in very swanky places, I may understand some of the cooler reviews, however, here is mine... We arrived after check in time and were greeted by leis and punch. We had only booked the garden room, but asked if upgrade was available and received a partial ocean view which means you can see the ocean from the lanai of the bedroom. We did have to settle on two double beds versus a king to get the upgrade, but I wanted the view. We were not sure if we had a renovated suite or not, but think we did. Very roomy and the bathroom was my favorite part. Room had small refrigerator and even a microwave which was nice. We had twice daily maid service and I thought the evening service was even better than the day. Always had fresh supply of towels which is great when you are showering a couple times a day. I thought the various pools were very nice, if yes, a little cool at first. We stayed at the one with the pool bar. At this time of year which is shoulder season, not hard to get chairs and umbrella. Yes, there were some kids, but I thought very few and they did not come up to that pool area except to use the slide which originates up there. And at the adult pool, I hever saw any kids. I guess it really depends on time of year. I thought pool service was good, even though we did not use it much. I thought the pool area was always clean. I agree that there was virtually no night life with exception of restaurants and Nick's FishMarket was probably our favorite meal on the island. We had a lovely table and excellent service and food. Was pricey, but pretty standard for Wailea. I think there was a guitarist at the other restaurant, but again, I was suprised no managers cocktail party, any other live entertainment. But we really didn't care. The pathway that links the Wailea resorts was one of the favorite things we did every morning. We could walk to the other resorts, the shops at Waleia, etc. The resort offers shuttle service around the area to restaurants, golf, shops so if you don't plan on renting a car, this is helpful to avoid taxi fees. I would highly recommend joining the Fairmont President's Club. You can do the first level for free which I did it it got you some extras like free paper, free local calls, and best of all, complimentary use of golf clubs. I had a beautiful set of ladies Taylor Mades and never drove the ball better. Helps if you don't want to bring clubs to island. Overall, my husband and I were very pleased with the Fairmont.

I just got back 4 days ago from a 10 day honeymoon that included a stay for 5 days in Maui at the Kea Lani. My wife and I really wished now we stayed at the Four Seasons next door (we visited there for dinner at Spago's and a beach walk), especially after having just stayed at a Four Seasons on anothe island. Oh well, next time. The Good part: The room was very nice and roomy. The reason we thought we wanted to stay at the Kea Lani over others in Wailea was because you get a nice sized suite with separate living room, and it is a Fairmont Hotel. The room we had was clean and comfortable, and we had a great peaceful view of the ocean from the 5th floor in our position. Bathroom and bedroom were clean and nicely done. The Hotel is spacicious and very open aired, and some staff seem friendly enough in their jobs. There are some star customer service moments, like our masseuses at the Spa. The Bad Parts: For the price, the Kea Lani is not worth it compared to the competition. The facilities are trying to be top notch, but they simply are not. We would see bottles and drinks laid down around the place and pools that seemed to sit for too long. The place is a machine for placing in and spitting out hundreds of people and their staff operate in this mode. Many of their staff just aren't thinking \"resort\" even though it is on the building, and simply want to move you on and get you out of their faces. Not good. One prime example is how the bartendar at the Ciao restaurant rolled his eyes and was a lump of coal because I was ordering my favorite Mojito drinks (they take a little more work to make then throwing in a shot of rum and pressing a button). Another is how at their Spa when we came in for our appointments the greet/register person who was talking to a friend, kept talking a little longer and acted like we were in their way. Not good for spending $300 on two Spa treatments. Another example is how the Concierge desk closes at 9PM. Or another is how staff walk by you and look away from you so they don't have to say \"hi\". There are more examples, but maybe this gives you an idea. And get this - we were there on the off-season. They nickel and dime you. This aggravated me coming in from a Four Seasons. I don't mind paying good money to go to a good resort, but then I don't expect to be nickle and dimed for small stuff. For example, $10/hr to get into an office to get on the internet, $9/hr for an umbrella at the beach, $75 fee for use of a pool cabana, $4 fee for \"in-room\" service to bring up $26 of bottled water. What the hell was the \"in-room\" service about since I am ordering from a in room bar menu in the first place??? Also $1 phone charge to even an 1-800 number. Four Seasons doesn't do this to you. And the Fairmont was not the much less in price then then in Wailea. The food their was not good, especially at $25-35 a plate. The dining amenities were average. Avoid the breakfast buffet. At $26 a person, the food there was old and bland, the fruit was aged. I have had much better ones. Fortunetly you are near Kihea and other very good dining is available nearby. They do have a Ciao Deli on site that has good snack foods and items. That at least was there to go to. The pool facilites were average, and I believe due to the suites a lot of parents bring children there. Thus you have a lot of kids running around. We were off-season so it was probably better than it is during on season I would imagine. The Spa needs some help. It is very small, think gym locker room. You can see they try, but for the men's room they only \"extras\" for products looked directly out of an old-school barber shop I have been too. Ouch! The woman's side wasn't much better. Then the waiting area is actually an end of a hall with a candle and some tea. Cramped if another couple shows up. The massage table and area was fine, and we had a good tandem massage treatment with good staff there. All in all, I would say it is an average resort in a good location, which asks for too much money.

If you want 5 star fabulous-ness, don't go to Maui. We stayed 7 nights at the Fairmont. It was decent. I've stayed in much better and much worse. It's not 5 star but it really IS the second best hotel in the Wailea area of Maui (Four Seasons being the best). When I read all of the reviews, I couldn't understand how they could be so contradictory but it's true. The Fairmont has a lovely lobby and pool area, lovely romantic restaurants (Caffe Ciao is actually more romantic and less expensive than Nick's Fishmarket) and a nice (but tiny) spa. It also has rooms that are mediocre (although the bathrooms are fabulous) even after renovations, filthy patio furniture in the rooms AND at the pool, and so-so service even in the least busy season. I had never been to Hawaii so I had this image in my head of it being pure 5 star paradise but it's really more like the land the 80s forgot. The buildings are aging and it shows. I also thought that if I was paying $600 a night for a deluxe ocean front suite, it would be one of the best room I've ever seen--also wrong. That's just how it is on Maui though way overpriced and so-so. I live in Florida and for my money (and traveling time!) all things being equal I'd rather go to a newer, cheaper, closer fabulous resort in the Carribbean. I'm glad I did the Hawaii thing and we did have a fun trip but if you're expecting the best trip of your life based on price alone, you're going to be disappointed. We checked out the Four Seasons (lovely but no breeze or air conditioning in the lobby and hallways so it was STIFLING) and the rooms looked tiny and didn't have great views (most rooms face each other in a courtyard setting). For the money, big deal! The Grand Wailea is a big tacky Vegas-like place (there's even a wedding chapel by the pool) that was absolutely teaming with people. Everyone there seemed drunk and happy though so if that's your type of thing you might enjoy it. The Maui Prince looks like a 70's office building. Fake wood trim. Just hideous. If you're going to Maui and you want to stay in the Wailea area (best weather by far!) pick the Fairmont. If you pick Four Seasons you'll get a view of your neighbor's balcony in a shoe box room for $800/night. At least at the Fairmont, it's not 100 degrees and you can see the ocean. Or if you want a big drunken crowd, the Grand Wailea is probably the 3rd choice and I believe it's a little cheaper (probably why it's so crowded).", "Date": "November 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4078570", "Content": "My wife and I just returned from 7 days at the Kea Lani and have to say we can't wait to go back next year.

We were overall very impressed with the hotel and did not see signs of any of the things mentioned in some of the more critical reviews on this board. The service was outstanding - everyone was extremely friendly and said Aloha at every turn. b The ladies at the concierge desk were great and recommended an outstanding local sushi place called Sansei. Everything we needed regarding service was always right there and everything seemed very efficient. Twice daily housekeeping kept everything fresh too. The only area that seemed to be a challenge for them was getting the paper to us each day (we had asked for something other than the local paper so I think it kept getting mixed up). Our room was beautiul - we were on a corner so it was a little larger. Well-equipped and v. comfortable. They include a mini-fridge and microwave which is great so you can store drinks bought at the market at much lower prices than the resort charges. The adult pool was great - nice and quiet. I thought we would have a problem getting chairs since I had read people reserved them early in the morning but we were able to sit exactly where we wanted each day. The beach was great too - they have a nice little crescent of beachfront (see pics attached!) I will say that we may have been there on a quiet week since the day we left the resort seemed a lot more crowded with loud people. Regarding restaurants, in addition to Sansei (which we ate at twice it was so good! Go by 5PM on Sundays - there's a line out the door since they do a half-price special), we loved Spago at the Four Seasons (great flavors, impeccable service, awesome view and liked Seawatch at the Golf Club (great food, attentive (if somewhat slow) service).

Also, Caffe Kihei in town had a pretty good inexpensive breakfast and the place was packed. The other restaurant at the Fairmont and the pool bar both were nothing great and very pricey. One feature that was great at the Fairmont was the Cafe - we were able to buy muffins and juice/coffee each day for around $10 which was nice if we didn't want to go out or weren't hungry for the big, expensive buffet breakfast.

I did notice there are stairs that divide the cabanas to the rest of the cafe. What the cafe does to keep people out of the area is put up a barrier. I thought that was cool when we arrived. But...when we got there the waiter took it down...so families started walking down the steps and walking right past our cabana--talking loud and being rude. TOO MANY FAMILIES!!! I was annoyed by that. I wish the staff would have thought about keeping the barrier up for privacy. Another issue I had was the adult pool. Now, My now husband and I are on vacation. We do not want to get up at the crack of dawn and put a towel and \"claim\" a lounge chair. I was appaled that people actually do that. It was my understanding that the Fairmont has a policy that you cannot do that...but nobody cared to stop it. Which was annoying. I am sorry-but I am paying almost $700/night and would like to NOT worry about these sort of things. I would also like to mention the rudeness of children there. My Husband and I were walking to the Spa to get massages and a little boy just ran right into me. With his rich Mom right there. Literally BANG right into me. I was soooo annoyed! What has happened to \"WOW I am sorry!\" But the rich Mom didn't even care to notice. This is the case all over the hotel. I would also like to mention the Pool Bar. I completely agree that the Pool Bar should be at the Adult Pool. Why would anyone with any sort of brain put a bar at the family/kids pool?? I don't get it. Overall, the prices at the Fairmont were VERY PRICEY! It would be better to go to the nearby Safeway and stock up on Milk, Cereal and Coke. Overall, it was a lovely hotel with lovely grounds. I would not stay here again because of the price and the attitude of the hotel as a whole.

If you don't want to run into crowds, especially kids, than don't travel to Hawaii during peak seasons, i.e. summer. The best time to visit Hawaii is in the fall - when there are few crowds and even less kids, due to school. Plus, the rates are less expensive. I always take my two young boys and we have quality family time. People with children pay just as much money to stay at a resort as couples do and spend even more money when it comes to food and activities (that's why resorts love families and cater to them). If you don't want to run into children, I recommend staying at the Kona Village Resort on the Big Island during couples only season. Remember, we were all once children. As for the resort, the beach is awesome (smooth sand and great waves for bodysurfing and boogie boarding), the pools are wonderful (there's a waterslide, toys, a basketball hoop and a swim-up bar), the rooms are huge (the bathroom alone is the size of a small hotel room). There's a big soaking tub, a separate walk-in shower with tremendous water pressure, a separate toilet and double sinks. The bedroom is separate from the living room where there's a pull-out sofa and entertainment center. There's two TV's, two telephones, a refrigerator and a microwave.

Of course, it was kinda neat to see all the stars (many were staying in the villas at the Kea Lani), but it made the crowds unbearable. In fact, we almost left to go to the Ritz Kapalua for some peace and quiet. The resort itself is incredible, maybe a little on the large and unmanageable size, but nothing compared to the Grand Wailea. Great restaurants - Nicks was one of the best meals we had on the island. Relatively attentive staff, but they weren't on the same level as the Ritz or Four Seasons. Our room was unreal - top floor suite overlooking \"adult\" pool and the ocean. Not cheap, though. Once the film festival crowd left it was a totally different resort, but other guests we spoke with who had been there previously said that during any convention it gets crazy. I've been to Maui several times, and this was the first time I stayed in Wailea (been to Kapalua once and Kaanapali several times). The weather was better down south (although it did rain twice, that is unusual), but all in all Kaanapali was more enjoyable for me.

We were there from Aug. 17 - 24, not only for our honeymoon, but to be married on Maui. I had let them know ahead of time this was our purpose. As a previous poster emphasized, we are also usually easygoing, easy to please people. (Please refer to our review of Goria's Spouting Horn B&B on Kauai, to see that we can be pleased.) We booked a Deluxe Ocean View room and figured that we would have a slim chance of a honeymoon upgrade. But we didn't expect to have to fight for what we paid for. We didn't even get leis when we checked in. Our understanding was that all the suites are the same, but that the floor determines the quality because of the view. The lobby area, as previously stated by others, was always hectic and loud. We were taken to our room (524) to discover that it directly overlooked the \"upper\" pool with a million screaming kids. Not exactly our honeymoon dream. We called the front desk to inquire if there were other comparable quality rooms available near the adult pool and were given a key to go look at another room (456). Now if my understanding is correct, this is not a deluxe ocean view room by definition. The room was not nearly as nice as the first. Strange foul odor, worn upholstery, stained carpet, stained walls and stained bedspread! I was apalled that such a room even existed at the Fairmont. I was very disappointed that they tried to pass this off on us. So we went back and said it wouldn't work. After much deliberation they offered us the room we ended up with (658). My guess is they were holding it for someone \"special\" whoever that might be. This room had a fabulous view and nice accomodations. But after 14 hours traveling, and given that we were there for our wedding, at $665 per night, we shouldn't have had to go through this. And, though moved away from the kids' pool, we ended up with a screaming monster in the room next door anyhow. The previous post about the outrageous prices is also true. I sent my wedding gown with housekeeping to have it steamed. They charged me $60 and it came back stained!!! We ordered in-suite dining on our lanai for our wedding night, this was all arranged ahead of time. They did not even give us a complimentray split of champagne or anything. The room, though nice, was not 5 star. It could have been cleaner. Towels were not plush. Turn down service didn't even include a mint on your pillow. All of the staff, however, were very nice and helpful. And the grounds are breathtaking. Then there are the pools. And the kids. We're from Florida. If we wanted to be surrounded by screaming, overindulged kids, we could have saved a lot of money and just gone to Disney World for our honeymoon. We also had trouble getting seats at the adult pool and just could not believe the swim-up bar wasn't at the adult pool. We didn't even try that. What were they thinking? We didn't even try for a cabana, but they weren't in my opinion even that private or nice for the money. And, when we sat out on the lawn by the adult pool, we had a bunch of kids playing hide and seek all around there one day and parent playing catch with his kid another day. The first day we were there, there were kids in the adult pool. I feel the need to add here that we both actually like kids. Well behaved, respectful ones. I was left wondering what the deal was with the parents at the Fairmont. Do they all have nannies and don't know how to deal with their kids on their own on vacation? And what happened to the day when there was a degree of decorum expected when one stayed at a place such as this? We never did eat at Nick's because we couldn't get a reservation. I believe our food on our wedding night was from there, and it was very good. We had in-suite dining a couple nights and it was always good. We also at Cafe Ciao one night and it was delicious. But this comes back to the \"what are they thinking\" thing again. The deli/cafe is directly behind it, so again, a romantic patio dinner, with screaming kids in the background. I am SO glad we didn't pay for the romantic dinner in the poolside cabana on our wedding night (which we seriously considered) because that would have been the same thing for $375. The final kicker for us was the night before our wedding, when the Fairmont had a charity event on the patio directly below our room. Also noisy and annoying. (We're not against charity either, we both do a lot of volunteer work ourselved). We just didn't expect this kind of lack of consideration fromt he Fairmont. I'm sure they managed to profit from that little affair also. All in all, I think they have a lot of nerve charging what they charge for what they offer and we will not be likely to ever return again. One of our next planned trips is to Bermuda and we had planned on staying at the Fairmont there too, but after this experience will definitely not. We have both stayed at similarly rated hotels previously (Four Seasons at Las Colinas, Ritz Carlton in Naples, The Breakers at Palm Beach and even the Hyatt Regency Westshore in Tampa all come to mind) and been thoroughly delighted by them all.

The Firmont really felt like a palace from a different time, very classy. The open walkways were lined with shops and spas. Views of the ocean and pools were breathtaking and almost made us forget we were on vacation. You just have to see it for yourself. Our room was on the far end of the hotel (a long walk) and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an ocean view. The very nice bathroom had a big tub and shower. There was a separate sitting area with a TV and stereo, this was a nice extra. My wife and I thought it was nice that a maid would clean the room twice in one day. We would wake up, make a mess of our room go out and have fun, come back and it was clean. We would go out for dinner and came back for the turndown service; this was also a nice extra. The Fairmont was not as busy as the Hilton in Oahu and it really felt as if you had the place to yourself. The pools were never over crowded and walking through the hotel was quiet. The beaches were almost empty and this was a really nice change of pace for us. Service was better than expected, sitting by the pool or having dinner at Nick's Fishmarket on site. If we wanted to go to a different restaurant we would call the front desk and they would suggest something, they would call that restaurant and make the reservations for us. If you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to drive your rental car (you need a rental car on Maui) the Fairmont offered a nice Cadillac service to drive you where you wanted to go, within reason of-course. The Cadillac service was not advertised and we were told by other gusts of the hotel that it could be done, and we used it. One of the best examples of good service I can give would be our scuba adventure. We were sitting by the pool one early morning and a Fairmont employee suggested we take a dive. My wife and I never thought of doing it and a 30min crash course dive in the pool and we were ready. We were only a short walk away from the hotel, just off the beach. Our instructor told us this is a good spot to see sea turtles and he was right. I could go on and on about the good service. Sunsets at the Fairmont were always breathtaking.

Now what does that mean to you? Well, I originally requested a renovated room, but upon check-in was told that I was assigned a non-renovated room. I did a little arm twisting, and was quickly given a renovated room...which was beautiful! I did sneak a few peeks at some non-renovated rooms, and there was a stark contrast: The non-renovated rooms were very bland, lots of white couches and furniture that looked fairly old and worn. Our renovated room on the other hand was brand new, with aqua colored couches, nice mix of dark and light woods, etc. The bathroom was spectacular, with separate bathtub and shower (shower was actually tucked in around a wall,) separate pedestal sinks and doors at either end - one leading to your bedroom, the other leading to the hallway. Now, I have been at many Four Seasons hotels around the world, and yes, their bedrooms tend to be \"slightly\" classier and a little \"plusher,\" but seriously...would you rather be in the standard 300-500 square foot Four Seasons room or in a nearly 900 square feet Fairmont room? And for 6 days of living...who cares if your lamp is from Tiffany's or not! The renovated rooms at the Kea Lani are beautiful AND extremely spacious, with a separate bedroom that's closed off from a living room with a huge wraparound couch, a second TV set, CD/DVD player, wet bar with a nice size fridge...what more could one ask? I can see however, how some people could be upset flying all the way to Maui, paying all that money, and then getting an older, slightly run down room (especially when they know that newer rooms DO exist at the same property!). That's a tough call to make...but keep in mind that the rooms are huge no matter what shape they're in, and how much time did you really expect to spend in your room after flying all this way to Maui? In my opinion, it's worth the chance to request a renovated room, and if you don't get one than you should push for one, and if that doesn't work...the resort itself is nice enough that in the long run, it won't really matter that much. As for the rest of the place, it's all first rate. Now, will they have people waiting at the pool to lay out your towels, no? That's a nice touch, but just because they don't do that here doesn't mean the service is bad. Anything we asked for, we received with no hassle. I even wanted to use the Internet but not pay $10 a day, so the nice lady at the concierge let me use the computers in the business center for free anytime I wanted. While the pool cabanas did cost money to rent ($75), the valet parking was absolutely free, all day, every day! The adult pool was very quiet and very large and nearly empty most of the time, which was nice. The other pool is actually two pools, and upper and lower pool, and they are connected by a great waterslide. The slide entrance is actually located IN the upper pool, so you don't have to even get out of the water to slide down to the bottom pool. There is a great swim up bar at the upper pool as well, and the bartenders were always quick and witty. The bottom pool had a nice waterfall at one end, an island in the middle to swim around, a small bridge to swim under, as well a basketball hoop at another end. But the basketball games never intruded on the rest of the pool area because there was so much room to swim. A large grass area heading down toward the beach was always open for sunbathers or watching the sunset, but the beach area was the magical part of the hotel. Never crowded, it was the most amazing place to watch the sun go down. There were always lots of chairs to lay back and relax in a secluded part of the beach, except for the one or two couples who came down daily to have their picture taken immediately after their wedding reception...truly another world. My only complaint\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6for the sheer size and beauty of the resort\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6how they could have the tiniest little spa is absolutely beyond me. Was it nice? Yes. Was the massage great? Yes. But beyond the front desk area, the entire spa consisted of a small narrow hallway which contained two small locker rooms and maybe five or so treatment rooms. The locker room had only two or three small showers and one small steam room. I do like to get my massages in the same hotel where I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m staying just for the convenience, but for those who want to make a day or even a half day of it, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re better off going up to the Four Seasons or the Grand Wailea.

Regrettably, the Kea Lani received the lowest grade, in our opinion.

However, the biggest problem, by far, was that you had to rise by 6 a.m to get a pool chair with any shade. If you left it until 8 a.m. or so, there was NOTHING with shade left, and you would be hard pressed to find a chair anywhere. If you went to the beach, you could rent beach umberellas for $35 per day, but if there are more than 2 or you, you need two umberellas, so its pretty expensive. Once down at the beach, its a long way back to get a drink or food. Other guests told us that this occurred the year previously as well at the Failrmont, so its notlike its a new issue. The cabanas ($75 per day) may be booked in advance, so they were all taken as well for the entire time we were at the Fairmont, but guests may cancel their cabana reservation as late as the morning of the reservation, so if you are on the waiting list, you still have to get up very early to get chairs, which you can then give up if your number on the wait list gets called...what a goofey system.

I don't know what those people giving this place bad reviews are talking about because I am one of the most picky people about my accomidations, I need everything to be perfect. The Kea Lani has unbelievable service inside and outside the hotel. We had breakfast every morning, and the breakfast was there exaclty on time for five mornings straight and the food was top notch. Then we watched the sunset from our balcony every night. The hotel is looking west and we had a corner room with a rap-around balcony which allows anyone with an ocean view room to watch the sunset. I did extensive research before I went to Maui and It looks like it paid off. Me and my wife visited the Four Seasons and the Grand Wailea to see if we made the right decision, and we could not have been happier to go back to paradise at the Kea Lani. The Four Seasons is nice but a little stuffy (people were not as friendly), and forget about the Grand Wailea it does not even compare to the other two. There are a lot of teenagers and family's with young children, so honeymooners stay at the Fairmont Kea Lani and if you can reserve the Kilohana suite.

We were really looking forward to the 5 star experience the Fairmont offered for $665/night. All six of us were uniformly disappointed. At first glance, the resort looks decadent. A closer look reveals a worn and dingy appearance. The rooms were nice sized, but had a lot of wasted space. The deluxe ocean view was very nice, if only slightly worse than the view we had on Waikiki at less than half the price. The private beach was tiny with an unpleasant shore break. The pool was pleasant, but the chairs and grounds were somewhat dilapidated, with peeling paint, chipped furniture and average common areas. I was put off by the $75 price tag on the poolside cabanas. The service was cool and aloof; the staff was never overtly friendly and lacked the Aloha spirit that makes Maui so charming. In general, we were made to feel like strangers. The spa services were wonderful (the massages were high quality), but the spa itself was miniscule and unimpressive, consisting only of showers and a steam room. The restaurants were only average. Breakfast buffet was $28 per person and was pretty good. My only complaint is that they ran out of hot tea and didn't bother to obtain any during my four days there. What 5 star resort runs out of tea bags? In contrast, we visited the Four Seasons and Grand Wailea for dinner. The Four Seasons definitely gave off a classy, clean, elegant feeling throughout. The Grand Wailea appeared equally nice, abeit massive, and catered more to families with children. Both of these resorts made a better impression than the Fairmont. As far as the island, the beaches were magnificent. The Haleakala bike ride was worth the 2:00 a.m. departure time (really!). Eat at Humuhumunukunukuapua'a (Grand Wailea) for a beautiful sunset and great food. In short, it looks like the Fairmont's 5 star rating was handed out decades ago. Time has not been kind to the Fairmont. When I return to Maui, I'll choose the Four Seasons for a more intimate, upscale experience. Either that or the Ritz Carlton in Kapalua.

This is a great family vacation hotel because of the suites. We have 2 children ages 6 and 9. We had a moderate room with a view of the front grounds, room 353, for $385 night - don't forget the extra $40 tax per night (approx.) which added about an extra $400 to our bill. The staff and service were excellent - housekeeping always arrived promptly as did engineering (we had a small problem with the stereo). The carpet needed changing out in our room and the air conditioner was a little too loud but other than that I have no complaints about the resort. I did request a renovated room when we checked in and was told that the moderate suites had not been renovated yet - not sure if that is true or not. There are 3 pools (1 adults and the other 2 for everyone). The 2 for everyone are on two different levels with a water slide connecting the 2 pools. We all liked the water slide. Yes, if you want a chair right by the pool get there really early but we never had a problem getting a chair because there are plenty of grassy areas with palm tree shade that we liked better. We ate at Nicks one night and had reservations the food was very good as was the service. If you are a light eater an appetizer is enough for an entree. Our last night on the island we decided to eat at Nicks impromtu. First we went to the hotel lobby bar and ordered drinks my husband had already been to Nicks and they said yes they could accommodate us. We went back down in the 5-10 min. that they said but we weren't allowed to enter the restaurant with our drinks. It turns out the restaurant has nothing to do with the hotel and only leases the space, they have separate liquor licenses and you can't bring a drink into Nicks. For about 30 min the hostess kept telling us a table would be ready in 5-10 min. At one point when I checked on our table she said \"...oh yea no reservations.\" with an attitude of how dare we expect to eat here without reservations. They finally sat us in a booth behind the bar (my husband said these booths had been open the entire time) it is so hot in this part of the restaurant that we left. They said they could not accommodate us with another table. Note this is an open air restaurant and unless you are sit outside or very near you will not get a breeze - no air conditioning. That second night I thought the hostess had a rather rude attitude. If you want to eat here make reservations before you leave home. We ate at Cafe Caio in hotel and same prices as Nicks. If you are going to spend the money for Nicks you may want to consider David Pauls we went there one night (yes we had reservations) food is outstanding as is service and about the same price as Nicks. Kehei Cafe is a good place for breakfast and lunch and very reasonable prices. Great huevos rancheros with homemade salsa. We also ate at Stella Blues in Kehei and an Italian place Aroma de Italia all were good but left hungry from the Italian place entrees were on the small side and not inexpensive. If you go to Lahaina and love pizza you have to eat at BJ's great deep dish. We ate at the breakfast buffet one morning but $80 for breakfast for 4 is a little steep for me. After staying at the Fairmont I would agree that it is probably not the best place for honeymooners. A word for families unless you kids just love ocean swimming (mine don't) I won't take mine back to Hawaii for a long time there just isn't enough to do on the island for the kids and we picked Maui over Kauai because we thought the kids would enjoy it more.

We booked 5 nights several months back for our honeymoon. While the resort does have some things going for it, there were some issues that I think are worth mentioning. Hopefully this will help some of you couples that may be planning a getaway. Pros: - Rooms are all suites so you can expect to have spacious accomodations including a living room area, and a wet bar. - There is an adult pool area to get away from the chaos of the kids pool. - Decor is simple, yet tasteful. - Upon arrival, you are greeted with juice, a lei, and friendly bell service ready to take your bags off your hands. - In general the service was good. There was one time that we called ahead for our car and they lost our request. The poolside service was decent. All in all, I'd rate the service a B (some of the front desk, and concierge staff had chilly attitudes). Cons: - Resort has clearly made an effort to accomodate families with children. This can be a con for those of you that may be looking for a little more solitude. Since we were there in June (school just getting out)...it seemed that there were many, many families with small children on vacation. While the resort does have an adult only pool, you can hear the screaming and yelling from the kids pool from time to time. If I were a parent, I would be excited to have a high quality resort such as this cater to me like this, but as a honeymooner...it was a let down. - The rooms located on the lower levels (K, M) have somewhat of a musty smell. Our room was nice, but I did get the feeling that it was an older room that had been refaced. There was a basementish odor about it that contributed to this feeling. In the end, if we were going back to Maui as a couple, I'd think about the Four Seasons in Wailea.

My family and I went for a week in June, 2005. We flew in on an early flight from Los Angeles and when we arrived, our suite was not yet ready. (We, admittedly, arrived hours before the stated check-in time so the hotel was not at fault.) We were given cold water and leis - flowers for my husband and me and candy ones for the children - and spent time exploring the grounds and Polo Beach. When our room was finally ready (suite #670), it did not disappoint. It was towards the southern end of the building - facing west - a deluxe full ocean view ($665/night). Beautiful! We loved having the separate bedroom so that the kids (who slept in luxury in there!) could go to bed but we didn't have to. The pull-out in the family room area wasn't amazing - but it did suffice. We were so tired most nights that we could've fallen asleep on the floor! The lanai was gorgeous and we used it often. We ordered in-suite dining 2 days for lunch and the food came quickly and was really, really good ($53 for 3 of us one day and $75 for 4 of us another). Housekeeping was always friendly and came when we called and requested service while at breakfast. The nightly turn-down service was great too - they'd turn down the kids' beds and set up the pull-out for my husband and me as well. While my husband golfed at Wailea one day, I decided to take the kids to the Keiki Lani kids camp from 9 until noon so I could enjoy some quiet time to myself. Bonnie was wonderful and the kids had a great time. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to any parent with little ones. The spa was nice. I had a lomi lomi massage one day and a citrus scrub another. The facility is decent - the waiting room isn't very large, though, and ended up with standing room only at one point. Too - the steam room (which I usually enjoy before a treatment) was the loudest I'd ever been in and there was no ice water or chilled towels for those of us using it. This isn't a necessity, obviously, but it's a small thing that would've made the experience more enjoyable for me and it is done - I've seen it at half a dozen other resort spas in the past few years. The massage technicians were both great - very courteous and skilled. We had breakfast daily at the Kea Lani Restaurant. The breakfast buffet ($26 for adults and $10 for kids) was incredible. The kitchen was very accommodating and never hesitated to help and/or send the chef out when we had a question about something. (My son is Autistic and on a wheat and dairy free diet so we have to check labels and verify ingredients often.) The terrace is gorgeous and the perfect way to start a day in Maui. We had lunch at the Polo Beach Bar & Grille one day and it was great. We did not have a chance to eat at Caffe Ciao but enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Nick's one evening. There couldn't be a prettier spot on the property! We were not able to enjoy the adult pool as we had our 5 and 6 year olds with us - it certainly looked lovely, though. There never seemed to be a shortage of chairs. The main (kids) pool was always fairly busy but - again - we never had problems finding a chair or two. The slide was fun and the children (as well as their Father) enjoyed the shallow-end basketball net! We enjoyed many a lava flow by the pool and the servers were always quick and friendly. The pineapple slices and chilled towels were much appreciated as well. Cabanas (that fit 2 lounge chairs and a small table, I think) were available for $75/day I think but we didn't feel the need for or use one. The beach - ahhh - what can I say about Polo Beach? We absolutely loved it. The attendants were always more than willing to help drag chairs through the sand for me and we spent hours upon hours enjoying the sand and the surf. It's a great little beach. We did not do it this time (but will on our next visit!) - but they had boogie boards available for rent - $9/hour or $20 for the day. There were umbrellas available for rent down there as well as chairs with \"hoods\" to protect you from the sun. We did not have any complaints whatsoever and I would not hesitate to recommend this resort to even my pickiest of friends.

I did much research on the hotel and Maui before deciding on where to go. We decided to do 5 of our 10 nights at the Kea Lani and the first half at the Kappalua Villas (next to the Ritz). Negatives: (1) We had to wait almost 2 hours to get our rooms \"ready\". They told us they would call us when it was done, finally almost 2 hours later, my husband had to go ask the front desk what was taking so long and they finally had it ready....when we did arrive to our room (which was a Deluxe Ocean Front), there was some else's bags in our room. SO, we had to go all the way down to the front desk again and tell them there's someone else's belongings in the room. The front desk girl tells us the room is ours, but they need to move those bags, which belong to another guest to another room. The original guests in that room decided they wanted to upgrade. Well, when we did get to our room, it was nice, clean, spacious, all what you expect at a 5 star resort. However, our ocean front room was not really ocean front. So again we went to the front desk and asked them why we didnt get the room we're paying for and to the hotel's standard we did have deluxe ocean front...but we were facing the Four Season's villas as well as the ocean, so honestly we felt we did not get our money's worth on the room itself! (2) The concierge's desk was a joke. The attitude at the concierge's was not helpful, but rather half --- when you asked them to do anything (i.e. my husband asked if they could give him some change...so we can tip the valet...but the response he got was \"the front desk can give you change\". the front desk had several people waiting in line to check in and out but the concierge's didnt have anything else to do) (3) The pools are average at best, nothing spectacular....seen better pools at my friend's backyards! (4) Service over all was a 4 out of 10. I dont feel they go above and beyond what they should at a resort area like this. I felt like the service was like a Holiday Inn (at best!) Positives: (1) The food was good, not great, but good. It is not that expensive considering you're at a resort and in Maui. (2) The valet and bell desk service was great, that was the only service at the hotel worth praising. They actual gave the island hospitality that lacked everywhere else on the island! Over all I am not a person that gets hung up on 'status' or '5 star' places, but I do expect a certain level of service and quality when I do pay for these things...and the Kea Lani did not give us that quality service one should expect. The resorts in Waiela in general was not that great, we went to the Four Season's, Grand Waiela and they weren't anything spectacular either. MAUI IN GENERAL: As I mentioned, we did stay at the Kappalua Villas (next to the Ritz) and those villas were great! We had a 2 level ocean front (real ocean front, literally we can walk up to the beach...so beautiful!) 1 bedroom, 2 bath villa. This was far less costly than the Kea Lani and 100 times better! Also, the Ritz was beautiful, the resort was amazing and the service and food was great! We should have stayed there after our stay in the villas, instead of the Kea Lani! As far as food....we ate at almost every single resturant in Waiela and nothing was worth really mentioning except for Longhi's. The food at Longhi's was great, espeically breakfast....which we ate next to Magic Johnson & family...very nice guy! We had been there during the Waiela Movie Festival so a lot of Hollywood was there. Roy's in Kiehi was OK, probably the next best to Longhi's. In Lahiana we loved Aloha mixed plate, cheap & good! Can't go wrong with korean bbq! I'O is where we had our reception dinner (on front street) and I'O is the BEST food we had while in Maui. The food, service and atmosphere was excellent! Definately recommend I'O as the place to try dinner during sunset...as they have an ocean front view outside for lunch, dinner or drinks! We also went Parasailing and did the helicopter ride around the island, which was both very fun! We wanted to go horseback riding but those book quickly, so do it a few weeks ahead of time! Road to Hana...I'll pass! We did do this, but it is not for those who dont like looong car rides and are not really into 'nature'. Yes there are beautiful waterfalls, and the seven pools are nice...(they were closed when we went so we didnt go in..too bad! as that was what was motiviating me to end of the ride) and the black sand beach....nice, but not 'sand' more like lava rocks! All in all, Maui was nice....although we found it boring sometimes (being we're in our early and mid 20's)....more ideal for families or older couples. The food was nothing amazing, we've had better in Oahu and the locals were not as friendly as they are in Oahu....next time we'll be in Oahu or Fiji...Maui maybe in another 10-15 years when we dont want much of a night life or fun!", "Date": "July 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cThe Fairmont Rocks!\u201d", "Author": "Ava007", "ReviewID": "UR3542209", "Content": "The Fairmont Kea Lani is an absolutely beautiful 5 star luxury resort.

The luau at the Hyatt in Kanapali was excellent, food was great and not so unusual that you will not eat it, I actually had seconds.

All of the roads were really well marked; we didn't even need the maps I had printed out before leaving. Once at the hotel, we were greeted with cool towels, leis (a candy lei for our keiki), and POG juice. We requested a renovated suite and were upgraded at no charge to a partial ocean view room. (Be sure to join the Fairmont President's Club before you go. At no charge, you are given some upgrades and perks.) What a room! Our 840 square foot room consisted of a huge marble bathroom with two sinks, sunken tub, and an open shower, kitchenette area with fridge and microwave, living room with large comfy sofa (sleeper), and spacious lanai with chaise, table, and four chairs. Both the bedroom and the living room had televisions and there was a stereo system, DVD player, and VCR in the room. The rooms were remarkably clean as there was twice daily maid service. The hotel provided us with a crib and a pack 'n play for the pool. There are four pools at the Kea Lani. The adult pool is set off by itself. It looked lovely and quiet. The other pools are grouped together. There is a baby pool which our son loved! It is perfect for toddlers. The other pools are spacious and wrap around the grounds. The water slide is a blast. My husband got lessons from many 7 year olds as to how to get down really fast (stick your belly out). There is a small waterfall in one of the pools. They were giving scuba lessons in the pool at the hotel. We reserved a cabana for our keiki. Shade is hard to come by at the pool. There are very few umbrellas (they go fast). They provide you with a roomy cabana, two chaise lounge chairs, a cooler with juices, waters, and an Evian atomizer, and a fruit bowl. We had great service: fresh towels, pineapple, cool washcloths at the pool. All in all they are expensive, but we felt it was well worth the money so we could have our little guy in the shade. We had a hotel pack 'n play at the pool and our son was able to nap in the cabana while we enjoyed a little down time. We were lucky to have been at the hotel when it was not too crowded. There were many horror stories about fighting for chairs during high season that sounded awful. We ate a couple of lunches at the pool area. It is pricey, but convenient. I am still dreaming of the \"Pirates Treasure\" - a yummy mango/pineapple rum drink! One day we ordered pizza from Shaka Pizza at the pool. Good stuff! We used the Nanny Connection for three nights of our trip. All of the hotels use this service. We requested a sitter that had been with them over five years and who had lots of experience with toddlers. Our son wound up never even meeting our nanny. He went to sleep each night before she arrived. Nevertheless, she was pleasant, prompt, loaded with toys and activities, and truly seemed nice. We were able to have a few dinners to ourselves with complete confidence that he was being taken care of. (Down at the pool we met a few more sitters from the service and each one was nicer than the next.) As far as restaurants go, we loved so many places! The breakfasts at the Kea Lani buffet were great. If you can get the buffet included in the price of your room you can save some money. Kids eat free. Don't miss Mama's Fish House in Paia - great food, atmosphere, and sunsets. We loved the menu. Each fish lists the fisherman, boat, and location caught. The town is really funky, too. Good people watching and surfing. We also loved Roy's and Tommy Bahama's. We ate at Nick's one night in the hotel. We enjoyed it, but it didn't hold a candle to the one in Chicago. Funny story: We watched the waiters move our salt and pepper shakers around all night. My husband decided to move them around himself to see what would happen. They kept moving them back to a different position on the table. We finally asked one of the waiters about it. Apparently, they use the shakers to tell the other wait staff what has been ordered, what has been asked, which position each person is, etc. Sansei for sushi was good, but we have had equally good or better sushi at home. We didn't like Joe's Bar and Grill, but heard their other restaurant Haliimaile General Store is excellent. We also loved the coffee at BadAss Coffee Shop in Kihei. There are so many great places to dine on the island. As far as shopping goes, the Shops at Wailea down the road were nice. Good souvenirs. We actually found great stuff for our nephews at Longs and Safeway of all places! If you venture out to Lahaina try to avoid it when there is a cruise ship docked. Very crowded. Our favorite place was Makena. It is gorgeous, peaceful, and unspoiled. Drive down all the way to end (even where the road is one lane). The water is magnificent and the lava fields are spectacular. Maui is amazingly beautiful, relaxing, and laid back. We can't wait to return.

It is difficult to say which one is better because both are really exceptional resorts. There were good things and bad things about each one. The positives of staying at Fairmont are: all rooms are suites, pool area is much larger than the four seasons, the resort itself is much bigger than the four seasons, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The biggest positive about Fairmont for me was the beach! I don't think the hotel owns the beach but the location is such that only hotel guests have access to it so it is really private, not very noisy, and not crowded. Upon arrival we were greeted with leis, cold towels, and juice. We are members of the presidential club so we were upgraded to a nicer suite without even asking. Room service was prompt and efficient. We noted that I had left my lei on the couch and when we returned, housekeeping had taken the lei and put it in a heart shape on the coffee table. The bathrooms are huge and recently renovated. Although the restaurants are good (especially Nick's fishmarket), there are good but limited food choices so one can get bored eating the same type of things more than once. It is a tropical climate and the fairmont has open walk ways so there are some areas where the carpets have dark mold on them in the corners but it is not really noticeable. The only real negative was that the Fairmont really nickel and dimes you for everything. $75 for cabana rental!! There is also a charge to rent dvds. At the four seasons, those things are free. We did not rent a car but apparently parking is also very expensive, that is free at the four seasons. The spa is ok and over priced, not that great of a facial and it was nearly $300, but I am an avid spa goer with really high standards so that is my disclaimer. If you want to stay at the fairmont, use the spa at the four seasons because it really nice and the services are better priced. The Fairmont also offers some complimentary activities, the canoe experience is great and I recommend that because the four seasons does not have anything comparable to it. Overall, we had a great time at the fairmont and will most likely return but we will divide our time again between the four seasons and the fairmont.", "Date": "May 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cFairmont Kea Lani 5 Star attitude!\u201d", "Author": "SC/BTravels", "ReviewID": "UR3474179", "Content": "As previous guests at the Kea Lani we feel our experience needed to be given to others who are looking forward to an upcoming stay. From the moment we arrived the staff and accomodations were excellent. We were booked into a renovated room on the 7th flr. overlooking the adult pool area. This is a great location if you are looking to relax in your own room on the balcony during the day. Since this was above the adult pool (18 and older allowed) it was not noisy, but pretty sedate. With all the families staying at the resort, noise was never a problem, it seems everyone from staff to guests are friendly (just that aloha spirit). The renovated room was updated with new carpets, paint, window coverings and bedding. The lighting was improved in the bathroom also (they used to be really dark). We ate at Caffe Ciao and Nick's twice and enjoyed both for different reasons. You can't compare as they are totally different restaurants. We also had drinks and appetizers in the lobby bar one night as our dinner. We had a couples massage at Spa Kea Lani...sooooooo relaxing! Cabana's are expensive ($75 perday) but do include a cooler with waters, juices, mints, evian spritzer, magazine and fruit bowl. You are offered a refill too.

These trip advisor rewiews were helpful to me, so I should like to share the following nuggets with you prior to your trip. Maui is expensive! The best times to visit are the spring or autumn, when rates are generally lower for rooms, rental cars, etc. The taxi fare from the airport to the hotel is $38.00 plus tip. Go to the taxi kiosk near baggage claim to get a number (if not renting a car). Costco is near the airport if you need to load up on any items. The air around the airport is polluted from a sugarcane factory smokestack bellowing effluent, but the coast near the hotel is clear and beautiful. Join the President's Club by registering for free on the Fairmont website. The bellhop greeted us as if we were old friends and frequent guests. There is a special reservations desk for the President's Club where you are greeted with chilled guava juice, chilled washcloths, flower lais for the ladies and nut necklaces for the men. We had a renovated deluxe oceanview room that was a spacious suite of approximately 900 sq. ft.. The foyer entry has a granite wetbar with a large microwave, coffepot and small refrigerator. The living room has a complete Sony stereo system with DVD, CD, tape players and gamestation. The king sized bedroom (non-smoking) has dual closets and safe w/ key. My wife liked the large bathroom and amenities. We were lucky with our timing because there were no conventions during our stay at the third week of April. The hotel was only at 60% occupancy, so the service was prompt, relaxed and comfortable. For golf nuts like me, I suggest using the hotel's clubs which are free to President's Club members (Taylor made RAC OS irons and R-5 driver, 3W & 5W and a free sleeve of balls). I prefer the Gold and Emerald courses at the Wailea golf course (******) - $150 per round or use Wailea's Triple Play Pass $375. The Plantation course at Kapalua was closed for repairs. Food at the hotel was very good. Nick's Fishmarket is best ($100 per person with alcohol and tip). Caffe Caio restaurant and Deli / Bakery was good. Buy wine at the Deli and enjoy dinner on your room's balcony at sunset. The Kea Lani breakfast buffet is excellent ($25 per person). The Polo Beach is nice. There is a 3 mile roundtrip beach sidewalk for morning walks. You can cross through the Marriott Hotel and walk directly into the Shops at Wailea. For additional restaurants, I suggest Sarento's (owners of Nick's Fishmarket) at sunset. The waiters were so good they changed our water glasses at mid-meal. Ferraro's at the Four Seasons is better than Spago's. Longhi's, Tommy Bahama's and Ruth's Chris Steakhouse at the Shops at Wailea were all good. The Four Seasons has a small pool and doesn't have the same Hawaiian feel as the Fairmont or the Grand Wailea hotels. Breakfast at the Four Seasons (Granola w/ fruit and an egg white omelet) was $50 with tip. The Grand Wailea hotel is beautiful, but loaded with children and families. The Fairmont has three large pools, including an adult only pool which is good for lap swimming. The Kea Lani is shaped like a big \"W\" facing the ocean, with moorish, arabesque tones and a Greek island setting appearance. Maui is one of the most popular island resort destinations, and the natives are friendly. Our Fairmont experience was very comfortable and positive. Another nice aspect is the Fairmont's free shuttle service to local restaurants and hotels, so you save on cab fares. To paraphrase a golfer in our foursome who said: \"You pay a lot of money to have them blow smoke up your backside,\" Take a lot of $1 and $5 bills for tipping.

It was a beautiful hotel and the experience was somewhat positive. We stayed at the Hyatt on Kauai prior to arriving at the Kea Lani and I was a bit surprised at some of the service issues at the Kea Lani. In all fairness, the resort was very busy and I think that this definitely could have impacted our stay because the resort was highly recommended by many other people. We arrived around 3:30 and our room was not yet available. I think we got in around 4:30 or so. The room was very nice and spacious. We had requested one of the rooms that had already undergone the renovations but unfortunately, that request was not honored. Oh well, it was still nice. We went to Nick's that first night. They were pretty busy. They seated us and brought out our drinks. 2 rounds of drinks later, I had to find someone to see if we could see a menu and order. They were pretty flustered as they thought we had already ordered. (We had been there almost an hour) but it was our honeymoon and we were trying not to be uptight. The food was good though and I thought they had a nice wine selection. When we got back to our room there was a gift there. I opened the card and unfortunately, it was for another couple. When I called the desk they told us to keep it. I let them know that it was actually a personal gift from a person not from the hotel. They said they'd be up to get it but almost 2 hours passed and we wanted to get to bed so I called back and they told me to just leave it in the hall. I hope the other couple got their wedding gift. . . We had a difficult time getting any drinks etc at the pool so be prepared for that if they are busy. We also were unable to get help from the concierge on restaurants. She instead told us that it would be best for us to just drive and look around. We also requested a later check out time by 2 hours and the Fairmont wouldn't allow this. They offered a courtesy room but wouldn't allow us to keep ours for 2 hours longer. . . Overall, I did truly like the hotel. It was very nice and the people were nice. I did however want to write an honest review of what happens when they get busy and are renovating at the same time.

It was packed when we were there and we experienced very mediocre service all around, at Nick's, Cafe Ciao, Concierge and pool attendants, especially. Food was mediocre as well and Nick's seems to be overated. These peak times should be an opportunity for a hotel to really shine and provide a wonderful experience but the Fairmont is not yet up to the task. The fitness center needs to be at least three times the size to accomodate the demand and the pools need to be enlarged somehow. Yes, there were enough chairs but not enough shade and it all felt too crowded. Also, considering the competition, (FS) the Fairmont should not be charging for cabanas and beach umbrellas (or boogie boards for that matter). Just build it into the room rate if you have to so there is at least some perceived value. We were so underwhelmed with this hotel in general that we only ate three meals there and had our Spa treatments and most meals at The Four Seasons. On the plus side, we stayed in a villa and it looked to be recently renovated and the beds were very comfortable. Housekeeping also did a nice job. There could have been more kitchen supplies since we do like to cook so that was a little disappointing. There was also something odd about the sofa in the living room - it made us itch when we sat on it! Was it fleas or a chemical in the fabric? We couldn't figure it out but we didn't spend enough time on the sofa to be too worried because the living room TV didn't work very well (!) so we watched TV in the bedroom.

The bathroom was spacious and everything clean. The balcony was big also and had both lounge chairs and a table with chairs. The room had a microwave and a small fridge which can be handy. THE SERVICE. The service was great from check in to departure, from the valet to the pool and restaurants. Friendly staff. When we checked out we forgot my daughter's small blanket, one of those things that can not be replaced and that she sleeps with, and I did panic a bit when I realized it at the Four Seasons. I called and spoke with the housekeeping manager. Within 24 hours, the blanket (clean) was wrapped in paper and brought to our room at the FS with a hand-written note. Very nice touch! THE POOL. Cabanas were nice but did charge a fee. The sides will close though to provide plenty of shade. Overall the pool was not too crowded and we could find a great spot every day. Swim up bar was great also. Slide and kiddie pool good for the little ones. THE BEACH. Nice. They have a hut with staff so we had help setting up our chairs. It is downhill from the pool and hotel and the walk up can seem long if you have little ones to carry or that get tired. NICK's. Wow.

It was so nice to have a refrigerator so we could grab a quick yogurt and fruit before heading out for the day and to have a bottle of wine chilling for our return. My only gripe was having to pay extra to rent a beach umbrella daily. Considering the room rates, I don't think that's too much to ask.

We could see the entire ocean, the island of Molokini and humpback whales from our balcony. Be sure to get a room on the 5th or 6th floors. The pools are great and slide is a blast. The beach is very nice and try renting a boogie board from the poolside desk...lots of fun. Before you go, sign up for the Fairmont President's club (-------).

Check in was nice with leis for adults and candy leis for the kids. Fresh guava juice is offered to you as well. Valet is very very helpful and nice. The poolside room was decorated very nicely and has beautiful linens. It is more noisy when you have this type of room so keep this in mind if you would like to stay poolside. The moderate room is just as big but in the older section which not as nicely decorated. Since it is all white the stains tended to show and there was more wear and tear but it was much more peaceful and quiet there which was very nice. The breakfast buffet is worth the 25 dollars price but you must be hungry. My girls loved the miso soup japanese bar they had. My favorite place was the caffe ciao that had amazing pastries, snacks and little gifts. Try the ice cream there and you won't be disappointed. The pool area was nice. They have three pools. One pool is for adults. One is the general pool for everyone and very large. The last pool is smaller and in an upper lagoon that has a small slide that goes into the general pool. They have a swim up bar at this pool. My only complaint is the cabanas are 50 dollars to rent per day and there isn't much shade unless you rent one. Bring a hat in case you don't like being in the sun all day long. Lunch at the POLO GRILLE was very nice and overlooks the ocean.

We didn't check out any other resorts in South Maui so we have nothing to compare it to but it made me proud to pull in everyday.

When we didn't have a couple nights of reservations the 4 concierges helped tremendously to get us in to some great restaurants. We were told to sign up for the Fairmont President's Club online before we left and there are some great perks for a free club membership, we are so glad we signed up.

Its one of the few places that you get a full two room suite, full balcony which was great for in room dining - and large two sink bathroom. I'm not sure whether it was a renovated room or not (see next) Average - our room was clean but dingy, as was the rest of the hotel. Looked like it hadn't been freshened up with paint, carpet, etc in years. The bed was uncomfortable and the sheets paper thin. Hallways seemed superficially cleaned, but in need of paint and a real cleaning job. Food was a challenge and amazingly there are really no good casual evening options. If you want to hang out by the pool in the evening, forget it. Ciao deli has breakfast items - but they are very slow and disorganized, which is quite amazing. Even on non-busy mornings, it took a long time to get simple service of coffee and pasty. We had room service two nights - first night was good, second night the food was cold, congealed and late (took well over an hour and 15 minutes), it had been promised in 45 minutes or less. Bad - we found the staff to be surely, unfriendly and generally not inviting or welcoming. Best staff was at the valet, worst at the pool. Concierge treatment was the worst of any hotel I've been at (and I travel a lot). The pool/beach staff spent most of their time talking amongst themselves and pushing each other around. If you've been to the Four Seasons (pick one), the difference is night and day. Finally the spa and workout room are a dirty, outdated disaster. Go next door to Four Seasons or better to Grand Wailea which has amazing facilities. Overall, hard to recommend the Kea Lani and we would not stay again.

After much debate between it and the Four Seasons, we opted for the Kea Lani due to it being all-suite. We appreciated the space and were glad we did. When we checked in, I asked for a renovated suite at the suggestion of someone on this site, and we were given a suite in the back overlooking the parking lot. I am not knocking the suggestion to ask for a renovated room - the decor was very different and very nice, but when the manager offered us rooms with better views, we opted for a non-renovated, all white suite with views of the resort and ocean. It was a vast improvement, and we were appreciative of the upgrade. We ended up sitting on our lanai every night enjoying cocktails and the view, something we would not have done looking at the cars. :) We bought the romance package and thought it was a fantastic deal! The candlelight dinner was a highlight and spectacular. I don't want to give away all the secrets of it - you'll be pleasantly surprised yourself. The spa treatment was great, but the spa is not all that decadent compared to some others. If you are big spa people, this one is a bit on the small side. Again, the treatment was wonderful, however. We booked a snorkel trip with Blue Water Rafting, and it was perfect. What a great guide, and we saw many whales. One even swam right under the boat. It was awesome. I highly recommend that outfit. Very nice people. If you choose the Kea Lani for your honeymoon, you will definitely NOT be disappointed. The service was excellent, the pools beautiful (although the one with the slide was closed for renovation), and the resort itself immaculate. And mid-December seems like a great time.

Me, spouse, and 2 pre-teen daughters. As per everyone elses comments, the hotel was great. Great service from everyone we made contact with. Of course for this price you expect that, but they delivered. Pool areas are great. Adult pool stays very quiet, other 2 pools are alive with both adults and kids. Water slide is very cool, but does take some technique to get a really fast ride(arch your back and go down on only the heels of your feet and your shoulder blades !). Many adult men having way too much fun competiting to see who get get the fastest ride, and yet it's tame enough young kids can enjoy it also. My 12 year old old ended up with slide burns on her shoulder blasdes from go down the slide so many times. There's a nice swim up bar, but as with everything else in Wailea, prices are a little high. We did splurge and get my wife a drink in an actual pineapple, she loved that. The kids could get smoothies, they really got a kick out of sitting at the bar. We had a garden veiw room, NOT a newly renovated one, but still fine. All beds were comfortable, and everything was clean. Maids took very good care of us. Make sure you join Fairmont Presidents Club so you get a newspaper delivered to you door every morning. Our view was simple but great, very well groomed garden area, and fountains in the background. Slept with windows open several nights, no bugs at all while we were there. (you would think in such a tropical area mosquitos would be out of control, but didn't see a single one the whole trip). They offer free valet parking, but it's not really free since you are supposed to tip the Valets. I'm a cheapskate, so I parked for myself most the time. Parking spots can be hard to come by (I think Thanksgiving week is one of there busiest of the year though), but I felt it was very convenient always knowing where the car was and being able to come and go without interacting with anyone if I chose not to. As for activities right at the hotel, if you have young kids (or are young at heart yourself), the koi feeding every morning is kind of fun to do once. Good video opportunity. They also offer a free intro Scuba lesson in the pool, and it was one of my daughters biggest highlights. Just be prepared that they give you about a 30 minute scuba tutorial before letting you put on the gear and get in the pool, but still well worth it if you've never scuba'd before. Then you have the opportunity to do guided dives with the instructors on the reefs right off the beach (not free anymore though). You should also make sure to reserve a spot ahead of time for the complimentary Canoe trip experience. It's not that it's something you can't miss, but it is fun and different, and takes only 30-40 minutes (and did I say I was a cheapskate, and it's free !). If they come across Turtles, they let you jump out of the canoe and swim with them for a while. Speaking of Turtles, if you snorkel out on the north reef on the hotel beach, you may come across a few big ones, my daughter and I saw 2 of them, and got pretty close up and personal. Very cool to see that right on the beach of the hotel. As for the beach, nice and clean, water is of course very warm. In a former life I was an avid body surfer, but the waves break way to close to shore for good body surfing. Applies to all beaches I saw in Wailea. Good for some boogie boarding, but not surfing. Waters are very safe for swimming and snorkeling, and you'd be surprised how little you need to swim out to see some cool fish and formations. I've heard people say the beach(Polo Beach) is small, but plenty of room for sunning and sand castle building, so I'm not sure what peoples concerns were. If you need a bigger beach for a broader view, drive a few minutes south to Big Beach, same quality/features as Polo beach, just much bigger. OK, enough on the hotel related stuff, let's talk about the fun stuff. If you are the adventurous type, a great snorkel trip is one with a group called \"Blue Water Rafting\", take the 5.5 hour trip. It's not your normal everyday snorkel trip. Instead of just going to Molokini like most the other snorkel tours, they go south down the Maui coast. They pick you up at the Kihei boat ramp(only a few minutes way from the Kea Lani). They take you south down the coast, onceyou get past Wailea the going gets really rough. But you get to see sea caves and rock formations you will not see on other trips, and in fact they even back you in to one of the sea caves, definately a highlight. Be prepared they aren't kidding about not taking this trip if you have a bad back/neck or are pregnant, the first part of the trip is extrmmely rough going. But my 12 year old was thrilled with it, she thought it was just like riding a roller coasteron the ocean. It was fun for me also. But one women actually started having a panic attic, and if you are susceptible to seasickness, this is NOT the trip for you. Otherwise it will be some of the best money you'll spend on your whole trip. After going south down the coast, they also do a free float at Molokini, which allows you to see different things that what you see with the bigger boats that anchor in Molokini. During this trip we saw breaching whales, 2 different types of Sea Turtles (Green and HawksBill), octopus, and bottlenose dolphins. The 2nd snorkel trip we took was one of the tamer ones, with the Pacific Whale Foundation, which leaves out of Maalea harbor. Really big boat, lot's of inside covered areas for those like my elderly in-laws, but lots of good views outside too. And they teach a lot about what you see, even a special kid oriented session near the end of the trip. Cheapest trip for the kids, and on this trip we saw a ton of spinner dolphins on the Lanai coast and big sea turtles right outside the Harbor. Another trip I'd highly recommend. As for places to eat, Maui is very expensive for food and drink, shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. Wailea is even on the high side for Maui. Make sure you stop by a grocery store, or Walmart, for some cheap snacks, sodas, alcohol, etc you can keep in your hotel room. The best restaurant we went to was Nicks. Just incredible service, wonderful food, great presentation. Very, very expensive, but even for a cheapskate like me, was worth it for a one evening splurge. Leave the kids in the room though, that's what we did. HINT: bring your own DVD's from home to keep the kids busy, all rooms have a DVD player. The Kea Lani morning buffet is fantastic, but you'll never eat your money's worth unless you sit and chow for hours. We splurged on it once, and I ate a ton of smoked salmon. The kids and wife loved it too, but just couldn't pack away enough food to make it worth it for them. We also ate at several places in Kihei, and Pizza Hut Express will deliver to the hotel. There is an Outback Steakhouse near theSafeway, and the prices aren't much different than in the mainland US, so a good place to go when you want a known quantity for a reasonable price. Other places to try: Antonios for simple italian at reasonable prices. It's basic italian, small place next to Longs Drugstore, but good. We also thought Longhi's in \"Shops at Wailea\" was pretty good, but contruction in front of it means you no longer have a ocean view.

The adult pool area was fantastic and the grounds in general were superb, the grass was like a golfcourse and the common areas were very well designed. The children's pool looked great and the kids and parents there seemed happy, and the waterslide was great even for adults. Wait staff was courteous and for the most part expedient and there was little problem finding a good spot to lounge at any time of the day. We're not big \"ocean\" people but the beach area was quaint, if not a bit small but if its too small for your tastes there are many other beaches nearby. As for restaurants/room service/bar, we weren't overly impressed with Nick's. Perhaps we didn't order the right dishes but we've had much better in NY. Service was great and atmosphere was pretty good (not much of a breeze so dining was a little stuffy). Room service was quick and satisfactory. The lobby bar was ok, one night they didn't have food service but it had a great view of the grounds/ocean and drinks were good. We were very happy with the room given some of the earlier reviews I've read. They didn't have a king bed available our first night so they gave us a $100 credit for putting up with a double and for having to switch the next day, but that didn't bother us too much. The room was spacious and the bed (king) was very good, better than I thought it would be. The bathroom was large and luxurious, although the first room we were in didn't have very hot water in the shower. It wasn't overly decorated but it was certainly nice. The lanai was large and although we didn't have an ocean view (we were rarely in the room) was nice to have. Check in/check out/valet was all good, and although we weren't given towels and juice at check in we were supplied canned juice later and a frame for our honeymoon (yeah, they could have done more but we're not picky). Overall it was a great experience in a great location in Maui. Lots of honeymooners and lots of families, but as mentioned above the adult pool did a fine job for privacy purposes. Now, if we were to go back it would be tough to decide between the Kea Lani and Four Seasons (really can't go wrong--the Grand Wailea is great for families but we're not ready for that yet). The Four Seasons likely offers better services (we had a fantastic dinner there one night) and is on Wailea beach but the pool area was surprisingly extremely cramped.

I had booked prior to our trip the canoe ride the resort offers 3 times only in the A.M . That was a really fun morning. The guys that take you out tell you about the history of the canoe. They take you out and chat old Hawaiian songs... then let you hop out of the canoe and snorkel for about 15-20 minutes. The whole trip lasted about 45 minutes and like I said the kids had a ball. We rented a cabana for both the ocean and the pool. The pool cabana was bigger with more privacy but kind of noisy. The beach cabanas were smaller but really quiet depending on where you wanted to be. If your going to hang at the pool ask for #13,it overlooks the pool and the ocean. We also went to Nick's for dinner. My kids got room service (which they were really happy with and the movies which run from $9-12 per movie depending on how new they were) Anywhoo.... Nick's was nice. I believe our total dinner bill ran about $240.00. I had the Filet and it was good ,my husband had a fresh fish that was very good. I'm not a person who likes alot of waiters running around me and we did had about 3. It was a bit much when I ordered fresh berries and Grand Marnier and a waiter did a spoon-spinnig routine that made me dizzy....(just kidding) One of the waiters I talked to told me people really like that. To be honest we have traveled many places and thats the first time I got that kind of entertainment. But It was fun and we had a good time. We went to the Rennaisance Laui and the Fairmont drove us there which is great,they will drive you to any resorts in the immediate area . That was a fun Laui. Our kids our 11 and 13 , we got in line early and got a close seat, the food belive or not was really good. I would say that the best thing at the Fairmont was the customer service. Anything, (within reason) is attainable at this resort. I needed plastic cups with lids for the room, they brought them to me in less then 10 minutes as well as the S.F Chronicle every A.M. Everyone at this resort seems to calm and friendly. The staff knew us by name and I have to have to the valet ,who always put that darn top on our jeep for us! As far as resaurents, try Sansei for sushi (fun sushi bar, buy Hide(aka bob )a beer he will turn you on to some really interesting dishes. Go toThe Maui Prince Hotel, Ivan isa secret sushi chief that will blow you away . We met a few locals and ordered the \"Hurricane Ivan\" , it will put you back some bucks ($17.00 a roll) but it's not only out of this world for taste but a piece of art to look at. He is really incredible . In closing ,the Wailea area is pricey but you know that going in. The Fairmont has a nice \"quiet busy\" feeling. You know there's people there but the grounds are laid out do you really don't hear the noise,your kids won't get lost and you will really have a relaxing wonderful time.", "Date": "December 6, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAmazing!\u201d", "Author": "fam27", "ReviewID": "UR2831741", "Content": "We just returned from the Fairmont Kea Lani (Nov 8th to Nov 15th) and had a wonderful time.

Our flight from Houston was very long and tiring and included a glitch in the Honolulu airport that delayed our arrival in Maui by several hours. When we FINALLY arrived at the Kea Lani we were very tired, frustrated and frazzled. The Staff at check-in were exremely pleasant and greeted us with leis, a cool glass of fresh tropical fruit juice and a cool wash rag. How WONDERFUL it was to be pampered after such a long, frustrating trip. During our entire stay, we found the staff to be EXTREMELY pleasant and always quick to greet you with a friendly \"Aloha\" and end every interaction with \"Maholo\" (thank you.) The staff was probably 3/4 \"Hawaiian native\" to 1/4 \"non-native.\" Our room was the larger suite - the \"SIGNATURE KILOHANA KING SUITE\" which features more square feet and a VERY larg wrap-around lanai (patio). Our first day at the hotel, we went snorkeling - and immediately saw many tropical fish - right in front of the hotel's beach. The folks that said the water was unclear, must have been in the water where the waves break - which will always be less clear. If you go out a little - and especially by the lava rock - the water is very clear and full of life (I have the underwater pictures to prove it). We also enjoyed the pools of the Kea Lani - the pool area was kept perfectly clean and the grounds are well kept and manicured. There is a nice walkway that likns the Kea Lani to other nearby hotels (4-Seasons, Grand Wailea - and others). We spent some time at those hotels as well - and NEVER regretted chosing the Kea Lani. The rooms were MUCH bigger, the bathrooms are HUGE and you get much more for your dollar. Is it expensive? Yes - but this IS Maui, where EVERYTHING is expensive - but we feel we got a lot for our money. There are a couple of shopping centers nearby where you can stock up on inexpensive gifts - or food and liquor for your refrigerator. The restaurants are good. We had the breakfast included in our package and took advantage of it (except for a couple of days when we had to leave early for touring). The deli is a great place to grab a sandwich - and Nick's Fishmarket was a first class restaurant where we enjoyed a wonderful dinner. But here is a little tip which we enjoyed MUCH more. Our suite was overlooking the ocean and every evening we had beautiful sunsets. On our last night, I ordered room service from Nick's. We fixed our own drinks from our liquor stash in the refrigerator. Room service came up and fixed one of the tables on our balcony (we had 3) with a linen tablecloth. They brought up silverware, dishes, a wonderful salad and steak dinner. My wife and I sipped our drinks - ate a FANTASTIC dinner by candlelight and watched the most beautiful sunset we had ever seen - while the ocean waves soothingly crashed below and the gentle Hawaiian breezes blew across us. I had the sliding glass doors open to the suite and we listened to Hawaiian music playing over the speakers of the stereo (which is included with the room.) It was the most perfect dinner we have had in our many years together. We actually enjoyed it MUCH more than our dinner at Nick's... and it cost less. As we sat there and contemplated what a great week it had been - the moon crossed the sky - reflecting on the water below. (we also have gorgeous pictures of the sunset and moon on the water) This was truly heaven and we both agreed that this trip would likely NEVER be topped (and we have travelled a LOT.)

I spent countless hours trying to decide between the Fairmont, the Grand Wailea and the Four Seasons. They all seemed to get excellent reviews but for different reasons. They also seemed to have very different atmoshperes and that was important to my wife and I. We eventually decided on the Fairmont and here are some of the good and bad of the stay. -Upon arrival we did use the valet. They were very nice and professional. Since the service is free, except for the tipping its a great benny. -When we checked in we were informed that the King size bed that we requested wasn't available until tomorrow. I did request a newly renovated room and that was available but only with 2 full beds. The front desk advised that a king size bed in the catagory that we requested would be available the next day. We said that we would look at the room when it was available. The room wasn't newly renovated and had a downgraded view. We stayed in the 1st room, despite the 2 fulls. Definately ask for the newly renovated rooms. They are considerably better! -Bugs. We hunted and killed several cockroachs in the room during our 6 nights. Too many for such a short period of time. The hotel was clean and so was the room. Not too sure why they were around but they were. -The pool is OK. Nothing to get excited about. The pool staff is above average. Towels were plentiful. No real problem finding open seats. If you have kids I would consider the Grand Wailea. We walked through the grounds at the Grand Wailea and there is no comparison to the Fairmont. The kids will be excited and want to spend most of their day at the pool at the Grand Wailea, not so at the Fairmont. -The hotel bar is pretty quiet. Not much going on and not fun. -One bit of advice. If you plan to spend your time in Lahina/Ka anapali area (shopping/restaurants/nightlife). You might want to consider staying in that area. It's a good 45 minute drive from the Wailea area. That's with no traffic, with traffic look for an hour plus. There was always traffic when we were driving around. It's pretty heavy and the speed limits are on average 40 mph. Slow going. Overall, the hotel is good. The rooms (newly renovated) are very nice and the pool is nice but your paying alot for it.

Food at the hotel restaurants were good and we knew it was going to be expensive, but we helped our budget by shopping for snacks, etc at Safeway. All rooms come with a refrigerator & microwave which was nice since my daughter still likes to drink her milk warm. The nightly torch lighting ceremony was beautiful, the ocean was warm and calm and the beach was uncrowded! Because of the off-season, there wasn't much activity planned for kids, but my daughter had a lot of fun feeding the koi fish most mornings. I do have to say that the person in charge of bringing out the koi food at 9 wasn't very prompt and one day didn't show at all, a little annoying, but hey.. there's the fun waterslide. Most every employee we encountered asked us how our vacation was going and one of the managers, Todd, who seemed to be everywhere, was very nice and remembered our names, etc..

So, I guess if you don't want to be with the rug rats, go to Maui when they go back to school. The hotel was not perfect but it was pretty nice.

It's nerve-racking to travel with a kid with allergies. We had dinner at Nick's one night and the waiter was so absorbed in memorizing the menu. I told him about my son's allergies and he brought my son's fish swimming in butter. Guess we didn't have fun there.

The ocean view should be called \"Tip of the ocean view\". Not worth the $1900. Liked our suite better. If you're facing the beach, some of the villas on the right side were being renovated. So if you are rolling in it and want a villa make sure yours is newly renovated. There's a walking/jogging path that's a 3-mile round trip along the beach.

The views are awesome--even my little rug rat loved it. Don't go crazy about the prices in this hotel or anywhere in Maui. You know it was expensive. Have a great time. Give yourself a break. If you go to Makena beach--south of the hotel, be careful under the trees. The small pieces of the branches that fall have thorns. On the way to Makena there are some taco vendors. We ate some good tacos from one of them. Wailea is totally cool. It's beautiful and clean. Makena is quite and natural. Kihei is a kick back town. If you like seafood or Japanese, go to Sansei. We went there for Yellowtail cheek and great sushi.", "Date": "September 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Venice, ca", "Title": "\u201cMixed Bag\u201d", "Author": "bistecca", "ReviewID": "UR2524682", "Content": "My wife and I just returned from Maui. Stayed at the Ritz Carlton and the Kea Lani. Some hybrid of the two would have been perfect. (As a point of reference, on previous trips to HI we stayed at the Princeville resort, the Royal Hawaiian, the Lodge at Koele, and Kona Village.) Problem with the Kea Lani was with the check-in experience. Arrived, impressed by valet, lobby, and reception. My wife had told the reservation person we were in Hawaii to celebrate our anniversary. This information was never conveyed to staff. (At Ritz we received much love.) Anyway, still high on the check-in experience we came crashing down to earth when we saw the room--a mountain view that was actually a parking lot view. Room looked worn and dingy. So depressing. We complained and were led to another room, this one in the renovated section of the resort, which was nice, but what a journey. What was the guy thinking? We saw the bowels of the resort, construction workers ripping up carpet; the cold towels, lei greeting, and juice were a very distant memory. This new room was much better than the first, but was a double, not the king we had requested--at least we were spared the parking lot view. Why couldn't we have been offered this room in the first place. (We changed to another room the next day, which was very nice--if they had offered this room at the start all would have been great.) Ate at Nick's; had braced for ridiculous prices and Nick exceeded expectations. We had a very pleasant evening--excellent service, good food, but wildly overpriced. All in all, service at the resort was very good, bathroom in room is great, the beach is lovely, grounds are beautiful.

I wanted to post my review as I have referred to this site often for opinions, etc. The resort is fabulous, plain and simple. The service is outstanding from the valet to the housekeeping staff. The grounds are beautiful. The suites are spacious and very ideal for families with children. I traveled with my 2 young children and the suite was perfect. The bathrooms are huge! Housekeeping does an excellent job and \"services\" your room twice daily......turn down service in the evening includes replenishing of everything in the suite once again. Our check in service was friendly and efficient. My husband and I both received leis and our children received candy leis. We were not offered fresh juice or cool towels as I have seen mentioned in these reviews. We NEVER had a problem finding a chair poolside. Perhaps the resort was not as busy over Labor Day as it is other times of the year. There is an ample supply of lounges all over the resort. If you can't find one poolside, there are some located a few steps away all over the lawn. We were never offered fresh pineapple, cool towels or water poolside. They have cucumber/lemon water stations set up at various points around the pools. I have read where people find the kids to be numerous here at the resort. There is an adult pool and area that is very serene and quiet where you can relax and not be \"bothered\" by the noise of children enjoying themselves on vacation. The activity pool doesn't compare to the Grand Wailea, but the one slide was fun. If you are looking for a more relaxed pool area and non water park atmosphere, this is it. Rentals poolside were ridiculous....$12 for an intertube per day! Everything is pricey, but it's Hawaii and to be expected. Cafe Ciao was excellent for dinner. Great food and service. We ate at the breakfast buffet one morning. The food is average and can be found at any resort in Wailea. It's mostly convenience. The birds at that particular restaurant are terrible. They will steal your food right in front of you! We did not eat at Nick's as we had 2 children with us. It was busy every evening and the people we met had good things to say about it. If you are staying for more than a few days, I recommend stopping at Safeway in Kihei to stock up on essentials for the morning or light lunch as it is cheaper than dropping $50 on the same breakfast and lunch food every day.

The suites were spacious (make sure to request a renovated suite) with a fold out queen size sleeper sofa in the living room. We were able to put my 2 year old in the sleeper sofa and had plenty of room for the crib for our infant. The suites have mini kitchens (microwave ovens, small fridge, sink) and entertainment systems with TV, DVD/CD players.

The pool area was great. There is a lovely, quiet adult pool (no one under 18 allowed) and the two-level family pool. There is a water slide...great fun for kids (mostly 3 and older) and the upper pool has a swim up bar. The lower pool has a basketball net for water play and a separate wading pool for the littlest ones. Be warned, when we were there at the end of August, most of the chaise lounges by umbrellas were spoken for by 6:30AM.

I recommend you go to breakfast elsewhere. There are numerous spots to go that are cheaper and the food is better, unless you want to spend $50.00 for the same breakfast buffet every morning. As for the pool, better get there early to claim a seat or you will be stuck monitoring the pool for chairs all day. Take advantage of the resort car service. The service will take you to any place in Wailia, just in case you want to have some drinks for dinner. Not much of a night life there, but very relaxing. We stayed in oahu at the Royal Hawaian before going to Maui and we felt the staff at the Royal Hawian was much nicer to us.

There are three pools, one exclusivly for adults, which was nice when we wanted quiet time, but we also couldn't resist the water slide at the other pool! The hotel has great pool service and they bring around pineapple slices to everyone. The thing about this side of the island is that it goes to sleep early. Very quiet, which can be nice. Don't think you can get dinner too far after 9:00pm. Plan accordingly or you will have to drive up to Lahaina if you really want a night life. The only bad part is that we eventually had to leave.

The service and staff were amazing, I really got the feeling these people truly enjoy what they do...even housekeeping always had a smile on their face! Everything we could possibly want or need was available to us. After every excursion or return to our hotel, we were always greeted back warmly by the valet attendants. We went the week of August 10th and I'm sure they were booked to capacity, but it honestly never felt overcrowded. The grounds are spacious and gorgeous! We never had a problem getting lounge chairs by the pool, however finding one with an umbrella posed a bit of a challenge. Most lounge chairs were \"reserved\" with people's belongings by 6:00 am. But, here's a tip, people cannot \"reserve\" lounge chairs and go off to shower, have breakfast or generally take their time coming to the pool all awhile leaving their belongings on lounge chairs. If they are away for more then 1/2 hour, their spots are up for grabs. Ask a pool attendant to come and remove their belongings and they will keep them in the kiosk...and deal with them when they come to claim their spot. We did this a couple of times. The cabanas are available for $50.00, but you have to rent these months in advance! We ate at Nick's one night and it was very, very good...also very expensive. My husband and I enjoyed a nice, romantic dinner there one evening while our kids ate pizza at Caffe Ciao. We also enjoyed massages at the Kea Lani Spa...another wonderful experience, one of the best spas I've ever been to.

The Fairmont is indeed a beautiful hotel and luxurious as any available. We managed to get a really nice room although if you are partial to a good view from the room, you should confirm that your room is not facing the parking lot. I think it is designated as a garden side or standard room. Don't be fooled, it should be labeled as a parking lot suite. The suite itself was impressive and satisfactory. I especially liked the network internet service which is also available via the TV console if you don't have a computer. Definitely five star. However since this is my 4 trip to Maui over a period of 9 years, I have to say this is also a very bland hotel if you are interested in experiencing the Polynesian spirit. I felt this hotel could have been located in any Caribbean, Southern California or Cabo San Lucas luxury resort as it could have been Hawaii.

We had considered staying at the Four Seasons so we walked over there to see what the hype was about (a lot of great reviews on trip advisor). When we got there, we were so happy we had not stayed there. Their pool area is a joke. It is so small and crowded, it really feels like a cruise ship and not a hotel. There was one tiny pool full of adults and children, and that was it. If we had stayed at the Four Seasons, I don't think we would have wanted to spend much time at the pool. Overall, we loved our stay at the Kea Lani, and from what I saw, it is without question the nicest hotel on Maui. My wife and I really loved Kauai more because we loved the Hyatt, plus it had a much more magical feeling than Maui. We think it's because basically all of the employees at the Hyatt were native Hawaiians, while there are a lot of Americans working in Maui. It just didn't have the same \"aloha\" feel. It might sound silly, but it makes a huge difference. Also, Kauai is more beautiful. There are more touristy activities in Maui, though. After reading all of the great reviews on trip advisor about Nick's Fish Market, we at there, and both of our meals were terrible. Everything was over-spiced and tasted bad. The service was very bad, also, but I am much less concerned with service than I am with how my food tastes. It's one of those restaurants that tried so hard to be \"fancy\" and they use all kinds of exotic spices and ingredients, etc., but they forgot to make the food taste good. We had dinner nearby at Spago at the Four Seasons, and the food was awesome. Overall, I would highly recommend the Kea Lani to anyone, and I would definitely stay there again if I went back to Maui.", "Date": "July 12, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Resort\u201d", "Author": "BB8689", "ReviewID": "UR2271044", "Content": "We just returned from a 5 night stay at the Fairmont.

The activities desk really knew their stuff and the deep-sea fishing charter and snorkeling charter they recommended were great. The dining experience at Nick's was probably the best in my 49 years. The filet mignon was probably the best I ever had and the Mahi-Mahi was first rate also. Service was unsurpassed. If you are at all budget conscious be aware it is not cheap and the soft drink refills are not free. The pools were great and the beach was fun also. We had two 18 year old boys and a 14 year old boy with us. They had a great time. I think the 18 year olds would have preferred a more lively social scene so perhaps something in the Lahaina area would have suited them more. This was our best vacation experience ever.

To get that, we would have had to go to the middle or south wings next to the construction. It was nice room, though.

We ended up going to the Four Seasons spa instead. They have beautiful private huts next to the ocean, so you can enjoy the sound of wind, birds, and the surf. The spa there is fantastic and beautiful. The waiting room there offers dried Hawaiian fruits, tea, water, etc. as you relax waiting for your treatment. RESTAURANT: We also went to Nicks because we had heard so much about it. We ordered oysters on the half shell as an appetizer. I tasted a funky one. I mentioned it to my wife, and she said one of her oysters tasted bad, too. We didn't get too discouraged, laughed it off, hoping not to get sick. Then she found a bug in her dinner salad.

When we got there, we were offered an upgrade for a fee, but it was late so we decided to sleep on it. Our first room was nice, but with absolutely no view. The next morning, we asked for the upgrade, packed up our bags and spent the day on the beach.

Our room was above the restaurant and main pool (not kids pool) and we had a great view of the ocean every morning and night. The staff was a delight - the concierges made all of our reservations at the restaurants we read about in review books. The beach was small, but beautiful and never crowded. The chair guy knew us by the second day and as soon as we'd walk up to the beach, he would set up chairs for us in our usual spot. Food: Breakfast was included in our package so we had the buffet each morning. Very good! Nick's was awesome. We had one full dinner there, then one light dinner (the Maui Wowi salad and caramel souffle are unbeatable) at the bar during sunset. Also good are Spago (Four Seasons) - ate there 2x and had the whole fish both times - and Mama's Fish House (amazingly fresh fish caught that day and macadamia nut torte).

To start off, we we pulled up to the entrance of the hotel and were greeted by the guys parking the cars. They told my husband to leave the luggage and it would be sent to the room (mind you they have our car keys and last name). Check in was not really a breeze-we waited on line-man at front desk was somewhat rude when I asked if they had any upgrades- he shoved in my face the room rate card and said this will be the price to upgrade. He then started pointing and gesturing us in the direction to the room like we were bothering him--just thought for this type of hotel a friendlier attitude was expected -- and stated our luggage would be right there. We finally find the room and it was disgusting -- obviously not a \"newly renovated room.\" It was dirty (how about killing some bugs--I hope because there was no screens on the sliding glass doors to the balcony and how about seeing hair all over the floor- it also smelled musty). In addition, we were overlooking a party and the service entrance. For the money we were paying I found this unacceptable. Now about 1/2 hour has gone by and we get a call from the bell hop saying \"we lost your luggage.\" How do you loose luggage (that has identification tags on it) that is in a guests rental car. To make a long story short-- I decided to go to the front desk and see what was going on -- when I find my luggage sitting by itself on the curb-- TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!!! Mind you about 45 minutes has gone by now. Well after this, we immediately got in touch with the manager of the hotel who moved us to a newly renovated room (it was like night and day). The manager was very nice and he knew the old room was not up to Fairmount standards. So why would they give this room to a paying guest!!!!! He also said that it was a very busy day for them and that they were a little overwhelmed. They are a 5 star hotel, and I felt like that was a poor excuse. He did give us though a $100 credit for incidentals. The day gets better though (not really)-- we decided to go by the adult pool and order a late lunch.

However if I was on a romantic vacation or honeymoon would probably do the Four Seasons instead. Be sure to ask for a recent renovated room. Service was wonderful, truly aloha spirit. Polo Beach was great, some erosion but still plenty of sand and snorkeling was good, but even better further down the coast. We had the beach in front of the Makena Surf condos and Big Beach to ourselves in the mornings. Worth it to get up early and snorkel before the crowds and the wind picks up. Beach access and parking all along the shoreline. Watch out for currents- can be very strong. We are strong swimmers but still several days did not venture out too far due to currents and wind, earlier the better! The \"Fishbowl\" is great snorkel spot for kids but parking fills up fast. The Shave Ice and Fish Taco guys in their van right where Wailea becomes Makena a nice stop on way back from snorkeling. Highly recommend Paragon Sailing Charters, second year we have gone out with them. They really sail-not just put the sail up for show. Very uncrowded boat- not the cattle call you see on some of the other boats and they always seem to find lots and lots of whales! I think the whales must like that they are sailing not motoring. Cafe Ciao Deli at the Fairmont a great pinic and breakfast stop. We made several meals from their salads and cheeses and fabulous desserts. Sarrentos on the Beach was the best meal although Nick's a close second place. (same owners) Food and service out of this world! Even though fine dining don't hestitate to take the kids- very nice children's menu- many steps above the standard chicken fingers and fish sticks and the staff was just wonderful with children. Polo Grille not so good- food is average but prices very high- but it is nice to just lay by the pool and have them bring it to you. Long's Drugs and the main Maui Dive Shop have good selection of beach toys and floats and much lower prices than buying from the pool/beach concession.

Immediately upon our arrival, we were greeted with Leis, cold towels and a great passion juice. Check in was a breeze and we were guided to our room. Just like others say, all rooms are suites, and the bathrooms are a definate high point. My view was not great, it looked into a new development which is being built. Aside from that, I dont know what things I can say bad about this hotel. Service was always with a smile, except at the pool with the slide, where the attendant was just worried about closing the slide and going home it seemed. The hotel is really nice and if you can, get the breakfast buffet package, its a good variety. Think its expensive??? The only thing that isnt is Mc Donalds, so plan on that. You will spend alot of money in Maui on food and anything else you buy. The adult pool is a relaxing place to swim, the other pools are full with kids and families playing...doesnt bother me but may bother others. I still say its a great honeymoon place b/c of the adult pools and great guest rooms. Plus, Maui itself is a great Honeymoon destination. Buy the book Maui Revealed if you can, it talks about all the good places to see, especially helpfull during the Road to Hana...... A MUST IN MAUI by the way. Sarrentos on the Beach was great, nice setting and good food, my wife especially enjoyed it. Back to the hotel, the maid service was good, the rooms were kept well.

Our first 6 days was at the Kia lani, and the last 4 at the Hyatt in Kanapali, My wife and I loved the Kia Lani, and it was a definite down grade to go to the Hyatt afterwards. The room was fantastic, but there were some issues:This was our 1st trip to Maui, and had our 17 yr old son with us, so we chose this hotel mainly on the all suite issue. The sofa bed had seen better days the cushions were flat and the bed was like laying on bars, However they did upon our complaint changed the cushions and gave us a roll-a-way at no charge. We were told that they are in the process of replacing all the sofa beds, so keep that in mind if your bring others to stay in your room.South Maui is definitely more lay back than Lahina so if your looking for peace and quiet you cant do any better, but if your looking for a hotel that has activities, pool or otherwise your not going to find that here. Also make sure your room is on the adult side of the pool if kiddy noise is something you re looking to avoid.For hotel nightlife and socializing you re out of luck! The pool bar closes at 6pm? And it's by the kid s pool! The lobby bars only open to 11, and the piano/singer doesn t allow for socializing with other guest.Please don't get the wrong idea; this is absolutely a 1st class operation, with one of the most service-oriented staff I've seen.

You bet, can t wait to get back.Also, on our arrival I was told by my family that we we re not going on vacation with that guide book I had my nose in on the plane ride that all changed after an awful breakfast we had right were the book said we would find the most tasteless food around!

Overall, our experience with the Kea Lani was fantastic. We debated between Kea Lani & the Four Seasons and opted for Kea Lani based on the \"suite\" room--and we weren't disappointed. Both the living room & bedroom were spacious & comfortable. The bathroom was HUGE (two sinks, huge tub, separate walk-in shower), with the toilet behind a separate enclosed door. When traveling with kids, the microwave/minifridge cannot be overestimated! We received great service from housekeeping and found our garden-level patio to be a great addition (for meals, activities for our 8 year old, etc.) The grounds were beautiful, (torchlit at night) and the beach was pristine and more than adequate in size. Our son loved the pools & the slide. We were right next door to the kids club which was outstanding and very professionally run. Our son went for one day and begged to go back the next. Bonnie the person who runs it is a sweetheart and great with the kids (cost is $55 a day for one kid). The concierge service was excellent ( prepared for any request), while the sevice at the activities desk was more average (seemed understaffed). The valet (included) service was wonderful (got towels for us as we departed on snorkel trips, etc.) There was a slight change for the worse during the busier few days right before the Thanksgiving holiday holiday as the pool area became a little overcrowded people were reserving chairs. A bit frustrating was the $50 a day charge for the shaded \"cabana\" areas by the pool and beach (essentially two padded chairs under a shaded tent), however may be the only way to regulate their use. With respect to food, Nick's Fishmarket was superb. Pricey but worth it with outstanding food, service and atmosphere. They even made an impromptu bed for our son when he fell asleep the first time by pushing two soft padded chairs together. The buffet was a bit overpriced but we found the food to be solid. By far the best value was the the excellent italian deli Cafe Ciao. Everything we tasted there was excellent. We made many outstanding meals just by combining their various pasta salads and sandwiches etc. Avoid the attached Italian restaurant though. Really not worth it. Overall our experience at Kea Lani was outstanding, although I think it perhaps slightly more ideal for families than honeymooners. Outside of the hotel, Shaka Pizza in Kihei was a great hole in the wall for pizza, hoagies etc as a break from the nice meals. We rented our snorkel equipment from Snorkel Bob in Kihei. The woman who runs (Sue?) Snorkel Bob was incredibly sweet and helpful, giving us great tips and letting us have a free ride on our extra couple of days over the week rental. Other fun highlights included a hike to the \"fish bowl\" a wonderful snorkel site reached by walking 30 minutes over the lava fields about fifteen minutes south of Kea Lani ( probably only for older kids though) and snorkeling off of the Maui Prince beach where we had multiple close encounters with the majestic sea turtles.

There was hardly anyone there in Sept and more adults used the slide than kids. You can rent pool rafts and kids flotation devices for $15-20 per hour or just purchase your own. They even said they would help you pump them up. Most pools don't let you have a raft in the pool but they did - a plus in my mind! We passed the costco on the way from the airport to the hotel and stocked up on water and other essentials. There was also a Walmart on the way. There is a small strip mall near the hotel with an Outback Steak house, Safeway, and Blockbuster. Food was very expensive, we made sure we purchased our package with the breakfast buffet which was very good. Not worth the over $20 a day you pay off the street. It was less when in our package. The hotel is right next to the Four Seasons and Grand Wialia. We walked to each. The Four Seasons looked very beautiful and quiet. The Grand Wialia looked trashed by 6pm when we were there.

We decided to stay at this property based on the reviews on this site, as well as others. I'll do my best to give you a complete overview of our stay. Location: Great location! I would not stay anywhere other than Wailea. The Fairmont is basically the farthest south that you can stay on the island (as far as large hotels). The area is generally very quiet and peaceful. There is an upscale shopping center nearby, and there's a grocery store about 10 minutes north. Grounds: Very, very nice. Not exactly what we expected, but nice nontheless. There are three pools, including one adults only pool. Beyond the pools is a large grassy area with palm trees and lounge chairs. Past the grass are the villas, and then finally the beach. The pool areas were generally very well kept, except for the very late afternoon before the pool staff had a chance to clean up. All the pools are infinity pools, so the water level is flush with the surrounding pool deck. On the top level pool there is also a swim up bar. The beach was great - very low surf and swell, with great soft sand. The only rub here was that they put away the beach chairs at 5 pm because it is a public beach. There is another beach just south of the Fairmont's, but if you go any farther you will have to scramble over some rocks. The pools were kept around 78 so they were very comfortable. Rooms: The rooms are very comfortable and large. The bed was great although the pillows left something to be desired - a little too hard for me. The bathroom is great - separate sinks, and a door-less walk shower. The tub fits two people, just barely. There is a fridge, microwave and sink in the room, which came in handy for snacks. Closet space is ample for two people, and the living area was very nice. As this is an older hotel, it did show a bit in the rooms - not the decor so much as the ceilings and trim work. The lanai was plenty big for the two of us. Staff: Very, very helpful, courteous and nice. The front desk went above and beyond the call of duty in getting us a room upgrade (our reservation got screwed up). Basically they comp'd us a double upgrade that would have run about $500 for our stay. They also sent up champagne and homemade chocolate turtles. When I say turtles, I mean that literally - chocolate turtles and a white chocolate starfish on crystallized can sugar that looks like beach sand. When our deli sandwiches got ruined in our cooler on a day trip, my wife ended up speaking with the hotel's assistant manager (Dan), who was nice enough to comp us lunch at the poolside grill the next day. Keep in mind lunch ran us 65 bucks. The bell and valet staff were equally as nice. This is not the kind of hotel where the staff hates there job - every single person was pleasant. Food: We mostly ate breakfast at the buffet as it was included in our package. It was very good in my opinions - made to order omelletes, pancakes, fruit, pastries, etc. It got me through to dinner most days. We did eat at Nick's, and it was very good. If you go to the island, you HAVE to eat at Sarento's, just up the road. It is amazing. Spago at the Four Seasons next door is also incredible. The Italian restaurant at the Fairmont was very good the night we at there. Note that the restaurants on the island are all very expensive - we didn't spent less than $100 on any occasion - that is with maybe one alcoholic drink, no appetizers for the two of us. You will not forget the seafood however - it is world class. Activities: nearby snorkeling is OK, but we are spoiled by Kauai. Even Molokini was a bummer, but we sailed over on a 47 foot catamaran run by Paragon and it was fantastic! While the power boats were crammed with over 100 people, we had 13 people on our boat including the crew. We hit 27 knots coming back from Molokini. Summary: I don't think I can give the hotel 5 stars, but it deserves at least 4, maybe 4.5. It wasn't quite the world class experience that we were expecting. Mind you there were multiple wedding per day on the property, and it did seem quite full even though it was after labor day. But it was relaxing and enjoyable. We didn't prefer Maui over Kauai, but if we were to return we would stay here or at the Four Seasons next door (even though it is substantially more expensive). We toured their hotel and even went into one of the rooms, and it is just a step up from everyone else. We were pleased with the Fairmont however.

Having been to maui 6 times my family has stayed in 6 different resort from Kapalua, Kaanapali to now Wailea. I've read the great reviews about the Kea Lani and it's 5 star rating was a plus in making my decision. The Lei greeting with guava Juice was a nice touch and the initial impression of the resort was good but not awe inspring like I've read from the other reviews. When we checked in we were offered an upgrade for a suite next to the pool at a discounted rate with one condition that we stay in our original suite for a night. We agreed, thinking for an extra $50 bucks a night we get such a great deal and our original room was facing a construction site next door with loud machinery . When we moved into our upgraded room the next day it was nice unitil we heard construction noise from the level above us. We soon found out why this room was such a good deal--they were renovating the floor above us from 7 am to 4 pm. If I would have know that this was going on I would have never moved perferring the construction noise next door than the annoying hammering above us. I complained to the manager a few times but they weren't really helpful. They're only advice to us was that the construction will only last a day but it went on for the 10 days we were there. The suite was nice, but not 5 star quality especially the old furniture and carpeting that needed a steam clean( if you view on expedia's virtual tour the room looks bigger than it really is). The large bathrrom was the nicest part of the suite with it's dual sinks and huge shower and tub. The intertainment system was nice as well with CD,DVD, VCR palyers in each room. All in all the rooms was 4 star at best not 5 stars. The grounds were very well kept and clean. The 3 pools were nice with a decent slide . My toddler loved the children's pool. The beach was a good size and clean--decent boogie board waves for your kids. The service was great with their complimetary pineapple slice and food servers were very attentive. And Yes, the Burgers are $15 but very good--it's huge! I have no complaints about their service and grounds. The breakfast Buffet was the usual fair nothing too impressive---pancakes , beacon, eggs etc. The outdoor restaurant has a bird problem so be careful not to leave your food unattended because a flock of birds will get to them----It almost was like watching Hitchcock's the Birds when they attacked the food! I don't want to come off as a complainer but just honest with my experience. Overall, I had a good time but I won't come back. I was expecting 5 star rooms , but what I got was a 4 star room at a 5 star price. For the same price I would stay at the Hyatt on Kaanapali or the Ritz in Kapalua.", "Date": "September 23, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cFantastic from start to finish!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1331289", "Content": "Our experience was truly wonderful from the time we arrived to that sad morning we had to leave.

Aftere the $$$ spent, view was great! Room needed a large overhaul. Bathroom was nice, kids loved the walk in shower, but I found lighting terrible and nowhere to stow bath articles. Closet space very minimal, had to ask for a few extra hangers and closet rod broke! Room definetely needed updating, 'cottage cheese' ceiling, carpets were stained, furniture was worn out. I feel they need to redecorate and it would be perfect! As for the restaurants Nicks Fishmarket was fabulous! Caffe Ciao restaurant and deli were superb!

The larger family pool is great for kids, though one will find much more appealing slides and pool features at the Grand Wailea but without the benefit of a hotel suite.

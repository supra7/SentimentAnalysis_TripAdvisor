He booked one evening in a regular room and added an extra evening once we got there. The front desk person was very nice and upgraded us to the whirlpool suite right away. That was awesome for a run of the mill business trip, however when I looked at the room number it was still being cleaned (we could see the room from the front desk, which was a little weird to us that she put us there with a cleaning cart clearly there and the door open.) The person cleaning was vacuuming and hurried and finished and got out. I kind of don't think the room was really that thoroughly cleaned. The carpet clearly hadn't been fully vacuumed, the bed was made but not as perfectly as I'm used too (and I stay pretty middle range hotels), and the comforter on top had something on it. Also when you look out the window there was a bunch of garbage scattered all over. We discarded the comforter and checked the other blankets which were in fact clean. There was a paper that said they had 100 channels with Direct TV, but initially we only got several very fuzzy channels. I played with the cord a little and it cleared everything up, but a far cry from 100 channels. The tv was nice though. The bed was very comfortable. I had been having some neck issues and slept great with the bed and pillows provided. Breakfast was decent enough (probably a step above the cold continental offerings), oatmeal, little muffins, cereal, bagels, bread, a waffle maker, some sausage patties, and pre-made egg patties. Since I was at the hotel while my husband worked, I considered swimming. However the pool didn't really look clean when we looked in on our way up to the room, so I decided to forgo that idea. The hot tub was great when we decided to give it a try. No complaints there at all. (We did use the one in our room not the whirlpool that is in the same area as the pool though) It was about 20 minutes or so from downtown and the same distance opposite direction from a bigger selection of restaurants which worked out fine for us. There isn't really much besides fast food nearby. The hotel could really use some updating, which it seems is in the future. I'd consider coming back with a little overhaul and better cleaning.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Muskegon, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cSmall Beds for a spacious room\u201d", "Author": "cberry135", "ReviewID": "UR124968337", "Content": "I stayed for the President's day weekend in a double bed \"suite\", which is really nothing more than a large room.

First, the positives: The hotel offers a nice lobby, breakfast area, and pool. The rooms are clean and comfortable as you would expect for a hotel in this class. However.... upon settling into our room, it didn't take long to realize that maintenance needs to be more diligent. First thing I always do upon entering a hotel room is to adjust the temperature. After fiddling with the controls I finally coaxed the A/C compressor into running.... for 30 seconds. The room remained stuffy and a bit warm throughout the night. Also, the in-room phone was unusable. Not sure what the issue was, but it sounded like the dial tone was having a fight with a bobcat. Finally, I had chosen a room with a whirlpool tub. One problem.... there was no way to plug the tub. There was some odd thing in the plug hole, but there was no way to make it stop the water from draining. I'm fairly mechanically inclined, yet I was baffled. Obviously, a whirlpool tub is useless without the ability to hold water. For fairness, I need to mention that due to the fact that my sleepy family of 5 arrived at the hotel late, these issues were not mentioned to the staff until morning, so they had no opportunity to rectify them. The staff was very apologetic and professional in the morning. I would have been more upset had this not been a free stay through then Choice Hotels rewards program. Nevertheless, having this many things broken in one room should never happen at a hotel in this class.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cNew Years Getway\u201d", "Author": "KayseN", "ReviewID": "UR91349784", "Content": "What a great getaway with friends to ring in the New Year. This Clarion Inn & Suites is in a great location close to area Restaurants and Shopping Our check in was quick and easy. The Staff was very helpful suggesting a very good restaurants even providing directions. We chose Rick's Boatyard Cafe. Everything was wonderful from the Seafood, pastas and salads. Dining by the firplace to watching the sunset made our experience even better. Ricks is a don't miss on your trip to Indy. Also a local favorite is Trader Joes an upscale friendly, wacky grocery that sales great wine and speciality foods. Ah we made 2 trips Other things to do was a trip to the Fountain Square area about 30 min. from the Hotel for dinner at the Smokehouse on shelby. The food was very good but allow time if you have reservations for Duck Pin Bowling which is in the same building. This is a don't miss. even people that hate bowling thought this was GREAT!

The intersection is undergoing major construction but we didn't have any trouble given we were there on a weekend. The room is large with a very comfortable king-size bed. I believe they only have king size beds at this smallish hotel. Continental breakfast was provided and there were a few warm items (egg & sausage patties) along with the typical cereal and bagels---(they did run out of pastries however). The bad - our kids really wanted to swim but the \"heated\" pool was too cold for all but the most determined children. I don't think the water was heated. I suspect that the clerks heat the pool room to 85 degrees and then simply assume that the water would also reach that temperature. Of course, it doesn't work that way and the result was a cold pool. Because of the cold pool and the inability/unwillingness of the desk people to make any changes to the pool temperature we would not choose this hotel again.

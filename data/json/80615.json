Check-in staff was not very friendly and gave completely different story about airport shuttle than truth turned out to be in the morning; were told that they had a minivan and even talked to the driver (?) but in the morning it was the blue airport shuttles that serve the whole area, times and names were all mixed up compared to what we had signed up for, AM staff not helpful is solving the shuttle issue; shuttle has $5 charge/person-had understood it to be free, adds up when you're 14 people!! Didn't bother me and I knew the noise would be there, but if you haven't googled the motel location - it is pretty much at the end of the runway so NOT for light sleepers! and the trolley and railway lines run behind the motel as well. Quiet time is from about midnight or 1- 6:30 am? I personally loved watching the planes come in. For a motel that offers an airport shuttle (or do they?), they should have a public access computer to print boarding passes in my opinion. (A question I forgot to ask when booking.) Apparently we could have given the information to the manager and he would have done that. NOT something I'm comfortable with - I want to be there to do my own check in and baggage payments at the same time.

At first we were alarmed by the reviews before coming here, but actually it's much better than expected and I'm really glad we were forced to move. We had a massive, newly refurbished room with a fridge. It was also cheaper than Downtown and had free Wi-Fi too. Granted, it's next to a strip club, railway line and beneath the flight path of the airport (so close you can almost see the passenger's faces) but we weren't bothered. Never saw any trouble from the strip club (it's far away enough next door and you can't see it from your room) and the planes landing was very exciting. I personally loved being so close to an airport and I'm not even a plane spotter! Most flights have landed by around 10.30-11pm, so noise isn't really an issue from the airport. The departures runway is away from the property, so early morning noise didn't really happen for us. You might get train horns sounding if you're unlucky until about 1am, but that's about it. We didn't use public transport and drove to most places. In particular I would recommend a trip to 'Old Town', which is about 5-10 minutes up the road.

I didn't know if I would be warm enough under the sheet and blanket and I didn't want to use the bedspread unless absolutely necessary. I wasn't confident it was totally clean. The pillows were too big for the pillowcases they were stuffed into. One was too thick for me to rest my head onto comfortably, and both were very lumpy. The mattress was uncomfortably hard. I wasn't sure I would be able to sleep on it, never mind the planes frequently flying not far overhead and the trollies honking by. The bathroom was OK, but a hair dryer would have been nice, and the water pressure was not very good.

The airport shuttle worked fine too and it was next door to our rental car place. However, I would stay a bit further from the airport next time and pay for a taxi.", "Date": "April 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, WA", "Title": "\u201cHorrid\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1787175", "Content": "Most awful place I have ever stayed. We were close to everything, especially MCRD, where my son was graduating from boot camp. But the dirty socks, the unchanged sheets, the filthy bathrooms. I do not get it at all. We were there in August 2003, from the other review, it has not changed at all!", "Date": "April 15, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cAvoid at all costs\u201d", "Author": "Exp_Biz_Traveler", "ReviewID": "UR1778006", "Content": "(Stayed early December 2003) What a shame. It is two blocks from light rail, close to the cruise center, and cheap -- all the makings of a perfect place to stay. You really need to avoid this one at all costs. Our non-smoking room smelled like smoke. The bathroom floor was so dirty it turned our socks black. The carpet was so filthy it turned our spare socks brownish-yellow. There were yellow stains on the mattress and what looked and smelled like a pet stain in the corner by the closet. Those are the things under management's control. Not under management's control is the fact the hotel is literally across the street from the landing pad for the airport and backed up against both the light rail and freight train tracks. The airplane noise is deafening at all hours. This hotel won a quality award from their chain a while back, but it certainly doesn't deserve it now. Management was rude and would not even return calls from our travel agent. Luckily, our agent processed the refund independently after almost four months of trying to contact management.", "Date": "April 13, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Motel 6 - San Diego Airport/Harbor", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d80615-Reviews-Motel_6_San_Diego_Airport_Harbor-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$64 - $89*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2353 Pacific Highway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92101</span></span> (Formerly Econo Lodge)</span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "80615", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/53/94/539436e10342bbb094fd85dbd02960211large.jpg"}}

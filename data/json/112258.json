Everything you need is within a 5-10 minute walk or a 5 minute walk to the transportation to get you there. Everyone at the hotel was very friendly and our room was very clean. The room itself (ours was a hotel room) was extremely small. There was just enough room on either side of the bed to walk. One straight chair was provided and this needed to be moved to get into the dresser. We were also on an inside room which meant that our room looked out into a dark abyss surrounded by other walls. When it rained the rain beat on the metal rails which was less than soothing. Of course this cannot be changed by the hotel - just try to request an outside room. We spent 3 nights and were really there only to sleep so this was adequate. Breakfast - cereal, toast, apples, pastry (not worth the calories) and an occasional bagel, coffee and juice - not the greatest for sure. With all that said - I would recommend this location - especially if you get a one bedroom suite as that would have made it a much more comfortable stay.

We stayed, for the first time, at Gaslamp Plaza Suites. Without any prior knowledge of this hotel and relying on reviews of others, I booked it. We love being in the center of Gaslamp when we stay in San Diego especially when we catch a Padres game and eat at the incrediable restaurants. This hotel has alot of history being the first skyscraper in San Diego. http://www.gaslampplaza.com/history.html The original materials have been preserved and rooms were clean and updated while retaining its history. We stayed on the 4th floor in the Emerson room. Our Queen bed was comfortable. Our teenage son used the pullout couch, which was not comfortable at all so he slept on the couch it self without the pullout bed. In the morning starting at 7 am they have coffee and a continental breakfast. The coffee was good but the breakfast was run of the mill, carb filled toast, pastries, and cereal. If you want a great breakfast, go to Brians 24 http://www.yelp.com/biz/brians-24-san-diego around the corner next to the lobby of the Ramada. The service at the hotel was excellent! It is valet parking and runs $28 a day but that is reasonable in San Diego and has in and out priviledges. When we needed our car, we phoned down 15 minutes before and it was there when we arrived! The parking attendants were polite abd responsible. A couple of small negatives- the noise on Saturday night was somewhat loud till 2 am but that is to be expected in the city (windows were all updated and kept noise to a minimum) Sunday night was much better, no mirror in the living area-just the bathroom, and the breakfast needs improving. All in all we liked this hotel and our stay in San Diego and will consider this hotel again.

While the hotel is still charming, and in a great location, it is starting to show its age. The electrical outlets in the room were all loose and made the lights flicker. It seemed very unsafe. Carpets were worn and needed cleaning. Although there were two flat screen TVs - the other furnishings were very worn and old. The TV in the bedroom was very small and far away from the bed. Our particular room had two windows - one had a bullet hole, and both windows were faced with chicken wire. When you opened the windows, if you could, they were loud and made a lot of noise. The units are dark and narrow. There is a minifridge and a microwave. There are dishes, but no counterspace. Wireless internet is available for $20 per week. Parking is still valet and cost $28 per night, but call Central Parking - you can get a great deal and pay the monthly rate for a nearby lot and spend a fraction of what you would at the hotel. There is no pool or workout facitlity, but you can get a pass from the front desk to go to a nearby health club. It will cost $7.50 per day per person. The maids came through each day with fresh towels and to remove trash. There is nowhere for you to throw away your own trash, so if you need it out sooner than the next cleaning, you have to call the front desk. Continental breakfast is on the rooftop every day. It is a nice way to start your day. The food is exactly the same every day, so if you are not ready for cheerios, raisin bran, or plain oatmeal, bring along something for yourself. There is coffee, juice, bread, apples and oranges. A microwave is available. The only change in menu was additional bagels two days a week. The hotel is in a great location, in walking distance to everything - Horton Plaza, restaurants, bars, Seaport Village, the Embarcadero. But, being in the middle of downtown also means lots of sirens, homeless people at every turn and plenty of crowds. There was quite a bit of noise in our room from the street and we were on the 6th floor. All of the staff was helpful and friendly. They did whatever they could to help us have a fun vacation. Definitely go to the orientation on the first day. Merry will have a lot of little tips for you and suggestions for places to go.

In the heart of downtown, and walking distance to shopping, restaurants, Little Italy and more, the Gaslamp Plaza is in a wonderful, central location. The hotel rooftop which is open until 11: 00 pm is a unique feature and a great place to take advantage of the complimentary breakfast, read, relax or simply take in the view. Internet costs $10/day which was reasonable. Valet parking was $28/day, while somewhat pricey, was very convenient and I was able to come and go as I pleased without worrying about street parking. The hotel was offering a discount both times that I stayed there, which made the cost reasonable for me. Without the discount it would not have been in my personal budget but I would definitely consider the hotel worth the full price cost. The noise level is what you would expect from a hotel located in a downtown area - i.e. typical traffic noise but not unordinarily loud.

As for the noise, it is definitely there. From about 9pm to 2 or 3 in the morning there was chatter, shouting, music, a guy with a megaphone saying something about God, sirens and more sirens. And we were ten floors up. On Friday night, my wife and I watched out the window for nearly two hours until finally at about 1 am, we threw on some clothes and went out and mingled for awhile - rowdy students, homeless people and hookers. It was quite entertaining. At about 8 am in the morning, all the streets were cleaned up, immaculate even, and the whole neighborhood was dead quiet. An amazing transformation.

The ensuite is large enough, but needs more towel rails and clothes hooks. The shower has no light so when the curtain is drawn, it's very dark. Plenty of high pressure hot water.

The property is slap bang in the Gaslamp Quarter which is the main entertainment and nightlife centre of Downtown SD. The area comprises a 16 block radius jam packed with shops/restaurants/bars. In this respect be careful what you are looking for from your vacation because this area in general can get a little roudy at night, especially at the weekends. This was fine by me as it affords you great nightlife on your doorstep without even having to dream about driving your car. However, if you are after a more sedate vacation then this hotel and perhaps area of downtown SD aint for you.

It is only 11 stories with 60 guest rooms/suites. It is charming and cozy. The rooms are quite small for a suite, but the fact that the building was once a bank building built in the mid 1900s, makes it so very interesting. Much of the original marble and brass have been preserved. My first thought when I entered the hall was that I was back in a black and white movie going to the office of a local attorney or the import/export company and I would see a secretary typing on an old manual Royal. Each suite is named for a different writer...Margaret Mitchell, Tennyson, Shelley, Keats. It combines old and new as there is a hot and bumping club in the basement. Restaurants abound as do local convenience stores and shops. Horton Plaza is right around the corner...a huge mall with everything at all prices. The valet guys are very accommodating and friendly and chatty; the front desk staff will help with whatever you need. We never saw the housekeeping staff, but their work was evident. My one little complaint...there was no hook on the back of the bathroom door to hang robes and nities. There were two nice flat-screen TVs in the deluxe one bedroom suite, a very comfortable queen size bed, a mini fridge coffeemaker, dinner and silverware and microwave. Because of its location, it can get noisy late at night as that part of town NEVER seems to sleep. So if you are looking for quite and solitude, this is not the place to be. It is convenient to many public bus lines and you can pick up most tours right on Broadway (one block away) and/or at Horton Plaza. A limited complimentary continental breakfast is served daily on the rooftop terrace overlooking downtown San Diego. The guests were friendly. Dakota's Restaurant (access from outside) provides room service when they are open. Wireless internet is in each room, but it's not free (about $10 per day or $20 per week). Paring is expensive too.

They are like very large hotel rooms. 2 members of staff I have to mention. The first is Merry who really made our holiday for us. She is a real gem and has worked there for 16 years - she knows everything. We must have asked her a question everyday but she never lost patience. She also gave us loads of vouchers which saved us about 150 dollars for the 4 of us - we seemed to have a voucher for everything - supplied by Merry of course. The other member of staff was our wonderful cleaner who came in every day and really helped to make my holiday a rest. There is only one thing that would make it better - if it had it's own pool but that is being a bit picky. I looked at the reviews before going and a few were off putting so it was all a great surprise. The valet parking being 28 dollars is a bit of a bone of contention but it is the cheapest way to park as you have unlimited access to your car.After reading the reviews we parked in a public car park next door on the first day but that was 20 dollars for 12 hours which would have meant getting up at 6am on our first day. So use the valet parking is my advice. Another thing we did not realise that our kitchen would be so limited we would have to go out to eat all the time which of course worked out very expensive- so take plenty of money.

I was traveling alone on business, and I opened the closet door to hide half of the glass door, stacked my suitcase next to that, and then piled pillow on top of pillow to prevent anyone from peeking in. Now, I really don't think that anyone could have peeked in, but I was paranoid. Plus there was a window, but again, it had this weird glass and there was nothing but an alley with no light/ceiling whatsoever. The rooftop was incredible. I went up there every morning for the continental breakfast. They also finally, after two nights, moved me up to a larger studio on the 8th floor (albeit I did have to pay more). The staff was very nice. I did wonder about the security, especially since I went to the lower lobby one night to get a soda...and couldn't figure out what/who/what/why the club room doors were for. The whole gaslamp area is beautiful, but it is full of homeless people. They really don't bother you, but again, being alone on business, I was sort of scared. All in all, it is a beautiful hotel, although DO NOT GET A Studio on 204, 304, 504, 404 or 604. Other than that, I'm sure it is great.

We had confirmed this same suite just 2 days prior to be sure it was available. They did offer other alternatives and we did finally decide to stay in a suite at a discounted rate, but only with one bathroom. They also offered a bottle of wine. The hotel is in a great location. Glad we stayed in town. The hotel is historic, so if you are looking for a modern hotel with amenities, this is not the place. It is dated, dark hallways and small rooms, but clean. The street noise level can be an issue with lots of bars around, but fortunately we were on one of the highest floors. The rooftop was a nice place to go sit or have breakfast, but the food was very basic (coffee, juice, 2 dry cereal choices and either donuts or muffins and bagels. No fruit or warm options but just enough. To give you some comparison, we did stay in an Embassy Suites and a Homewood Suites during this same trip in other parts of California. The Gaslamp does not match up to these hotels. I don't think my family would stay here again, but, if you are looking for very basic accomodations in a good location at a price less than the big chains, this might suit your needs. We would likely stay at the Embassy Suites, Hyatt or Omni next time. If you do visit San Diego and you like Italian food, you do have to visit Filippis.

She was always there to give us some money off coupons or directions. The room we had on the 9th floor was wonderful. We had two full bathrooms, two queen size beds and a living area. The room was kept clean and we were not distrubed by noisy maids or knocking on the door early to see if they could come in. The free breakfast on the roof top was fine for a quick start. Everyday they had different bakeries but the cereal and toast sections were the same. It was fine. Just sitting in the morning looking out at the view of the harbor was worth its weight in gold. We had a get together party with cider, cheese, crackers and chips the first day we arrives. It was a nice touch to meet the other guests in the hotel. One night some of us went up to the roof top for our own wine and cheese party with the guests we had meet. Everyone at this hotel is concerned that you have a good time.

We paid $149 for a 9th floor room with a harbor view (Mini-Suite Higher Floor) and were quite happy with our stay. The bed was comfortable, front desk staff helpful, and the building was charming. The included breakfast on the rooftop terrace was a treat, though the breakfast selections are limited (health-food fanatics beware) and the air-conditioner compressors are kind of noisy. Some reviews have mentioned a roof-top hot tub...there isn't one there, now. Two major pluses of this hotel: location and kitchenette. The hotel is one block from major bus lines, two blocks from the trolley, and within an easy walk to many good restaurants. This means you can get to La Jolla, Old Town, the zoo, beaches, the convention center, sports facilities...without renting a car and paying the $20 nightly car park fee. Also, a taxi from the airport is about $11 (without tip). If you come back to the hotel too pooped to drag yourself to a restaurant, you can stop at a nearby convenience store or take-out and sit on the sofa in your pajamas while eating dinner and watching TV. Yes, street noise can be a problem, but (apart from a couple of car horns on the weekend) it didn't disturb our sleep at all. The hotel feels quite safe, but be aware that downtown San Diego has a sizable homeless population--some with mental problems--so this area might feel a bit \"rough\" to some people.

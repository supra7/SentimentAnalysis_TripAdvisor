I called the front desk and spoke to Ulonda and she went right to our room and retrieved my jewelry. Then she hand carried it herself to the mailing center and made sure it was shipped out to me. She then called me to tell me it had been shipped. I received it the very next day and I will be forever grateful to her for her loyal help. She was wonderful.

I must say that the beds here (two doubles) were among the most comfortable I've ever found in a hotel. There is also a sleep sofa in the room, with a divider between the beds and the sleep sofa. For families, the kitchen area would be a great money-saving option instead of eating out all the time. The staff were quite friendly. The beach is a just a short walk away. The location at the north end of Ocean City is perfect if you don't want to be in the midst of all the activity in town. Restaurants, gift shops, candy stores, and minigolfs are all within walking distance. A major problem with this hotel is housekeeping. Our room smelled like rotten fruit and was infested with fruit flies. I thought that after a day or so that the flies would die off. I was wrong, they kept increasing in number. Finally I began searching and eventually I found a totally rotted, never-been-peeled banana under one of the beds (and a capsule of medicine or vitamin under the other, as well as candy wrappers and used tissues). The staff offered to switch our room, but I figured since I'd found the source of the problem, we would just stay put. (I really didn't feel like packing up everything to move to another room. In retrospect, I wish that I had.) On the morning we checked out, there were still a good two dozen fruit flies in the bathroom (significantly down from the original number). There were other issues with housekeeping also. Beds were never made correctly. To my disappointment, fitted bottom sheets are not used by this hotel. Top sheets to the floor on one side and barely covering the top of the bed on the other is just wrong. I had to remake the beds every day. And they never bothered to put the bedspreads back on the beds. We often saw the housekeeping staff watching TV in the rooms where they were supposedly working, sometimes several of them at the same time. There were spots in the hallway that needed to be vacuumed when we got there, these spots were still dirty when we left. We had to go begging for shampoo one day when none was left for us. And we had a housekeeper burst in the room on us once in spite of the \"Do not disturb\" sign. If management would properly train their housekeeping staff, I would be able to give this hotel a much higher rating. Unlike most hotels, there were no feedback forms available in the room. My primary comment would have addressed the problems with housekeeping. The only other negative was the shower. First of all, the shower head is one of the worst I have ever used. Second, the surging between scalding hot water and freezing cold is not only annoying, it could be dangerous. This is something that should be fixed. We did not have opportunity to use the pool or the eat at the restaurant, so I cannot comment on these amenities.", "Date": "October 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Balto", "Title": "\u201cGood Oceanblock Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Baltobchgrl", "ReviewID": "UR19132446", "Content": "A great location to beach and restaurants.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay. The hotel is located just a half block from the beach. It has a nice outdoor pool with a restaurant/bar. My only complaint has to do with the housekeeping. When we arrived in the afternoon, we found that our room had garbage in the trash can and one of the beds did not have any sheets. Two days later, housekeeping failed to come by to clean our room. I notified the front desk of this but, unfortunately, housekeeping departs at 2:30 pm and there was nothing they could do about it. Not a big deal, I took some sheets and pillowcases and made up the room myself.

The sing in the bathroom made you feel like you were in luxury, i have never seen a model like that in a hotel before. We went out to our balcony where belowe us was the pool and the tiki bar, alot of people that evening, i do believe there was a lacrosse team staying the same time we were. It was nice though. The next morning when we got up we ate breakfast in the Rio Grande Cafe on premesis the food was amazing and they give you so much. I had there fruite bowl because of dieting and it was so amazing. the beach is not even 1/2 a block it seemed so much closer and beautiful. the food and drinks at the rio grande tiki bar and cafe were very well priced not expensive at all. the service was amazing and omg how friendly everyone is. I loved our stay at the econo lodge and i reccomend this to any one and everyone for your stay at ocean city. Theres also so much to do right around the hotel mini golf across the street, dippin dots down the street walking distance. Pretzel time ect. its a wonderful place and the Hotel was beyond my expectations. Econo lodge staff thank you so much for making our stay a memorable one. To the head waitress at the cafe we love your service, my dad would go down everymorning during our 3 day stay get coffe and u remembered his order the last time we had breakfast there.

A minature golf place on the other side and two more across the street, in addition to Fishers popcorn and Candy Kitchen. Two blocks from a movie theater and three blocks from Phillips Crabhouse.

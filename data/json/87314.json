The condo is very comfortable for a family of four, well stocked, and owners are very helpful with arrangements and any incidentals. The ocean view is wonderful, the beds are comfy with foam mattress toppers, and the beach is a quick 5 minute walk through the parking lot rather than the path if you have a large cooler. The snorkeling cove is wonderful for sea life and very safe for all ages however climbing in over lava rock can be a bit tricky without water shoes. Take advantage of all the recommendations referred to in other reviews. Highly recommend surfing lessons in Ka'anapali in front of the Marriot. MaiTais at Beach Bums at the Maui Aquarium harbor are delicious. Aquarium is a great place to visit to see sea life, and learn about the area. Can't say enough about the whales! Get out on the water one way or another! The condo has lots of water sports equipment however if you want a better fit for snorkeling, we rented at Boss Frogs next to the Napili Market 3 blocks away from the condo. Napili Market is a good food store if you don't hit Costco when you land. we will definitely stay at C-37 again when vacationing in Napili, Maui.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort McMurray, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFamily time in Maui!!

Note, can only speak to the specific rental room and about the resort in general as the room we rented was via VRBO directly from owner. Unit C37: ideally located in the resort, both close to the pool, small lobby area, and parking. The condo is a second floor unit with large balcony with direct ocean, pool, and garden views. The condo was very well equipped with everything you might need including bino's to watch the whales, and copius amounts of snorkle equipment, sand toys, rock shoes, and boogie boards. I especially enjoyed having the little things like a cooler bag and frosty mugs, nice little vacation touches that were handy but things too big or bulky to pack. Everything was clean, functional, and the owners were excellent to deal with. Our only hiccup was upon arrival the key box was missing, however, a call to the emergency contact number provided by the owners had us in the unit within 10 minutes (the maid had forgot the key box inside the condo). Highly recommend! The resort: well located close to Lahaina (10 min) and walking distance to a beach. Pools and grounds were well maintained, grills worked well and were clean, and as far as I can tell they have 24-hour security on the resort as in a uniformed patrolling security guard. The snorkelling in the small cove that the resort overlooks is world class and multiple close encounters with turtles are guaranteed! Whales were going crazy in late February, and at any given time I could look into the ocean and see whales. The resort is a 5 minute walk (or closer depending on your unit) to The Gazebo Restaurant where they serve the best breakfast around (be prepared to wait in line 15 minutes plus). There is also a popular surf break off the point of this resort and was entertained daily by some very good local surfers on the waves. Only drawback for us as a young family with 2 kids is that there were not many other kids around (a plus for some). We stayed at Napili Shores nextdoor to this resort for the second part of our trip and found there were much more kids running around, which is good if you have kids and want them to make friends and play while you lounge by the pool. Conclusion here is that if you want quiet, choose Napili Point, if you want your kids running around with other kids, choose Napili Shores. Overall another great trip in Maui, and will visit again, and again. Would recommend this resort. Do in Maui: highly recommend the Road to Hana, a Luau, renting a convertible, visiting Front Street in Lahaina, going whale watching, snorkling Molikini, trying a Mai Tai, visiting the blowholes north of Napili, taking a surfing lesson, and visiting Fleming Beach (be careful in the big waves).

The descent past the Office and along the cove with the turtles on one side, views of Lana'i and Moloka'i on another remains magical. Each year we try to reserve for the following year for a month. We know that if any problems arise, Rod or Keith will handle matters immediately. We also come to look forward to the marvelous staff, including Arlene (who should be canonized), Dan, Rolly, Doming, Liza.... There are so many! We know that twenty or so turtles will still be out there along with surfers on a windy day. And we also know that our night's sleep will be absolutely guaranteed, especially when the tide comes in to provide natural \"white noise.\" But this year, something happened. Apparently last May, the Board decided to cancel the Mai-Tai parties. Depending on whom one contacts, the reasons vary from questions of liability, who should fund the events, or why should one or two members fund a social event during which alcohol is served. Irrespective of reasons, these functions serve as a valuable means for guests to mingle with one another. Every Monday, two or three staff members would serve mai-tai's or punch and taro chips from 5 to 6 PM. During this time acquaintances and friendships were made. As this is a resort, it makes sense to provide this kind of social opportunity. To the naysayers who object to serving alcohol, I should add that a majority of guests choose punch or simply abstain altogether. The important thing is for the association and owners alike work for the good of the guests. After all, the other resorts along Napili Bay provide these events for their--why not Napili Point Resort? This is certainly not a deal breaker, but shouldn't NPR live up to its reputation as a unique destination?

We had two 2-BR condos that overlooked the rocky bay. We had a great experience! The condos and property were clean and well-maintained. The condos were well stocked with cooking equipment. Beds were comfortable. The views could not be beat. We would wake up, walk down the 3 minute path to the rocky bay, go snorkeling (there are tons of sea turtles in that bay!), go back to the condo to eat a leisurely breakfast on the lanai (again, watching the turtles popping up in the bay), walk the 5-7 minute path to Napili Bay, spend several hours on the beach, return to the condo for happy hour and dinner on the lanai and then just relax for the evening. Every day. It was amazing. The location is perfect for families and groups because it is so easy to snorkel or go to the beach. You don't have to wait for everyone in the group to be ready, or want to do the same thing, because you can just meet at the beach. There is a Snorkel Bobs within walking distance so it is easy to rent snorkel and paddle board equipment. There is also a market (Napili Market) that is about a mile and a half away. That market is a full supermarket. Kaanapali Beach is about a 15 minute drive. I would definitely recommend renting a car as Napili is a bit removed from everything else (part of what makes it lovely). My only complaint about the condos was that the bathrooms did not have great ventilation (no windows in the shower/toilet room) and toiletries were only replenished once during the week we were there (the condo was cleaned beautifully every day). This is a small detail and, if you have read my other reviews, you know that bathrooms tend to be a point of pickiness for me anyway...

I have continued the tradition by sharing the experience with my husband, on our honeymoon, and taking our two children for family vacations. All of the units provide a beautiful and unique experience to watch the sunsets. The surfers are always out in the ocean to entertain the guests. The snorkeling with the turtles is another plus at Napili Point Resort. Cleo1117 stated that the parking lot was 3 groups of steps away from the lower units. The land is built on a slope so there must be steps to get to the lower units. She stated that the owner had locked cabinets in the kitchen of unit A1. My understanding is that each owner has locked cabinets because they need a place to put their personal belongings when they are away from their condos. The kitchen is fully stocked with kitchen utensils and gadgets to cook any meal, and there are ample kitchen cabinets to store purchased food. How much cupboard space does Cleo1117 need?

With that said, I have to describe how our vacation started at Napili Point Resort. We booked our trip one year in advance, booking five nights to finish out a three week stay on Maui. We were booking for less than one week and we understood that we would not get to choose our condo, but we paid for one of the condos located on the point so that we would get an ocean front condo. We arrived exactly at the check in time and the process was quick. We were directed to Suite A1. Parking near A1 is difficult and it gave us quite a walk with our luggage considering there were three groups of steps to go down and no elevators for any location on the property. We entered the unit with great expectations only to be disappointed. The furnishings were 1970\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, with a Herculon fabric covered sofa popular in the 70's. Half the kitchen cabinets were locked and reserved exclusively for the owner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s use, the cheap chrome towel rack in the bath room was bent to the extent that it needed to be replaced, and some of the hallway wall was sponge painted a dabbled blue to resemble water. The tile did not match throughout the unit due to replacing the part located in the bathroom and leaving the rest with older and a different color tile. The unit is located about 20 feet from the community outdoor shower so small crowds gathered, the side walk was only 4 feet from our patio so there were plenty of people walking very close to where we were trying to relax, and the worst of all\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..this unit was located just above the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smoking hole.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Guests who needed to smoke would light up while still on the property and then move on down to the rocks which technically was off property. We could smell the smoke on our patio and in our unit whenever this happened. The next morning we requested a move to another unit based on the age and condition of the furnishings and the smoking issue. The manager was able to move us to unit C9 an ocean view suite that was reasonably nice with a couple of exceptions. This unit looked directly over the pool. The furnishings were a high grade rattan, comfortable sofa and additional chairs and a beautiful balcony. The kitchen cabinets were of much higher quality than the unit A1. The only problem with this unit was worn and dirty carpet which turned our bare feet black and an abundance of miniature ants in the bathroom and kitchen. We lost some food to the ants before we discovered them. The manager did send some ant bates to us once we reported the ants. The ant bates were useless, but we managed. My husband ask about a refund for the difference in price for the unit since we were not moved to another one on the point. We were told that they would have to upgrade an ocean view guest to the A1 ocean point, therefore no refund would be given. I feel the owner of the unit should have to absorb any loss due to the condition of the condo. There is a drastic difference in the quality of the furnishings and the decorating of Unit A1 and other units at the Resort. This owner clearly needs to make improvements to the unit. Napali Point Resort describes walking to a sand beach implying reasonable accessibility. The walk to the sand beach is a difficult one with signs warning those who venture the trail that accidents can happen. Napili Point wants to advertise the sand beach as close by, but in my opinion does not want to take any responsibility for the safety of its guests. Our maid service was very good. Our housekeeper was very nice and friendly. When she found out we were moving into her unit, she came right away to help us. It was the only help that we had in relocating. There are no luggage carts since every unit has some kind of steps. You are on your own to get your luggage and things to your unit. My 69 year old husband had to carry most everything himself. The sunsets are beautiful from the point and so I will not say that Napili Point Resort is a terrible place to stay, just be advised that not all units are the same and you may get unit A1 or one just like it. Even though you get to choose a unit if you are booking seven days or more, we were told by the manager that that rule didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t apply for guests receiving any type of discount. Looking at their rate list it is apparent that most everyone is getting a discount even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only the buy 4 nights and get 1 night free. We met several guests who return year after year and are happy with the resort; however, I brought one woman guest to our unit A1 to show her it's condition and she said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, this is a very tired one\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

We were very disappointed with Napili Point Resort, so much so that we opted to leave early and move to another hotel (Westin Maui Ocean Villas). First the good. The location was excellent. You are close to a bay containing hundreds of turtles and a 5 min walk from an excellent beach. Now the bad. We stayed in B-36 and it appeared to not have been renovated, painted, walls/furniture cleaned since the early 70's. Grime had built up on the rattan furniture to the point I didn't feel comfortable sitting on them. We travelled with an infant, so on one night my wife went out to get formula from the fridge for him. There was a big crunch. She came running back, said she had stepped on a huge cockroach. I went out and sure enough there it was. Of course, I understand it might be hard to contain pests in a tropical environment but with a baby crawling around the last thing we wanted him to encounter would be cockroaches. We explained this to the gentleman at the front desk and his reply was \"You must have left the front door open\" (we hadn't) and then \"Don't worry about it, we'll set out some traps\". The resort did not look full so we had hoped they would move us to another unit. We decided to give it another try and hope the traps worked. The following day we found a baby cockroach so that was it for us. We figured B-36 has a cockroach family living in it. We decided to switch hotels and managed for the same rate to get a 1 bedroom 2 queen beds at the Westin Maui Ocean Villas for the same rate that we paid for our 2 bedroom condo at Napili Point. Needless to say things were more cramped but now we were in the lap of luxury -jacuzzi bath, kitchen with all utensils, etc. Other issues with our condo were the absolute lack of anything useful, save for one boogy board (which due to the lack of a B-36 stamp I'm assuming was left behind by another visitor). We stayed in Kona the year prior and the condo there had snorkel gear, beach chairs, ice chest, etc. It really seems that the owner of this unit doesn't care about the enjoyment of the people he/she rents to. That is likely why he/she doesn't rent it directly and instead lets the property managers rent it. So my advice, if you decide to stay here, is to rent through an owner directly via VRBO or something similar.

On another note, please be aware that the turtle cove and sandy beach are not available for people who are not very agile. To access the beach you must traverse slippery rocks with no clear path and the cove is only accessed by using the very rocky shoreline to climb in and out with strong currents trashing you about.

The kitchen was fully equipped with all of the utensils, silver, and flatware you could need. The view was incredible, whether the sea was calm or when the waves were breaking as they did on our last day in paradise. Watching the surfers was better than anything on television (although there were two of them in our unit we probably never watched more than about five minutes' worth the whole time we were there; just too many other great things to do when you are in Maui). The cove is a moment's walk from the condos and easily accessed for some terrific snorkeling with the sea turtles and colorful fish. Napili Beach is less than five minutes away and an easy stroll along a semi-paved path behind the next resort --- nice waves for mild body surfing, snorkeling, and more sea turtles to look at. Easy drive to Kahana (grocery & casual dining), Ka'anapali (shopping & more upscale dining), and Lahaina (pretty much anything you want to buy or eat). In all, convenient to get almost anywhere from the resort. The cost was certainly reasonable, and Napili Point offers many discount offers. If there is anything negative, it would be that the interior of the ground level (A) units are in plain view of everyone who passes by (and there are a lot of people passing by). That said, we met many nice people as they strolled past and said hello. Remember to pull the curtains for privacy. The folks that we encountered were all very pleasant and obviously happy to be there. Arlene took care of our room daily, and could not be more pleasant. She was always ready to answer any questions that we had and is a wonderful representative. There was a wide variety of folks staying at the resort from newlyweds, young and established families, middle aged and mature couples. Make time one morning to walk over to the Gazebo at Napili Shores next door. The wait is long for a slightly above avaregae breakfast, but the view and overall experience are worth the time.

The combination of the downstairs 2bd/2bth B37 (access/no stairs for the in-laws) and the upstairs C37 for my wife, 9 and 12 yr old daughters and myself was absolutely perfect. Realistically, we could have all stayed in either condo as they are both spacious but the additional privacy was great. Credit Patty, the C37 owner, for helping us identify the downstairs condo as well as suggesting we book an additional day to give us a place to relax/change before our 10pm flight back. The C37 unit was immaculate, beautifully decorated and over the top equipped. We wanted a condo so we could eat bkfst/lunch in and Patty has everything you could possilby want, including condiments/spices, dish/cookware, piles of towels. Lots of beach toys/chairs/coolers. Every time we needed something, there it was. Both condos had AC, which was a deal breaker going in, and we never used it as the units set up perfect to catch afternoon breezes. We ran the in-unit washer/dryer every day for swimsuits/towels so ended up not needing much of the clothing we brought (Patty even provides the soap/dryer sheets). Resort is on right on the cove which provided snorkelling with sea turtles (more than I can count), most of the fish we saw at the Maui Ocean Center and darn scary looking eels. We could see the turtles from our balcony throughout the day. Tide pools on the north tip of the property provided great morning exploration and a short but rocky (too much for my cane toting M-I-L) path lead to Napili Beach which was beautiful and great for the girls to play. Between actitivies and amenities, we could have spent the entire week in Napili and been very happy. Did our shopping at Napili Market just up the road (loved Maui Taco's fish tacos in same plaza; snorkel equipment rental at Snorkel Bobs) which had everything we needed. The Sea House and Gazebo restaurants on Napili Beach were both excellent. Overall, we all agreed it was one of the most relaxing enjoyable vacations we'd had. The condo played a large part as didn't need to organize ourselves to get out for breakfast, could pack/take lunch with us and everything was so close that it was just a quick jaunt back for forgotten items or a quick shower/nap before dinner.

The proximity to the rocky cove for snorkeling is perfect and you're guaranteed to see turtles snorkeling there (although it's not for ocean novices as the entry is a bit challenging but pretty easy if you've snorkeled before.) The tiled pool is also nice and right on the ocean for the great views again (the pool was very chlorinated and yet still needed some minor tile repair and cleaning.). We rented 2 units and we would definitely recommend one of them - C11 a two bedroom. It was nicely appointed in an Island style. For those unfamiliar with Napili, this is a more laid back side of Maui so if you want \"resort\" style this may not be for you. Some suggestions and concerns: The biggest issue we had was with the other 1 bedroom (B16). It was not as updated and had serious problems with the refrigerator (which the manager tried to blame on us despite our explanation that we hadn't touched it and if it was so touchy why not give us instructions.) We lost a lot of groceries and had no use of that refrigerator for 36 hours. This was not compensated but should have been. In general be aware that these units don't have air conditioning. We probably would have been a bit more comfortable on some hot September days but that's a personal choice. The walk to the beach is not as quick as I expected given the other reviews here. It's a bit of a trek of about 10 minutes and you have to figure it out on your own at first. Luckily there are many friendly neighbors to help. It can be a bit laborious with kids, probably not an issue for just a couple. Again this is not really a resort. It's a set of personally owned, apartment-styled condominiums. If that's what you're looking for then Napili Point is a good option. If you want a resort style locale, Napili Kai may be a better choice (although may be pricier) or head to Kaanapali or Wailea.

We were looking to try a new area on Maui, having always stayed south of Napili on previous trips, and were intrigued by the Napili area. This thoughtfully appointed condo has everything you need: a beautiful location, with a wonderful view of Honokeana cove, the ocean, and Lanai and Molokaii. The cove itself is remarkable, with at least twelve turtles as residents, easily viewed from the wrap- around lanai, where we spent time every morning and evening. Snorkeling with the turtles was amazing; each seemed to have its own \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the reef, and we visited them daily. The condo itself was perfect for our extended family of three adults and two \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tween\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd cousins, with a large master bedroom/bathroom suite and a second bedroom and bathroom. Patty has obviously put a lot of work and thought into this condo: thoughtful touches are everywhere, e.g. numerous hooks in the master bathroom for hanging up wet bathing suits; a pair of binoculars, two binders full of DVDs, for kids and adults, as well as three drawers full of travel books and paperback novels of all sorts. The second bedroom had lots of snorkeling equipment, sand toys, and boogie boards, which was perfect for the kids. The kitchen and pantry were especially welcome, stocked with all manner of dishes, glassware, cooking tools, etc, and well as a spice cabinet, oil and vinegar, and lots of other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ingredients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 you might need, saving you from buying something for just one meal. The living area was very accommodating, with plenty of seating, including a comfortable sofa, which converted into a comfortable double/?queen bed, which was used by one of the kids. The condo is a corner unit, with sliding glass doors and windows on both corner walls, so the lighting was beautiful and bright, but could be closed off at night with heavy, rich dark drapes. And beautiful Napili Bay itself is right next door to this complex. We spent many hours there, snorkeling, boogie boarding, and we even rented stand-up paddle boards from Snorkel Bob's at Napili Bay, all within easy walking distance to the condo.

The second bedroom is also a nice size with 2 twin sized beds, which can be moved together to make a king, if desired. The closet in this bedroom is the fun one! It has snorkeling equipment, boogie boards, and lots of fun things, which saves the time and expense of going to the beach shop to rent these things. The kitchen is probably, no it IS, better equipped than my kitchen here at home. Every gadget imaginable, lots of pots and pans, dishes, glasses, spices, teas.

For those of you who need more entertainment there are plenty of VHS tapes and DVD's to be viewed on the large screen TV. CD's to enhance the mood and Internet service is free for those of you who just can't leave it behind. If you still have doubts about being in Paradise, step out onto the lanai that wraps around the unit. The view of Lanai and Molakai across the waters of the Pacific is exceptional. If you happen to be there during whale season, you will be able to see them cavorting in the near waters. But the absolute best, as far as I'm concerned, is the cove just off to the left side of the property. Every morning and evening lots and lots of huge sea turtles come into the cove to feed.

As each room is different and owned by individual owners, there will be differences in the rooms, however, I can say that B37 was in my opinion one of the best spots, being close to the pools, snorkling, and parking. The room itself was recently renovated, clean, open, spacious, and of course ideally situated in the resort. It was stocked with everything we needed, and the welcome basket with local chocolates, chips, and candy was a nice touch! As for the resort, wow, what a spot. Literally steps to world-class snorkling among the Hawaiian Green Turtles, and a local surfing hot spot. Having gone in the off season, it seemed like we had the place to ourselves, most times being the only ones snorkling, the only ones in the pool, or, the only ones at the barbeques. There were even full-time security guards roaming the grounds. Location: literally steps from snorkling, surfing, and prime turtle watching (whales too). About a 5-minute walk (scenic) to the beach. 5 minute walk to the Gazebo restaurant for amazing pancakes or omelettes in the morning. Easy to find, about 10 minutes from the Lahaina Cannery Mall. Lots of parking, easy to find, and quiet. Grounds: immaculately maintained, pools were vacuumed every morning, grounds were well groomed and kept. Clean throughout. Desk staff: did not have much dealings with them, but all seemed to be well, there seemed to always be someone there. By my estimation all units would have a pretty decent if not great ocean view. There are many resorts in the area, all seem to be nice, however, we certainly had no complaints with this one, and would certainly return. To do while in Maui: 1) Rent a convertible. We had one for our 10 days and didnt regret it for a second! 2) Go see the blowholes! 3) Do the road to Hana, while there, dont forget the blacksands beach (there is a trail to the left as you face the ocean which brings you down to some pools which you can jump into and swim under the rocks). Also, past Hana are the 7 Sacred Pools, this is a must do! Climb up behind the 2nd waterfall from the top, and take a jump off the top down into the cool pools below! 4) Eat at BubbaGump's Shrimp! 5) Check out the Aquarium! 6) Go snorkle at Molikini (we used Four Winds charters and had a great time). 7) Drink a local-made Mai Tai! 8) Walk the strip on front street in Lahaina!

You can walk next door and go through the public accsess to reach it. A very nice beach! The Gazebo restaurant is on the property next door. You will wait for seating. Food is okay, don't really know what all the hoopla is about. Nice food, nice staff but not super stupendous.

However, it's our opinion that because the location is so amazing, others have been inclined to be less critical of the actual accommodations. Since for us there is nothing more frustrating than planning a wonderful vacation and then being very disappointed with where you're staying, especially for 10 days in the same place, we will provide as much specific detail regarding our unit as possible. The best advice we can give is to plan way in advance, 6-12 months at least, and do a lot of research on the individual units. All units are privately owned and vary DRASTICALLY in upgrades, ammenities and cleanliness. Some units can only be rented through the actual owner and others through the main office. I asked at the front desk during our stay what units have recently been upgraded and the only information they were willing to provide was to ask for a recently upgraded unit when you make your reservation and they will \"do the best we can to accomodate your request when you arrive\". The front desk also discouraged against renting directly through an individual owner because according to them, \"you will have no representation on the island if you have issues with the unit\", since the front desk does not support those units. They also stated that they have minimum requirements of the units they rent and home owners who rent on their own \"usually don't meet those minimum requirements\". Well, we asked for a recently upgraded unit when we made our reservations and were still not completely happy with the unit we were given, unit #C12. We even looked at 2 other available units when we arrived and they were not nearly as nice/upgraded as #C12. We looked at unit #C26 and #C7. Both were not appealing at all due to the lack of upgrades. Although #C7 is an ocean point view with a simply incredible, unobstructed ocean view that goes on forever. #C12 is an upstairs unit with one bedroom and a loft. The downstairs bedroom has a queen bed and the upstairs loft a king bed. Both beds were not very comfortable, especially the upstairs king which was hard as a rock. This unit is next to the pool and the balcony overlooks the pool area. This was one of the reasons we originally looked at other units when we arrived. It ended up not being a major issue since there never really were a lot of people at the pool and we were gone most of the time during the day. At night there never was anyone at the pool and we left all our windows open all day and night without being bothered by noise. The kitchen is pretty large compared to the other two units we looked at and the counters had been upgraded to granite and fairly new cabinets, along with the counters and cabinets in both bathrooms. The living room and dining area furniture also looked liked they had been upgraded not long ago. Other than that, the rest of the unit was outdated, old and not very clean. The day we arrived we made lunch at the unit and wiped down the kitchen counter with a damp paper towel and the towel was black from dust and dirt. We understand that this is a tropical area and the windows are typically kept open all day, but we would expect that on our first day of arrival the unit would have been thoroughly cleaned prior. We also found the same to be true of both the bathroom counters. Neither of the bathrooms were very clean, including dirty fingerprint smudges all over the upstairs bathroom wall, grime on the toilet seat lid and mold in the showers to the point that we stood on a hand towel while showering, so our feet wouldn't touch the actual grout/mold. The upstairs toilet was loose and wobbled when used and the tile around the toilet was broken/missing a piece. The more we looked around the unit during our stay, the more we noticed just how old and unclean the unit actually was. The housekeeping staff was very nice, especially Ilene who typically cleans this unit, but when they clean they do a very quick job and not very thorough. The front desk staff who were working the day we arrived, were also nice and allowed us to look at the other two available units to compare. The cove that these units border, is the best place to snorkel of all the places we tried during our stay, but as others mention it is very difficult to get in and out of. All in all, we would definitely stay here again because of the location, but will take our own advice next time and really do our research on what unit we stay in.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape May, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201calmost perfect\u201d", "Author": "George812", "ReviewID": "UR75000755", "Content": "We are grateful to those who wrote reviews for this resort and once again we made an excellent choice in staying in this resort.

This resort is fabulous for those wanting a private, quiet vacation in a beautiful, oceanfront setting. We spent a week on Maui, travelling the island extensively: Wailea, Kihei, Lehaina, Kaanapali, Kapalua, as well as taking the gorgeous drive to Hana. After viewing the Ritz Carlton and the Four Seasons and the various resorts in Kaanapali, we didn't see any as appealing as the Napili Point Resort. The resort itself is very attractive and well kept and because it on a rocky point, and not a beach, it is quiet, which for us was a big plus. The main attraction, though, is the location -- right on the water. None of the big-name resorts offer this. If you have teenagers who want action, Kaanapali may be your best bet, but Kaanapali and Wailea, for our tastes, were too commercial -- highly manicured and overly developed. An added bonus was that Maui was fairly quiet and prices are discounted. The only line up all week was at the Gazebo restaurant on the property next door and at the Sansei Restaurant in Kapalua. Otherwise, very easy to get around and do things. We stayed in Unit B1, with an ocean front view. Excellent view and nice accommodation. The bed, however, was very soft and should be replaced soon!

The location can't be beat - the units all look out over Honokeana Cove and the ocean beyond and as advertised, is around the point from the Napili Bay beach. The snorkeling off the point in the cove offers easy access and lot of fish and turtles. The clarity isn't quite as clear as what we found off Lanai (we took one of the snorkle boat trips as well) but the variety of fish and convenience of snorkeling right in front of your condo was terrific and the water was still quite clear. Many sea turtles to see regularly - we were told they show up primarily in the mornings and late afternoons but we saw them out there any time of day. The unit we stayed in (C-21) was in their ocean front category. We looked at a couple of different units and found that they do vary. This one had an upgraded kitchen and comfortable furnishings. Not luxury but tasteful and completely adequate. The manager was agreeable to our looking at a couple of available units before we decided which we wanted - I recommend doing this if the unit you are given isn't what you expected. The first unit we were assigned to was in the lower price point category (ocean view), had dated and well-worn furnishings and was in the building closest to the road and noisier than we liked so the upgrade was well worth it. Other units in that building may have had nicer furnishings though and they do offer air conditioning in the bedrooms of that wing to compensate for the road noise if you don't want your windows open. The rest of the complex has ceiling fans and lots of window options which were more than enough to keep the place cool. The pools were clean and convenient. Daily maid service was a treat. BBQ's were appreciated for the times when we wanted to eat in (and the local market at the Napili Plaza had an excellent selection of whatever you might want). We weren't around to take advantage of their weekly mai tai gathering or the pineapple cutting demo but it's nice that they offer these. The breakfast next door at the Gazebo restaurant is worth making time for - and you will need to wait since it's a small place but go in a relaxed state of mind and you'll be set for hours. The portions are huge and it's all so good that we didn't need to have lunch at all that day!

We weren't disappointed!! Our unit was gorgeous, with a beautifully renovated kitchen (nice cupboards, granite counters, dishwasher), and was fully equipped with everything we needed. In fact, we cooked all but one of our meals in. There was a nice large flat screen tv in the living room, and one in the bedroom, too. The bathroom was large, had a really nice vanity (two sinks, a luxury for us!) and granite counters, as well as a nice ceramic tile walk in shower. The entire unit was very tastefully decorated, including gorgeous water color paintings by the owner. We loved sitting out on our private & roomy lanai watching the whales spouting, and also loved snorkeling in the bay with the sea turtles. That was a real highlight of our trip! It was really tricky getting into the water from the slippery rocks, and even harder getting out of the water! I had a scary moment trying to get out, and kept getting knocked against the rocks by the waves (I've got a mean looking bruise to prove it!). The only negative to the unit we were staying in is that the bedroom is right on a fairly busy road, and the traffic would wake us up before 5:30 each morning (including loud delivery trucks). we tried shutting the bedroom window and having the a/c on, which helped block out some, but not all of the noise. There are three buildings comprising Napili Point Resort, and ours was the only one right on the road. So, if you are not a really sound sleeper, this may be an issue. We really want to stay here next year, but will try & get a unit in another building (too bad, because we just loved everything else about B39). We asked the front desk if we could see another unit, so we could compare what others looked like, so we can get a better idea of what to book next year. Not sure of the unit #, I think it was B29. We really didn't like this one. The kitchen cupboards looked really cheap, the decor dated, and the carpet (we had nice new ceramic tile thru out in our unit) was musty smelling.

You can't beat the view and I believe that this is why they get booked-but if you can't sleep what's the point. You are too tired to do anything. We plan , in advance, when we come here-so once again, their complete indifference as to where they put you is unbelieveable. I suggest that they put families together- not around couples who want to relax. Just poor front desk etiquette-AND indifference. If you complain-YOU HAVE TO MOVE and the change is to a much inferior unit. No wonder Hawaiian travel is down -the aloha spirit does not exist here! I watched an older couple check in and ask if they could see the ocean-the wife could not walk very well. The next day, the husband had to move because they could not sleep in the unit-one of many things wrong with it-and they could not see the ocean very well. Since you are so close to the ocean-you get lots of surfer traffic and the parking lot is monitored but you get surfers taking the parking spots anyway, I hope this resort gets exactly what they want-no visitors-because that is exactly the feeling that you get.", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spring Grove, IL", "Title": "\u201cWonderdul Resort\u201d", "Author": "JS2323", "ReviewID": "UR50385723", "Content": "Our family just returned from a week stay at Napili Point and couldn't be more happy with our visit.

We have decided for Napili Point Resort for Maui. And, that was one of our best vacation decisions.

The service people have been not only friendly but committed to make you happy. It is not a 4 or 5 star hotel service, but coming from the heart. The garden and pools are well maintained (7 days a week). And the appartment? Well, that depends on which you pick.

We have not met any who had not been satisfied by the cleanliness or condition of the furniture or installations.

Very clean, very comfortable for 4 adults. The people were friendly, most kept to themselves. It felt private and was soooo relaxing! Let's start with the important stuff. Location and views. Napili point is about 45 minutes from the airport, although this can be a slow drive during rush hours as much of it is single lane. There is plenty of parking. The units are labeled A, B, C. This is a C unit that has two bedrooms on the same level which we liked. Most C units here have a loft as the second bedroom. C-37 is also located at the end of the building so it enjoys more windows and cross ventilation--very important. This unit is elevated and has a wonderful ocean view from the living room and especially from the large wraparound balcony. We saw two full rainbows from the deck.The cove where sea turtles surface and eat is maybe 50 yards away as you look across one of the pools. The location is quiet although the bedrooms in the back are located about 50 feet from a small road. This cove, called Honokeana Cove, has very, very good snorkeling. It is almost entirely protected from the surf and is often glassy smooth. Many sea turtles any time of day from smaller to 4 foot giants. Lots of colorful coral too but not a ton of fish. Water visibility was fair to good while the water temp in June was about 80 degrees or so. Also there is great snorkeling a few minutes up the coast at numerous sites including Slaughterhouse Bay. There is also a nice sand beach about a 5 minute walk north if you want to sun bathe and do a bit of splashing. Very nice for children as the waves aren't too big. Also at the the next door property is the \"famous\" Gazebo restaurant. Nice views, good food, big breakfast portions (easily shared), but expect a 20 minute wait at almost any time, except near closing. Decor/Amenities They have nice furniture that is functional and comfortable. The king sized bed in the master was very comfortable. They normally have two twins in the second bedroom but they pushed them together with nice pad to make a king for my brother and his wife. Small flat screen TVs in LR and in both bedrooms. Several bar stools at the kitchen counter. In the living room is a larger round dining table that could seat 6 easily. There is one basic chaise lounge on the large deck and a nice patio table set with seating for four. There are some nice pictures on the walls and other Hawaiian objects here and there. There are two bathrooms which are basic and fairly small with a shower over the tub. The master bedroom has a separate vanity sink area while the hall bath has the vanity in the room with the toilet and shower. C-37 is very clean with lots and lots of supplies and a kitchen that is better equipped than my home. Leave your beach towels at home. Before you buy any supplies, check out the spices, pots, pans, silverware, toaster, blender, bottle openers, glasses, etc. in the condo. You will also find lots of different teas, sugars, coffees, filters, etc. Good size locking safe in master bedroom. Internet is $10/day with a break for a full week. Wired and very fast. Air conditioner in second bedroom which we never used. The tradewinds of 10 to 20 mph were blowing all the time after 12 noon or so. The unit was very comfortable with the windows open. Nice quiet fans in every room kept the air moving too. I did not use the pools but my wife said they were pleasant. Only one umbrella so bring your sunscreen. We barbecued at one of the many gas grills and they worked well and were clean. There are picnic tables so enjoy your meal oceanside. Tips: Do yourself a favor and shop at the local market in the shopping center about 5 minutes away. You can walk there but the road is very tight with no sidewalk, kinda tricky. (C-37 has an insulated wheeled shopping cart and nice canvas bags to carry groceries.) Very decent prices, nice selection of deli stuff and great meats. Prices there compare well to Safeway which is 20 minutes away. Rum was actually less! Another tip. Buy your roasted chicken at this market rather than at the chicken and ribs place next door--about 1/3rd the price! There are more turtles in this cove than you will see on the snorkeling cruises. Save your money unless you must snorkel Molokini. Bring some good open shoes like Teva's for walking to your snorkeling in the cove. The lava can be tricky and flip flops can be problematic. There are a few smooth easy places to get in and out depending on the tide. If you want really easy access to the cove walk to the next property south and they have a cement ramp with a bar that you can hold onto while adjusting your mask or putting on your fins. Also, wear a dark T shirt while you are snorkeling. It prevents sunburn on your back, shoulders and keeps you a tad warmer. I use one that is synthetic as it dries faster. Buy some spray sunburn protection and be sure to apply to the top of your head. Why? When you lie in the water, a large round spot on your head will not have any hair covering it. It will get fried after 20 minutes in this tropical sun.", "Date": "July 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lahaina Maui", "Title": "\u201cSnorkling with the turtles\u201d", "Author": "KauKauLauLau", "ReviewID": "UR33613303", "Content": "We have never stayed in a condo before, so were very pleased to find that the unit we stayed in, C-11, a two-bedroom with a loft, was not only clean and well-maintained but had even more comforts than our own home.

Each morning we would wake up and rush to the lanai to count the turtles in the cove below. With the coffee pot brewing (Maui coffee of course) and waffles in the toaster, the kids would help us plan our Maui day (which most often started with a snorkle right outside in the cove. Hint, that's free!) While we were out, the housekeeper tidied up and when we got back, we were able to wash all our beachwear in the big washer and dryer. (We had been advised not to bring beach towels since the resort provided them, and they did.) Parking is free in the lot outside.

It was recently remodeled with a nice kitchen, everything we needed for cooking was provided. There is no air conditioning, but we did not need it as there is a wonderful breeze that blows through the unit and keeps it quite comfortable without the noise of an air conditioner. What we loved: The location was wonderful, with a beautiful view of the ocean. The unit is located right next to one of the pools, which made it nice as I could watch the kids swim while I made dinner. The patio of the unit is surrounded by a hedge, which makes it much more private than most of the other units in the complex, so we could eat dinner without people looking at us while they walked by. It was extremely quiet and peaceful, very relaxing. The unit is clean and well cared for. There are several b-b-q grills that overlook the ocean, which made cooking dinner enjoyable. The snorkeling in the bay was fantastic, without a doubt the best snorkeling on the island. In the afternoon when the wind pick up on the rest of the island, the cove is still very calm and we were able to snorkel until sundown. This complex has a very reasonable rental rate, which includes a compact car. We found it to be a great value. We liked the fact that is was a quiet complex, there was no crowding at the pool, often we were the only people there, (no throwing towels on lounge chairs at 5 AM like at the Marriott). What we did not love: The bed. It had a pretty big mountain in the middle, and it needs to be replaced. Also, it had a waterproof mattress cover on it, which felt like we were sleeping on plastic. I would really recommend that the owners replace the bed and get rid of the waterproof cover, it is crinkly and uncomfortable. Overall impression: Nice, quiet complex. If you have the type of family that likes to relax and does not need constant entertainment from an activities coordinator, this is a great place to stay. If you are looking for a water park with slides, a pool side bar and an attendant to bring you drinks with little umbrellas, this is probably not the place for you.

Every day, twice a day we would walk down to the water and snorkel with more than a dozen sea turtles and many colorful fish. It was like a private aquarium. After spending days on Kauai looking for the perfect snorkeling off shore, this was fabulous to just walk out of the condo and down the steps. If the agent just said there were sea turtles there in the first place, we would have booked instantly. We will go back and tell all our friends to go there...such a reasonable price and beautiful sunset views!", "Date": "August 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara", "Title": "\u201cExtraordinary!\u201d", "Author": "SantaBarbaraTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR18395435", "Content": "My family and I just returned from our vacation in Maui, and our stay at the Napili Point Resort was extraordinaryl!

The unit is very tastefully decorated, felt just like a home, had a fully stocked kitchen and very comfortable furniture.

One of my favorite things about the location was the beach which is a 5 minute walk, the Gazebo Restaurant( which is so worth the wait) and the snorkeling and swimming with the turtles in the cove.

We booked one of the A-units directly through the owner afterreading several offers on line. Since we booked over a year in advance, we had no problems getting the unit we wanted. In fact our unit was guaranteed. There are three categories of A-units: point ocean front (A 1-12); ocean front (A 13-19) and ocean view (A 21-27). The point ocean front units are the most expensive, with view of both Moloka'i and Lana'i, while ocean view units have the lower pool in front of the turtle cove and glimpses of the two islands. The ocean front units, like the one we stayed in, overlook Lana'i and the turtle cove. With only nine feet from the grassy knoll, these units are ideal for lounging, gazing at the windsurfers/surfers and the turtles. If there is any drawback to these units, it's that many people choose to linger in awe of the turtles while standing directly in front of the lanai. There are other units, to be sure. In fact, there are 120 units altogether. B units and C units are located by the upper level but a ways back from the A level unitls. (Photos give the erroneous impression that there are three levels--there are only two). The C-level units are two-bedroom units and are fine for families or two couples. The loft-level bedroom has no door to ensure privacy. Access to these room are from the parking lot only. One must take a connecting path to the pools and beach walk. What I find amazing about the A units is that one cannot hear conversations from inside the neighboring units. Unless a nearby units is chatting outside, these units are usually quiet. Be advised that strollers like to talk and this sound reverberates into the A units. At night, this isn't much of a problem. Outdoor gas grills are spaced apart on the grounds to allow grilling. On Monday afternoons, the management hosts a mai-tai party for everyone. Maids will drop a note to remind guests! Also in the reminder slip is a note that resident Nani likes to \"talk story\" while showing guests Hawaiian vegetation and also to learn the proper way to choose and cut a pineapple. Check the in-unit reminders for times and location. Why am I giving this property four circles instead of five? Many of the units cater to massive turnover and the units do show wear and tear, although with limited maid service, these are usually clean. Other units are reguarly maintained with their owners constantly updating and replacing fixtures and furnishings. These are ideal units and while small (A units are 600 square feet) they are supremely comfortable. There have been so many fine reports about nearby restaurants that to repeat them would be redundant. The newly renovated Ritz Carlton (Kapalua) has a magnificent $27 breakfast buffet \"plus.\" I say \"plus\" because the servers will serve oatmeal, fresh mahi-mahi (yes, at breakfast!), and even bowls of fresh berries. I find the quality very high and certainly justifies the high price tag. Besides, this will eliminate the need to go out and splurge later! The Sea House restaurant, in addition to serving what I consider a first-class breakfast, offers a special slack key guitar program on Wednesday evenings. Expensive at $45, it nevertheless presents authentic island music and often features the Ukulele Boyz, an island treasure. (What used to be Fish & Poi at the Island Surf is undergoing a name change; the management has already changed.) A stay at this resort is uncommonly satisfying. I am confident most will find this medium -end lodging worth the money.", "Date": "March 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Cruz, California", "Title": "\u201cWe'll be back!\u201d", "Author": "norcal777", "ReviewID": "UR14011477", "Content": "We stayed in unit C3 which is a 2 bedroom point oceanfront category. Awesome view but I was disappointed in the unit itself. We have stayed in a 2 bedroom oceanfront (C12) and the square footage was greater. When we return we will stay in the oceanfront category. Each unit is individually owned so some have better amenities then others. There were a few things that needed improvement, where the carpet met the tile the carpet tacks were sticking out and actually stuck my friends foot. The blinds in the upstairs vanity are approx 2 feet too narrow. The fridge took a long time to cool off but we put tons of warm sodas and beer in it so that was part of it but the filter for water didn't work either. We don't watch TV on vacation much but there was no TV in the upstairs loft. The bed was VERY firm and was great for me but may not be for others=). The shower in the downstairs bathroom was either firehose or dripping out. Now for the positives...the view was AMAZING! From this unit there was nothing blocking our view of the whales breaching (Nov-Apr). This unit is very close to the walk way that leads to The Gazebo for breakfast (get in line by 7am and they open at 7:30). There was never any wait for the BBQ's and they had gas and coal ones. The turtles are great of course in the cove in front of the condo. Our favorite beach in Maui is the Napili Bay and it's a very short walk approx 150 yards from the door of our condo. On Monday nights they do a maitai party at the pool which is fun. We went whale watching on Captain Steves and it was phenomenal! (6yrs and up) It is a hard bottom zodiac type boat. It was so great I went again while I was there=) and it's only $39 per person. Our friends stayed in unit B28 a 1 bedroom ocean front category which was awesome because the kitchen and tiles in the bathroom at recently been renovated. You could walk right onto the lawn from the lanai which was nice and since it was a end unit no one walked in front of the lawn so it was like an extension of the patio/lanai.

We prefer renting a condo in Napili (vs a high-rise resort elsewhere) because: ** Space to spread out for everyone ** Dining Area with full kitchen/fridge for bfast &/or lunch ** Laundry facilities for small jobs in middle of stay ** Separate TV and sleeping areas to accomodate people ** Can get multiple bedrooms in one unit for families ** Napili condos are lower-rise buildings = lower people density, better views, generally more sq footage, quieter & more relaxing Re: Napili Point We stayed for 2 weeks in #C-13, a 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit on the top (C) level of the complex. Upstairs bedroom was a loft style area with king bed, & bathroom with shower only. Downstairs bedroom has 2 twin beds & bathroom with full tub & shower. Living area has table 4 chairs, sofa, side chairs. Lanai has small table & chairs, lounge chair & side table. Full kitchen/fridge w/ micro, blender, dishwasher, coffee maker, toaster, etc. 3 full sized closets; pool noodles, in room safe, foam ice chest, and small up/down closet washer/dryer (dryer vents into room... not a problem for us as we did small loads and dried at pm.) Gorgeous ocean views from our condo include the cove just south of Napili with swimming sea turtles, rocky coastline with breaking ocean waves & surf towards Kahana (we've watched surfers & whales & sea turtles on the surface) and the view from the sofa is rather southwestern out to sea and includes the islands offshore. We look through 2 tall swaying palm trees at the ocean below & beyond - just lovely! Outdoor facilites here are well-maintained, pretty pool on B level, mature landscaping, easy parking just outside the entrance to the room (always spaces in lot.) The snorkeling in the cove adjacent (south) to the resort is rewarding when sea conditions are calm - the cove is full of tropical fish & sea urchins of several colors, we saw a large black octopus on the sea floor, many huge sea turtles swam with us throughout the cove, and several small schools of fish resting in the sandy bottom between the coral outcroppings. The rocky area leading into the water could be tricky for young children to navigate - I'd suggest that kids under 10 or so go to the sandy beach just north of the complex and snorkel/play there under adult supervision, as conditions are much safer. There's street parking and a public access area to that beach, including a fresh water faucet to wash the sand from your toes as you depart. We rented snorkel gear from Maui Dive Shop in Kahana Ctr by the week - they even had rental Rx masks for those with glasses; and they were as aloha-friendly as ever! Re interior of #C-13: appliances were ok - newer fridge, older stove/vent/dishwasher, partially working toaster was cheerfully replaced. Air flow was great and high temps were in low 80s; the 2 bedroom units have windows on 2 sides for ventilation and ours had 3 ceiling fans sprinkled throughout. The kitchen could use a re-do as it's tired and the cabinet opening areas are greasy from many years of hands using them; the large bath/tub combo needs to be replaced as the grout is worn, stained & gaping where it meets the tub, with several large caulk patches also gaping; the plastic tub has surface scuffs/crazing; the upstairs shower floor tiles could use a scrubbing with degreaser/soap scum remover; and the ceiling fans need to have their blades thoroughly cleaned (black dirt on edges). The carpets are newer and clean, hard floors are ceramic tiles, wiped clean daily by maids. The upstairs king mattress is old and hard - we bought a 4\" foam/poly mattress pad at Costco and new pillows (the ones in the condo are dreadful) - and we slept in comfortable luxury! The resort staff are aloha-friendly and helpful; maid service was delightfully performed each morning. We bought internet access for our room (equipment already in place including connection cables - we plugged in the laptop and voila! connected!) For food = bfast at Gazebo next door & in room (Napili market 3 blocks away; large Safeway in Lahaina); take-away lunches from Mamas Ribs & Napili Smoothie (they have good grilled panini sandwiches) also Subway & Maui Tacos (we couldn't find the fish in their fish tacos) in same Napili Plaza center. Dinner = we were pleased with the places nearby in Kahana Center, 1)Outback was consistently great, and welcomed us with warm aloha our first night after unpacking. 2)Maui Brewing has excellent pork ribs & salads & microbrews & Maui grown steaks; 3)the ice cream shop had terrific island ice cream flavors from a local Maui ice cream co (Roselani?) (lilikoi, coconut, cherry, chocolate macadamia)...there's also a Roys Restaurant & Shell Gas station & McDonalds & Maui Dive Shop in the center. To our delight, we found many excellent, high-end restaurants on the beach for sunset dining in Maui this time... Mala, Pacific'o, i'o, Hula Grill and others in Lahaina. We found Sansei's sushi in Kapalua to be both over-rated & over-priced, even with the 25% discount. We avoided Wailea restaurants because of mixed reviews on this site and elsewhere... and why bother when there are many to choose from in Lahaina/Kahana/Kapalua areas? We also enjoyed Hula Grill's casual Barefoot Bar several times for dinner (live music & hula dancer 6:30-9pm), with validated parking in the whaler's village pkg garage. We used several discount coupons provided by Napili Point's mgmt - kudos to them as they saved us some money and we appreciate it. Would we stay here again? Yes. With kids? - only when they're 10 & up. For families with younger kids, I'd choose a different Napili condo resort right on the sandy beach where the access to the beach & snorkeling is safer.

The pools were also very nice, though we only visited one of them for about 20 minutes since the snorkeling was so cool and the beach was really nice (off to the right, past the Gazebo within walking distance). This location also provided an awesome view of Molokai in the distance. It really felt like we were someplace magical. Usually when we vacation, we figure \"been there, done that\", and won't go back anywhere since there are so many places on my list of things to see, but we are already trying to figure out how many frequent flyer miles we will need to get back here! Have been trying to submit photos, but somehow they were converted from jpg to bmp and I can't figure out how to change that.

Thanks Jennifer at SaveonAloha(--) for sending us here, we were expecting a nice condo on the West side of Maui but this was The Bomb! My wife, three daughters(21, 17, 14) mom and I stayed here from June 4 - 8 and it was much more than we expected. We own timeshares and are used to condo style places to stay, after we finally gave up trying to exchange in to Mau we sought guidance from Jennifer who hooked us up here promising a great view, super snorkeling and location. This place really delivered. The development is a series of low rise condos located in Napilli which is on the NW tip of Maui. The complex is beautifully landscaped and has several gas BBQ grills scattered throughout (which have lighting attached so grilling at night is a breeze) on the \"cliff\" which overlooks an outrageous cove. I asked about prices for the units as each is privately owned and property mgt advised that the 2BR units were selling (when available that is) in the $950K price range. So here we were staying in a million dollar condo located on a cove with the best snorkeling we had in Hawaii! I cannot impress upon you how diverse, clear, calm and GORGEOUS this cove is. Each morning you'll see 6 or 7 sea turtles popping up around the cove getting air and then going back down to the reef to eat. We swam with at least two of these creatures which were as big as our coffee table. Way cool! The tropical fish were beautiful and compared with those we saw at Molokini (which we paid to take a sailboat out to). The units have NO A/C, but you don't need it as they open up really well and have ceiling fans throughout. The evenings in June were actually quite cool and the sound of the surf was really relaxing. If you walk along a sidewalk around the rear perimeter of the property it takes you to the adjacent property and a gorgeous golden sand beach. Its a shortt stroll and the beach is nice. Also about 10mins away from the property by car is Fleming Beach which the beach doctor rated the #1 beach in America this year. I would not hesitate to stay here again!", "Date": "June 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bolingbrook, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBest place to swim with Sea Turtles\u201d", "Author": "Bonwald", "ReviewID": "UR5357589", "Content": "Napili Point was the highlight of our stay in Maui!

Great location, the Napili Market was very close by and very clean! While there try to go horseback riding at the ironwood Ranch, Great trails and nice people.

I did alot of research before leaving and it all paid off. We rented condo C37 which is a privately held condo. You can view it at (--). It was a 2bd/2bath condo that was well supplied with cooking utensils and many extras. Our lanai overlooked a beautiful cove where the sea turtles loved to swim. The bay is a short walk, but had nice swimming and snorkling. My family and I explored several beaches and our favorites were Kapalua bay ( about a mile away) and Honoloa Bay for swimming and snorkling. Our least favorite was Kaanapali. Napili Point had two well maintained swimming pools, BBQ grills at varying points, and a free Mai Tai party on Mon. night. Our children are 7, 10, & 12 and they loved it as much as we did. I would recommend Napili Point and especially condo C37.

Traveled w/ our 2 kids (4 1/2 yrs.; 7 yrs.). We had stayed at the Point 15 yrs. ago before kids. Hasn't changed! Napili Bay is a great beach for kids, all low rise condos and very laid back atmosphere. The Point is a 5 min. walk down a path and across some rocks to the beach. It was a alittle bit of a challenge for the kids but fine. The condos vary depending on the owner. Ours was fine but hadn't been updated. We stayed on an end unit which meant there was a walkway betw. our unit and the next bldg. That made it alittle noisier as you could hear foot traffic at all hours. The condo had no a/c but okay b/c not too hot this time of yr. And kept window slates open (but then you hear outside noise better!). Washing machine/dryer in unit is a major plus. Only thing is the unit is in the hallway next to kitchen so noisy and made it hotter because dryer vent is in the interior. So tried to run washer/dryer when we were out of the unit or not sleeping. The view from our condo was amazing b/c it faces out to the ocean. The 1 bedroom ocean view unit (like ours) is on ground level below the 2 bedroom room units. The negative of that is you hear people walking around above. A lot of kids this time of year so we would hear feet walking around early in the a.m.! I later learned you can request specific unit, if available. Met another family who said they didn't like their unit and was able to choose among the ones available. Might have done that if I had known. The cove fronting the property has excellent snorkelling when conditions are calm (usually in the a.m.). Saw tons of sea turtles and all kinds of fish. Better than on the snorkeling cruise we took! The Gazebo restaurant for breakfast (next door at Napili Shores) was good for breakfast but gets busy early. Otherwise, we ate in everyday. When you check in, we got beach towels for the week. Housecleaning -- they changed bathroom towels everyday if you wanted. The property has 2 or 3 pools but not heated. So the kids didn't want to go in, ocean was warmer. A lot of families stay at the Point. It has all the amenities you needs and a great location. It is is not directly on the bay but so close and great views. Would definitely stay there again. If you are looking for kids activities, a big fun swimming pool, and more action, this is NOT the place to stay. But if you want a laid back, go at your own pace, and enjoy the beautiful cove and beach kind of stay, then this is the place.", "Date": "December 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cRoom Quality Varies Tremendously\u201d", "Author": "TruthfulTrudy", "ReviewID": "UR2784008", "Content": "This resort rents condos that are privately owned when the owners are not using them. Unfortunately that means you get a wide variety of quality in rooms. Our first room was run down and in bad need of a complete remodel. The furnishings were worn, the tile grout moldy, and we had unwelcome creepy crawlys. After a night of misery, we went to management and were given a new room right next door. What a difference! Clean, updated, light and airy. A real delight. So beware....you may get a great condo, or one that is intolerable. The hotel/condo personnel vary almost as much as the rooms. Unable to locate a pool, we asked an employee of the condo, and were told that there were no pools! Being certain that this condo did have pools, we asked again the next day, and were told exactly where the pools were. Would also have to add, I will NEVER stay anywhere in Hawaii again that does not have air conditioning, which this hotel did not. It was very hot and unbelievably humid. One more big negative about this place....while the view is gorgeous, you have to walk about 10-15 minutes, through another resorts property to get to the beach.

The hotel seemed to have been recently renovated and all effort was put into the lobby and restaurants, very little into the rooms. They were average and had no amenities such as a mini-bar or even a shower cap as most hotels offer. The whole thing was bare bones. But the worst is when you book online they show-boat by asking questions about your preferences (do you want extra towels, high floor, feather pillows) then didn't acknowledge any of my choices. I asked for a high floor-we were on 9 of 18...glass half full I guess? I asked for extra towels-we didn't even get enough towels let alone extra...I also asked (at check-in) \"what was the view\" The response \"a partial runway view\" when in fact we were full on looking at the runway and trust me it was NOISEY-that's why he lied. They should not give the noisey room unless all other rooms are booked and even then it should be at a discount. I rented a Hertz car, through the Marriott LAX website link but then after waiting (for close to a half hour) at the Hertz desk in the rear of the hotel lobby I learned that my car was reserved down the street at another Hertz location so I was not able to get the car I had booked. I waited in another ridiculously long line for Starbucks (gift card in hand) and was told they don't take Starbuck's gift cards...? Why-he couldn't answer...Both mornings our room phone rang at 5am with someone else's wake up call that the hotel staff did not care to clear from the previous guest....My husband pulled the rental car out of the lot but misplaced the ticket. Instead of calling to learn that we checked in one day ago they billed me $143.00 for one night's parking. I went to the front desk and they charged me another $25 for parking and said to show the receipt to the parking attendant. He of course said he couldn't help and that we have to call back to talk to the manager the next day...so one night's parking will either cost me $175 or a lot of time and hassle on the phone trying to straighten out- The whole thing was really a joke because they were trying to come across as so chic, for instance the drinking glass in the room is wrapped in paper that says \"quench\" and the do not disturb sign for the door says \"brainstorming\" It was all too \"cool\" but with zero ammenity or service to back it up. It was a total disappointment. Had they just offered a room in a convenient location without pretending to be able to offer more I would have been prepared, but I just really hated this hotel for misleading us...", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location\u201d", "Author": "Denise B", "ReviewID": "UR127090060", "Content": "Hotel is perfect location to return rental car and take shuttle to airport.

Breakfast bar was a big plus, but I do wish that they would either open it earlier (this is right next to the airport and we do have flights leaving very early) or allowed you to purchase a few breakfast items the night before. Noise was an issue. However, I mentioned my allergies and the staff immediately put me in a PURE room with a HEPA filter. This was not only very kind of them to hook me up, but it helped block the noise. Also, central AC gave me access to turn up or down the fan. Coffee - I wasn't impressed. I know we have to think about being green, but I need a to go cup with a lid and not just a mug. Then, I found out later that there's a coffee service down stairs after chugging the coffee down in 2 minutes. ;D Also, shame on you LA for pumping all of that \"health conscious\" information and so far, you don't even have Splenda much less Truvia. I have those in Georgia and we \"always get things after California\" according to you. Gym - Ditto above! Small gym in a \"health conscious\" city/state! Food - Again ditto. Provide more health conscious foods like a yogurt fruit smoothie and provide it so that I can purchase it at midnight even if I have to fly out at 4AM! However, the staff was very helpful and polite and provided quick shuttle to/from airport and other destinations.

After a very long flight, I was looking forward to a comfortable, quiet stay. I knew there was a hotel shuttle, but I stood out on the curb for nearly 45 minutes waiting, even though the hotel is only a mile or two away. I probably should have just walked. Once on board, I had to stand because the shuttle was packed with other travelers. Made it to the front desk about 9PM but I, and other travelers, were ignored because a contingent of flight personnel had also just arrived. Turns out, this hotel is the layover headquarters for a large number of flight personnel (flight attendants and pilots) who get their own counter, clerks, and priority. I finally got my room by going down to the ground floor level. This was very strange but I was told this was the only room available. It opened outside onto the exterior pool courtyard, but in January, everything was closed up and this room was cold and unappealing. It also had been used recently as an overflow room associated with a conference on that floor. It was missing toiletries, a pillow, in-room coffe pot, and an alarm clock. When I called the very busy desk, I was told this would be remedied at once, but it never was. Next, I went upstairs hoping to get a glass of wine in a quiet pub atmosphere. The nice looking restaurant still had patrons but I was told that I could not get a glass of wine in there, they were closing soon, but I could go next door to the breakfast restaurant where a a small bar was located, and get one there. Some people were mingling and watching TV in the bright lights of this kitchen-y area, but that was not what I had in mind, so I skipped that. The next morning, all I wanted was a cup of coffee. I made my way back upstairs to the lobby level and was greeted by a mob of ladies and young girls in attendance for some sort of gymnastics or dance conference. Most of the ladies/moms were in line at the Starbucks counter in the hotel. The line wrapped all the way around and down the hallway. Several of us customers went, instead, to the harried hostess at the cafe who got us coffees to go. It was very chaotic, and no seats were available in the cafe for breakfast. Needless to say, I checked out and took off as soon as I could. This experience was so different from my other stays with this fine hotel group that I felt compelled to write this review.

Finally called in a Manager, explained the situation and the emails are now condescending, and during a phone call, M actually said, \"lets forget about the past (when we asked her to explain her sudden lack of cooperation) since we are trying to finish this up for you.\". Excuse me? Forget about why you dont return calls, return emails? FAST FORWARD> got an email from M saying they wont be held liable but offered a $500 token of good will for my GF's trouble. Uhm.. OK. OTC medicine was about 60 bucks. taxi from marriott to CVS and back at night was 22 bucks. Saw one general family doctor and her out of pocket was 180 not including her time and taxi to get there. Saw a plastic surgeon to ask if the scar was permanent and that was about 290. getting a cut above your eye in a place like the marriott cause of a zipper is not the way anyone would want to spend the night. it can happen at any hotel. But the lack of communication, failure to accept responsibility (maybe they should be inserting the zipper side in when putting on cases?) and then offering something so ridiculous. NOT GOOD. Own Up Marriott. its ok to make mistakes. we are all human. Just make the kind of mistakes and learn from it.

After several phone calls and conversations with me he said all the hotel could offer was the double bed on the first floor which is really the basement.

The manager finally arrived and apologized for the confusion and said that he had found me a king room (which I had reserved a month ago) on the same floor. I went to the new room and turned on the AC only to hear the same high pitched noise. After a long trip from the East Coast I was not ready to go through the same issues with the manager. I turned off the AC and just let the fan run. It eliminated the high pitched noise but wasn't the best option for keeping the room cool.

They put me in a room right next to the elevator so I heard screaming kids and loud guests all night long, every night, in addition to the sound of the elevators rumbling. However, thats just the beginning. The first morning I had housekeeping barge in on my room at 7 am, Tregardless of the \"Do not disturb\" sign I had put on the door. The housekeeper proceeded to enter until she had reached my bed to hear me yelling and realized that I was still in there. The manager upon informing him of the issue denied that it happened, and then upon informing him I needed to change hotels, he offered to give a slight discount. The second night I came up to my room to find that the floor smelled strongly of Marijuana smoke and hotel security had to be called. These rooms were listed as non smoking and I am required to pass a monthly drug test as part of my employment with the government, so as such I was very concerned. That following morning there were no issues and upon returning to my room on the third night everything seemed fine, aside from being parked next to the elevators. However, the fourth night I found the smell of marijuana again and had to call hotel security to find the source and vanquish it as well as spend the night in a friends room on another floor due to the smell and smoke present on mine. I managed to go back to my room later on the following day to find the smell only faintly there and spent the last night in my room doing paperwork. But As if the preceeding issues had not been enough, On the morning I was set to check out I had my room entered again by hotel staff at around 8 am while I was still sleeping. This was regardless of the 2 \"Do not disturb\" signs that I had put on the door. One in the keycard slot and the other on the door handle. The hotel employee apparently opened my door to go inside to place my bill on the desk and I woke up to see him leaving. I would have thought that the staff would have had the courtesy to slip it underneath the door due to the signs but they didnt. Instead I was left wondering if any of my property had been stolen while I was asleep. Luckily nothing was. When I finally went to check out, the manager on duty denied that there were any of the aformentioned issues and claimed I was lying. I requested that she preform a lock interrogation to see who had entered my room and to check the calls placed from my phone top verify my calls for security. She then finally told me that she would have hotel staff check the lock records for my room and that I was to wait for them to get back to her. I spent 45 minutes waiting for the lock check and nothing happened. I then went to go pack up and leave. Upon checking out the manager was unavailable to speak with and I paid full rate for my room minus the 50 dollars they agreed to deduct from the first night at the beginning of the stay.

The restaurants are pretty good if you don't have time to go elsewhere. Rooms are fine and the beds are very good. If you shop around you will be able to find excellent rates for this hotel.

I had an absolutely perfect stay with no problems or concerns. I stayed for 4 nights in December 2011. The Airport Marriott at LAX is a large hotel property on Century Blvd just minutes from LAX, literally between two runways and nearby a bunch of other airport hotels. They do have two parking options, Self at $25.00/night or Valet at $30 or $35. I used self-park. It is convenient with in/out privileges with a swipe of your room key. The parking is very convenient and close to the main entrance. Upon arrival, we were greeted with lots of friendly employees. In fact, I was always greeted with friendly employees walking through the lobby area. The lobby has three restaurants and a Starbucks. Unfortunately, I did not have a chance to use any of the food service, so I cannot comment. We were checked in efficiently at the front desk and given a room on the 9th Floor facing the beautiful pool/courtyard area -- but not with a balcony. The very efficient and fast elevators are always waiting for you and you are not waiting for them. Our room was very clean and of average United States/Marriott standards. We had two double beds and the decor was generally up-to-date and everything was in working order and good condition. The bathroom was small, but fine for us -- although I wish the shower head was a bit higher for tall people like myself. Our room was made up timely every single day. The courtyard/pool area is gorgeous. A massive pool in a tropical setting with lots of seating areas, plants, flowers and even a stream and bridge. It is really a nice area to just chill and relax, even if you are not using the pool or hot tub. Good Service, Good Value, a Decent Room = a good value! By the way, you will hear airport noise between like 6am and midnight, somewhat frequently. If this bothers you, then you should seriously consider staying at a non-airport hotel. We actually enjoy this and it doesn't bother us at all. I would highly recommend a stay with the LAX Airport Marriott.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNotourious on no refunds on Natural Disasters\u201d", "Author": "karly C", "ReviewID": "UR121745377", "Content": "If you planning to book Los Angeles Aiport Marriott call before hand and ask about their policy on refunds on Natural Disasters.

I asked the front desk to remind housekeeping that my room didn't need serviced. I had to switch floors because the maids on the 10th floor started work very early in the morning and were EXTREMELY loud and shouting to each other down the halls - they were anything but mindful of people trying to sleep. The staff was apologetic and upgraded me to an executive suite on another floor.

I have a bad back that requires me to arrange pillows in a certain way to ease the pain, and when the maids came in they removed all the pillows and stacked them in a corner (requiring me to place all the pillows all over again) and the maids moved several of my belongings when they came in my room. Come to find out, even after all my requests for \"NO HOUSEKEEPING\" the hotel had never removed my room number from housekeeping's list of rooms to be cleaned. Another issue is self parking. When you check in, they're supposed to activate your room key for parking. I've discovered most of the employees, however, don't activate the keys properly which causes you to have to buzz the valet to come and let you out of the gate...sometimes they're prompt, sometimes you wait 5 minutes with a cue of cars behind you. I would only suggest this hotel if your flight's been cancelled and you have to stay somewhere overnight. It's at least a safe, clean hotel.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chesterfield", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel great customer service\u201d", "Author": "Princessalaska", "ReviewID": "UR118663583", "Content": "We love this hotel and always stay here on our arrival in LA, so many good things to mention, the beds ( possibly the most comfortable I have ever slept in ), the great staff, shuttle bus service from the airport ( every 15 mins ). This trip we had quite a few rooms and I managed to loose a denim jacket in one of them or it may have been left in the main area downstairs, I had borrowed it from my youngest daughter without permission !! We returned two weeks later and it was only as I was getting my plane outfit sorted that I realised it was missing!! I went to see the concierge not thinking that I would ever see it again and amazingly he produced it within 10 mins !!!! Unbelievable. The staff are really lovely so welcoming and nothing is too much trouble, we like the balcony rooms, but they are not available beyond the 7th floor. The pool area is really lovely always room and never feels overcrowded. Night time patrols by security ( for those poor brits abroad ) who find themselves up at 2am! Smoking is allowed by the pool in a designated area. The two eating places one a sports bar and one more family based dining with a fairly standard menu good hearty fare with reasonable pricing. Starbucks is onsite and opens at 6am but if you don't fancy that then there is a Denny's just down the road a five minute walk away. All the main car rental places are within easy reach of the hotel so it makes it an ideal start and end destination to the holiday. We go every year and have stayed at other hotels near the airport but we keep returning to this one ( mainly for the beds ) !!!! and the pool and the really lovely welcome and great staff.

Towels and cold water were available; equipment was equipped with individual TVs. A complaint about the fitness center is that it was kind of warm. 4. The outdoor pool is impressive, and water was bathwater warm despite it being a rather cool day. 5. The television set was an old-fashioned tube, with limited channel selection. 6. Good in-room climate control with quiet operation. 7. A large airport hotel like this should make it very easy to find out about its complimentary shuttle service to the airport -- for example, lobby signage, a prominent notice in the room, etc. -- turns out I had to call to ask, and the word was the shuttle ran about once every 25 minutes and not on a schedule. That tends to work against a primary objective of staying at an airport hotel: minimizing time spent getting to the airport. My recommendation -- if you can get past the ethics of it and your luggage is not too cumbersome -- is walk across the street to the nearby Budget Rent-a-Car and ride their shuttle (which is nearly continuous) to the LAX terminals. 8.

He picked up way too many passengers who ended up standing in the aisles along with luggage that fell onto people. Passengers on the bus finally told him they refused to allow him to pick anyone else up. When he was confronted with how unsafe the situation was, he could care less. After the harrowing shuttle bus ride, we arrived at the hotel and were met with hundred of screaming adolescents and young adults who were there for an Anamae convention (likely didn't spell that correctly). They were dressed in very odd outfits and obviously were all deaf as they screamed at one another constantly. They monopolized the elevators, the lobby and the pool area. We could not get a room by the pool, which we have always had in the past, as we were warned we wouldn't get any rest. Instead, we were put on the 14th floor overlooking a parking area. For this we paid about $160.00/night! We advised the front desk manager of our concerns.

It is very close to the airport terminals, but current arrangements with airport shuttles mean it may take longer to reach the hotel door than you would like. This, plus new LAX security policy, which apparently prohibits walking to and from the area, means that even though you are literally next to the airport, you should plan on more time to get to your room or meeting than you would have in the past. Otherwise, we experienced no problems with this property. As mentioned in other reviews, the rooms are alarmingly small for such a hotel, reminding one of some of the old New York City hotels that were converted from really old properties but kept the small room sizes. Given prices near the airport, it might pay to shop around for a hotel with more living space if you are going to spend more than a night there. Within a quarter mile of the terminals, there are lots of top hotels to choose from. If you are not a frequent visitor to LAX, you should also prepare yourself for the airport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abysmal conditions and expect it to take you maybe twice as long to negotiate outbound departures. Security procedures are closer to those in third world airports and the domestic and international terminal areas are well behind those in some other major USA airports and disorganized, despite the waves of TSA (read as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thousands Standing Around\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), personnel shuttling your checked baggage from one place to another. The absurdity of the three stage international departure exercise challenges both logic and patience as you must first check in with the airline, then physically carry your checked baggage to the TSA X-Ray point which is always backed up and understaffed, then go and get in line a third time for the usual mindless check of your carry-on and person. This routine may also include undue harassment from private security personnel at various locations. Plan at least three hours for portal to portal, hotel front door to airline gate, to be safe. Still, the hotel is convenient if you must be in or go through LAX and sometimes you have little choice. If you arrive there from overseas, prepare yourself for long waits, first at immigration and then at customs. Returning from Japan, we spent two hours after we got our luggage getting through US government check points. Private security personnel were the rudest encountered in many years anywhere, so again, prepare yourself for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The LAX Treatment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As other reviews show, there is no convenient place to eat except at other nearby hotels, so plan accordingly.

The price to park is just out of this world..I understand valet is a premium service but I've paid less at 5 star hotels here in Hawaii where we live and the self parking rates are ridiculous too.

The first night we waited about 10-15 minutes for our car which btw we could see parked..the next few days it was a little better with wait times in the 10 minute range..still for about $32/day valet fee, i'd expect better service. It seemed like they were short staffed with only 1 or 2 people getting the cars...very frustrating!! To me , this is the only downfall to this property but it's pretty major..when you're on vacation you want the convenience of fast service..we would end up sending my husband downstairs 5-10 minutes earlier just to give the valet our parking ticket to get the car, then I'd come downstairs w/ my two kids..if you plan on not getting a car (which would be pretty dificult for this hotel, because nothing major is within walking distance) or you don't mind crappy valet service and overpriced parking rates than this place won't be an issue for you.

The pool area is nicely done and if you have time it looks really good but that seems about the best part along with the fitness room which was also good but there really must be better hotels in the area and the Renaissance certainally looked it, this will be the for me the next time we are in the area.", "Date": "May 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cA great airport hotel. Our top choice!\u201d", "Author": "juliryan", "ReviewID": "UR28755609", "Content": "Almost everything went our way when we stayed at the Los Angeles Airport Marriott. The courtesy shuttle pulled up to the stop at our terminal just as we were walking out. A couple minutes later we pulled into the hotel. From the outside, the hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look like much. The entry into the lobby, however, is very nice. The bellhop brought our bags to the bell captain. We were arriving at midnight, but this capable airport hotel is accustomed to late arrivals and ours posed no problem to the reservation desk (we had rung ahead to confirm, of course). We were given a room with a king sized bed on the eighth floor, away from the elevator. The bell captain brought our bags to our room. The rooms are not big, but they are nicely furnished. Not too dated. The fixtures and furniture aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too cheap. Our room was almost spotless. It had been cleaned to a very high standard. Except, the windows did need a clean, but I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too concerned. The soundproofing is adequate. I heard very little jet noise, and we were practically on the tarmac, the hotel is so close to LAX. I heard a few doors closing in the hallway in the morning, but otherwise it was quiet enough. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a mini bar in the room, but ice and vending machines are nearby. The downstairs bar was closed on our arrival, but I suppose we could have ordered drinks from room service. The bed was very comfortable. Unfortunately we did not receive the feather free linens that we had requested. Nice LCD television. No problems accessing the internet ($12.95 for 24 hours, includes local calls and domestic long distance). We appreciated the safe. Enough room for our many bags. The bathroom is small, but again it has nice fixtures. Good tub and ample pressure from the shower head. Plenty of hot water. Complimentary USA Today in the morning. Complimentary tea and coffee is available in the room. We did not order breakfast from room service. We liked the Starbucks in the lobby. We got a couple lattes and breakfast rolls. I wish Starbucks had had croissants! Unfortunately, during our stay, only the hotel restaurant was open (not the sports bar, which we thought had the most appealing menu, or the steak restaurant). The child was not inclined to sit down for a meal at the restaurant, so we had to skip it. One of the best things about this hotel is the outdoor pool area. The heated pool is huge, with a large area that is only two feet deep. The child loved it. The pool is on the ground level, and is surrounded on all four sides by the hotel. Very sheltered. There is a hot tub/jacuzzi as well. Lots of lounge chairs and nice outdoor landscaping make it the perfect place to get some sun. There are amenities for smokers in this area, and this space is large enough that you probably wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even notice them lighting up. No food is allowed by the pool. The gym looked well equipped, but I didn't have a chance to use it. Lots of meeting room space at the hotel. A convenience shop is also at the hotel. There is a business centre and a place to print out boarding passes. We ordered room service for lunch. We got a hamburger and fish tacos. They tried to accommodate the child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food allergies, but I recommend that if you need a special order, you be very specific and quiz them on all ingredients to assure that everything is okay. Still, very good service and we were quite happy with our meal. We ordered a wake-up call so we could have an afternoon nap, and it worked. The clock in the room worked as well, although the last guest had set it 30 minutes fast. Another tea and coffee from the Starbucks. Nice one. We requested and were granted a very late checkout of 5:00 p.m. We used the express check out service. There was supposed to be an additional charge, but it did not appear on our final bill, despite discussions with At Your Service and the reservation desk. I guess the charge was waived. Um, good? This hotel is a busy airport hotel. Lots of business travellers, airline crews and layover folks like us. The hotel staff was friendly and accommodating. Again, the hotel has an inviting lobby, and a lot of guests were hanging out there, during the morning and in the afternoon. On checking out, the bellman arrived promptly to assist us with our bags. We had to wait about ten minutes for the complimentary shuttle, which runs about every 25 minutes but is not on a schedule. No problems being dropped off at our terminal, although if you are flying Qantas like we were, be sure to double-check your terminal, as Qantas has desks in TWO international terminals. Happy to recommend the LAX Marriott. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t confuse it with the Marriott Courtyard, which is nearby. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect too much, the LAX Marriott is a great airport hotel. If we have another LA layover, the LAX Marriott will be our top choice.", "Date": "April 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atascadero, CA", "Title": "\u201cChanged rooms 3 times in 10 hrs!\u201d", "Author": "Hotelemployee58", "ReviewID": "UR28148742", "Content": "My daughter and I went to this Marriott for a convention. Being an asociate of the Marriot, and knowing how our hotel is, I was looking forward to the trip. We arrived at 11pm, I jumped in the shower, in the middle of washing my hair the water turned ice cold. I called the front desk, told the receptionist and she said, \"And what exactly would you like me to do about this?\" I was transferred five times before being offer a 2nd level room. Due to being very noise sensitive I had originally requested an upper lever room (we started on the 7th floor) but it was 1am, and I wanted to take a hot shower and get to bed. Got to bed at 3am, and was awoken at 9am by screaming and loud music coming from the pool. Called the front desk again, got the run around, was told they were to occupancy, on and on. I was finally transferred to \"The Friendly Manager\" (??), that is what they called her, who apologized and transferred us to the 14th floor. So there was our third room, and we left for the day. Next morning we left early, my daughter returned to the room at 8:15, was washing up and a knock on the door from housekeeping, wanting to clean our room. We had been out of the room for over 12 hours. She called me, I went to the front desk, was met by a \"deer in the headlights stare\" and the she pointed to the houseman! He tracked down the head of housekeeping, who asked if I wanted the room cleaned right then. I was going up to shower and go to bed, it was 10:30 by that time, so I told her what items we needed. I got up to the room, housekeeping had gotten there before their very slow elevators got me up, some of the items were left on one of the beds, but they had forgotten half of them! The last day of our conference was Sunday, so we had checked out that morning. The conference ran late and ended at 11:00. Rather than stay the night there again, I decided to head north and find a Courtyard. We found and older Courtyard in Oxnard and it was wonderful! As a side note, on my first phone call to the front desk, she asked if I was an associate. I said yes, she asked if I worked at a Courtyard, yes, she had the nerve to tell me that \"they were a full service Marriott\" so things were a little different. I got the strong feeling she was looking down her nose at me, due to the fact I worked at a Courtyard rather than a \"full service\"! I asked if she were treating me this was due to the fact I was an associate, she said she treated everyone the same. I told her I felt bad for her guests if they were all being treated as we were, and I would never dream of treating a guest to our hotel in the manner in which I was being treated. The ONLY people who were nice was the maintainance gentleman who came up to check the shower, and the bell man, Jerry, who moved our bags for us. If you don't care if you are treated like a number, pay $14/day for internet, $20+/night for parking, and just rudeness, try the LAX Marriott. I work at the Courtyard Marriott in San Luis Obispo. I could not wait to get back to work where the entire staff is friendly and would bend over backwards to accomodate a guest. This is not because we are told to, but because we want to. The employees at the LAX Marriott, could use a weekend stay at our hotel to learn some service skills and a better attitude. As an associate I get a huge discount so this shouldn't matter to me, right? Well, if I could do it over again, I would have stayed at a different hotel and paid full price if it would have made the stay even a little nicer. I could not imagine paying full price then paying all the junk fees, for what? A \"full service\" hotel. The only \"full service\" they provide, is valet parking and bell men.

I had stayed at the Airport Marriott when stranded by the airlines and they upgraded my party to a luxury suite to calm our frazzled nerves. So who better to turn to, when you are stressed, and have only hours to make a memorable weekend happen. I called the LA Airport Marriott directly and poured my heart out to the Ft Desk Mgr Daniel. He assured me everything would be fine and he would make it happen. I had NO IDEA he would be more than true to his word. The staff at this property upgraded our reservation with our Marriott Platinum Card to the Berkley Suite. This room is plush, CLEAN, and wonderful for any special occasion. The staff greeted our party with smiles and warm personalities. Daniel made sure this would be special for my daughter by having the entire staff sign a Birthday Card and sending a tray of treats to the room. He made what was a horrible day turn into what my daughter says is the Best BDay yet. The pool, food and amenities are over the top. CLEAN,CLEAN,CLEAN...being an investigative producer, this is a biggie for me. Some hotels give the appearance of clean but when you look past the top layer it is NOT. This property has gained a lifetime of loyalty from me and anyone else I come in contact with. The location is not a place where you would walk down the street at night but for business or pleasure you are only minutes away from everything. We chose the Santa Monica Promenade (3rd St) (that took us 2 days) and Hermosa Beach. We were so relaxed and rejuvenated at this property we booked a 3rd night after we had already checked out. We went back for more. The top notch staff booked us right back into the Berkley Suite for a 3rd night. Now that is 1st Class Service. It is goodbye to my other frequent card holder hotels as the Marriott has my loyalty for life. It is RARE to find a GEM of a hotel with a staff to match. May I also add the price was 1/2 of what I was going to pay for the hotel in San Diego. The price has me sold too!!! It pays to be a Marriott Rewards Member!!

We never encountered any problems with the lifts, the staff were all very nice and helpful and our room was made up everyday perfectly.

The lobby was always busy, but we were all checked in within around 5 minutes. The concerge was very helpful giving us information and maps on how to get around. We caught a bus to La Brae Tarpits,we had to change buses but found it very easy. the tarpits were quite interesting and from there we caught another bus just up the road to Farmers Markets and The Grove Shopping Centre. On the way back we had to change buses again and whilst waiting for the bus, we spotted the Hollywood sign in the distance. The next day we caught the bus to Santa Monica which was not far. The next day we had arranged a tour with Starline Tours and were picked up from the hotel and had the full day at Universal Studios. There are not much food options around the hotel, one night we ate at the hotel resturant and the meal was very good.There is a liquor shop which sells anything else you might need just down the road and a Burger King.

You're not going to be wowed by any means, but it's everything you expect from a Marriott. LOCATION- Straight down the road from LAX maybe a half mile. Catching the shuttle can be a daunting process (as it would be for any airport hotel here). The arrivals roadway is very, very busy and there are thousands of cars and vans all whizzing by. It comes by on a random schedule and serves both the Marriott and Renaissance. PROPERTY- This is a Marriott relic that has been redone many times over. But I like this \"old style\". There is a beautifully landscaped courtyard pool area surrounded by a 5-story tower. There is also a tall18 story tower as well. I prefer to stay in one of the lower floors by the pool. If you request an even numbered room (ending in 00,02,04,06, etc) you will have a nice balcony overlooking the courtyard and pool. 1st floor even-numbered rooms actually have a patio that walks straight out to the pool. Can you tell I have stayed here many times??? I think this pool area is a small respite in the busy LAX area. ROOMS- For the most part, small. I've had some rooms that were bigger than others, although it's kind of random. The rooms are standard updated Marriott - very nice. Fabulous bedding and small but luxurious bathrooms. No surprises here but you'll be very comfortable. FOOD- I have been in the lobby bar. They have great food and a nice selection of drinks, but it's very, very expensive.

The very good: The exercise room now has at least eight treadmills, and each has an individual television monitor. They provide earbuds so you don't have to listen to your neighbor's program. There were also a variety of other exercise machines, and a separate alcove with weights. There were lots of clean towels, cold water, and apples. Definitely above average! The not so good: It took us several hours to drive there, and when we arrived we were directed to underground parking. My husband drove around and around, looking for a space for his small truck, until he finally gave up and drove out again. When we told the attendant we couldn't find a place to park the attendant said \"There are spaces there -- people are going in and not coming out.\" and directed us to the above-ground area, where the only place we could find had a tree branch obscuring it. Fortunately we're not car proud, so we just moved the branch aside and then let it rest against the truck. I guess if we had continued circling the underground garage we would have found a space eventually. Also there would have been space if there hadn't been at least two cars taking up two spaces apiece, and one truck that was taking up two and a half spaces. Also, some of the underground space was being used to store what looked like building supplies. I asked one of the hotel staff and he confirmed that the parking lot operation is contracted out. A web search showed that you can pay to park here even if you are not a hotel guest. I like Marriott. The hotel staff do their best to be cheerful, courteous, and efficient and they put up with a lot. I wish the Marriott also ran the parking lot. Regarding nearby restaurants -- We stayed at the Four Points Sheraton next door a few months ago and they have a nice restaurant with a good beer selection.

However, for an airport hotel, and a property which does a great deal of it's business with flight crews, it certainly does not go out of it's way to ensure that the crews are indulged. We are Marriott Rewards customers (albeit the basic level), and were assigned a room on the ground floor - with a very narrow door, making it hard to push our luggage through. This was almost laughable since the rooms on the opposite side of the hall had standard sized doors. As other reviewers have noted, internet access is charged at $12.95 plus tax per day ... and parking is $19! So, a relatively inexpensive room rate is pushed up substantially by the add-ons. So, if you have no car, and no need to use the internet - then this hotel is a relative bargain; if you need those accoutrement then the price rises rapidly - and I would recommend the Doubletree down off of Sepulveda. The other matter I took issue with during my stay was the large gathering that was held the morning of our departure. Since we were on the ground floor, and since there was an entry/exit at the end of our hall, it became very noisy in the morning as the group filed in, and furthermore, many members of that group were smokers so the hall was quite malodorous by the time we departed. Apparently, no effort was made to prevent the attendees from smoking in the lodging hallways. On the bright side, corporate policy allows for a 3 PM departure upon request - although that is done via the internet before one's arrival. In summary, I would like to compliment the staff - to a person, they were pleasant and affable. To the management - rather than nickel-and-diming your flight crews, why not bundle everything so they will want to visit your property when traveling on leisure?

The rooms at the LAX Marriott are on the small side, but they were recently (and completely) updated. They are fresh, bright, and lovely. For two people, it's plenty of room.

The hotel has recently remodeled it's work-out/fitness room. When I went, it was busy...but no waiting for equipment. It was nice to be in a hotel gym that was not completely empty. The hotel has a Starbucks in the lobby, as well as three restaurants: a high-end steak house; a mid-level restaurant; and a sports bar. We dined in all three, and we found the food to be good (not excellent...but good) in all of them. The LAX Marriott is a busy hotel, but the staff seems to do an excellent job of keeping the line moving at the front desk, as well as the traffic moving in the driveway. In the end, we departed the LAX Marriott much more satisfied than we were when we left the Manhattan Beach Marriott.

At least once a day, we ordered room service just to enjoy the hotel's caesar salads - seriously, they are THAT good. We did try 2 of the hotel's restaurants, though. On the afternoon of our arrival, we had absolutely delicious, reasonably priced burgers in Champion's Sports Bar. Another day, we had dinner at JW Steakhouse. This was extremely disappointing - every menu item is a la carte, and I ended up paying nearly $50 for rack of lamb, mashed potatoes and asparagus (I know LA restaurants are much pricier than those here in Pennsylvania, but considering my meal at Spago was a fraction of the price of this hotel restaurant...) The lamb was terrible, horribly overspiced to the point of being bitter and inedible, and well-done, though I'd ordered it medium rare. I wouldn't recommed this restaurant to anyone.

Quite convenient ditching the rental car the night before and then hopping on the hotel shuttle bus. From check-in to check-out this hotel was a delight. I was a solo dad traveling with a tired, cranky 4-year-old and they got us in and out perfectly. The pool at this hotel is great and for those of you who specifically seek out airport hotels to watch planes this place is amazing if you ask for an airport runway view and there are many. As for those of you don't don't like airport hotels because of the noise this place should not be an issue. I didn't notice any plane sound. Rooms were newly renovated, there's a Starbucks in the lobby, parking is a ripoff (but that's the case at all LAX hotels...) and the restaurant was decent for breakfast. I've stayed at the Embassy Suites across the street, that's a good bet too if you specifically need a suite hotel.

In 20 years of traveling, this was the worst hotel service we have ever had. It was a comedy of errors that should have embarassed the hotel manager. The fact that he was not embarassed nor apologetic seemed to be an indicator that poor service was the norm. The challenges started with parking. The hotel is undergoing work on the lobby entrance. We had to park in the surface lot about 1/4 mile away and haul our luggage over the parking lot, dodging cars that were parking. It was difficult to find the escalator (it was unmarked), no help was offered anywhere. When we checked in, we found out that the double bed promised on the reservation would not be honored. No apologies were made, and the impression we received that this was a normal occurrence. When we got to the room, the room was still dirty from previous guests! We immediately called down to the front desk, and were promised a new room promptly and help to move to another room. After 30 minutes passed, we called down again. Ten minutes later, a hotel clerk came up with new keys and left. At this point, we negotiated for a reduced hotel rate. The new keys did not work. After another 30 minute wait, the manager appeared talking on a walkie talkie to other hotel staff. He had new keys, however was more interested in talking on his walkie talkie than in alleviating our concerns. Again, the apologies were lacking for the poor service. The restaurant service was friendly, quick and without errors. At checkout the following morning, the bill was incorrect and did not include the discount that was negotiated. This necessitated another trip downstairs to talk to the hotel staff. A notation was made on our record so the clerk reprinted the bill. This was a quick, overnight stay so other facilities were not used. Hotels make mistakes, although the number of mistakes was startling. The lack of concern on the hotel's staff art seemed to indicate that mistakes were the norm, not the exception.

Do be aware that they started tearing down the breakfast a little before the posted closing time, but the server was kind enough to bring me a yogurt after they had been put away.

The business center was closed for the weekend, and the internet TV was a very poor substitute. I took a bus to Santa Monica Beach, which was a long ride, but the beach itself was fun. The surrounding shopping was lovely, and the persons there fun to meet. I also took a VIP Tour (brand name, not level of service!) around Hollywood and the surrounding areas, and was disappointed. The tour was, in my opinion, overpriced, and the driver mainly told us about how many people lived in each city, and how many miles it was. Each place we stopped we had about twenty minutes to look around, before we were due back on the bus. The tour ended two hours earlier than I had been told it would.

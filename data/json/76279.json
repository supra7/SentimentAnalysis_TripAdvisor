At first impression, it had the original 1950's charm. It went downhill from there. We were given \"an upgraded\" and \"remodeled\" room. It was large, but barely furnished. There was no armchair for reading, just three regular desk chairs. The armoir for TV was gigantic, yet when we opened it we found a tiny little set, not flat-screen, maybe 20 inches. It looked so ridiculous that we had a good giggle over it. The faucet in the shower barely worked. The room had a narrow and claustrophobic shower stall, not a tub (an unpleasant surprise - we're staying at a mineral bath place and we'd like to soak in our own private bathroom). The carpets were drab. There was dust on top of the headboard. Everything in the room looked dingy. We specifically asked for a room away from the road, but no such luck - rattling cars and trucks kept us up at night (how about installing double-pane windows?). There were no amenities - no breakfast, no warm cookies in the evening, no cotton balls/q-tips/shower caps in the bathroom. The towels were thin, small, and scratchy. The pillows were springy and hard. Now, both of us like vintage and we find a lot of charm in old-fashioned, historic hotels (stayed at many). If you're going for the 1950's original look and feel, but all means, please do! Yet Wikinson's was simply cheap. The decor in the room didn't fit stylistically and was cheap. Everything about the place looked and felt like a Motel 6 rather than a high-end Calistoga spa that they claim to be. We paid an exorbitant price for this room (over $200 per night) and when we were checking out, I mentioned to the clerk how disappointed we were that nothing about the property was upscale like they claim. The clerk informed us that we had been given an upgraded room and overall their prices usually start at $250, so we got a good deal. Hmm... Traveling a month later, we had to spend an night at an airport Holiday Inn. It was incredible, in terms of the amenities it offered and the low price we paid. *THAT* was my beef with Wilkinson's - if I am paying over $200 a night, I am expecting to get value for my money.

It's not fancy, nor does it try to be. The value is excellent. The rooms could use some updating, they looked tired and outdated but clean, The best part about this hotel is after a day of wine tasting, you walk 2 blocks to a variety of decent restaurants, have dinner and then come back, put on a bathing suit and go soak in one of 3 mineral pools. I truly believe this is why we were never hungover the next day! I absolutely LOVED the outdoor hot mineral pool. It gets chilly in Northern California at night, but swimming & doing laps in this normal sized swimming pool underneath a starry sky was heaven. And we were there during harvest season (early October) yet had the mineral pools to ourselves! Even my husband swears his skin became softer after 3 nights of mineral pool swims. We did the mud bath treatment and really enjoyed the weightlessness of the peat infused volcanic ash warm mud. The lavender scented whirlpool bath was very relaxing, then were put in a steam room (men & women are segragated here, you're naked, except for the little towel you wear in the steam room). The iced towel and lemon water helped rehydrate, then off to a massage included in the package. I was very happy. It took most of the morning so we didn't go wine tasting until that afternoon, which I didn't mind because it was a nice treatment. It's not fancy, it's not like a regular new age music playing spa. But that's ok. Calistoga is kind of a laid back, old-fashioned town so it all just fits in. I usually don't like to do repeat visits but this is a place I would like to go back to.

I think it's shameful. I assumed because it was in the wine country, there are enough people that get there and are sort of stuck, that they just don't go back. But then reading these reviews, I guess I'm wrong. The property looks like a Motel 6 from the 1950's - made out of tinder blocks, concrete everywhere, plastic cups and plastic ice bucket in bathroom, lamp fixtures looked like they came from Target, single paned windows - you could hear the traffic, draperies unlined and only barely cover window (not to floor), towels paper thin, iinsulation from rooms is non existent (you could literally hear the person above us peeing in the toilet), plastic corian counter top, laying in bed you could see the plumbing from the sink, the TV in the armoire was so small- it was actually a little difficult to see picture very well when lying in bed, we were told it had WIFI - sure, but you have to go OUTSIDE the room to get a signal (because of the concrete construction) - I could go on and on. I was born and raised in Napa Valley and I'm embarrassed for this place. It's been there a long time, I know that. But when we were told it had been redone and upgraded, I believed then. When we booked the room (which was very last minute) they were the only rooms available in town - that should have been my first clue. It's just not a $255 room, it's a motel/hotel room that is not worth more than $175 - maximum. It was clean, no question about that. And the bed was very comfortable.

From the tripadvisor reviews, we knew not to expect a five star hotel but a clean, affordable accommodation (considering the area), central to Northern Napa and literally steps from Lincoln Ave in the quaint town of Calistoga. First the good, Dr. Wilkinsons has three mineral pools ranging from and indoor jacuzzi temperature pool, to two outdoor pools one heated and one closer to the natural outside temperature. It's safe to say that you'll find mineral spring water to bathe in that will suit your temperature preference. The room was impeccably clean with a small but versatile TV that unlike many hotel/motel sets allowed us to plug in our portable DVD player. Though small the toilet and shower area were both as clean as the rest of the room and are also separate from sink area to allow for more efficient use of facilities. We stayed in a courtyard one room which was about as close as you could get to Lincoln ave. That being said, the walls were not thin so road noise (Lincoln isn't very busy anyway) wasn't a problem nor were voices audible from the courtyard. Step out into the courtyard and lounge chairs as well as cannopied tables are available to sip that wine you just purchased during a long day of tastings. By this time you probably have multiple wine glasses from your winery tours but just in case they stayed in the car, Dr Wilkinsons ensures clean wine glasses are placed in your room daily. To close out the good section....LOCATION! Calistoga is a sleepy LITTLE town in Northern wine country. The only negative about Calistoga is that the retail shops close relatively early and there may not be as many dining choices as some would hope. Dr. Wilkinson's is right on Lincoln Ave and only a few seconds walk from the three or four block long strip that contains everything to do in town. Walk out of Dr. Wilkinson's and turn left and you run into a bike path that is suitable for a good 5 mile out and back run or a trip to the nearest hiking trail that will take you to heights overlooking the valley. Unfortunately, I can't comment on the spa treatments because my wife went down the road to Indian Springs for her mud bath and massage during our stay. Few more positivies: Dr Wilikinsons is about a 1.5 miles from Clos Pegase one of the best kept secrets among wineries in Napa Valley, 15 minute drive from the petrified forest (no need to see it twice but definitely worth the trip), and only about a 5 minute drive from Old Faithful geyeser of California. Wilkinson's is only about a 2 minute walk from great coffe and breakfast at the Calistoga Roastery. It beats Starbucks ten times over. Negatives: The rooms are not new. The decor can use some updating and the facilities would benefit from general renovations. The carpet was starting to look old and the small tiled bathroom with stand up shower would fit nicely in any 60s era movie. Large parts of the outdoor pool area are blocked from the sun for significant parts of the day, which may require some jockeying around to ensure you capture that even tan. The rooms aren't exactly cheap for what you get but remember, we are in Napa Valley here so if you think about it that way the rooms are very cheap for the location, and this location is GREAT!!! I'd stay here again and recommend it to all. Clean, comfortable, and central would be the best way to describe Dr. Wilkinson's.

The potential for this to be a great hotel is all there but there were simply too many \"small\" problems to ignor. Pros - Fantastic massage, great service in the bath house and the BEST facial ever. Very nice pools. Cons - Check in time is very late - sometime between 3-5 pm with no guarentee of when the room will actually become available. Rooms are dark. Something is just \"off\" - hard to put my finger on it. I called at 3:00 to say that we were 45 minutes away and to confirm that our rooms would be ready. I was greeted with a \"not sure, we'll do our best.\" We decided to make a wine tasting stop and arrived at the hotel at 4:30. The rooms were still not ready! Not only that, but no one could actually tell us when the rooms would be ready. There was another gentleman in the lobby who said he had been waiting for over 3 hours for his room. We were told that we were welcome to enjoy the pools, which was great, but the only place to change is the lobby bathroom which is rather inconvenient. Our rooms became ready just as we changed into our swimsuits (we would have waited is someone could have told us it would only be 10-15 minutes). The rooms were very clean, although somewhat drab. The \"Bungalow\" we booked with a kitchen was very dark, the bathroom sink didn't drain well and the kitchen was very minimalistic - right from the 70's with a refridgerator that was not quite as cold as it should be. The double queen room we booked was nice although the shower was very weak. One very nice surprise was that the managment placed a lovely bottle of wine for us in the room as it was my mom's birthday. We ended up having a problem with the bungalow and having to move to another room for our second night. Although the staff tried to be very polite it definitely cut into our day and the entire experience left us feeling more stressed than relaxed. The one upside is that the room we received - queen with kitchen - was much nicer than the bungalow. We were compensated for the inconvenience - which was very nice - but I would have rather not dealt with moving rooms. Basically, the property and the staff have great potential but small things kept creeping up that prevented us from truly enjoying our retreat away. One more note - although the bath house serviced were FANTASTIC and the staff very friendly, this is not a spa! It is much more clinical and less private than any spa services I have ever experienced.

Dr. Wilkinson's was always a nice place to stay because of it's location and because it WAS half the price of many of the other neighboring properties. My recent visit was such a disappointment - the room we had was in a corner with one bed, which would have been fine, but it was like a tiny cave. The noise from the upstairs neighbors woke us up every night and then the \"campers\" in the courtyard were out every morning with their kids screaming at 8 a.m.! AND the Dr. was no longer a bargain - it was only about 15% less expensive per night than Indian Hot Springs! So bottom line, my advice: 1. Stay at Indian Hot Springs or another newer property. 2. If you have to stay at Dr Wilkinson's make sure you get a room with 2 beds updstairs (this will guarantee you a decent sized room). Also, the Dr's Victorian is ok, but the last time I stayed there about a year ago, the self-closing front door slammed shut at all hours of the day and night. 3.Have your spa treatments at Indian Hot Springs. I have spa'd at about 5 different palces in Calistoga and always end up there. The Dr.'s steam room is like a closet, the mud is smelly, and the massage just so-so. At Indian H.S. the service is great, the facilites are fist class (though older, too), and are super clean. As a side note: I've done the couple's treatments at Roman Hot Springs too and it's not too comfortable. You sit in your robe in a co-ed waiting room about the size of a small walk-in closet in between each treatment.

Also: DW's is right on Lincoln Ave. right, a half-block walk to the best restaurants and shops. Some of the complaints about the mud baths (in prior reviews) are just crazy. All mudbaths smell. No one changes the mud after each bath. The mud baths at DW's are what they should be--hot theraputic mud. Mine was tended by a knowledgeable attendant who applied the usual cold cloths to my forehead and dabbed some aromatic oils on my face which counteract some of the odor--a real nice touch. I have been to Calistoga about a dozen times, but this was my first visit to DW's.

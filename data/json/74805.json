It is old, and could stand to be upgraded with new carpet and furnishings. Having said that, it was clean, had a great breakfast, free USA Today newspaper, and very friendly staff. They answered our questions about the area, but I don't like the access issues getting into and out of this hotel parking lot. You cannot exit the parking lot and head east on Bell Road, due to traffic, and no traffic lights. You must turn west, do a U Turn, and take risks with the heavy traffic in the area. The price was affordable, the parking was ample, but make sure you don't park in the spaces marked for the neighboring car rental business. They give you a parking decal to put in your windshield to ensure you won't get towed if you park in the right area. To get to the hotel, you must drive past it on the frontage road, and then turn a hard right to drive around to the front door of the hotel. The hotel was quiet while we were there, and while airplanes were flying overhead during the day, we didn't hear them at night. The \"white noise\" created by the air conditioner drowned out any noise we may have heard, and we slept well.

The hotel itself is very old and dirty. The elevator doesnt look like it has ever been cleaned or vacuumed. The sheets on our bed were dirty when asked for a new set they gave us two flat sheets. Of course the sheets werent changed the following day. Then my husband and I both forgot our phone chargers (iphone & blackberry) and of course they are no where to be found.

All shifts and all departments were all smiles all the time. Better service than I've received at twice the price. I was first given a handicap accessible room with an adjoining door. I went down and explained I just don't like adjoining rooms and the clothing rack was too low for my clothes to hang without touching the floor. No problem; changed rooms with a smile. Ride to the convention center at the last minute? No problem. The area is NOT dangerous or scary but There is no view to speak of. There is a BurgerKing on one side and an IHOP on the other but there was no cooking smell outside (surprising). The area is clean.

I selected this particular hotel because I trust Marriott properties and the Fairfield Inn Phoenix North seemed conveniently located between the base and the areas of Phoenix we wanted to explore in our 24 hours together. I arrived earlier than anticipated, but Sue, the assistant GM, welcomed me like family and went to great lengths to ensure that I could check in right away, even though it was before check-in time. I'm sure she and the housekeeping staff had to go to some measure of trouble to do so, but her professionalism and charming personality kept me from feeling like I had inconvenienced anyone. In reading other reviews, I see that others have commented that the property is not in a very good part of town. I travel extensively and work in the travel industry, and, while it is not in a resort or tourist area, it didn't seem too bad at all. I've definitely stayed in far worse locations, and know that even the nicest of resorts are plagued with vandalism now and then. (A good practice is to never leave valuables in your vehicle, no matter where you are.) The hotel is located within sight of I-17 and Bell Road, and I felt quite safe walking to a nearby Applebee's alone at dusk while waiting for my fiance' to arrive.

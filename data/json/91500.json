I didn't have a chance to eat at the 1881 restaurant as I spent the majority of my time at the hospital.

Marten House is very reasonably priced and as a result there aren't some perks a traveler might expect (shampoo comes in a packet) but my room had a refrigerator and coffee maker and a huge bed. The exercise room was better than I expected and should be acceptable to anyone who needs a quick workout during a stay. At least during the week, the restaurant closes at 9 pm, which was a bit too early for me during my stay. My room was clean and quiet and I would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs a hotel close to St. Vincent's.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perrysburg, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cAttended a conference\u201d", "Author": "babina8", "ReviewID": "UR118149484", "Content": "I attended a 2-day conference in November 2010 at this hotel. I didn't stay at the hotel, but I tried to -- it was completely booked when I checked about a month before the conference. I really wish I had been able to stay there, as it looked better than where I ended up finding a room, and it would have been extremely convenient. The conference center was very nice -- well equipped, updated, comfortable. No true meals were provided, but they did provide a small continental breakfast and snacks at breaks, which were fine -- not amazing, but I'd say a little better than expected at conferences. I'd definitely attend another conference here.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cHorrible experience\u201d", "Author": "wsa46041", "ReviewID": "UR37563689", "Content": "This was a horrible experience.

So, if that's what you're looking for, you need to head downtown. It may not be perfect like others have explained but the Marten House does care about their guests. Let me explain... If you're from Indiana, like myself, and have ever had a family member sent to St. Vincent Hospital (which is across the street from the hotel) to have open heart surgery, you have probably stayed at the Marten House. The Marten House offers family members a very good rate (if not free) to those who have family members who are having or had surgery. Most recently, a friend of mine had a premature baby and the Marten House is offering the parents 2 free nights a week until the baby is released to go home. It allows the family to be close by instead of having to commute each day, over 80 miles each way in this instance. I just really appreciate the service that's offered to the family members of those who are in the hospital.", "Date": "March 28, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Marten House Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g37209-d91500-Reviews-The_Marten_House_Hotel-Indianapolis_Indiana.html", "Price": "$70 - $109*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1801 W. 86th St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Indianapolis</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">IN</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">46260</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "91500", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b4/84/b484ff8fe730d1b906851fd5e64e417f1large.jpg"}}

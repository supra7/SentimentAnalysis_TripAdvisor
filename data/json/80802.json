I arrived a little over an hour ago. The room is great overall. I took pictures and will post them as well when I have a chance. I did not expect to be on my computer so quickly and trying to prove what the website said about Kimpton's Best Rate Guaranteed. I spent quite awhile at the check-in counter. First, I was astounded when I was told that the $25 food & beverage part of the offer was related to purchasing a room package. Second, the staff member got on the phone pretty quickly at that point to get someone else involved. That person was more like \"Charlie\" from the old \"Charlie's Angels\"...only a voice on the phone. He never came in person. Yet, the counter person told me that I should never have gotten the lower rate because I didn't book it at the 3rd party website...the website was bid-based like priceline or hotels.com. Then, he said they would allow me to keep the rate that I had already reserved and they would look into it more. I kept telling the guy this was on their own website. Later, I just got a call in my room telling me that \"this one time\", they would honor the rate and the $25 promise from the Kimpton website. I had the website up on my laptop & read it to the guy who had told me \"it was probably in the fine print\". He told me that the unnamed person he talked to has been with the hotel for many years doing reservations and had never heard of the website (venere.com) where I found the rate and the reservations person matched on the phone after verifying it herself. I came here anticipating a very fun and pleasant stay based on other reviews and the website. The management was responding to every review it seemed. That impressed me & I thought that that must mean a very responsive customer-focused place. Right now, I feel like they are still trying to say that I misread the guarantee, it doesn't say what it says, and I have no faith that it will be honored in the future since it was just \"this one time\". --- Sure, the robe is in the closet, the free wireless is there, and there is supposed to be a wine reception right now which I will go check out. But, feeling like I had to fight for something that is promised, and feeling like they think they did me a \"favor\" rather than acknowledging that I was informed & cared enough about giving this hotel my business that I actually read up on it.... I don't know... starting off this conference & vacation sourly. ===================================================== Going to go checkout after doing this.I have read reviews posted today by others yesterday...I wish my experience was same. I like the hotel and the wine reception. The towels are great. The housekeeper did more than was needed usually. Even though I would put towels up to keep, they would be changed. The thermostat was always turned off and the room would be cold when I returned at night. No biggie & easily remedied. 14th floor room - not spectacular view if looking for \"sites\"; but it was a nice view to wake up to. Some street sound is to be expected...nothing that interfered with sleep or anything like that. I thought back to check-in and how that went. The front desk guy acted like he did not know about playing a game to get something free or to make a charity donation if I lost. I had to explain it...then he said \"Oh oh yeah\". He would only do blackjack and then didn't know where the cards were which were right by his keyboard. When I lost, he didn't know about the SPCA or what the money was for or went to. Frankly, I wonder if he kept it. That is not the way I want to feel about a staff. The weather provided on the TV never worked. The Best Rate Guarantee...the restaurant didn't know what I was talking about. I added a day as I had expected. The key was extended by the front desk. However, when I got back to my room that night, it didn't work. When asking for a map at the concierge, they did not have any to provide. The guy said he would get one to me, and never did. The account summary on the TV worked the second day; but has not worked every other time I have tried including today. I am quite concerned that the rate for the extra day will not be what I was told it would be. I expect there will be issues with the $25 food/bev credit for the guarantee. This has been pretty unsettling when I think about these things and just want it all to be smooth. The location, cleanliness, noise, and all that were just fine. It is just a disappointing thing that I spent nearly double what some other colleagues have spent at nearby hotels and they felt things were much easier and smoother. So... really think about what you NEED to feel comfortable and good. If peace of mind with where you stay and no struggles are it...this is NOT going to be the hotel for you.

When signing up you let them know your preference of pillows, location of room etc. when we got to our room I was amazed that we had been put on the TOP floor, I was so pleased as I let them know I prefer higher floors. The rooms were so cozy,clean and warm. We did use the heater a couple of times and it worked well and quickly. Mini bar was great stocked with everything you need. I loved getting up in the morning and heading down stairs to the lobby where you could make up a coffee and sit down with it and ready a complimentary news paper (many of these) or take it on the road with you which we did many days. The men out the front would hail us a taxi and let us sit inside till they hailed one. My most favorite thing about this hotel was the thought if coming home to it after a long day of site seeing , every night we would arrive home the lovely men at the front would say \"welcome back\" such a nice touch. The beds were amazing!!! Plenty of closet space also. The hotel is in a great location also, within walking distance to many restaurants , a Walgreens and of course Union Square.

Close to market street means it is a bit far to the touristy locations of Fisherman's Wharf, Alcatraz, Pier 39, Embarcadero road etc. All the destinations are around 2 miles from the hotel.

We were hoping to have one, good day in the city. I have stayed at Kimpton hotels before and loved them, so I was willing to pay a little extra for the the Serrano Hotel for the joy of staying in a Kimpton. I had read reviews that there were bed bugs in this hotel, but I booked it anyway. First, I want to say that Kimpton has a strong reputation and for good reasons. Their free wine receptions are always fun, and overall their service is accommodating and friendly. The Sarrano is good in many ways--same fun wine reception, quirky decor, fairly friendly service, and good location. But I do think that some of the rooms are in some need upgrading. The paint is a bit worn and the fixtures, baseboards, and carpeting are in dire need of cleaning or replacing. The first room we were offered (unfortunately I cannot remember the room number) appeared nice. But I am terrified of bed bugs and check every room I stay in very thoroughly, and since I had read about reports of bugs in this hotel I was determined to check it. The mattress appeared clean, but when we took the headboard off, we found bug casings and eggs. It looked as if the eggs had been killed--in fact, we didn't find any live bugs, but finding dead bugs and eggs was upsetting enough for me. Bed bugs are a sad reality in today's world, and they do not discriminate based on whether a hotel is one or five stars. They are not the result of a dirty hotel, but careless travelers who bring them into the hotel. BUT, if a hotel has had a bug problem in the past, CLEAN IT UP. I think Serrano has treated the problem rooms and we found the aftermath of the extermination (no live bugs, just dead remains), but I WISH they had cleaned the room up after the exterminators were there. Even finding dead bugs was enough to give me the heebejeebes and make my skin crawl. I promptly called the front desk, saying that it appeared there had been a bed bug problem in this room and I wanted to be moved to another room as far from this one as possible where no guests have complained of bugs in the past. The woman at the front desk was polite and said she's send someone up to move us because she wanted me to be as comfortable in my room as possible. And we searched the second room even more thoroughly, and we found nothing--no dead bugs or live bugs. We had a clean room, but I still didn't sleep well that night. I still think Kimpton hotels are wonderful, quirky, and worth staying in, but I strongly recommend that after a bug problem, especially a bed bug problem, the Serrano Hotel should read up on where these little critter like to hide, and send their housekeeping staff in to clean the crap out of the rooms after the bugs have been killed. I totally understand that bed bugs happen, but once a hotel gets rid of them, they should clean up. So, I don't think I'd discourage someone from staying here, but I would suggest searching your rooms before unpacking. In fact, I'd recommend any traveler do that no matter what hotel he/she is staying in. And I think once Serrano does a good clean of the rooms, this place will once again be a gem in San Francisco.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bethany, Canada", "Title": "\u201cI was duped\u201d", "Author": "Kempka", "ReviewID": "UR125531941", "Content": "Lovely potential however didn't deliver.

The lobby is attractive, and features free tea/coffee and free wine for one hour each evening. If you join the hotel's rewards programme, you get free easy-to-connect wifi throughout the hotel. We also got complementary continental breakfast vouchers, valid at the adjoining restaurant - and the food was pretty good. However, my room was tiny, barely larger than the queen-sized bed. There was no desk, which is a serious omission for your average business traveller, and very little floor space to spread luggage around. My colleague, who paid the same rate, did get a desk and more space - so presumably you can demand something bigger if you don't mind making a fuss. Another annoying feature was the glowing light switches. Presumably they are lit to help you find them in the dark, but in my opinion they are far too bright. Given the tiny dimensions of the room, it was like being surrounded by a row of candles all night. Another couple of things: the television was at the side of the bed, making it difficult to view from the bed; and there was a surprisingly large gap between the toilet and the toilet roll dispenser (fortunately I'm quite tall!).

I found a bellman in front of the hotel who held a space in the street in front of the hotel for our car while I called my friend to let her know there was now parking space in front of the hotel. A little stressful, but we arrived safe and sound. This hotel is in an old building, but it is well maintained for the most part. Our suite was large and clean... housekeeping does a good job, and they were always very friendly. While the room had no view (but we didn't need one or care) other than the adjacent building walls, it had plenty of light. The King Bed was fine, but the sofa bed (which we also needed to use) was horribly uncomfortable. It sagged in the middle and many of the springs were painfully noticeable. The bathroom was HUGE with a jacuzzi tub, great showerhead and plenty of towels. The bell staff was great every time we called upon them. Prompt, professional and always with a smile! While the front desk staff were all very friendly, they were understaffed. There was never more than one person working the front desk during our weekend stay. The phone was ignored often... from our call during our arrival at 7:30PM on a Friday night (rang 30+times and then went to a message saying no one was available... we called from our room for our car and a bellman before our departure to have the same thing happen. It rang and rang and rang for at least 20-30 times before someone answered. I think that was my biggest peeve is that we were ignored when we were in need. We also had called the night before arrival to have our Kimpton In-Touch membership number added to our reservation. We were assured all was taken care of, yet our Kimpton number was not on our reservation when we arrived. Even after adding it, our kids were never offered the ammenities upon arrival that Kimpton advertises... but the front desk lady who was working the next AM, who was especially friendly and attentive, caught us and asked if the kids had gotten anything (GREAT -- nice catch!)... the kids were thrilled to pick out light-up yo-yos, which we asked to have delivered to our room since we were on our way out into the City. Unfortunately, the yo-yo's never were delivered to our room. We asked about them upon check-out and were promptly given new ones. We have no idea what happened to the originals? Our price break was great, and I felt even better about our stay given I was sharing room costs with a friend, and it was a busy weekend in the City with most hotels sold out or priced high, but we got what we paid for. Overall the hotel was fine for our quick weekend trip, but given the level of service we experienced, it would not be among my top choices for a return visit.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queensland", "Title": "\u201cA Quirky Hotel with Character\u201d", "Author": "Imation", "ReviewID": "UR119240893", "Content": "We originally were reccomended to stay at the Hotel Monaco (another Kimpoton Hotel) but it was booked out.

This hotel has a restaurant inside, which is nice so you don't have to go out looking for a place to eat, but it doesn't have many offerings. It is also very loud. The rooms in the hotel remind me of a hotel from the 1930's. The furnishings are kind of funky and they just seem like something that would've been around way back when. The beds are comfy and it actually had a pillow that didn't flatten out like the majority of pillows in other hotels tend to do. The rooms and the bathrooms are pretty small. The bathrooms have pedastal sinks and so there really isn't any room to spread out your stuff. My room had a shelf above the sink but it was full of things that belonged to the hotel such as a tissue dispenser, soap dish, glasses, etc. There was another small glass shelf in the bathroom but it was up kind of high and was small, too, so I couldn't put much on it. The sides of the bathtub in my room were up high so I had to lift my leg high to get in. The corners of the bathtub are curved and so when I took a shower the water would hit my shampoo and other bottles and because of the curved corners, my bottles would slide down into the tub and float in the water. My first night in the hotel was very quiet, which was nice because I am a light sleeper. I slept through the whole night and didn't wake up once. During my second night, I was woken up at about 2:00 a.m. because some guy was yelling outside of the hostel across the street. He continued yelling for awhile then took off running down the street. This hotel is not close to Fisherman's Wharf or the Golden Gate Bridge so if you want a hotel in that area don't stay at this hotel.

You can sign up for their hotel club to get free internet but the internet connection is horrible. I signed up for the club and the internet connection worked for about five or ten minutes and then I lost the connection. I kept trying to get back on but it would either say that there was a connection error or it kept trying to charge me to connect.

The room was amazing, the bed was soooo comfy! We felt like we could have spent our whole vacation just hanging out in the room and we would've been happy! Also when we arrived there was a playpen set up for my son and a highchair with a beautiful teddybear holding a welcome card addressed to our son! What a nice suprise!

I had been in touch with the manager JP to ask a few questions before we got there, and he always had prompt responses and was more than helpful! I was a little worried about the area and being there with a baby, but we had no problems. As long as you don't go to the streets behind the hotel, you are in safe territory!

We've never experienced bed bugs. We quickly packed (it was a quick overnight trip) and went downstairs to check out and inform front of house that they had issues with bed bugs. What we experienced at that point was disbelief and utter rudeness. My cousin tried to show the staff member who checked us out (Pam Davis) her bites, but she would have none of it and quickly dismissed our complaints in an extremely rude manner. In the meantime, my 3 year old daughter has bites, as does my mom. All in all, there were 5 of us in two rooms, and eveyone has bites on their legs! The manager (Jana Syquia) was at least cordial, but she was indifferent to our plight and her only comment was to fill out a report. Ridiculous! Clearly, the staff at the Serrano do not care about their customers because by not taking us seriously and just looking at our legs for themselves, they are going to continue renting bed bug infested rooms 503 and 507 (and who knows how many other rooms) to unsuspecting travelers with bed bugs.

We had a corner room with barely enough room to walk around the bed let alone lay your suitcase out. Also, itt was suppose to have a city view, our city view was billboard of a guy smiling right at us. The elevators are really difficult during heavy traffic times because of their size and people trying to fit their luggage. The darkness of a the hotel gives it a bit of a run down feeling. Now the positives, they do have a wine hour which is great and the customer service we had at the front desk and from the doorman was excellent. I think it is 3 stars all around....

The wine evenings between 5pm - 6pm are a super idea for people to mix and have a chat and unwind. If you have any questions at all the bell boys are a fantastic help and are only too willing to explain how to find your way to places or grab you a taxi whenever you need one.

Our stay in the Serrano Hotel was ok but not great because of a couple of things. First the pros: I was a little worried about the location after reading some of the earlier reviews but we felt extremely safe around the hotel area. The room was small but I could understand it, this being San Francisco. Good eateries (True Blue cafe, Nan n Curry), BART and the tram lines are very conveniently located. The wine social at 5 pm was great and so was the easy check-in and check-out. The door man welcomed us back each time we came back to the hotel. Cons: For some reason, the AC in the room was not great. It felt like it wasn't working well. We woke up a couple of times in the night to reduce the temperature further to get it to work again. Our worse experience was with the concierge. The concierge (Stephen per his name tag) was not helpful and was very rude. The morning we started from the hotel to the airport (Friday morning 5/8), we went by the concierge's desk and asked Stephan to book us a shuttle to the airport. He asked my name to note it down and for some strange reason, doesnt like my last name, saying that it was too confusing for him (even though I was spelling it for him)!! So he strikes my name out and asks for a - I am quoting him here - 'simple name like Smith'. We thought this was extremely rude and insulting considering that international customers visit this hotel and they have last names other than 'Smith' but we didn't want to make a big fuss out of it and were eager to get going. My girlfriend gives him her last name and he tells us that the noon shuttle will be at 12:35 pm. We thought that this was because of the shuttle running late and so when we were at the check-out around noon, we were surpised to see another hotel employee (a tall guy with a hat) come by and tell us that we missed our shuttle. So my girl friend and I tell him that we were told that the shuttle was at 12:35 and not at noon. When the concierge is approached, he says that he told us that it was noon and that the 12:35 time was when the shuttle would reach the airport. I could understand that there was a miscommunication and all it would have taken for them to right the situation is to make alternate arrangements (like booking us on the next shuttle). But the focus of Stephen was more on making sure that he shows us that he was correct and the two of us heard it wrong. He sends the other guy into some room, to make alternate arrangements we thought, but he comes out with the paper that the concierge had filled out to show us that he had noted the time for the shuttle ride as noon. So instead of helping us find alternate transportation, Stephen is engaged in proving us wrong! Finally we ask him to make alternate arrangements and the concierge starts calling other shuttles and tells us that they had another shuttle between 12:45 and 1 pm. We declined and told him to get us a cab. However the second gentleman comes along and gets us into a private taxi service and tells the taxi driver to charge us the same $15 per person rate. The taxi guy was very courteous and went above and beyond what was expected of him. The attitude and, may I say, lack of professionalism shown by the concierge Stephen(who has communication issues for sure and is a grumpy person with no smile on his face at anytime we saw him) left a sour taste in the mouth. This hotel prides itself on exceptional service and so it is indeed very disconcerting and insulting when you find unhelpful staff like this. On a scale of 1-5, I will give this hotel a 2, mainly because we felt our expectations of a friendly, professional service did not come true.", "Date": "May 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cI would definetly return to this classy Hotel\u201d", "Author": "adey666", "ReviewID": "UR29898728", "Content": "Stayed here for four nights and would recommend this hotel to anyone.

From the moment i entered the lobby i was greeted with a smile and felt at home. I had asked for an upgrade when i reserved on line and my request was accomodated. the room was large and very well appointed. Mgt greeted me with a bottle of ferrarelle, chocolate and a welcome card. The staff at this hotel was outstanding, from the front desk, to house keeping, to the door man (not once have i had to open the door to the lobby). The wine hour (5-6pm nightly) was a nice touch, allowed you to mingle with hotel guests in a very confortable environment. Ponzu, the hotel restaurant, was awesome. they offer a great happy hour, great appetizers and drinks for $3 seven days a week (a shout to Emily at Ponzu, thank you for being such a doll and taking care of me) Many of the reviews i had read mentioned location..it is true that the hotel is on the edge of union square and the tenderloin (just like the hilton, across the street and the Clift), with that in mind, I never had a problem walking around a night. The homeless issue is a well known problem in all major cities, I prefer to be reminded of this problem, rather than believing that we live in a society where all are equal. I highly suggest this hotel if you are looking for a place with character and great service. I will stay here again on my next trip.

This lovely hotel is close to Union Square, all the shops, some lovely diners and bars and we actually even walked to fishermans wharf! It was also perfect for us to hit the ground running on our nightlife spots in America, with some of the cool nightclubs either within walking distance or a short taxi ride away(happily arranged by the lobby staff) Upon walking into the hotel you're met with a beautiful lobby with a classic design and plenty of space. The lobby staff were really helpful(especially Trey) and the reception staff were great too (Hom and Catherine especially). We were given a lovely room which met all our requests and our luggage was bought up to our room. To be honest, every single call I made downstairs was helpfully and decisively addressed. The room service was perfect, as was the restaurant where we had breakfast a few mornings. The hotel have a lovely evening 'drink and greet' session between 5-7 which is really nice to sit down, have a nice glass of wine and meet some of the other hotel guests (some of which we became quite friendly with). All our excursion ideas were assisted with, and we were also given assistance on some important calls we had to make for our excursions coming up in Vegas.

I don't have a budget but wanted to impress the boss with my sub-$150/night bill. Before the taxes and fees that every big city charges, my rate from hotel.com was $118. Not as good as others have gotten at the Serrano but for SF, this close to the convention center, nice shopping, cable cars, Chinatown and public transportation.... a steal. Yes, it's on the edge of the Tenderloin and yes it's a little skeevy here and there but it doesn't hurt those of us that are fortunate enough to be able to travel for ANY reason to beautiful cities like SF to not be able to ignore (as I can in my home in the suburbs) that there are much less fortunate people in this world. I will add that I walked nearly everywhere and on ill-advised trip to a club at night through some pretty scary areas (down Taylor to 6th to Folsom for those of you familiar) but I was not once bothered by any of the many \"street people that I passed. Each morning as I walked to the Moscone, I was asked for change or coffee money but was not followed or harassed. My Queen Deluxe on the fourth floor was smaller than I've stayed in at Sheraton Four Points and Hilton Garden Inns in Chicago for example, but I was traveling alone. However if my wife would have accomapnied me, we might have had a tiny bit trafffic trouble getting dressed and inand out of the bathroom. Overall, though, clean and comfortable. I like chain hotels because you have in-room microwaves, fridges and coffee. I love food and I would have love to have tried a few more things while dining out to be able to put a couple things in the fridge to warm-up later. But the fridge in the room was stocked with the minibar items and useless for leftover storage. The cleaning staff seemd to be pretty stingy with the toiletries by other standards, although in five nights, I never completely ran out of anything. As I said, I lke chain hotels for their amenities, but one thing I haven't experienced since I stayed at the FOur Seasons was the extremely high quality of the pillows and bed linens at the Serrano. They were as good or nearly as good as what you would put on your bed at home. Excellent and really lends to a good nights sleep when you remember the awful stuff that most places have. I would have preferred wireless internet in-room but I could wire-up with the provided ethernet cable. I found out after a couple of days that I could get a half decent wireless signal in the room (from downstairs, I guess.) If you need to print boarding passes, i guess you ask staff and they'll do it for you (someone else posted that they were successful getting the staff to do this) whatever the case, there is no quesiton that the the Business Center is a rip-off. I printed my boarding passed at the Marriott that was hosting my convention. Television was a new flat screen LCD, but of course if you're used to watching HD at home, they don't have HD in the rooms and only basic cable. Movies on pay per view cost a fortune ($16, I think) which is outrageous). The fish eye lenses that the tour pics of the Serrano are shot with are very successful in making the rooms and lobby look bigger than they are. So don't be surprised, the lobby is the size of someone's large living room. Everyone on the staff was very courteous and helpful. Yes, Stephan is very good (if a little condescending) and gave me flawless bus directions to the Golden Gate. I've given what look like criticisms for a very good rating but I just want you to know that if you want UNIVERSALLY attentive and helpful staff, clean comfortable rooms, high speed internet, and coffee in the lobby. This place realy can't be beat. If you can't have a nice stay without premium cable, a microwave or a free place to print documents, try one of the big chains. I'd go back to the Serrano.

We were in SF to celebrate our 40th birthday's and decided a girls getaway weekend and chocolate tour were just what year 40 called for! We found the Serrano Hotel to be well appointed. The 2 double bed room was fair in size and the beds & bedding were quite comfy and clean! The bathroom was large enough to comfortably move around, shower and have space for your clothes & supplies. The room also came with 2 bathrobes for guests to use which was a nice touch. We enjoyed the tea service each morning but were never around to enjoy the wine reception in the afternoon. As for the location, I thought it was pretty center to alot of shopping, transportation and restaurants. I knew in advance, from previous trips to SF, that parking would be pricey so we did not even bother to rent a car and instead rode the BART from the airport to the Powell St. Station to get to the Serrano...which was roughly 4 blocks away. I also investigated in advance the SF MUNI system so we each purchased a 3-day MUNI pass for $18 to ride as many bus & cable cars we wanted/needed to during our stay. The MUNI pass was awesome because we didn't have to worry about having exact change to ride each time, we just showed the driver our passes, and in reality with all of the public transportation we used we ended up using about $27 in transportation fees had we used cash instead of the pass. What made the pass even handier was the MUNI kiosk that sells the 3-day Muni passes was just outside the Powell St. BART station, so we purchased our passes even before we initially walked to the Serrano. If there was one downside at the Serrano it was that we couldn't print off our boarding passes because the single business center computer was not working properly; the day we left we had to ask the concierge to print off our passes for us, which he did without issue. If there were but one issue I had with the hotel was that if you actually wanted to use the business center computer for anything other than to print boarding passes it was that it cost you $5.95 for 15 minutes of internet use and 49 cents per page printed. I thought that cost was a bit excessive for guest use. We also enjoyed the Ponzu restaurant. We ate there during happy hour & enjoyed some happy hour food specials and had a beverage or 2. We met two kind & funny women from other parts of the country while dining at Ponzu, one from Texas the other from Virgina, we enjoyed great conversation & laughs with them!! Hey, Marti & Kelly!!

Tbe only thing that I can say that I did not like about hotel, was the dirty windows on the 16h Floor. We overloked the Hilton and O'Farrell Street. Got a couple of good pix from the window, so it was not a great big thing.

The TV didn't work on one machine and the incline didn't work on the other. My biggest complaint is something the hotel can't do much about - location, location, location. It's NOT at Union Square. When we pulled up in the cab, our driver told us not to walk around the outside of the hotel. Basically it was a rough neighborhood, heard it called the Tenderloin, along with a lot of homeless. We did walk to the street car once, which isn't through the worst part, but as a young woman I probably wouldn't do it alone.

Upon arrival to our suite, our bed had flower petals spread out on it, a chilled bottle of champagne waiting for us and some chocolates. What a great way to start the valentines day weekend! The following day we moved into the ACT theater suite which was awesome and unique(the only one in the building) I felt extremely fortunate that Mr.Lukinov was so generous on this stay, I can not thank him enough, and was lucky enough to do it at wine hour, as I asked the young man serving the wine if he could tell me Mr.Lukinov's work hours, only to find out I was asking the man himself, and he knew exactly who I was. Stefan at the concierge was very helpful and after getting our bags to our room upon check in, he asked for our names and throughout the stay referred to me as Mr.Omar. I have stayed at many of the city's kimpton hotels, such as the triton, sir francis drake,harbor court, and prescott, but my favorite is the Serrano. So much so, that I just booked a weekend return for my Birthday weekend in April! I had also recommended this hotel to two other couples who came up the same weekend and they had great things to say about the hotel! Wine hour from 5-6, and teas/coffees/etc in the mornings.

The location is prime, just three blocks from the action of Union Square, and a short walk from the Theater district on Geary Street. Service is exemplary. Artem at the front desk spoke twice with my wife about the occasion when we were making our bookings, and he attended to every detail that she asked about. Joe at valet parking knew that we were running late as we pulled up (how, I don't know, unless the front desk informed him that we were expected at a certain time). We walked into a room that had rose-petals arranged in a heart pattern on the sheets and a bottle of chardonnay cooling in a silver bucket. The room was spotless and incredibly comfortable. The clock radio accomodated my iPhone (so we had a personalized Pandora station) and the internet connection on the desk was complimentary high-speed DSL. We had forgotten toothpaste, and the front desk delivered a tube in seven minutes (yes, I timed it).

We found a wonderful rate through hotels.com for the Serrano Hotel, which is a Kimpton property. Knowing Kimpton's reputation and noting the fantastic location we decided to give the hotel a try and are we glad we did! Some reviews here suggest that the area is too criminal or threatening, esp. for women traveling by themselves, but we came and went after dark and never once felt threatened or afraid. We weren't even nervous. The Hilton and Nikko hotel are right around the corner and walking to and from Union Square along O'farrell is absolutely fine. Yes, you might be asked for change by someone along the way, but that can happen on almost any street downtown. The hotel itself was an easy walk from the BART station on Powell. The lobby is very cute and the decor for Christmas cheery. At the front desk, play a hand of blackjack with the clerk and if you win, you pick from a list of daily prizes (we got a bottle of wine delivered to the room). If you lose, donate to their animal charity. Check-in was fast. The elevators are tiny and on the slow side, but not annoyingly so. We had rooms with two doubles. The rooms are very small, but nicely decorated. Love the ipod docking alarm clock/radio, the down comforters and comfy beds. The flat panel TV was a nice touch also. The closet had ample room with iron/ironing board, plenty of hangers and cheetah-print robes for guest use. The bathroom again, was very tiny but well-stocked with Aveda bath amenities (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and two kinds of soap). I love not having to pack extra toiletries, so having nice products is a big plus. There is no counter space to speak of, but there is a narrow shelf running the length of the mirror. Enough room for toothbrushes, etc. The shower is really high on the wall, perfect for tall people. The water pressure is fine. The biggest surprise for us was the absence of street noise. Our room faced O'Farrell St. and we expected it to be loud, but we remarked every morning how quiet it had been the night before. I think we're used to putting up with noisy SF streets, so it was an unexpected surprise to have such quiet nights. We did not eat at the restaurant but did attend the wine reception one afternoon. For 1 hour each afternoon, there is a wine reception in the lobby with a choice of house red or white wine. Check out a board game from the many choices at the front desk and relax. It's a lot of fun and a good time to meet other guests. There is also coffee and tea available every morning. The staff was always friendly and helpful.

Internet available in hotel room and lobby. Coffee and tea available free in lobby in morning. Wine hour late afternoon. Doorman great with directions. Play a quick game of blackjack when you check in and you might get a free continental breakfast. Pet friendly, restaurant on site but lots of restaurants within walking distance not to be missed. They include Taylor Street Cafe and Doris' for breakfast. Trust me. They're good and reasonable. Expect about a 45 min wait at Doris', worth it. Try Max's for dinner. Also Daily Grill is close. Lots of sushi and Indian eateries nearby. Didn't try them, maybe next trip. A few things I think could be improved. Although they offer coffee in lobby, would like a small pot in room, just to get you off the dime while you're waking up. They need a brand of soap that lasts longer. Parking is expensive, valet service about $45 a day. You don't need a car plus there's nowhere to park in city. About the area, yes, there are a lot of homeless. There are also a lot of tourists. This hotel is on fringe of Tenderloin district but just use common sense and you should be fine. It's also extremely close to one of the main cable car stations, Union Square, shopping, food, the Westfield Mall (love the food court there). And no big hills to negotiate. Serrano is just across from the Hilton so there are always plenty of taxis nearby. Overall, where we stay is a big part of the success of our trips. In this case, the Serrano is our first choice.

I saw the rates for $104.88 per night on travelocity, so I decided to book via the hotel website itself incase i wanted to cancel for a better rate if available at the Westin. When I called in to request for a rate, they gave me $140+. I then asked why it was so high compared to what I saw on travelocity, and they put me on hold for a quick minute and then responded with \"we will match that\". I think that alone is very decieving as they were able to knock off $40 per night for us within 1 min. Second - although you see all the reviews of this location being in a convenient spot, at night, this street is pretty quiet and so is the intersection where the Hilton is located. There also seems to be more homeless people loitering around this area compared to others. Third - This hotel will charge you $50 (believe this is some insurance charge) each night you stay on top of the room rate. This will be deducted from your form of payment and supposedly will be returned back to your account. Either right after check out or 48 hours after check out. Which is fine if they actually return the money back to you. Fourth - When my boyfriend and I checked in, the person at the front desk gave us two key cards that did not even work for our hotel room PLUS charged us TWICE for our stay and didn't even acknowledge what he did. My boyfriend didn't know either until he looked at his online statement - thankfully for that. When we notified the front desk of this situation, all they did was apologize and contacted their accounting dept who unfortunately told us they couldn't even do anything. So I stepped in and asked, if you are going to return our $50 insurance charge per night upon our check out, why can't you return the second charge as this is not a valid charge? They could not even give me an answer nor did they try to resolve it. So finally, the next front desk person we spoke with said she will try the accounting dept. again and give us a call the following business day, Monday (we left on a friday). At this point - it is now Thursday, no refund was made nor did they even bother contacting us. I believe they are waiting and expecting us to dispute the charge from the bank which is completely insane and the transaction and investigation for the dispute will take weeks compared to just a refund from the hotel itself - we have already notified them of this delay and nothing has been done. This amount was a lot too and he had used his debit card. Fifth - They give you keys for the bar which is located in the tv shelf. They tell you the keys are for the bar and make it sound like anything from the bar is complimentary. I first thought the drinks/snacks were complimentary but they don't mention you have to pay for everything until you ask - nor do they leave a sign anywhere about it compared the other hotels I've stayed at. Conclusion - Hotel was really small, pictures of the hotel gave a much bigger and nicer impression of the hotel until we walked in it. The next time I visit, I think I will stay at the Westin and pay 50 dollars more for just the convenience, safety, security, bigger room and a staff who can provide even an ounce of satisfaction to their guests.

I would have preferred to be closer to Union Square because this hotel is right on the cusp of the Tenderloin district and there were so many homeless people approaching us that the location made us very uneasy. When you depart the hotel everything that is of interest is to the right, up the hill toward Union Square approx. 3 blocks. The hotel sits right on the corner of Taylor Street and Powell, so it is in close proximity of the Mission/Powell trolley embarkation spot.

All related hotels host evening wine/beer hours in the lobby, which is a very nice perk. Check-in was unbelievably smooth. I had been staying at another Kimpton (Hotel Triton) earlier in the week and checked out at noon before walking the 1/3 mile to the Serrano. I fully expected to not be able to check in, but I had hoped to at least leave my luggage before heading out again. Much to my surprise, I was greeted warmly and given my preferred room immediately. My room was on the 12th floor and had a so-so view east of Union Square. My room was wonderful--decadently comfortable queen sized bed, sufficent armoire and tv, and decent bathroom with bath/shower combo and Aveda products. The rooms aren't large, but you are hard-pressed to find large rooms in the middle of San Francisco. The room was spotless and was immaculately tended to each morning by housekeeping. I'm a member of the loyalty program with Kimpton, which includes a \"gift\" upon each arrival. When I arrived to my room, I found a 16 oz. bottle of spring water and a small box of Napa-produced truffles. Very nice touch. The concierge assisted me twice--once to arrange shuttle transportation to the airport and another time to make reservations for my party at a nearby restaurant. Each time, Chad was most gracious and helpful. My only complaint was with room-service from the adjacent restaurant (Ponzu). On my last morning there, I ordered breakfast and was told delivery would take place within 30 minutes. After 55 minutes, I called to inquire about the order since my shuttle was due to pick me up in 45 minutes. I was told that the kitchen was backed up and my order would not be ready for at least another 25 minutes. I emphasized that I had been conveyed different information when I placed the order and that I would need to cancel the order due to my shuttle. Within 5 minutes, I had a knock at the door and my breakfast was ushered into the room. The restaurant manager had delivered it and then told me it was on the house. In spite of the frustration of waiting, I felt it had been handled very well. One final note: many reviewers have commented/complained about the large number of transients in the area. San Francisco is a large city and the Serrano Hotel is located in the middle of it all. Unfortunately, homelessness is a very sad reality of city life in the United States. I did not encounter one hostile transient during my entire stay. I felt completely safe and comfortable (and spent much of my time alone). Homelessness makes much of us uncomfortable--and it should. But it is not a threatening issue that should dissuade visitors from staying in the Union Square area.

The beds are comfortable and the staff is friendly. It is certainly adequate. It is just far from luxurious. If you are from Europe, you will be very satisfied with the room sizes. If you are used to U.S. hotel room sizes, you will be extremely disappointed. The bathroom was so small, I kept bumping my head and other body parts just turning around in it.

We have kept coming back because the experience is fun, and because as return stayers there is such a nice \"welcome back\". Not this time... The bellman is great, friendly, he knows who you are just by teling him where you are coming from. At check-in we were asked if this was our first time staying at the hotel. I told the man that this was our 4th time, and asked if our Kimpton In-Touch loyalty number was attached to our reservation in the computer (I thought maybe it was not showing up in the computer that we were return customers because the loyalty number was not attached to the reservation). He said that our loyalty number was attached to the reservation. We proceeded to the room. In the past, there has always been a nice note and some treats (cookies, drinks, small bottle of wine) in the room welcoming us back as loyal, returning guests. There was nothing there. I thought maybe something would be coming later. Nope...nothing. So, again, I thought maybe our number is really not attached to our reservation. The following morning I went to the front desk and let them know that we usually have a little something waiting in our room as in-touch loyalty members, and nothing was there, so I just wanted to double check that the loyalty number was in the computer. The woman checked and just simply said \"Yes, it's there.\" I guess I have been spoiled, but I was disappointed that there was nothing waiting for us, and no special welcoming feel this time. We were going to head out for the day (around 8 am) and got some change from the front desk. The woman then said she would try to send up something for us, inquired where we were from, made small talk. I thought that was nice and we would have something when we get back. Nope! When we returned, the room was clean, but no goodies were there. Got back around 2 pm and took a nap. Was awoken with a knock at the door at around 4 pm. A woman handed me a bottle of water and a little box with 2 chocolates...not exactly the same touch as before. At check-out the next morning, the same woman at the front desk who the previous day looked in the computer for our loyalty number asked me if I wanted to sign up to join Kimpton In-Touch. I told her we are already members, is the number not there? (She just checked on this for me the day before) She said, oh yes, the number is here. She asked us if we have stayed at the hotel before. I told her this was our 4th visit. The hotel was not busy at all, so I was confused as to how so many staff members at the front desk didn't have a clue about anything. I booked the reservation though the Kimpton website after logging in with my loyalty number, so I was expecting to receive all the perks that go along with that. Instead, I felt like we were treated as if we booked through Priceline or something (I should have done that--I would have gotten a better deal, and the same service). I am normally not a complainer--but I definitely feel like the experience for the return customer is different now than it was in the past. I think the front desk needs some help. There are lots of hotels in SF Union Square and the reason I would return to the Serrano was consistent service where I felt they recognized repeat customers.

We had never stayed at the Serrano Hotel before, but since it is part of the Kimpton boutique hotel chain that my wife and I enjoy, we thought that we'd give it a try. I booked our King Deluxe room via the Kimpton website for $126 per night (plus tax), a rate that I thought was very reasonable for downtown San Francisco. We arrived Thursday night at 10 pm during the worst winter storm of the season (our flight from Canada was delayed 3 hours due to the storm conditions in San Francisco). Unfortunately, after a long trip getting to San Francisco, we did not get the warm Serrano Hotel welcome advertised on many web pages and websites. Don't get me wrong, everyone was decent to us, but there was no offer of a game of 21 to upgrade our room (as mentioned in the bedside book in our room), and the concierge desk person was less than enthusiastic when I asked about any half-decent places to eat on a late Thursday evening in the immediate area (we had missed dinner due to the flight delay). Speaking of the immediate area around the Serrano Hotel, it is less than \"upscale.\" In fact, the neighbourhood, despite being only two blocks from Union Square and kitty-korner to the San Francisco Hilton, is what one might call \"Transitional.\" That is, by day the neighbourhood is okay, but come darkness, the streets are taken over by homeless people and panhandlers. Furthermore, the streets in the area are very dark, lacking sufficient municipal street lighting. Some people may find the idea of walking alone at night too scary to try... As for the Serrano Hotel itself, it is a three star property (based on the five star scale). Some websites refer to it as a four star property, but it is not! The lobby is nice and clean, with a feeling of the roaring 20s. Our room, a King Deluxe, was also clean and contained the blessed Kimpton King Size bed (there are no \"Tall Rooms\" at the Serrano Hotel). As always, we had excellent sleeps in the Kimpton bed, but our room was extremely small with a very plain and basic bathroom. We can only hope that one-day the Kimpton people will hear about flat screen Plasma and LCD television, and start installing 42 inch sets into their hotel rooms instead of the small 20 year old television sets they currently utilize. Other than our first night when we enquired about a local place to eat, we found the staff to be quite friendly, with many staff members going out of their way to say \"hello\" to us or to ask if we needed help with anything. The various concierge staff were excellent at arranging dinner reservations and taxis for us, while the cleaning staff did an excellent job of keeping our room clean and tidy. Overall, we rate our Serrano Hotel experience as okay, but not quite what we have come to expect from Kimpton properties. If one \"must\" stay in the Union Square area, then the Sir Francis Drake, also a Kimpton property, would be a much better choice. But our favorite Kimpton San Francisco area hotel remains The Argonaut Hotel at the corner of Jefferson and Hyde on Fisherman's Wharf. For just a few dollars more, The Argonaut Hotel is in a far superior class to the Serrano Hotel, and at The Argonaut Hotel you get the bonus of staying in an area of town that is fun, safe and filled with excellent tourist and eating options.", "Date": "January 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "west linn", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Serrano!\u201d", "Author": "texasgirl3", "ReviewID": "UR12334440", "Content": "This small boutique hotel provided us with the very personal service (\"How are you today, Mr. & Mrs. H?\") that makes you feel special.

It is in the \"theater district\", and near Nob Hill, SoMa--long story short it is pretty convenient to get just about anywhere in the downtown area and it is near Muni (bus/streetcar) lines that will take you further out towards Golden Gate Park, Haight/Ashbury, etc. This old building has been lovingly transitioned into a perfectly lovely hotel.

If you're not comfortable with homeless or panhandlers, its probably better to take taxis or stay at Fisherman's Wharf. We rented a car for one day, with a GPS navigator for an extra $12. Best $12 we ever spent. Don't rent a car without one. It's especially great because of all the one way streets in SF. The rest of the days there we used the public transportation. If you don't mind buses, this is a good deal. We spent $18 each for a 3 day muni-pass which allowed us access to all the buses, cables cars, and old time trolley cars. We went all over the city.

We also arranged for a late check-in, since we would be driving up from Los Angeles after work. We had confirmation online, as well as over the phone a few days earlier. When we arrived at the hotel at 2 in the morning after an extremely long drive, we were not greeted by any staff. We then proceeded to check in at the front desk, when the staff member simply looked at us and said, \"Nope. There's 4 of you, but we only have you down for a single room with 1 bed.\" We disagreed, and explained that we had Pre-Paid for a double room. We even showed him the itinerary and invoice we had printed online. He just shook his head and said, \"Nope.\" He told us that all of their double rooms have been booked. He never apologized, and even got defensive saying that this was not the hotel's fault. He did not try to accommodate us at all for their mistake. When we were about to leave, he hesitantly offered us 2 separate smoking rooms. We definitely did not want to take the smoking rooms, so he then offered a suite..but we would have to pay the difference in price. Why should we have to pay more for a suite after they gave up the room that we had already reserved AND paid for?! So fine, we were so tired, we just agreed to stay in the separate single rooms for that night. The next morning, after talking to the manager of housekeeping, we were moved to a double room with 1 bed and a sofa bed (which we had to call down to the front desk again because we had no blankets/pillows for the sofa bed). For our inconvenience, they also gave us a voucher for a continental breakfast for 2, even though there were 4 of us. Whatever. When we went to redeem our voucher in the morning, their restaurant had closed early without any notice, so we were not able to get our breakfast. Lastly, upon checking out, we noticed that they had charged us an extra $120 for a late check-in! We had already arranged for a late check-in prior, and had already paid for everything in advance, but they still tried to charge us when we were leaving!! Our stay was a complete disaster, and not a single staff member was at all apologetic for their mistakes, or friendly at all for that matter. DO NOT STAY AT THE SERRANO. They treated us as if we were trying to get something for free, when all we wanted was what we had paid for!

The staff, though cordial at check-in, essentially ignored my existence from then on. I was particularly surprised when, on two separate occasions, the doormen suggested that I catch a cab at the hotel on the next block rather than hailing one for me (not fun when it's cold and rainy). Desk space in the room was extremely small for the business traveler, and there is absolutely no shelf/counter space in the bathroom - though this is often true of city hotels. However, the lighting was about the worst I've ever encountered in a hotel - only one lamp on the desk and another beside the bed, leaving the other side of the room completely in the dark. It would have been impossible to read while sitting in the armchair. However, what bothered me most was the condition of my room. The carpet was absolutely filthy, turning my white socks grey in no time. The windows were horribly dirty as well - making me wonder if the place ever received anything more than a very superficial cleaning. This is quite a contrast from other Kimptons, wihch I've found to be impeccably clean. Also suprising was the fact that housekeeping didn't leave any new bars of soap, or replenish other toiletries, or empty water from the ice bucket, during my four night stay. To be fair, there were pluses: the location was great - a very short walk to Union Square and Market Street (Nordstrom/Bloomingdales); several restaurants within walking distance, including two Starbucks within a two-block range. I did not feel at all unsafe walking in the neightborhood. The room was quiet; I did not hear much street noise (though admittedly I was on an upper floor).

It was our first time at a Kimpton hotel and if we can afford it, we will certainly stay at Kimpton's in other cities in our future travels. The Serrano has so much character. It has been beautifully restored/maintained and is very clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful and we met a number of other guests and the manager at the complementary evening wine receptions. Other guests have commented on the proximity to the \"tenderloin\" (a less 'upscale' area of SF). I must admit that had me worried a bit prior to our arrival, but we felt safe walking to both union sq area and the fisherman's wharf area from the Serrano. The proximity to all we wanted to do in SF was exceptional. Interestingly, the Hilton is kitty corner from the Serrano - and one wouldn't often think of a Hilton being in a rough area..... Our room was very quiet (I took someone's advice and requested a room away from the elevator) and very clean. I know a number of guests have commented on the small bathroom - but how much room do you really need and I'd much rather it was clean than large. Around the corner (.5 block) on O'Farrell are a number of car rental places, so take everyone's advice and only rent a car for the days you want to travel outside of SF - as the parking is VERY expensive. Just as an FYI, the cable car line ups at both Union Sq. and at Fisherman's wharf are REALLY long.... So, listen to the advice of the locals and catch it at a stop along the way and save yourself some time and energy. It's one of those must do tourist things... SF is a great city to visit.

It took me a long time to choose one (they have like 12 in SF alone!), but we had a lovely time and were very happy. Both front desk managers were delightful. We stayed 2 nights and I booked the first night in their standard room and then the \"relax and rejuvinate\" package for the 2nd night. The package was a deal!! It was $249 and included a plush bathrobe to keep, an hour massage (for my husband - he did most of the driving) and included the spa suite - A huge room with sitting area (large with big sofa, tv cabinet, desk etc..), bedroom that had curtains to close it off and a HUGE spa tub in a giant bathroom. Yes, the regular rooms are small, and the bathroom is tiny (for American standards), but they are well appointed and very nice. We also had a high floor with a stunning view downtown. The spa suite did not have a good view, but the room was such a treat I didn't care. Our cats LOVED the spa suite and both had a delightful stay too! We skipped the wine reception (1st night we were headed to Gary Danko's for dinner and didn't have reservations, so we wanted to arrive early to sit at the bar - fantastic experience by the way - and then the second night we were too tired). Also, we did not order any of the games from their \"game menu\" to try, but it was cool to see that they had a nice selection. Also, did not order food there, we did have a late breakfast at the Monaco (another Kimpton hotel next door) at the Grand Cafe and their food was good. They made a nice plum belini which we both thought was yummy.

We had booked the room directly through their website, and secured a 'hot dates' rate of $99 per night. We planned to stay in San Franscico for 5 nights as the first leg of our 2-week California stay, so we definitely wanted something not too pricey but hopefully nice. The Serrano definitely fit this criteria. The lobby area of the hotel is interesting & tasteful; I loved the decor of this area (sort of chic vintage Morroccan...perhaps a bit Casablanca-like & old Hollywood), with all sorts of interesting things to look at. The bedrooms had a similar theme and were really quite lovely. Ours was on the fifth floor and didn't have a great view (basically the side of a concrete building) and the room wasn't terribly large, but we didn't spend much time there anyways. Contrary to what other reviews have mentioned, our bathroom was actually quite spacious, although the shelving for toiletries is a little limited (they provided Aveda toiletries, by the way, which was very nice). The tub was fairly deep although I was disappointed because it was a little short for my long legs (I am 5'10\")!! The linens on the bed were lovely, I found the bed very comfortable, there was a spacious walk-in closet, terry cloth robes & a huge mirror on the wall by the bed. Although we didn't buy anything (the hotel is less than a block away from a Walgreens), there was a nice selection in the mini-bar. The location of the hotel is actually quite good. Some people have complained about homeless and feeling unsafe, but I think this is a bit ridiculous. This hotel is in a very busy, bustling area of the city, full of shops and restaurants, so as long as you don't stray too far south (and you should be able to tell immediately when you have done so because things start to get shady), you'll be fine. There are always lots of people around, even at night. For breakfast, I would recommend two places: David's Delicatessen (around the corner) and the Taylor St. Coffee Shop (just down the block.) David's is a Jewish deli with 1950's style diner seating, and cooks up a mean set of Fresh Apple Pancakes and Scrambled Eggs with lox...I am getting hungry just thinking about it! But this place is a bit pricey; my boyfriend ate here several mornings with our bill totalling over $30. More reasonably priced (we saved about $10 each time we ate here) is the Taylor St. Coffee Shop. This place is smaller but very friendly. The kitchen is in the open at the front of the restaurant and every member of staff thanked us as we left each morning. My favorite was a super yummy entre of eggs with guacamole, bacon bits, tomato and hashbrowns for $6.99 - great value. Also serve a fantastic fresh OJ. This place has a retro feel with photos of Marilyn, James Dean & other classic stars adorning the walls. But back to the Serrano - I think the excellent staff and the attention to customer service is one of the biggest ways this hotel is a standout. We were ALWAYS greeted by a member of staff upon entering the hotel, and even the staff taking luggage up or downstairs on the elevator were friendly enough to say hello and strike up short conversations. We missed the wine tasting one evening by a few minutes and the concierge overseeing it (didn't catch his name) was nice enough to bring us up our own bottle!!! This hotel has obviously made customer service a top priority and it shows, blowing most hotels I have stayed with out of the water.

We came back just before 3pm (check-n time) and spent another 25 minutes while the receptionist tracked down a room that had been cleaned. The following day we experienced a similar problem. We left at 9am and returned at 3pm only to find that maid service had not yet cleaned our room. She did appear at 3:45 which meant we had to leave the room while she cleaned. Aside from the bellmen, we did not find the staff to be overly friendly. There was coffee and tea served from 7-9am but the urns didn't seem to be replenished often. Both mornings I came downstairs at 8am to find the coffee urn empty. The location is a bit sketchy. I'll give it high marks for being around the block from Dottie's True Blue Cafe. However, it's also on the boarder of the Tenderloin. Needless to say, it's not a great area to walk around after dark. Overall our stay at the Serrano was just OK.

This hotel was great, and I recommend it to anyone. It is centrally located 3 blocks from Union Square and is clean and quiet. The Serrano Hotel, by contrast, although also a Kimpton Hotel, was very disappointing. My negative experience began with the reservationist who booked a King Room for us, I doubly confirmed this because I knew that the city was extremely booked at this time. When we checked in, the woman at the front desk was thoroughly overwhelmed and seemed anxious. She was very rushed and curt. Also, when we arrived we found our room to have only a queen sized bed instead of a king, and the room felt so cramped we were feeling clausterphobic as soon as we walked in. The bathroom was clean, in good working order, and had nice ammenities and fixtures but it too felt cramped. The room we stayed in was on the 4th floor and it was rectangular in shape, the foot of the queen sized bed reached the wall, not leaving much room around it. The comforter has loose threads and appeared worn, and the sheets looked dusty and had lint on them. It was extremely noisy in the area from construction and the windows did not block out any of the noise. We immediately called the front desk to inquire, and they left us on hold for so long that the line disconnected, and when I called again, another woman said the original person was on hold with someone else and she would have them call us back. However, we did not receive a call back for ten minutes so we decided to get out of the room and go to the front desk immediately. When we inquired about why we were given a queen room, we were told that all the king rooms had been booked. I assured her that we had booked a king room and she said there was nothing she could do about it. When I told her that we would like to check out and find another hotel, she said that was fine but that our credit card would be charged anyways for the stay and that there was nothing she could do about it. When I asked to speak with the original reservationist, he did some research and told us that they had no king rooms available, but that one might open up later, but they couldn't promise anything. I explained that he had not told us this from the beginning and that we should be able to leave without getting charged, since it had been their mistake. He finally said the manager would take care of us and let me go. Pam, the fron desk manager, apologized profusely and I overheard her on the phone booking restaurant reservations for a guest and she seemed wonderfully helpful. She was the only positive experience in the 45 minutes I spent in the hotel. All of that being said, if you are willing to spend $215+ during peak season for a small queen room that has a Victorian feel in the lobby, then these are the benefits: *4 blocks to Union Square *Attentive Bellman (At least the one who was there at the time, he was the only one who asked if he could be of any help) *Game tables in the lobby, a fireplace and a restaurant (we did not eat there) *Some of the higher rooms may have nice views, we were told that they did by the reservationist because they have more than 17 floors *Pam, the front desk manager, who seemed very interested in making everyone's stay a great one *Updated bathroom *Victorian feel I would definitely recommend the Hotel Palomar over Serrano, we paid less for more space, better customer service, and awesome amenities.

The street cars and buses from Powell and Market go any direction, as I caught the streetcar to the waterfront and to Height Ashbury. I even walked to Chinatown from the Serrano, but I am a walker.

Now, the bad: -If it had not been for the parking charge, I would have given the Serrano 4 stars. First off, we saw some of the other places were a little cheaper then the hotel...until the bellman made it seem like it would be about the same price to park at the hotel. Silly us, we work in the industry and should not have been \"hosed\" like we were, but oh well. Long story short, we ended up paying a total of $44 (Bellman didn't mention the tax or anything, of course) to have the privilege of parking. Oh well, it happens. -The rooms are SO small. I'm certainly not a prude by any means in terms of room size, but this was kind of ridiculous. They make phenomonal use of the room but the size is just unacceptable. Plus, the whole time I was there, I did not see another guest anywhere in the hotel. Again, I work in the hotel and if it is a slow night, open up a couple of your suties and try to get some repeat business. It certainly would have taken the bad taste of the parking charge out of my mouth. Anyway, if you do not have a car and need a decent place to stay for the night by yourself I would recommend it. However, if you have any sort of vehicle or need a room with any sort of size, do not bother with the Serrano.", "Date": "December 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cEarly check-in, great wine and champagne\u201d", "Author": "AuntPeanut", "ReviewID": "UR4299163", "Content": "I stayed here for four nights in December.

SO service is very personalised and its very important for them. We stayed in two different rooms. One was regular and the other was the executive suite with the Jacuzzi. Both where comfortable, charming, ultra clean and filled with little extras such as: Aveda products, robes, slippers, nice wine glasses, high quality furniture, beautiful draperies and bedding and 3 huge mirrors. The ambiance is romantic and luxurious. The hotel itself is 17 floors with 10 rooms per floor approximately. If you like places with charm, this is the place to go. There was wireless internet in the rooms at all times. There is a safe, a minibar and supplies in case of cravings. Wine tasting and tarot card reading occurs everyday in the lobey b/w 5-6. COffee is offered in the morning and it taste great. The hotel has a theme of games, if you're into that. In terms of Location, its fantastic. Its 5 minutes walk from Union square, nordstrom, sna francisco mall, saks and all the great shopping streets. Its a 25 minute walk from the warf.

The whirlpool tub is wonderful, especially if you have a chance to purchase some Lush bath bombs or bubble bars. The Aveda products were a plus.

I have some serious reservations about the hotel but overall would recommend it. The location of the Serrano hotel is remarkably mixed. Its immediate surroundings are parking lots, run-down convenience stores, and seedy massage parlors. However, just a block away are several luxury hotels and a small theatre district, so clearly this is not a bad neighborhood. And despite the surroundings I never felt unsafe during my stay here. Also, the Serrano is an excellent location for staging forays into the city. In one direction is Nob hill, about six blocks away (although I warn you, that is six blocks UPHILL) while the Powell street transportation complex (Cable Cars, Surface Street Cars, BART, and City Subway) is about five blocks in the other direction. Also at the Powell street complex is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153San Francisco Place\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is a gorgeous, very upscale, suburban shopping mall, with a Norstroms and the other usual suspects. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the foyer is elaborate and confused. It seems to be a cross between ancient Egypt and baroque Venice. I found it amusing eye candy when I first entered. Three days later it struck me as a bit labored and depressing. The important thing is that the lobby is bright and clean and pleasantly laid out. There is a bell captain inside to deal with your bags, and valets outside to hail you a cab. Every day there is a happy hour in the foyer. Wines are nice (although, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m no connoisseur, just a gleeful alcohol consumer), the food is not\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust a step up from pretzels and chips. Two elevators plus a service elevator (which I used often) only adequately cover the building. Two very highly recommended features of this hotel is the exercise room and business center. The exercise room has an excellent selection of tread mills and other stationary exercise equipment. It is thoughtfully furnished with ample clean towels\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnice touch. The business center features three web-ready PCs plus a printer and fax machine. Incoming fax are free, and computer usage and moderate paper supplies are free. Outgoing long distance fax charges apply. Note that with only three PCs you might have to wait, but it is better than the no service at all that many other hotels in this price range offer. While the d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the foyer is quite questionable, upstairs everything is first rate. The corridors and rooms are modestly and elegantly decorated. Everything of course, very clean and well-maintained. As for the rooms themselves, they are small. I had a room with a single king or queen-sized bed and even though I was by myself it felt small. Part of the problem is that they cram a full complement of furniture (chair, desk, wardrobe-entertainment center) without any thought into a small room. The closet was also not full sized. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a good way to test a relationship, you could do worse than share this room with your significant other. But the real problem with these rooms is the washrooms, they are very small. For those of you who have to have a full-sized tub (and why do you have to have that, huh?) your tub is there and is perfectly fine. The problem is that there is very little room left for the toilet. It is squeezed almost under the sink and mirror. Also, the hotel has made a very serious mistake in placing only a small shelf to set your toiletries on and in selecting a sink that has a banked perimeter so you have to very carefully set anything on the surface of the sink or it will fall off. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m warning you, close the toilet seat before you brush your teeth or change your contact lenses. I had a decent view looking North up towards Nob hill. Based on the surroundings, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe any side of the hotel is going to offer you great views. The staff was generally helpful and pleasant although not overwhelmingly so. Not a significant positive or negative for the hotel. There is a restaurant on the first floor which serves contemporary cuisine. It is nicely decorated with a helpful wait staff. I had one meal here, vegetable stir fry, which was excellent. Overall, I would stay here again. It is a good location, and a nice place to come home too and the end of the day.

As it was, we brought a car, but were able to park it on the street and leave it there--taking a cab, transit, and walking to get around.

The Serrano was just PERFECT for that! When we arrived we noticed that a hotel across the street had some labor union strike going on and the picket line was really LOUD with bullhorns, drums, yelling, etc. We had requested a room high up with a view, but that would have meant we would have been on the side of the hotel facing the picket line. We made a request to change to the opposite side and they were very willing to accomodate. The room was on the small side - but that was not a negative at all in our minds. We loved the complimentary wine hour in the lobby (even after tasting wines all week!). We also just loved the location. So convenient to Union Sq and the theater and restaurants.

It's just as pretty as the pictures show and the staff was extremely nice. EVERY time we went in or out, we were asked if we needed help or needed a car, you name it.

The bathroom does not have a separate vanity area and only one small shelf. The bedding was generous, with blankets, comforters, and a duvet. Several pillows and throw pillows. The king bed was very comfortable. The room was small, and it was difficult to unpack because we had one small closet and only two drawers under the armoire.

There are plenty of restaurants to walk to and the trolley service is not far from the hotel.

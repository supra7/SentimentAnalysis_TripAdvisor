The pictures they put up on the webpage look NOTHING like the rooms. The room we had was musty and damp and Orlando was hot. The aircontioning did not work properly. The plug in the bathroom tap did not work so we had to use a knife to open the hole to let the water out. The washing machine was broken and couldn't use it and on the last day they only gave us one towel as they couldn;t was all the hotel linen.The fridge was crap too and didn't work properly as it was all iced up. The shuttle bus only goes three times a day and the hotel is not a convienent location to anything. It cost as nearly $50.00 to get there by taxi from the airport.We had to hire a car so that we could get around otherwise we would have been trapped there. Generally speaking it has horrid. It was very cheap but i was annoyed as they sold themselves as being newly rennovated. This is just not true.

NOT a two star hotel, for multiple reasons. I happen to luck out when I checked in (about 1a on a Friday) there was no one ahead of me. Out of our group, 7 rooms and all of us arriving at different times, I was the only one who didn't have to wait at least 45 minutes for check in due to the slowness of the front desk staff. Others from our group checked in around the 1a time frame on different days and they waited, and waited. Now to the rooms, the best that I can say is adequate, barely. The rooms weren't always cleaned (some days no housekeeping showed up) and when they were \"cleaned\" they weren't cleaned too thoroughly. We were there for work so no one really had time to use the pool, which appeared to be nice, though there were people in the pool all hours of the night.... Specific to the room, my AC unit blew directly on to one of the beds, I put a chair between the bed and the unit so I wasn't in a cold draft all night. Another from our group had a room (the 3rd one that he tried) with no AC working. A couple of days my keys stopped working and the line at the front desk was long and it took a while to get the cards re-programmed. Over all this is a poor quality establishment. None of us tried the continental breakfast, lack of cleanliness of the rooms left us not trusting what the food choices might be.

I had to wait 15 minutes for them to check/clean my room. 3) Room I had reserved was a KING, they only had DOUBLES left. 4) Manager was completely rude and unprofessional, and uncaring about the issues at hand. She walked out of her \"office\" with an attitude and kept it the entire conversation I had with her. 5) There are multiple rooms across the property that have broken keycard locks (I counted 6 guests with issues the first night. Second day I counted 10 different people needing to be let into their rooms). This is an issue that has been going on for at least a week and a half (as is evidenced by complaints on the various web travel sites) that has not been addressed by the hotel. According to the maintenance crew, they are \"waiting for parts from out of state\" or \"the technician didn't have time to get to your room today.\" The only way to get into your room is by walking to the lobby (which is pretty far from the rooms) and having them call maintenance out to open the door. 6) Those rooms with broken locks SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE FOR RENT. The management knew there was an issue and did not disclose the issue to any hotel customers that were checking in. The management claims it is a new problem, but it was confirmed to me by both employees and maintenance that it has been an ongoing problem. Why is this not illegal? 7) Also, it is VERY unsafe! They were not checking ID or anything, when letting people into rooms. Anyone could have very easily pretended to need to get into my \"room\" and have attacked me if I was there, or stolen things from me if I wasn't. Very unsafe. 8) The check-in staff LIED to customers on 5 different occasions in front of me (remember, I was in the lobby for over half an hour because my room was not ready and they gave me the wrong type room), stating that $4 \"resort fee\" they charge was for local taxes. Resort fees are ways for hotels to advertise lower prices online, and then charge a larger total amount later when the guest is checking in. This is no resort, and \"resort fees\" are NOT for local taxes, those are already paid in the original booking price. What they are doing is illegal, and they should be called out on it, especially since they are preying on tourists that do not know better. As for the rooms/hotel itself: 1) While I read a lot of recent reviews about messy rooms, mine was actually pretty clean. They wood laminate floor was definitely not mopped, but had been swept. I'd say it was 85% clean. 2) Room design was pretty nice, it's nice to not have the same \"80s tropical\" comforter that most hotels down here have. This would be the one saving grace of the hotel\u2026it MIGHT have kept me as a customer here, had it not been for their abysmal customer service. 3) No wardrobe though, or any sort of cabinets to store clothes in the rooms. Only a metal shelf in the bathroom and a rod with 5 hangers. 4) No cups or ice buckets were available. 5) Wifi NEVER worked. Refused to connect. While I couldn\u2019t really leave my building to check the other areas since my door lock was broken and I had the leave the door open, I walked down the hallways to make sure it wasn\u2019t just my room. It wasn\u2019t. All 3 times I was at the lobby for something, another customer was complaining about it. Slightly nice rooms aside, this was a terrible experience. I have never seen a hotel have such flagrant offenses when it comes to completely lack of care for customer service and safety. The hotel had NO right to let the rooms with malfunctioning door locks be available for rent, no matter if the hotel was overbooked and in demand of more rooms. There's a certain call for professionalism in favor of customer service and customer safety, and this hotel completely disregarded it. That, coupled with the lies of management and check in staff (1- management claiming the key lock issue was something new that happened that day, when clearly document online via travel forums by previous guests as well as the maintenance crew, and then not telling guests about it when they check in, 2 - the check-in staff claiming the \"resort fee\" is for local taxes) should show you that you should think twice about renting here, for the amount of consideration you will get as a guest. Sure, you could risk it...you might be one of those with a functioning door lock and might escape the issues I had...but it is a big gamble...is it worth it to you?

But, these rooms are so cheap, it's hard to complain about that. Although, the front desk was a little huffy about it. We bought 10 day non-expiring passes a while back and ended up with 2 days on our passes.

I am glad we did. The hotel was small and it's not luxurious by any stretch but, the staff that greeted us was friendly (although, not all were during our stay) and our room was clean and functional. Not pretty, and bed was not great but.. good enough. The location to the park is excellent (quick right, half mile to on-ramp, and you enter the park). And the hotel is immediately next to (can walk) a waffle house and IHOP (although both were so incredibly packed each day, we did not use). There is a chik-fil-a across the street that was great (next to a gas station / quick trip also) and we used the drive thru on our way out to the park. We used our room to sleep in and that was it. And if that's all your looking for to make a economy trip to Disney, this place is more than perfect. Rooms were clean and functional. Beds were ok but not bad. parking and overall area felt safe and it was very quiet. They have a pool that is very basic but we did not use. the only issue we had was, Hotels.com stated we could get a roll away bed at no charge and the hotel staff said that was not true.

I don't know exactly how much we payed per night but it was almost for free. However I wish we choose another hotel.. After a 12 hour flight we arrived late at the hotel, at checkin they told us we booked and payed for one night. We told them we booked and payed for a package deal and got a reservation for 21 nights. Clearly something wrong with the communication between them and Expedia. This has never happened before and we book hotels via Expedia all the time. He literally told us to go fix this with Expedia. Of course I told him it was not our problem but theirs. We never heard about it again our entire stay. So I guess they fixed it. We got a room in the third building. Beware, if you do not have a car, walking from the lobby to your room can take about 5 \u2013 6 minutes if you're in the third building. The room was ok, the beds were clean but housekeeping did not come every day! Even when we left very early sometimes they would just not be made when we got back. There was a old TV and the reception was very bad. Also the plumbing in the third building is terrible. First time at night when we were a sleep our neighbor took a shower and it sounded like the entire building was coming down. Security even came to check it out but it turned out to be bad plumbing. So bring earplugs. Also because there is a lot of construction going on in the area, when we were there the construction on the parcel next to the hotel started at about 7 am in the morning. The staff doesn't care about your good night sleep either. One night they woke us up by moving televisions in the rooms next to us in the middle of the night. I called front desk because I thought they might be thieves. The worst thing of all for me was, they advertise with free WiFi but do not note online anywhere that it is only available at the front lobby. So when you need to get online to check something real quick thats a total of 12 minutes walking to front lobby and back. Not convenient at all since I need to be online often for work. Because of this we asked back for the $4 per day resort fee they charge. They agreed to pay back and said it was going to take 5 days. After a week we asked again and they told us we receive it back when we leave. We did get it back, $84 for 21 nights. Ok it can not get much worse right? Wrong! We went on a road trip via Miami and the Everglades to the Keys. After 4 days we got back to the Claremont in Kissimmee at night. We were very tired of the 8 hour drive from the Keys and were glad we got back to the hotel. But there was a note on our door saying we had to leave the room because the next morning it was going to get renovated! So in the middle of the night after a 8 hour drive they wanted us to pack all our things and move to a room in a different building. He gave us a new room and when we got there the door jammed, at least I thought it did. So I was very mad and kicked it in, turned out he gave us the wrong room. It was not jammed but locked from the inside and there were people sleeping... Of course they woke up scared and screamed at me! We went back to the front-desk and told the guy what happened, you should have seen his face... The next room he gave us he checked out himself, to see if there was nobody in there. The location is great. It's close to Disney and they have a free shuttle that picks you up in the morning and brings you back to the hotel at night. When you get to Disney you can use the free Disney shuttles and monorail to get to any park you like. If you want to use the shuttle to get to Sea World or Universal they charge $15 per person. The hotel is in walking distance from Kissimmee Old Town, you will find many places to eat and shop there. You can also go to Celebration for dinner, that town (previously owned by Disney) is worth a visit. So the hotel is a absolute hell hole and is lacking in management and service. Location is pretty good and the free shuttle to Disney is great if you're planning on visiting the Disney parks. But almost all hotels in this area offer a free Disney shuttle so I would strongly advice to go somewhere else.

We did not know this, but thankfully there was no problem at all checking in as they honored all reservations made for Hojo. They were busy making changes renovating etc. but we had no problem with noise etc. We had a newly renovated room , although still just a bit outdated it was just fine for the purpose of our stay. We did not pass much time in the hotel as we were out all day going to parks, and at night it was a very comfy night of sleep. Initially we had some issues that some lights were not working, no ice bucket and no cups for water or coffee, also our floors were not really clean. but as soon as I asked they made sure that the next day by the time we came back everything was fixed and clean. Beds are very clean bathroom as well, they replace all linens and towels everyday. My mother also got a newly renovated room that was changed later on as the shower pressure was not right, phone nor tv remote worked and toilet kept running , they fixed some but changed the room anyway to a great room with no problems at all. Our king size room had no closet or drawer space however mom's double did have plenty. Overall service is great and I expect this hotel to become even better once fully renovated. I would stay there again. I would definitely recommend this area if you want to be near everything in Orlando, plenty to do , even in walking distance. Like Shopping miniature Golf , enough food. and near by you have Walmart, outlets gift shops . Most important it it close to I-Drive and very close to Disney, literally less than 10 minutes away from all the fun stuff. If you don't have a car there are buses running right in front of the hotel and shuttles to take you to parks. \\Disney, Universal and Islands of adventure, are AWESOME this time of year! We finished all four parks of Disney in 3 days and 2 days (with time to spare) for Universal and Islands of adventure. The lines are short. The longest we had to wait in line was at the new Harry Potter attraction in the castle which we waited about half an hour for. AAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLL other lines in both parks AND in Disney also ALLLL lines were SUPER short , like a max of a 10 Minute wait..... even to meet characters!!!!! So if you are planning a trip for these parks I would 100% recommend to go in the last week of September to first week of October! Awesome!!! Make sure you buy a poncho for those wet rides , when you don't want to get wet, also great for when it starts to rain, you can go to shows and wait it out while others hide! believe me it is hot! so shorts and tanks would be best and lots of sunscreen. Make sure you wear sneakers, with so much walking you need good walking gear! I would recommend the Florida mall, West Oak mall ( its less hectic) and Orlando Fashion square. For your shopping for lat minute stuff you forgot in the parks , Universal's City Walk and Downtown Disney will sell mostly the same merchandise. Disney parks are awesome , something every kid would love! I would say go with older kids cuz the sun wears most kids out by 1 pm if you go in the morning. I saw plenty kids KO in their strollers by then.

Also, kids eat free deal expired months before and was no longer valid. False advertizing and terrible costumer service.

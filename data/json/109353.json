The air conditioner was so noisy though that I did need to turn it off to be able to sleep. I was plenty cool with it off, so it was not an issue. The separate sitting area was great for visiting with my friends. My only complaint is that although I had reserved a crib, I did not have one when I arrived.

We stayed in the largest suite, and was fortunate to be at the end of the last building, it was almost like a home from home. My husband and I stayed there for 2-3 weeks at a time on 3 occasions, while we transitioned. The hotel is very clean and has everything you need, the rooms are fully equipped with tv (with cable) fridge freezer (with ice maker) microwave, hob and a full range of crockery and utensils. The larger suites have separate bedrooms to the living areas which is great if one of you wants to go to bed and the other wants to stay up watching movies. Everything is very local, there is a petrol station over the road, that sells all of your basics, incl Subway! 2 bar and grills in the same area. Walmart is a short drive (10 minute walk up the road), and there is a fab all you can eat chinese buffet on the way for $7.95 per head. the hotel provides a complimentary continental breakfast, which although small is more than adequate, you have a selelction of muffins, bagels, egg/sausage (needs to be warmed in microwave) fresh fruit and pastries, coffee is available in receiption 24 hours a day. The hotel has its own laundry (great for those longer stays), small gym (basic equipment), and a pool and spa (great for the Texas Summer). We were so impressed by this hotel that we have made this our corporate hotel (our office is just across the car park), and have recently had directors and managers staying there, and they have been more than happy with the service. The staff are friendly and very helpfull, even when you get a few problems (which inevitably you will if you stay there as long as we did). The building is secure, with key card access to get in the main building, and then into the rooms. The hotel will be undergoing a refurbishment shortly, and I'm sure this will just enhance an already great establishment.", "Date": "October 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "austin", "Title": "\u201cCar broken into and nobody cares\u201d", "Author": "mpick123", "ReviewID": "UR5790170", "Content": "My car was broken into and I had some things stolen.

But the best service I've ever received, ever, was the little Westin Park Central in Dallas. This was in the early 00's but I've never forgotten the amazing staff at that hotel, especially in the Banquet Department. Those men and women under the leadership of the best of the best, Mike Tej, surpassed every banquet department I've ever worked with, before and since. Extremely attentive to every detail, personal attention to myself and my staff, but best of all, the same amazing attention to my attendees. Which, to me, is the most important of all. A little hotel in the middle of what I call The Corporate Jungle of Dallas, it's probably overlooked by anyone other than business travellers and the meeting industry, and that's a shame.

So I asked the guy \"You take guests within 5 miles of the hotel right?\" and he answered \"Yes but just not the mall.\" So I tell him if I find something close to the mall will you take me there \"He was like yes\" so I said \"Can you just take me to the mall then?\" and he was like sorry \"We can't do that, mall shuttles run every 3 hours.\" ARE YOU SERIOUS???? So I ended up looking up a restaurant half a mile away from the mall and going down to the shuttle desk. The guy I had just spoken to was there. I ask them to take the to the restaurant. He asked me if it was near the mall, I said yes, but you won't take me to the mall so... Then he started being dumb was like well if you have asked me for a favor, I would have said yes.

When we inquired at the front desk, they said they were aware of it and the issue was affecting floors 11 through 17. That's a lot of people without hot water for a shower! The following day, there was hot water, but no water pressure. I couldn't get even a trickle of water out of the shower head. There was a little bit of water that came out of the tub spout, but with it came about a 1/4 cup of dirty sandy-like grit. Letting the water run, it took 45 minutes to fill the tub 6 inches.

This hotel is nice, but is not the Westin standard. I am currently staying here as I write... When we pulled up to the hotel we nonchalantly greeted by the valet parking attendants who were not eager to lets us park at the entrance so we could check in and learn about our parking options. So we decided to self-park in the parking garage which is $12.00 a day and needs makeover. When we went to check-in at the Platinum Spg desk which I am a member we were informed that because a travel agent had booked the trip through a third party vendor none of the Platinum benefits applied even though the price paid come to find out was more than what the hotel charged on its website. I can understand this, but the customer service by the Spg desk some of the worst I have seen and for a Westin I expected better as I have received better service from a four point\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Spg hotel. Also, internet is 9.99 a day as well which is free at most hotels these days. Once in the room it is extremely outdated and the linens on one bed needed to be changed because they were stained, and the AC did not work so it had to be fixed. The hotel was full with a conference so it took longer than normal to fix these issues which I understand and the desk did check to see if they were completed.

But for $58/nt, it's pretty much the best deal you can find in decently Central/North Dallas for clean accommodations. Frankly, I think Starwood makes a mistake in branding these old, outdated hotels Westins. I remember not too long ago when a Westin meant something special and contemporary; now it seems to be their stodgiest brand, based on several recent stays in different cities. The rooms' decor was rather shockingly 1980's. The curtains, with their dark red floral patterns, were laughable, as was the outdated sink, shower, and bathroom. The windows looking out were filthy; apparently window washing when out the door at some point in the 90's. All of that said, the Starbucks in the room was nice, the staff was friendly, the common areas and parking clean. Didn't use the gym this time, and it's annoying to have to pay $12 for parking in such a parking lot of a city, and $10 for slow internet access is still a rub. But you can tell that they're just trying to get whatever extra fees they can, since they have to offer such low nightly room rates.

Parking options are ridiculous in my opinion.... $22/day for Valet... $14/day for Garage self park and the free parking lot was a 4-5 minute walk and had the smallest, most difficult to maneuver parking spots I've ever seen. It would be one thing if the hotel was in a downtown or city center, but this place is like a ghost town during nights and weekends. And don't ask to leave your car in the front of the hotel for 5 minutes while you run up to your room to grab something, the valet will tell you to park it in the adjacent office building's parking lot but \"don't let the security guard see you.\" So plan on making the walk every time you come or go if you don't want to pay $14/day + for parking.

We were there for an expo that was being hosted there. The rooms on the other hand were in questionable shape though when we arrived. The first room was actually open before we got to it. Which is strange because the doors all have a spring mechanism that keeps them from staying open. That creeped my fiancee out so we asked for another room. The 2nd room had a dirty bathroom door. Grimey handprints all over the edge, probably from the workers who'd been repairing the bathroom. I knew there was work going on it it because a lot of the shower tile was partially de-caulked and not yet recaulked, and whomever was doing the job just used putty to plug some old screw holes where the shower curtain rod used to be attached. So that was the bathroom. The phone by the bed was dead. The safe didn't work. We had to call and ask for a refrigerator which was supposed to already be included in the room. The AC in the room comes primarily from a 14x14 vent on one side of the room, and the flow can't be guided to where the bed is. The other vent was about 5x7 and located way by the door. The last but worst thing, one of the sheets had old blood stains on the top hem area where you grab it to cover yourself. I guess at least it wasn't fresh, right? So we obviously called the front desk about the problems, in our \"lemon/salvage room\", and they did fix the phone, and bring a refrigerator, and fix the safe. ...We hadn't yet seen the blood on the sheet. The whole odd experience made it feel like they decided, \"Ok, no one go fix anything that needs attention.

It did not interfere with sleep so I did not ask for a new room. Nothing more annoying than having to move after you have unpacked everything! I figured out the noise was the elevator, as my room was near it, and I was on the 19th floor...so probably near the motors or something. The room service was wonderful, expensive, but wonderful. They need a larger menu though...my only recommendation from that perspective. Front desk staff was very pleasant. I was checking out, and needed to get an updated receipt.

We just came from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico where we were for 3 weeks and heading to Colorado and didn't want to do it all in one day so we overnighted. We booked 2 connecting rooms as we have two small kids and needed to be next to them. I stayed here before many many years ago and I remember it being nicer. The rooms feel a bit tired compared to the really great lobby and bar area downstairs. I agree with a previous poster that said those areas are nice compared to the rooms. Still, the rooms aren't bad and very comfortable. The beds are very comfortable just like all the Westin hotels we've stayed in. Our rooms were quiet as well. We valet parked for the $20/night and the valet guys are VERY friendly and always super quick. We always tipped them every time we left and they were always good about helping with bags. We wanted to be in this area as it's not far from both the Galleria Mall and Northpark. We did a ton of shopping so it was convenient. The one big negative I'd say is on the adjoining rooms the system is really bad. On every hotel we've stayed at, there is a lock to lock the door to connect the rooms but the rooms don't automatically lock when the door is closed. But here it does which is dangerous if you have toddlers. We had a problem with this as our 19 month son and our 3 year old daughter were playing in one of the suites. We were in the other suite. The door was open between the rooms. We had the security lock on the inside of the main door. Well the door closed between the rooms and the door automatically locked. Our 19 month old son got trapped in the other room. I immediately called down and they came up immediately from maintenance which we really appreciated. The manager also came up and was great. The problem was that the tool they had to open the security latch was broken and it took some time for them to open the door. I can't blame them as they were really trying hard. Our son was scared and crying the entire time and the manager was so great even offering to break the door down. The maintenance guy got it unlocked after a bit. The only thing I'd recommend for the hotel is (a) got that tool fixed in case this happens again; (b) fix the adjoining room locks so the doors don't automatically lock when the door is closed. All the hotels we've been in have a lock that you can manually lock. Or at the very least if they see parents booking two rooms with kids, warn them about the door and that it will lock automatically. But I was really happy with how quickly the manager acted and how he was willing to break down the door if the maintenance guy couldn't get it. That was great.

The lobby decor was what you'd expect for a hotel of this size/class. Front desk, valet & room service staff were all exceedingly professional & courteous. Room service food was mediocre - need more healthy items. They have things that are labeled as healthy, but they really aren't due to sugar content or other additions. Perhaps they will make more healthful options upon request, not sure as I didn't ask. Regular guest rooms were average. All items were in working order, but wallpaper was beginning to peel in bathroom. Linens & pillows were great (tons of extra pillows), but the mattresses gave both husband and I backaches. They feel comfortable when you sit on them, but upon waking, both of our back hurt. Couldn't ask for a better location - right next to two major highways that will take you pretty much anywhere you need to go in the area. Lobby bar wasn't open at 2:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday, which surprised me. Front desk staff directed me to the hotel's in-house pub instead, which also wasn't open. Room service came to the rescue. There were two conferences going on (one H.S. cheerleaders) and I did not find noise to be an issue. Lobby was somewhat crowded with shabbily dressed conference-goers, though. Had to pay $10/day for internet connection in the room. Pay-per-view movie (great selection) was $12.00. Didn't check out the pool due to time of year. Overall, I would never pay full price for this hotel, but if you get a deal ($90 or less), it's worth it.

My partner and I were looking for a hotel in the Dallas so we could visit for a few days to celebrate our Anniversary. The property had a special rate at the SPG site online for a non-refundable rate for a traditional room, so we decided to book it. After booking the reservation online I called the SPG Gold Customer Service number to see if I could PAY to upgrade to a Deluxe Suite since they were not available online. I was notified by SPG Gold Customer Service that I would need to contact the property directly to arrange for an upgrade. I called the hotel the morning of our arrival, TODAY, to see if they had any deluxe suites I could PAY to upgrade to and was told that they would give me a complimentary upgrade to a Junior Suite based on my Gold status. I informed the gentleman I spoke with that while I appreciated that offer, I was really wanting to PAY for an upgrade to a Deluxe Suite since we were on the way to Dallas to celebrate our Anniversary and was told that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to call a different number at the hotel to do that and was given the phone number [---]. I called that number and got a voicemail that she was out of the office until Monday, January 3rd. I called the hotel again and was given the same gentleman at the front desk and was told, once again, that they could give me a complimentary upgrade to a Junior Suite. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean to sound ungrateful for what they offered based on my Gold Status, but it is still not what I wanted and what I WAS WILLING TO PAY FOR!!!!! What hotel turns down money from someone willing to pay for upgrades that weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available online??? I finally arrived at the hotel around 4pm and was notified by the front desk agent, a very kind and welcoming young lady, that I had been upgraded to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a suite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd based on my gold status and thanked me for staying with them. Once checked-in to the hotel I went to my room and went to take a nap before we went out for the night. As we were about to nap, we noticed that the pillow cases had stains and when we pulled back the sheets there was even a tag from a piece of clothing that someone had purchased at a store for a woman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s size 18. I went to the front desk to notify they young lady about it and she apologized and quickly sent someone from Housekeeping up to the room. When the lady from housekeeping arrived she looked at the sheets and changed the pillowcases and told me that the stains are normal and they happen from being washed. She also seemed to see nothing wrong with the clothing tag that was found in the bed and said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it must have fallen out of a pocket when the housekeeper was cleaning.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So in the past 2 hours this hotel has managed to make it where we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the room we wanted, couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take a nap on a bed with CLEAN linens, and we had to explain why finding a tag for women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing in our bed was not acceptable. I would NOT recommend this Westin property to any guests. All I can say is I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m thankful that we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have dinner reservations at the hotel because aside from the young lady at the front desk, this hotel needs some major help. Next year we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find another Starwood Property in the Dallas area that can live up the standards of an SPG property, allow us to PAY for the Upgrade or room we want, and have clean linens on the beds. The part that frustrates me the most about this, besides them ruining our anniversary, is that aside the from young lady at the front desk when I checked in\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 this all seems to be acceptable to them and no one has offered to correct anything or even offer to find a way to get us the room we really wanted.

There is free self parking lot a block away but the hotel staff will not tell you about it. I only learned about it from other reviews. In fact, upon check-in the front desk staff joked around like he was still going to charge for parking even after I stated I was parked in the FREE self-parking lot. Some other observations, the pool is outside. So while it isn't anything fancy, I was able to catch some sun. I think this hotel advertises a whirlpool but I never saw it. The gym is nice and large. The room was nice too and clean. The towels are rough. The hotel isn't located by much other than offices. The only restaurants in walking distance are Benihana (sp?) and Jack N the Box.

First, I traveled the same time the other poster did when the supposed model convention was in town. The hotel was a circus. There were no models, only kids who were loud and extremely obnioxious. I too tried to sit in the lobby to do some research and had to go back to my room after the pounding music gave me a headache. I felt so sorry for the other business travelers who were seated at the table with me. This hotel does not offer free wifi in the rooms, so you have to go to the lobby. This made it impossible. On check in I knew that this hotel was older and they tried really hard to put lipstick on a pig. The lobby is well appointed but old. I got up to my room and it was DISGUSTING. It smelled of mold. The furnishings were dated. The carpet was filthy. Next to the bed on the carpet there were old bobby pins on the floor. The bathroom had mold in the shower. Nothing in the room matched. This hotel is a mess. After two nights of not sleeping I checked out and lost one night here. I could not tolerate the family of 6 in the room next to mine. Yes, six people. I counted them. I tried to complain to the manager but when I was transfered to his office the phone just rang for about 5 minutes. This is a hotel for business travelers. The pool is the size of a hot tub. There is no hot tub. There are no chairs on the patio in which to lay out. The gym is small and stinks. You also have to pay for parking. You will need a car, as there is nothing within walking distance. The hotel is rather secluded. There is a Benihana though. The food is extremely overpriced. I would not recommend eating anywhere in the hotel . Take my advice and do not stay here.

I have always received top notch customer service at every Starwood hotel until the Dallas Park Central. I was in Dallas on business. We checked in on June 20th. The woman who checked in was brilliant. She offered to put us up on a higher floor which was a nice touch. The lobby is nicely decorated and updated. When we got into the room that is where it stopped. The bathroom was dirty with a huge glob of womens makeup on the wall behind the door. Also the blanket was stained with makeup. The room was obviously old. Now, let me interject this was a last minute business trip and I did use priceline to save money, but I do not believe any paying customer should ever have to put up with what went on at this hotel. On the second day there was a huge \"model\" expo. The hotel literally turned into a night club. There were kids screaming up and down the hall all night long. It was impossible to get an elevator. Remember folks, this hotel still charges 9.95 for wifi, when all other 4 star hotels include this. You can get free internet in the lobby, but there was pounding music and \"models\" everywhere. It was literally a zoo. I have never in my life been in a hotel and had to deal with this. Being down in Dallas for an interview this was unacceptable. When I complained to the manager he half listened and told me that they host this \"model\" expo twice a year. To me it sounded like. \" We are making a huge amount of money on this and I could care less about your concerns.\" My advice, before you make a reservation make sure there is no \"model\" expo. Also, I rode up on the elevator with a man who had checked in at that time. He was not notified there was a nightclub in the hotel. So none of the guests were provided with a warning! The manager did give me a voucher for two free nights, but frankly I would never stay here again. It is an old hotel and that is evident in every corner. Oh, and don't forget to use the free parking that is a block away. Otherwise you will pay a load of money on parking. I have no idea why they charge for parking, since it is in an isolated area. Overall, it really is not worth the money.

All of the hotel personnel I encountered were friendly and helpful in answering my questions and went out of their way to help solve a transportation problem. The lobby was decorated in an attractive, contemporary, minimalist style. My room was quiet and clean. Although the bed was too soft and left me with a sore back the next morning, there were a half dozen pillows that could be used as \"body pillows\" and that solved the problem for the remaining nights. The room contained three packets of Starbucks coffee (one of them decaf), some tea bags, and a one-cup coffee maker that was very handy. The surrounding area is not particularly interesting from a tourist standpoint (office buildings, highways), but if you'd like to get out of the hotel for some exercise, ask for a trail map at the front desk. There are three- and five-mile hikes you can take, if you can stand the heat in summer. I walked about four miles on a fairly attractive, well-traveled paved trail that started in a park two blocks away; it winds through various fields and parks, though also across highway exit ramps. The only caveat is that if you are attending a conference and have celiac disease and need gluten-free meals you may have difficulty obtaining them. The banquet staff (which may or may not be different than the regular restaurant staff) did not seem to grasp what gluten-free meant and repeatedly served me meals containing gluten, although they were given advance notice of dietary restrictions for all attendees and I provided the server at every meal with a note briefly listing what foods/ingredients were off-limits. I haven't had this much problem with meals at any conference I've attended.

Lacking the time or money for a traveling vacation, we used airline miles to stay here for free. We just needed an overnight mini-vacation \"away from it all\" and our stay at this hotel was perfect for that. We had peace & quiet, time alone together, away from the busyness of life and just a short drive from home. As other reviewers have commented, the closest free parking is a block away. This was not terribly inconvenient for us. I simply loaded & unloaded at the hotel entrance and walked the short distance. Hotel employees helped us with our luggage. If we were staying longer than one night this walking back and forth to avoid paying for parking might have begun to feel like a burden. Also, in the hot Texas summer months it would have been more uncomfortable. As it was, I didn't mind. The street I had to walk across was not busy. The parking lot did not appear to have any security, but the neighborhood was one where I felt comfortable parking overnight. Pros: Every hotel staff person we encountered was friendly and helpful. The room was acceptably clean, and we are somewhat picky about cleanliness. The heavenly bed and shower were a big plus. We all slept very soundly. Our room was quiet with minimal noise only from people in the hall going in an out of adjoining rooms. Our view from the 12th floor was as nice as you're going to get along I-635 in north Dallas. Cons: no free Internet, $10 per day to use wifi. This is our biggest complaint, and something the hotel could change for the benefit of guests. Many hotels now offer complimentary Internet connections. All of our other gripes are minor: No vent in the bathroom; taking hot showers made the bathroom and bedroom humid (A/C worked well, however.) No complimentary breakfast -- the menu in the room seemed high-priced and uninteresting to us, so I drove out & picked up something to eat. (Again, we didn't have a lot of money to fund this overnight getaway, so perhaps breakfast at the hotel would be reasonable for many guests.) For some weird reason, the Weather Channel seemed to be giving us local info for Pennsylvania rather than north Texas. But we were able to get local weather info from the local DFW news stations. There is a phone hung on the wall directly next to the toilet. I nearly knocked it off the wall and into the towlet bowl. The cord was long enough to allow it to fall in there. I recommend either relocating the phone or using a shorter cord to prevent the handset from falling into the toilet. (Personally, I would never use that phone anyway -- how sanitary can a hotel phone be if it's right next to a toilet? Think about it...) All in all, for this to be ranked a four-star hotel I would call it simply average at that. No major gripes, but nothing that especially impressed us beyond the comfortable bed and cleanliness, which one would expect at a highly-rated hotel. Seeing that the room would have cost us only about $114 after taxes, I think it's a good place to stay. We didn't use the other amenities which include an outdoor pool and a small gym.

There is a bar with a second bar counter, and then a number of tables. Good views of the TV's to watch a game. The lobby restaurant was nicely decorated as well, and mostly open to the lobby. My first room was a corner king suite. Unfortunately, I noticed an unpleasant smell, but thought I could deal with it.

Both rooms were clean and comfortable, with flat panel TVs and Westin beds. Bathroom in the new room was fine, clean and newish. I had a light dinner in the lobby bar.

Chalang gave us all the info we needed and also mentioned there was some party going on later on that night that we might want to check out. From there B.C. the bellman had taken everything out of our car from valet and followed us up to our room. Mr. B.C. told us about all the hotel had to offer on the way to the room. Once we got to the suite he put are clothes in drawers and hung our nice clothes up that we were wearing to my wife's company party later. He even gave us a tour of the room. YES a tour of the room, because there was so much in there. As you can see from some of the pictures, it was an amazing room. The room had french doors that you walk into from the hallway, and there was a entryway with a table and across from the table was a small bathroom. Then you walk into the living room. The living room had 2 nice size couches, a smaller table and a huge flat screen TV. The dining room had a large marble table and around the corner was a bar. Not just a little bar area, but a actual bar were you could serve drinks (which we did later that night), a fridge and a sink. There were even cabinets were you can hold extra bottles if need be. The bedroom had a large cozy bed, with a work desk and a chair with an autumn. The master bathroom was the only thing that was normal, except for the dual shower head. The suite had a hall closet and another closet in the master bedroom. We had a few friends over later that night, but you could have hosted a nice size party if you wanted to.

I have a feeling this in going to be a costly problem. We were a little hungry after checking in, so went down to the restaurant to have some appetizers and drinks. The menu in the restaurant is very limited. They had 5 or 6 appetizer, none of which were traditional. They were all over $10 each.

The location makes it convenient but hardly an area to go out and explore. The Westin is rated as a 4 star class hotel. Many reviews have questioned that. You have to know what the stars mean as it relates to hotel classification. It does not signify levels of superiority of service. It merely is the travel industry's way of saying that this hotel has lots of amenities like meeting rooms, conference areas, full service restaurant, etc. I have been a number of 2 star hotels that have better service than 4 star hotels, it just depends. That being said it does offer a better stay than lots of similar priced hotels in Dallas. I have stayed at a bunch in the North Dallas area and the Westin is my favorite. Better beds and room designs than Courtyards, Marriotts, Hiltons, and the like in this area. I particularly like the bed, dual shower head, overall room design and cleanliness since most floors have been updated or are going through this process. I know they have had problems with the elevators and that can be frustrating but they supposedly overhauled them all. It took several visits for me to notice a difference but now I do, they are much better. I have never eaten here so cannot rate the food or service and do recall prices being steep. No different than many city hotels. I do like the exercise room which has a good number of machines and is much more spacious than other chains. I also like the valet parking since I have no idea where the self park is. Yes it is expensive but worth it if coming and going on business. I also like the rooms they have. I have had one that offered a treadmill in the room and another with a stationary bike in the room. Prices overall are pretty reasonable compared to the $140 a night at a Courtyard in Dallas, if you get a good corporate rate.

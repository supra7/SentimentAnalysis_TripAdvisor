The hotel is a good value for New York, and the rooms are comfortable, but the renovation process does create some issues in the hotel. When I checked in, due to my Starwood status, my husband and I were told that we'd been upgraded to a newly renovated room. We were thrilled until we stepped off the elevator on the renovated floor and were greeted with the overwhelming smell of wet paint. We proceeded to our room hoping that the smell would just be in the hallway, but the room itself was also very freshly painted (not wet perse, but still full of paint smell). The room was REALLY nice, so the renovations definitely went well, and we would have loved to stay there, but for health reasons, we decided we needed to ask for another room. I personally don't think they should have even had this floor open yet, because there was no denying the smell. We called down to the front desk to ask for a room on a non-renovated floor, and they told us they could move us, but all they had left were rooms with two double beds. So unfortunately, our romantic evening in NYC turned into more of a friendly slumber party with us on two separate beds. As a platinum Starwood member, this was disappointing. However, the unrenovated room was perfectly fine - beds were comfortable, the room was quiet - other than not being able to sleep together, the room was great. I would consider staying here again - hopefully once the paint dries from the renovations.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cenjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "manc59", "ReviewID": "UR126781765", "Content": "my husband and i have just spent 5 nights at new york helmsley and throughly enjoyed the stay. we were given a renovated room (as i requested) on 36th floor overlooking 42nd street which was very noisy considering we were so high up! but fantastic views of the chrysler building.lovely room very clean, very comfy bed and pillows. a little disappointed no tea/coffee making facilities or room service but this was due to the renovations.pax next to the hotel for breakfast was ok or walk up to grand central lots more choice. we found all the staff.. reception,concierge and house-keeping to be all very friendly and polite. we had a small problem with the safe i made a call down to reception, the guy was knocking at the door within 10 minutes to sort it out.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed in facilities!\u201d", "Author": "Purplelenni", "ReviewID": "UR126776241", "Content": "Having stayed at this hotel on two previous occasions and being more than happy with my stay, I must say on this occasion I was quite disappointed.

The hotel is being refurbished and the room we had was desperately in need of an upgrade but clean and comfortable. The bar and restaurant were closed which was fine for us as we were out all the time but would have been nice to have a drink in the bar in the evening. My main disappointment and sheer outrage was on my last day, having stayed for three nights we checked out and left our bags and went to do some final sightseeing and shopping. Before my flight I wanted to use the bathroom and freshen up...only to be told the bathroom was shut due to the refurbishment and I could use Starbucks down the street!!!! I asked to use a room an was told i would need to check in to do this' After insisting on speaking to a manager, a very rude manager opened the bathroom to let myself and another hotel user in. Without a smile or apology she stalked about and locked them again 5 seconds after we left them. I was appalled that having has such a good experience on the past it was tarnished by this. I'm sure that a hotel must have facilities for people to use on departure.

I suggested to the staff that earplugs be provided because as of 7 am you can hear hammering and other demolition noises. Although this motivated us each morning to have an early start. Again i do believe it will be great once the renovations are done, but it kind of put a kink in our Valentines day celebrations.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, dated hotel\u201d", "Author": "DistrictScott", "ReviewID": "UR124729857", "Content": "As always, I generally prefer to stay at Starwood properties.

First of all, the room was seriously dated (i know they're in the process of updating the rooms, so I think I just got an old one), with a tiny little flat screen TV, which was more like an oversized computer monitor. Much worse, the room was overheated and overly stuffy, and the thermostat was outdated, and didn't even seem to be functional, so I ended up having to open the window to cool the room off. Which, even though I was on the 35th floor, resulted in a very loud night. Surprisingly, room service didn't open until 6:30 am!!! I called down at 6:30 to order coffee and oatmeal, and was told that it would take 45 minutes to deliver!! Since I had to leave at 7:20, I left without coffee or breakfast (there was no coffee maker in the room either). Also, the blowdryer on the wall in the bathroom didn't work. I called housekeeping and they delivered another one, which also didn't work. I called down for a third blowdryer, which finally did work.

I booked a deluxe high floor room as as a platinum starwood guest the only room they had for me was a renovated room directly in front of the elevator on the 38th floor. This room had no view and as it directly faced another building, it formed a canyon where the noise from the street roared up so every truck and car that roared by sounded like it was in the room. Between that noise and the \"pings\" every time the elevator came it was not a pleasant night. To top it all off there was a \"false alarm\" fire drill at 3AM which had the alarms blaring throughout the hotel....to say I didn't sleep well was an understatement. At 7:45 am they were doing hotel maintenance in the hallway outside my room....don't ask me what....noise everywhere. The furnishings in the new room are already looking worn however the bed was very comfortable and the internet/wifi worked well. Location of this hotel is excellent on 42nd street with easy access to all public transport. All staff were friendly and seemed excited about becoming a Westin. After staying in the newly renovated room, this hotel reminds me far more of a Sheraton than a Westin and I think this is going to be a hard sell. After a miserable night, I went down to the front desk where there were TWO people checking in 30 people waiting. I was hoping to speak to a manager and figure out what was going on. Finally I tired...I called Starwood chalked up another $80 and booked the W Union Square. A lovely hotel with a view of the Park....I checked in in 1 minute and my bags were instantly in my room....The quiet is deafening and quite frankly for a little extra money...this was well worth it. With so many rooms, so many people, renovations going on and seemingly little management, I did not feel safe at the New York Helmsley.

The room is quite old fashioned and could definately do with modernising, including the bathroom, very old fixtures etc. Our window faced the street, the window didn't close properly so there was abit of a draft and noise, I could sleep through most things so it didnt really bother me, but if you are light sleeper I would check the windows when you are taken to your room!. Also expensive room service and we had to keep changing our room pass almost on a daily basis, because they stopped working All in all I would recommend it if you are looking for somewhere clean to stay in a good location.

We were greeted with a tremendous smile by Pei in Reception and after she found out we were in NYC for my birthday and that we were repeat customers and knew an awful lot of her colleagues she managed to put us in one of the recently refurbished rooms on a high floor with magnificent views of both the Verrazzano Bridge and Empire State Building. The room was exceptional and we were incredibly grateful for the allocation and her continued beaming smile throughout our stay. As before, everybody we spoke to in the hotel was as courteous and friendly as ever and it was great to be remembered so fondly and affectionately by a number of The Helmsley team, but then I guess we are almost becoming regulars there these days! Denis (the Doorman) and Miguel (Concierge) were as friendly and helpful as ever and it certainly feels like our home from home in NYC these days. Everything that has been mentioned on here previously about the excellent location of the hotel is true and it is a fantastic base to discover all the restaurants, diner's, deli's and adventure that 2nd Avenue has to offer if you want to slip away from the usual suspects in the tourist trap areas. In summary, we want to thank all the staff on here again for a great stay, and in particular to Pei for allocating us such an exceptional room. We recognise there will be some disruption in 2012 as The Helmsley transforms itself in to a fully fledged Starwood hotel but I'm sure under the expert guidance of Maurizio Bonivento, the General Manager of The Helmsley, that disruption will be kept to a bare minimum for the guests. The effort that Maurizio is putting in to replying to comments on here is to be commended, indeed he responded to my previous comments on our stay in April 2011 but unfortunately I have only just discovered the email address that Tripadvisor uses to contact me was nearly 5 yrs out of date so I never saw the reply (I'm so sorry Maurizio, I have now replied to you separately via email and corrected the email address Tripadvisor has for me!).

I typically never ever comment on past hotel experiences as I understand that challenges can and will occur even with the best run properties.

The cab drove off before she could alert the cab driver. This was late in the evening and her flight the next morning left JFK at 7:40 a.m. The hotel was helpful in suggesting that I arrange for a car service to take her to the airport. However, she was going to be travelling without a penny on her, without Identification (TSA nightmare) and without the opportunity to find any source of funds in a limited time frame. We asked John and team to simply advance $20 and add this to our bill which was well over $1,000 already. $20.. that's all we asked after first requesting help. John, the front desk manager said it was against the Hotel's policy and that we were out of luck/on our own. As a Platinum Starwood Member, this is certainly not the way we have been treated in many other Starwood locations around the world. Hotels have always gone our of their way especially with Gold and Platinum members to ensure their guests are always comfortable. This hotel has recently joined the Starwood group and the Management Team needs to be re-trained on Starwood Guest expectations since this experience was less than desirable. My wife is going to be back in NYC next week and we will be avoiding this property needless to say. Anyhow, the hotel itself is a great asset for Starwood. They just need to address how they handles special one off situations rather than lump ALL guests into a single protocol/process. The Starwood manual undoubtedly suggests customizing a unique experience for each guest and a plain Vanilla approach offered by John is simply inexcusable. Starwood Corporate has been terrific by the way.. They are going way out of their way to remedy the situation and we love this Franchise and the many great benefits the Starwood program offers us and our family. Simply amazing.

The food was mediocre, but I had no choice but to eat there at 10:30pm. They also automatically charge you 15% gratuity included with the bill, which in my opinion is how the servers can get away with terrible service, since they are going to be tipped out either way. I think the in-room dining needs to open after 11pm, because there is nothing else to eat within a few blocks of the hotel late at night! For some of us, we are running on west coast time, and eating at 7:30-8:30 MY time is my normal. We asked the server to split the bill by price (not item), and she made it the biggest ordeal I've ever seen in a restaurant. It's not complicated to do this, we had a corporate card for a portion of the bill, and a personal credit card for the remainder. The server had to get management to do this for us, even though this is really a simple task, but she wouldn't just admit that she didn't know how, she made it a big deal by saying that she wouldn't do it.

I decided to email the hotel to ask for one of the renovated rooms, explaining that I was surprising my husband,( a soldier), and 2 kids with a trip to NYC for Veterans Day Weekend. I can only say that the response I received from the hotel made me teary- in a GREAT way. Violet Sanchez not only upgraded us to a Premium King Room (clean and spacious) with a breath-taking view of the city, there was a wonderful bottle of wine and a hand-written note from the general manager, Maurizio Bonivento. Everyone from the doormen to the receptionists, concierge, bartender, and housekeeping staff were friendly and helpful. The concierge (all 3 of them that I talked to during my stay) were extremely helpful in explaining which subway to take, which mass at St. Patrick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was better, how to get tickets to a Broadway Show, the Statue of Liberty, 9/11 Memorial, etc. We were even able to check our luggage in for storage after checkout since there was still sight-seeing we wanted to accomplish. The location close to Grand Central (just a short, short walk away), Times Square, and the Empire State Building, among others, was unbeatable. If you are on a budget, be advised that the parking is $55/24hr in the adjacent parking garage. **The parking garage is run by an independent company**, and is valet parking. (Yeah, we were the morons that tried parking the car ourselves. Whoops.) The parking attendant told me that parking was $60 if the hotel parked for you. (But hey, the hotel will park your car and deliver your luggage, so I should have gone with that!) I was surprised when we picked up our car 26 hours, yes, 26 hours after leaving it and were charged $100+ instead of the $50 plus hourly charge I assumed. My fault for not reading the signage. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if having the hotel staff park the car for you would result in not being charged the full 24 hours if you overstay, so be sure to ask. There is a small grocery/caf\u00c3\u00a9 on the other adjacent side of the hotel that has very inexpensive breakfasts.

I was really pleased with the property and the staff. I arrived around 10 AM with the intention of leaving a bag. The clerk at the front desk, Loida, was very helpful. She was not able to put me into a room but did help me find the bell staff to take my bag; I agree with others that the bell staff is a little tough to find and if there is room for improvement. Quite simply, they should make themselves more obviously available as you always have to look for them and it is not clear who is bell staff and who is not bell staff. The fellow that took my bag was very nice though. I also agree that the lobby in not ideal and it was tough to figure out who was waiting to talk to the front desk and who was just hanging around. When I came back to check in, I saw Loida again and was given a room on the 14th floor. I asked her if I could have something higher, and she suggested I take a look at the room and come back if I was not happy with it. I was given a large corner room that was really nice, and even though it looked out over 42nd St. it was set back in an alley or something and was one of the quietest rooms I've stayed in in New York. I am pretty sure the room has been renovated, as the bed was clearly the Westin heavenly bed and there was new carpeting. I really liked the room, and was able to do my morning exercises as there was enough space. The shower was nice but was not the heavenly shower (something I can live without as I don't like the Westin heavenly shower) and the bathroom amenities were high end. I did not notice plumbing noises from other rooms, which I find is a problem in a lot of older New York hotels. There were about 100 television channels available and the television and internet worked very well. Also, there was a spacious in-room safe which I always like to see.

The location near the corner of 42nd and 3rd, is extremely convenient when I'm visiting NYC for work. The hotel is just blocks from Grand Central Station and the Chrysler Building and some of the hotel's higher floors provide views of these iconic buildings. Additionally, the rooms are well appointed and spacious - esp. by NYC standards. My biggest critique is reserved for the rooms yet to undergo a renovation. These older rooms will transport you back to the 80s with their decor. I won't belabor this point since the hotel is obviously making a concerted effort to update their rooms. My other critiques are of a more personal nature. I find the space lacking personality. If you look at the walls they are bare, lacking warmth and interest. Lastly, the showers (even in the newer rooms) are not as nice as what I have in my own home, which is too bad, because I generally look forward to taking long, hot, relaxing showers when I travel and am away from friends and family. Some hints and tips about the property: - There is free internet access if you are a Starwood member so join Starwood's loyalty program before visiting and you can save yourself $10.00 a day - The hotel has views of the Chrysler Building - if that's important to you; call ahead and request a room with a view.

Bonus ! The room was in need of updating but it was clean. The only thing we were surprised about is that there was no coffee & tea in the rooms. But there is a PAX deli just 2 doors down that serves breakfast, lunch & dinner so that did the job. LOCATION: the hotel is well located, a 5 minutes walk to Grand Central, 10-15 minutes to Times Square and very close to all major attractions. There are plenty of amenities close by, pharmacy, restaurants, delis, shops, subway & train. SERVICE: We could not have asked for better service. As mentioned above, the request to our room was granted upon calling ahead of time. We also requested extra blankets upon arrival and within minutes someone was at our door with the blankets. On another night, we experienced a problem with our room safe. We called the front desk (past midnight) and withing minutes someone was in our room to fix the problem. Last but not least, Alexandra. She made our stay a most pleasant one. We ran into a price discrepancy with parking as the price was changed (without our knowledge) after we inquired upon booking the room. She honored the initial price we had inquired about and was very nice about handling the whole thing. Overall a very pleasant stay. I would go back for the service alone. Yes the rooms need some updating but the service was really out of this world for us, and that goes a long way.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunderland, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery clean.

As mentioned, this was our 3rd stay at the hotel and as before, all expectations were exceeded, despite the very challenging times all the staff were coping with as the transition to being a Starwood Hotel was only a fortnight old. We had emailed ahead to the Room Controls Manager Timothy to request a high floor as we were celebrating our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunofficial\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 anniversary during our stay in NYC and he duly obliged and also ensured a late checkout for us on our last day due to our 22:30 Virgin flight back to the UK. He secured Room 3909 for us which once again gave us a magnificent view down East 42nd Street and of The Chrysler Building. Everybody we spoke to in the hotel was as courteous and friendly as ever and it was great to be remembered so fondly and affectionately by Miguel in the Concierge team who was as exemplary in his courtesy, helpfulness and all round sparkling personality as ever. Denis the Doorman was also really pleased to see us again and he was able to give us lots of useful advice about the city as ever and once again showed what we have to come to love about The Helmsley. Excellent stories and a cheeky grin combined with marvellous service. In summary, we want to thank all the staff on here again for a great stay, and in particular to Timothy Leetch for ensuring our stay came and went without incident. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shame that Timothy has moved on to pastures new since the Starwood Regime commenced but his legacy is one of excellent customer service and timely and efficient communication prior to our many stays at The Helmsley. If there is one criticism I have to mention it would be that Timothy was the only person whoever did respond to emails for information etc. Since his departure (and during his stay at The Helmsley) every other person emailed has without exception failed to respond to me or has done so in a very corporate and not especially helpful manner, not giving me the specific info I wanted but instead just quoting information from the website which I could have easily got myself. We are hoping to find somebody in July who we can create a relationship with who can be that point of contact now that Timothy has moved on. In summary, we enjoyed our stay so much in April that we are returning for another 3 night stay at the end of July, this time to celebrate my birthday at the end of that month. Looking at the effort that Maurizio Bonivento the General Manager of The Helmsley is putting in to replying to comments on here I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure he will ensure the transition to Starwood and the planned complete renovation will retain what we love about The Helmsley at the same time as bringing its decor and amenities well in to the 21st Century.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cgreat location!!\u201d", "Author": "vongordon", "ReviewID": "UR114653214", "Content": "recently visited this hotel... decor in lobby was nice.

The bed was just one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in, and the bed linens, well you will just have to check them out for yourself. I did not want to get up each morning. We also had good robes and soft fluffy towels. We had asked for a fridge and there was one in the room which was great, as we were able to store cool drinks ( it was very hot outside). We would have liked a kettle( I love my tea), but the deli Pax next door does great coffees and snacks and met the need. I know lots of reviewers have commented on noise, but I have to say that our room was quiet. The air conditioning worked very well too and was never intrusive. We found the free wi fi to be very quick and a real bonus. Breakfast was included in our rate. We were only entitled to help ourselves to the buffet and I would have liked to sample pancakes or perhaps eggs benedict from the a la carte. However the buffet was plentiful and I particularly liked the fruit and yogurt. The dining room was a really beautiful space and must have been decorated recently.

Firstly, the location of the hotel really can't be beaten: Grand Central Terminal is two minutes away, which makes the hotel a great location for exploring the five boroughs and beyond. That's not to say travel is necessary: the whole of midtown and its many landmarks and attractions are easily reachable on foot. The area immediately around the hotel is well stocked with shops, banks and eateries, too. I must echo a number of other recent reviews in stating that my experience with the front desk wasn't brilliant. Upon arrival I was greeted with a dour \"Yes?\", and on returning my door cards a week later, received merely an \"Oh\" as I departed for my long journey home. The front desk area also feels to be cramped, dark, and often seemed to have an inadequate number of staff on duty. The rooms themselves are fairly large for New York and, though a little tired, I found the furnishings and decor to be acceptable for a hotel of this class. The bed was just as I like it (rock hard), and there is plenty of storage and seating available. The bathroom, again, a touch tired perhaps, though I understand the hotel is beginning a major renovation. The views from the Helmsley are excellent: on my two visits I've been treated to magnificent views of the Chrysler Tower (facing north) and Empire State Building (facing south). Guests may want to check in advance whether their room is blessed with a majestic view of one of these icons. I'd also say, the higher the floor the better (they go all the way up to 40), as midtown is never silent. I didn't use the restaurant or room service, and nor would I with a plethora of coffee and food shops on the doorstep. One thing that did bug me a little was the fact that the housekeeping staff called as early as 10AM some days and as late as 2PM on others. I appreciate they have many rooms to visit but I do prefer my room to be ready when I return in the early afternoon from a morning visit somewhere. My stay was considerably more expensive than my previous visit, though I suppose this was to be expected to some degree given exchange rates and different circumstances, though I did feel on this occasion that my stay was at the limit of what I'd be prepared to pay. Were my review to end here, I'd most likely have left four stars; however, upon returning home I discovered that, despite my paying in advance, the hotel charged me for my stay, forcing me into a series of emails and phone calls to obtain a refund. A simple clerical error perhaps, but I wasn't impressed by this. Sadly, I feel the manner in which hotels request your credit card upon arrival these days as a matter of course increases the risk of such errors being made. To conclude, excellent location, great views, decent rooms, but I must admit to some reservations about the service.

Our first day we walked down to 5th Ave for some shopping, Rockefeller Center, and Time Squares. It was a bit of walking but nothing too strenuous. I really loved the location out of all the places I had stayed in NYC. I would never stay in Times Squares again because it is way too busy. -There is also a CVS at the corner so we grabbed some bottled water for the room and a couple things that we had forgotten for our trip. Check In: -We had arrived about 2 hours ahead of check in but was still able to get our room at the time. -I had reserved two double bed rooms and got my room no problem. We were only a few doors from each other which was nice. I didn't even request it. We got our room keys and even extra keys no problem. I had a tendency to misplace room keys or forget them in a other pants pockets sometimes so I always request an extra room key. Rooms: -The rooms are a decent size. We had 3 girls in one room and 4 in another room no problem even with all the shopping that we had done. Yes the rooms were a bit dated, but they were very clean though. -The bed was a bit stiff for me but the rest of my roommates slept great in the them. Bedding was clean and crisp and very comfortable. -My biggest complaint would be the AC not properly working. I had it turned down to 50 and it was still warm in our room. Luckily it was cool outside so we just open the windows and were fine. It was bit a noisy at night but we were exhausted from the day that we all slept fine. -The bathroom was a decent size and had all the toiletries that we would need. The only thing that was a complaint for me in the bath room was the water pressure and the drain. Weaker water pressure and it took some time to drain the tub. -Also it would have been nice to have a mini fridge in the rooms too but it wasn't a deal breaker. Restaurant and Bar -Because hotels' restaurants and bars are always very pricey we skipped out on the one here. -There is a PAX right outside of the hotel to get some coffee or snacks. So i didn't feel the need to get at the Hotel Customer Service -We had ordered a cot up to our room and thankful it was up right away. I was worried that it would have taken forever to get it our room. -At one point our room keys had stopped working, so I called the front desk and they had sent someone up immediately with new ones. -Check out was a breeze. -We had a few hours left before we had to go the airport and was able to leave our bags with Bell Service. When we came back, I gave him the ticket and they pulled it all out for us to the front of the hotel. -Unfortunately we didn't think about rush hour when we were trying to catch a cab to LGA. The guys up front tried for 40 mins to waved down a cab for us until one would agreed to take us to the airport. There were at least a dozen cabs that denied going to LGA. So make sure you give yourself enough time to catch a cab. A car service tried to charge us $65 plus toll to go the airport and one of the Bellmen strongly advised us against taking it. -When we finally left, I was in such a rush that I had left a shopping bag behind by the curb. I didn't realized it until we were half way to the airport and traffic was so bad that if we had turned around we would have missed our flight. Luckily they turned it in right away and I was able to get it overnight by the concierge. If was any other bag, I don't think I would have freaked out as much but this was Chanel Shopping Bag with very expensive pair of shoes in them. Thankful for honest people! For the price ($200/night for a double room), I believed that it was a great value in Midtown Manhattan. I gave it a 4 based on the location and the outstanding customer service. I would definitely stay here again if I can get the same rate.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "baysidegirl55", "ReviewID": "UR109895933", "Content": "This is the third time I have stayed at the Helmsley and I hate to say I was very disappointed with my stay this time.

When we arrived we were impressed, it's looks lovely from the outside and the reception area is also very nice and also very busy. We arrived at 8am and were hoping for our room to be ready (I had emailed ahead 2 times leading up to our stay to request if possible as we were on the overnight flight from LA) although we didn't really expect it to be and it wasn't. Wandered around town waiting for lady on reception to call us when it was ready (she had offered to do this however never called) and went back to hotel at 1pm and when we asked if our room was ready now, it was. Not a big deal that she didn't call and she was nice enough, but this check in experience and much like the whole time we stayed at the Helmsley showed that there isn't enough staff for the size of the hotel, and the ones that are working there appear to be bothered by us whenever we asked a question. Another example was 4 porters hanging around near the unmanned concierge desk we approached them to ask for a map as there was a long queue at reception and we were told that we have ask at reception, even though we had seen another porter earlier grab a map from under the desk for someone else. The rooms were a gorgeous art deco style and the beds were massive and extremely comfortable. We stayed on the 22nd floor and the view was ok, they have forty floors so higher up would have definitely been better views. There was some street noise but not enough to bother us from from sleeping etc. the worst noise came from whenever our neighbors had showers and then it sounded like a kettle was whistling and boiling right in the middle of our room! Lucky we only heard them a couple of times over the 6 days so it really wasn't an issue but definitely noticeable. There was no fridge in the room which got annoying when your staying somewhere for a week, especially when we had bottled water as the NYC water does not taste great and we couldn't get any wine etc. We stayed in just their standard room which was quite roomy by NY standards from what I understand. The location is good, it was our first time to NYC so it's pretty accessible to jump on the subway on the green line really easily, about 5-10 minute walk to grand central and maybe 20 mins to times square. Really easy to get taxis out the front too. Definitely too far to walk to central park so subway or taxi got us there. The immediate surrounding areas of midtown were ok, a bit touristy and not the real New York that you think you will see, but it's a good central base to start out on your way uptown and downtown. Overall we really weren't in the room much and it suited us well for that, great bed for a good nights sleep after sightseeing all day. Fridges in the room would be a great addition. Service not great but not offensive either, really mediocre and not memorable (but I guess i would rather that then strong memories of really poor service.)

I decided to try it out. Read all the way through because it has a great ending. I checked in early and had a suite reserved. At check-in I found out that the hotel was not offering SPG Platinum Amenities as of yet but they were working on it. I was given suite 1414. I opened the door and walked into the 1970\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and my spacious suite with sweeping views was a small suite overlooking a wall. I called down to the front desk and I was then given suite 3920 which was right out of the 60\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and smelled of mildew. I called back down and asked for a manager and was connected to Maria Danna and the whole experience changed. It has been a long time since I have experienced such sincere fantastic hospitality. Maria said she would see what she could do and call me back. She also explained that the she was very sorry but the suites had not been renovated for a while and that the hotel was going to go under major renovation and come out branded as a Westin. After a few minutes Maria called me back and I was moved to 4120 a suite that had probably been renovated 5 to 6 years ago. From here on out I experienced nothing but fantastic service. I left my room and put my DND sign on the door. The housekeeper came up to me and asked me if I wanted my room made up. I said I just checked in. She pointed out to me I put the makeup room side of the sign on the door. We both laughed and I apologized. I ordered 3 meals room service. The food came hot and was delicious! The trays had a white rose on them. Moral of the story is this hotel has a great base in great employees working for it. It will soon be renovated and branded Westin. Welcome to the Starwood chain. Now one thing puzzles me. If Leona Helmsley may she rest in peace was such a stickler on the appearance of her hotels. Why have the hotel suites not been renovated in 30 to 40 years?

I spent ages trawling Trip Advisor looking for a good hotel recommendation in Manhattan and I was really pleased we found The Helmsley. The location is great, just 10 to 15 minutes walk to Times Square and is dead easy to find as all you have to do is walk out of the hotel, turn left and keep walking along 42nd (past Grand Central and Bryant Park) until you hit the edge of Times Square. Our first room was on the 9th floor and if you pressed your face right up against the window and looked up you could just about catch a glimpse of The Chrysler Building (my favourite NY landmark). I emailed the duty manager of the hotel to politely ask if they had any better rooms and within minutes Zach the General Manager called me and said he would arrange an alternative room the next day (as it was during the Christmas holidays the hotel was pretty full). Sure enough, the next day Jody the duty manager called so that we could view an alternative room on the 29th floor. Although the room was exactly the same size and layout it had a much better city view, was slightly less noisy (what is it with NY drivers honking their horns all the time?!!) and it had the most awesome view of the Empire State Building, which was perfectly framed between two adjacent skyscrapers to the right (I have posted a picture of it taken from our room at night). For us, the only downside to The Helmsley was that there are no rollaway beds available. A third bed (or even a sofa bed) would easily have fitted in the room and this would have made our sleeping arrangements much more comfortable as the two queen size beds are more like UK divans. There was not a kettle in the room but I read about that on another Trip Advisor report so we took a travel kettle with us. Having said that we also made great use of Dunkin Donuts for our hot drinks and morning toasted bagels. DD's are all around but the best one we found was out of the hotel, turn right to the corner of 42nd and 2nd, turn right onto 2nd Ave then just a block down to the corner of 40th and 2nd (5 minutes walk and no big roads to get across). Alternatively, the deli chain Pax is right next door to the hotel and although a little more pricey than Dunkin Donuts, Pax do a great range of sandwiches, salads and cakes, etc. The only other thing that might have improved the facilities in the room would be a fridge but there are plenty of ice machines near the stairwell on many floors. If like me you find you can't bear to be disconnected you will find the free wi-fi more than adequate. Logging on was always easy with no cumbersome procedures to follow and the speed/ was always pretty good. Our room was clean and comfortable, with freezing temperatures outside, our room was always warm and cosy and housekeeping visited us daily. On our day of departure we stored our bags with the concierge service as we had a few hours to kill. When we returned they arranged a taxi to take us to JFK and the whole process was as smooth as a 4* experience should be. New York can be expensive so another top tip if you are planning to stay at The Helmsley is to research the best price you can get from all the booking websites then log on to the Helmsley's own website (www.newyorkhelmsley.com). At the top of the home page hover your mouse over 'Reservations' then click on the 'Place A Bid' tab that drops down. Here you can put in a cheeky bid for the amount you want to pay per room per night and within 3 days you will find out if you bid has been accepted. I saved over \u00c2\u00a3500 (yes \u00c2\u00a3500 not $500) on the best price I could have got anywhere else! I definitely recommend The Helmsley and I say a big thank you to Zach the General Manager. It was a nice touch for him to respond to my email with a personal phone call in such a prompt fashion and considering the hotel was so busy I found him to be most accommodating. This personal touch made a big difference and made our stay even more special.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat deal on a nice hotel in Midtown\u201d", "Author": "NY_Guy_Traveling", "ReviewID": "UR92239367", "Content": "My wife, our baby and I spent four nights at the New York Helmsley to see friends in New York. (We lived in NY until recently.) Our experience was exceptionally positive, with one small complaint. I secured a low rate (including breakfast) via Travelzoo, so, frankly, I was a little afraid, hoping the reviews here were accurate, although it didn't seem possible at the price I was paying. I had nothing to fear. For starters, by New York standards, the room was large, with room for a king bed, a crib and a cushy chair (without feeling crowded). The furnishings (and carpeting) were not new, but they were in excellent condition (with minor blemishes from age). The room included a flat screen TV and lots of cable stations. The bathroom was in excellent shape, with newish tile, etc. In other words, a very nice room, but not a five-star luxury one (if that's what you're looking for). I'm kind of picky, and I was very comfortable in the room. The free wireless Internet was stable and while not fast enough to play any video online (e.g. I couldn't even watch 45-second sports highlight clips--video was not an option), was adequately fast to look at websites and definitely served my purpose. There is also an in-room safe, which is helpful. The hotel itself is very nice, with an attractive lobby, a lobby bar that is basically part of the lobby, and a restaurant in the back. The restaurant and bar service was excellent. The only meal we ate at the hotel was breakfast, and while it was fine (buffet with cereal, yogurt, eggs, bacon/sausage, potatoes, pastries and rolls), it would have been overpriced if I had to pay for it. Being NYC, there are a million restaurants within a couple of blocks of the hotel. (We enjoyed several relatively inexpensive meals at Energy Kitchen around the corner on 2nd Ave, and Osteria Laguna is a great upscale Italian restaurant literally across the avenue from the hotel.) As for service, it was mostly very positive. The front desk clerk who took care of us upon check-in (I think her name is Regina) was very helpful, as was the security staff, doormen, our housekeeper and restaurant/bar staff. We spent a lot of time in the hotel visiting with friends (with the baby around a lot), and the staff made us feel comfortable and relaxed. We appreciated that. I was also impressed that the crib and refrigerator we requested was waiting in our room. On the negative side, there was one big thing and one little thing. The big thing was the lack of communication after several rooms on our floor lost power for three hours due to a fire in the building. (Which meant we were effectively trapped in our room, since the elevator was out.) An hour and a half into the blackout, an announcement was made over the emergency sound system that everything was back to normal, and when we called the front desk, the clerk did not know that power was still out on our floor. (Several times, the announcement system was engaged, but no announcement was made. There were issues with the system.) Nobody from the hotel ever contacted us to apologize or offer us any kind of compensation for the disruption. That was disappointing. The small thing was that certain specific staff members, unlike most of their colleagues, were not especially responsive the few times we had questions or requests (e.g. asking a question at the front desk or when we called housekeeping for something small). But over all, our experience at the New York Helmsley was great (especially given the rate), and if we could secure a similar rate, we would be happy to stay at the hotel again on our next visit to NY.", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cunderstandable reservations office - snow storm disruptions\u201d", "Author": "lena-software", "ReviewID": "UR91851495", "Content": "We were due to arrive to the hotel on 27 December but only made it to NYC on 29th because of the snowstorm - the hotel offered refund for the two nights we could not stay there, although our fare was the least flexible one and fully pre-paid in advance - I was quite pleased.

They even upgraded us to a bigger room on the 40th floor with a fantastic view of the Chrysler Building. The hotel was clean, spacious and the room was very tidy. They had recently renovated most of their rooms, but we had an older style room which was yet to be decorated. However, it was still in good condition - the decor was just a little dated. The bed was huge and was very very comfortable, which is a must for me as I have a bad back (and after all the walking in NYC, you need a decent nights sleep!). The bathroom had a bath and shower, which suited us as my partner prefers to shower while I prefer a bath. There was plenty of room for cosmetics and there was also a spacious wardrobe and plenty of drawer space. There was also a safe in the room which you could lock with a digital keycode of your choice. We didn't try the food as we ate in a nearby diner for breakfast every morning, but we did have a peek at the buffet and it looked lovely. The best thing about the hotel was the location - it was just far enough away from the buzz of Times Square that there was no street noise at all, but it was right on top of Grand Central Terminal (you HAVE to go there just for Junior's Cheesecake), Bryant Park and the Chrysler Building.

The front desk staff agreed to move us to another room with a view of the Chrysler building. The hotel is on 42nd street, so it can be noisy at times. One BIG issue that should be addressed is the heating system. Even in much less expensive hotels, I expect to be able to control the room temperature in my room. But there was no way to control the temp in our hotel room. It stayed between 76 and 82 degrees in our room all the time, regardless of where we set the thermostat or whether we set the system on Manual, Auto, or Off. It was obvious that the hotel controlled the room temperatures at a central location. We kept the windows cracked open as far as possible for the entire day, but had to close the windows at night due to the traffic noise. Even with the windows cracked, the room was very hot at night and we were all miserable while trying to sleep. Didn't use the restaurant or bar or concierge service, so I can't comment on those. Business center was ridiculous - there was a per-minute charge to use the computer AND a charge per page to print anything, with a $5 minimum just to do anything at all.

It was only after I read the hotel information on gratuities that I had over tipped by $2 (yes the hotel actually tells you what they expect you to tip their staff). The room was a bit sad and dated and needed renovated however we made do. I'd advise you not to spend too much time in the bar as the drinks are around double what you would pay elsewhere and even though you sit at the bar you will be hit with a 15% gratuity charge and 18% if you have a meal. On leaving we needed to put our luggage in the store for which I tipped $3 even though they were stored no more than 5 feet from the room door however; when I needed to get them out again so we could leave I only had $1 left so I gave the guy this thinking it would be okay as I had already tipped to put them in. He looked the dollar and then at me as if I was dirt, shook his head and muttered something and walked off knocking over a case as he went. I know the culture for the USA is service staff top up wages off tips however; it's gone mad as they aren't interested in providing you with an acceptable service they just want money and all the staff came across as quite greedy in this hotel.

I was understandably irritated and said so and that this booking was for my friend's birthday. We received an upgrade to a corner king room on the 40th floor given the inconvenience.

The bed was also quite comfortable and the room was very quiet since it was in a corner. Besides the reservation issue, I had two minor negatives. First, breakfast was not included and the restaurant breakfast prices are pricey. This may be because we received a discount through my membership. Second, we needed assistance several times from the concierge and found the experience to not always be entirely pleasant. We were given mis-information which could have led to me arriving at one location and my friend (who was staying at another hotel) arriving at a different one for breakfast.

This was our first visit to New York and we were not disappointed. The hotel sits in a prime location with nearly everything within walking distance. We used Go Airlink NYC Sedan driver service for our ground transportation to and from the airport which was reasonably priced, quick & reliable and were lucky enough to be upgraded to a SUV on our arrival in NY! We made our booking back in February this year, so well in advance with good rates. We stayed at the Helmsley for 4 nights and were very happy with the room and service provided. Our room was located on the 12th floor on the main E 42nd St side and we had a nice view of the Empire State Building from our window. We had 2 double beds in a generously sized room which was clean and comfortable with air con you can manually control. The traffic noise did not disturb us at night and we slept soundly. There is also free WiFi available in your room. The maid service is provided daily and free newspapers are left at your door Mon-Fri. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant as it was a little expensive, but there are many places close by. We ate breakfast every day at a diner next door to the hotel called Pax which I cannot recommend highly enough! Their food is divine and will be something I miss back in the UK!! As I said, the majority of places to see are within walking distance. We managed without using the subway or cabs and our furthest walk was to Central Park which took around 35 minutes and Times Square was only around 15 mins away. The street system is actually very easy to follow after a day in the city. I would suggest that you read up on gratuities, as we did before we went - most places expect a tip (usually around 18-20%), but certain services do differ. Also expect an added sales tax at the till (of around 8.8%) when purchasing goods, but in most cases items bought with the sales tax added are still cheaper than in the UK!! All in all our stay at The Helmsley was great and our first experience of New York was an absolutely wonderful one, the city is amazing and the people are friendly, polite & courteous. The only downside was that we couldn't fit everything in to 5 days, so are planning to visit again next year for a longer period of time!

However, It isvery easy to get from Grand Central to Times Square by subway and both are stroller friendly. Also, if you have never gone to NYC, If you go to the subway after hours, one person must go through turn style and let the other person with stroller through the emergency exit door. We also bought the New York Pass to get into attractions, and I highly recommend that if you plan on seeing a lot of sites. Also, we did a Grey Line Bus Tour which was awesome!!

What an amazing time we had. We'd hardly stepped foot out of the shuttle bus from JFK before the fantastic doorman had popped our bags on a trolley an had taken them into reception for us to check in. There was no queue to wait in at reception and quickly we were whisked away by another doorman up to our room. We were situated on the 15th floor which suited us. The view from the room was facing east 42nd street and out the left a great view of the chrysler building. The room was very large (for a new york hotel) we had two double beds, a comfy chair, a table, a unit with drawers that also had an ice bucket and a vanity unit with a tv. The toilet was fancy but was extremely clean. While we were there it was so hot so our room was also very warm but we opened both windows and it soon cooled down (it may not suit those who dont like traffic noise to open the windows). There was a lot of traffic noise, tooting horns and police sirens but this didnt bother us at all as we stay in a city and are used to traffic noise so it was quite comforting. This hotel is within walking distance of absolutely everything. I was worried about booking a hotel for new york as i wanted to get a good location and i definitly made the right choice. It's like a 5-10min walk to times square, less than that for 5th Ave. Empire state building is maybe about 15min walk. And the hotel give you a map when you check so its pretty easy to find your way about. And its very hard to get lost in new york, the grid system amkes it so easy to get about and find where your going. We didnt eat at all in the hotel as it was very pricey but there's a small deli right outside the hotel with a great choice of food for breakfast lunch and dinner. Theres also a starbucks a 2min walk away. Theres also a 24hr pharmacy just across the road which has absolutely everything you can think of including drinks and snacks. We had a few problems with our room key during our stay, it wouldnt let us into our room a few times but the problem was quickly rectified by reception on both occasions which was great. The beds in the room where the comfiest ive ever had, the pillows moulded to the shape of your body which i loved and the duvets where so fresh :-) Always plenty of towels in the bathroom. Mon-Fri you get a new york times delivered to your hotel room door. And as one other reviewer said, we did feel as if we were the only ones on our floor we never heard a peep from anyone else. I organised a late check out for my room which i had asked for a couple of days in advance, two seconds an it was sorted, so efficient. Also on the day we left we hadnt had time to organise a shuttle bus back to the airport but the concierge for the hotel quickly arranged one for us and gave us a time to be picked up :-) All in all i can say i had the best experience at this hotel and it would definitly be my first choice for a new york hotel", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cFriendly, Clean, Convenient . . .

As far as an overnight base is concerned, the Helmsley ticked 3 major boxes. (1) The bedrooms are large and comfortable - my own room on the 20th Floor had 2 Queen-size beds which were extremely relaxing. I had 3 sound nights' sleep which is the big test for me. (2) The hotel itself is located within a relatively \"quiet\" part of Midtown Manhattan and once I was in the room on the 20th Floor, I heard no real \"noise\" from the outside world. Furthermore, there was no noise from adjacent bedrooms or from the corridor outside the bedroom itself. Very satisfying. (3) Staff service was professional, courteous & discrete - another big tick in the box for me. Now, I used the hotel only for sleeping / recharging the batteries from 10.00 PM until 07.00 AM, & not using the Helmsley for wining or dining. Hence, this review is for the solo traveller or partners who wish to experience a very secure, quite, relaxing evening / overnight base and who will use some of the multitude of bars, delis, cafes & restaurants nearby.

Second, the tub drain was not working, and there was a leak coming from the shower. Most of the bathroom floor was flooded as a result. Third, there were not many toiletries given. Aside from the bathroom, there also was no coffee maker (what I thought would be an essential for every New Yorker and tourist alike). The A/C also made a knocking noise while on.

We picked the Helmsley based on location, price, and reviews here. We got a deal on the hotel website that was better than on any of the travel sites, and we decided to give it a try. They recently remodeled the foyer and their restaurant & bar, so the lobby is shiny and new. The location, just a block and a half from Grand Central, is fantastic. Plenty of restaurants in easy walking distance. We used the (free) WiFi in the room to find good restaurants by searching google maps around our location. This worked well. The WiFi worked lightning fast most times. We had one hour where it went in and out, but it seemed reliable all other times. The rooms were not remodeled recently, and I'm sure that is the reason that the rooms are reasonably priced. Our room, #1416, a city double double, was pleasant. The lighting was a bit dim, and our view was mostly of the wall of another building (though you could see the Chrysler Building if you craned your neck). There was a smallish flat screen TV situated on a desk in the corner of the room. The toiletries were Gilchrist & Soames and I enjoyed those. Compared to other bathrooms I have seen in New York, it hotels, the bathroom seemed spacious. I was staying in the room with a friend, so I was glad the bathroom was big enough for me to change clothes in. Hot water had good pressure and was plentiful. The room seemed big by NY standards -- two double beds fit along with a desk & chair, and then an arm chair in the corner. We were very pleased with the amount of space. we were always gone from about 9AM to at least 4PM during the day, and housekeeping always came when we were out. There was no refrigerator or mini-bar, but this didn't bother us. The room felt clean for a hotel, and the complimentary NY Times in the morning was a nice touch. There was no coffee maker in the room, but there is a brisk breakfast spot next door, a hotel in the restaurant, and an espresso bar across the street... so there is no shortage of coffee. Staff was helpful and courteous. On garbage day, we did hear the trucks and banging, even up on the 14th floor. We were also by an elevator, so we heard anyone coming out of the elevator at whatever hour. I bought earplugs at the CVS across the street and that was sufficient.

The price is comparable with other main cities and affordable. The main plus is the location ... outstandingly convenient for many places of interest and walking further afield (as well as the drop off point for the Newark airport shuttle bus to Grand Central).

I called the day of my reservation to make sure the request was there but again it was not written anywhere so I told the lady this and asked if she could possibly pre-key my room so that I can get my request but she rudely told me that this would not be possible and that there are other people who have to check into the hotel and if they get there before I do then too bad.

I asked the front desk if they had a spare fork or something that I could use and before the word fork even came out of my mouth I got a firm NO. Then I was going to ask for some napkins and before I even finished the first two words of my sentence I heard NO. Then I said \"Do you guys have anything that I need?\" and the front desk said NO!! (I don't think they even heard anything I said that whole time). I know these things don't sound like huge deals, but being rude and not providing any sort of customer service is a big deal to me. I ended up buying a box of forks at the CVS across the street and left them at the front desk for others that possibly need utensils to eat. (They did have a restaurant at one point, there had to be utensils somewhere) Well the view in the room was beautiful!! That was the only thing that could be praised about this hotel...but the room was not very clean.

The people embody New York f (my hometown) for me, a friendliness that's REAL and down to earth Is this themost elegant or modern hotel in NY? NO. but they have something money can't buy in the form of those who work there, at every level. There are other reasons I'd stay again. The beds are just about the most comfortable I've ever slept on. I love te bathroom, with its old-fashioned towels and the hotel's name \"carved\"on them, and the thick soft bathrobe. The location by Grand Central Station on the East Side is perfect. The M104 bus, which has a route across 42nd st, via Times Sq, and all the way up the West Side, is diagonally across from the hotel. The English eatery Pret a Manger is across the street for a quick delicious sandwich, coffee, etc. There is a 24 Hour CVS right across the street . Great shopping (including a wonderful food-stalls market)in the passages leading to the huge lobby of Grand Central Station. The neighborhood is very safe. Among the very best IMHO bagels and great deli foods (try the gefilte fish) in NY are at Daniels, a few blocks away. Drawbacks: the lobby is being re-modeled, so you walk through a constuction area to get an elevator to third floor rception. However, this is after you've been greeted and welcomed warmly, so you don't feel like a duck out of water. The room furnishings, other than the marvelous beds with their white linens , are a bit dated--greens and golds. The mgr told me that, slowly but surely, once the lobby is completed, the rooms will be re-decorated. I was on the 20th floor with a view of the Empire State Bldg--especially striking at night, with clouds floating by its illuminated upper floors. Even at this level, the noise from garbage trucks and cars from the street below (facing 41st )was loud--the NY canyon effect? Obviously the windows are not double glazed . (In contrast, a friend stayed at the Times Sq Hilton, and we couldnt hear a thing from her room above the traffic). All in all, I would defintely recommend the NY Helmsley.

I did book the trip from one of the discounter sites, so getting the place for over half off certainly didn't hurt my opinion of it...but there were very few things that could have caused me to give it anything but a positive rating. The Bad: Since it's such a short list, I'll list the bad thing first. The only negative that we experienced was the fee for parking. Parking in the hotel's garage is around $52. I asked about garage parking and the bellman gave me some bit about it only saving a little and being several blocks away. Another much nicer person turned us on to parking right behind the hotel (2nd and 41st) that ended up costing us about $38. He actually thought that it would cost us a little less than that, but I wasn't made. That's still better than $52 and it was no trouble at all to find, walk from (less than 2 min.) or retrieve the car from. The Good: Everything else! The hotel first floor is under renovations (which didn't disturb us at all) so you check in on the third floor. All the staff was super nice, friendly and helpful. They offered us many suggestions on places to eat, how to find what we needed, etc. I'm always a little nervous when I book through a discount site that the staff will give you the leftovers and be ugly to you....but that wasn't the case at all. Truthfully, I've never really had that I'm just nervous about it a lot. Anyway, the room was great. A little small, but perfectly acceptable to us for our 1 night stay. Everything was very clean, the bathroom was equipped with the standard things, the beds were comfortable and fitted with white linens, the room had WiFi that worked perfectly immediately and the flat screen was an attractive touch. Because of the great people here on Trip Advisor, we were already hip to the minibar so we didn't even touch it!! But I did snap a couple of pictures of the wide range of technology. In a room with the super high tech sensor equipped minibar, there was a 1970's style thermostat. It worked just fine, it was just a funny combination. The CVS and PAX next door were very, very handy. My only frustration with that is that we didn't see them the night we arrived....but the following morning. I wish we had found them immediately because I bet I would have gotten something a little better for dinner than what I happened upon on 2nd Ave. around the corner. They are right next door, but when we came out the door we went right that night....we should have went left first.

The Irish Bar across the road had really good service also. If you want to call home (Europe) I would advise you to buy a phone card in the local shop and use the Hotel phone to call using that.

Upon our arrival at 1330 hrs our room wasn't ready, so we left our luggage and walked about the city for about 2 hours. When we got back to the hotel and checked in, we were given keys to a room on on the 24th floor - imagine our horror when we went up to this room, entered, and found it to be already fully occupied! Thankfully, there were no guests within, but we saw all their personal belongings, clothing, shoes, etc lying about and hurriedly made our way back down to the reception, where staff did not seem particularly perturbed - a 'computer error'! - and gve us another room on the 37th floor. On the plus side, the room was clean, comfortable and perfectly adequate. The following day, we left the hotel around 0700 hrs and returned about 1630 hrs, to find that our room had not been serviced. So we went back down to reception and this time asked to speak to a duty manager - Rae - came over to speak to us and we explained the errors that we had encountered so far. Although he was pleasant enough, we felt he did not appreciate our concerns, especially with the security breach we'd had upon arrival - I kept thinking 'imagine if that happened to us, imagine if we were in our room and someone else got access?' Not to mention the potential implications for theft allegations, extremism activities, etc, the list is endless! However Rae said he'd find out 'who dropped the ball' and suggested we went over for a drink in Harry's bar whilst he arranged for our room to be serviced. About half an hour later we went back upstairs and found our room had been cleaned, adequately, although obviously hurriedly. That evening, we telephoned home from the hotel room, as our mobiles weren't working. We had a 5 minute call to the UK. On the morning of the 6th June, when checking out, we discovered that not only had we been charged for the drinks in Harry's bar - which we had to take whilst waiting for our room to be cleaned! - but that we had been charged a whopping $49 for that brief call to the UK! Couldn't believe the exorbitant charges and asked for a detailed invoice which they were unable to provide. Spoke to a different duty manager, who again was pleasant, but dismissive of our dissatisfaction and did not bother to resolve the matter in our favour. Overall, we felt the hotel's fantastic location was spoiled by poor service, lack of customer care, and a disregard for customer satisfaction. A special occasion almost spoiled by the indifference and ineptitude of the New York Helmsley.", "Date": "June 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfax, VA", "Title": "\u201cStay Here\u201d", "Author": "scmcb", "ReviewID": "UR31576256", "Content": "I have made several trips to New York City and stayed in many hotels.

The staff, espcially those on the floor in the lobby (door/bell men, security) go out of their way to be pleasant and helpful. I checked in quite late, after midnight. Initially was given a smoking room, but I asked to be switched. When did front desk staff stop asking if you prefer non or smoking? My room was 2402 and had two beds. The room was adequate and comfortable. Although there was evidence of a recent rennovation, it was not a total gut, just a little updating. The decor is still outdated, and impractical. For example, the hotel kept the \"hutch\" which an, older, TV would have sat inside. The new LCD TV has been placed on what used to be the work desk. Now the work desk is mostly unusable and the TV is difficult to see from one of the beds. The desk/TV stand had no desk light, which made reading the morning paper difficult. Again, I found this an odd feature of the rennovation. Another odd feature was the choice of dark, non-patterned carpeting, which, of course, shows every little bit of fluff and dirt. The windows are the originals and are quite thin. A lot of street noise gets through. I found the ledge above the bathroom counter a great idea: very helpful to expand counter storage space which always seems to be an issue in hotels. There was a large hair on the bathroom floor, but besides this the room was quite clean and was even vacuumed each day. The room itself was a decent size for New York and the bed was very coomfortable.

When we got there, the doorman, kind of worried, asked us how much did he charged us. I told him, and he was relieved. The first night they gave us a room in the 6th floor. The next morning I asked to be changed to a higher floor, because of the view. The front desk changed us without any question. When we got to the new room in the 22nd floor the front desk called there to ask if that room was ok. The gym in the hotel is great. It's on the 6 floor, and it has some nice new cardio and weight training machines, clean towels too. Be careful with the water fridge, I sure they will charge a lot to the room. Everyday I used the free wi-fi in my laptop, excellent connection. And a PLUS is that the safe inside the closet it's big enough to fit a big laptop. I have a Dell Widescreen, and it fits great. The second day we got all wet because of the rain and the Concierge gave us a nice umbrella. It's close to everything, Grand Central, UN, Times Square is a 15 minutes walk away. There's a 24 hour CVS Pharmacy in the next corner, if you need something, including beer (LOL), there it is 24 hours.

The corner room on the 21st floor overlooked 42nd Street with a side view of the Chrysler building and was pleasant and roomy. The bed was excellent and loads of drawer and wardrobe space with iron and ironing board and with an armchair and small table, there was a decent flat panel TV and mini bar. Soft furnishings were of excellent quality. The bathroom with bath with shower over was reasonable sized and crammed with good quality towels and flannels. There was also good quality bath products, hair dryer and decent one size dressing gowns. There was a little traffic noise but not bad at all. Minor niggles were: the lack of hot drink maker but I knew this and took a travel kettle and makings, and a notice on the mini bar requesting that personal items were not stored in it (messed up the milk strategy), thought this a bit mean. Also an interesting tray of goodies on top with a warning notice that if an item was removed for more than 20 seconds it would be charged to the room as consumed? (mission Impossible self destruct?). Thought this was quite amusing but really out of character with the overall ambience of the room and looked like the work of a rogue jobsworth not involved with the customer service side of the organisation.

By the way I had a problem connecting my notebook to the FREE wifi and the helpful concerge sent up an expert to the room who sorted it for nothing and didnt want a tip. Be warned on using the business centre equipment it was $10 for 15 minutes and a fair bit more for each additional 5 minutes, this also seemed a bit mean, on line check in and printing boarding cards is quite desirable.

There is a PAX sandwich shop next door for breakfast take outs etc but we found it really crowded with limited seating, we breakfasted at the Frontier Restaurant on 3rd avenue around 39th street which we liked the food, space and service at not a lot more money than Pax.

Saw Chicago at the Ambassador theatre on 'cheap tickets' we got at the Sea port ticket booth, tickets werent that cheap, show was great but be warned if you bigger than petite the seats are very snug.

We didn't found the shoe in the room , so we called the housekeeping service, a woman came in the room and told us that she would have looked for it, we spoke also to the direction and reception. The shoe was not found and on the 4th january (our leaving date) the Direction Service assistant suggested to my husband to fill the security form and she told him that in one month they would inform us about the shoe or the refunding. At the end of february they still haven't contacted us so we wrote 2 e-mail to her, the first on the 2/20/2009 and the second on the 03/02/2009. the Direction Service and the Assistant Security finally answered on the 03/02/2009, saying the same things they told us before leaving the hotel(the shoe was not found).

After a long day walking, shopping and sight seeing we were thrilled to return to our little \"home\" with its comfy bed and bath robes. Everyone at this hotel welcomed us warmly and the door men were so lovely. Of note the bar bill has gratuity already added. Elsewhere a tip we were given to work out how much to tip, was, double the tax and add a little bit. This works out at the recommended 18-20%. Hotel is in a great location less than five min from Grand Central station and 15 min from Time Square (left outside Hotel for both). We travelled by subway a lot. (If going to Ground Zero/Century 21, take the downtown number 4 or 5 on green line to Fulton Street), journey time < 10 min. Well signposted and a $7 metro ticket will cover the return journey for 2 people. Deli next door, (about $20 for breakfast, french toast and coffee x 2) however if like me you hate paper plates and plastic knives and forks, try the Pershing Square Restaurant. (left at hotel, 5 min walk. The Breakfasts were fab, about $42 inc tip for two breakfasts and coffee. Be warned Juice is about $7 a glass, as is cereal, we declined and just had a main and coffee. The brioche was the nicest I'd ever tasted. For Lunch i'd recommend the Porter House, in the Time Warner building,10 Columbus Circle, (corner of Central Park). Only lunch though, we went here last year on a friends recommendation and dinner cost us $200. Lunch is $25 per person for three courses, the best steak we had ever tasted ( lunch special offered 7 days a week). After lunch we strolled down 5th Ave, visiting Abercrombie and Fitch and the Disney store, Tommy Hilfiger are renovating a building on 5th Ave, not sure when it's opening. For bargain shopping I'd recommend Jersey Gardens over Woodbury Common, $80 for two returns to Woodbury and 1 hr on bus. $21 return for 2 to Jersey Gardens and only 1/2 hr journey. Bus leaves from Port Authority for both. We like Tommy Hilfiger and the one at Jersey Gardens had pleny of bargains. A taxi to Manhattan cost around $60 each way inc tips and tolls. We took the bus $54 return for the two of us. It drops you at Grand Central. Turn right and about a 5 min walk to hotel. Slightly Slower option as it collects at all terminals, journey time about 45 min. Remember this city is always busy and noise can be a problem at night. I bought ear plugs and slept soundly.

The room was very clean (just a little dated) the beds were so comfortable we didn't want to get out of them. There is a very good deli next door where you can buy breakfast / Salads, very good sandwiches & cakes. Great to take up to room after a long day walking around New York. 24hr Pharmacy (sells all sorts) just on the corner. You can easily walk to Times square (10 - 15 mins) and the metro is just 2 mins, which will take you all over (at a very good price of $24 for the week). If I had one criticism it would be the restaurant. Food poor & costly, staff require more customer Service training. Oliver Tree (Time Square) for an Italian meal is a must. Quality food at a very reasonable price.

From outside it looks like something out of a film, very bling, if not a bit seventies. Arriving at the hotel: the doorman let us struggle through the door with our own bags, not a great start, and the woman behind the desk acted most upset that she had to deal with some customers. Her manner was poor, bordering on rude, when she laid down the law about how she would charge my credit card for potential damage to the room which, she was eluding to, was the 'approval' to see if the credit on the card was good. My faith in the hotel was falling. We asked if we could get a drink.... No was the answer. The bar was shut, room service was closed too and she didn't know of anywhere nearby to get a drink at that hour. By the way, we'd visited NYC before and knew that there would be somewhere - we just didnt know where in that neighbourhood and found somewhere a few days later. Our first room on the 19th floor, was cold, had broken heat, an even more broken door lock that took many to open (we went down to reception and it took 15min for anyone to show). The room was okay - broken hairdrier, good view, nice TV, great bed, though it was a little shabby. A call down to reception about the heat was ignored. Next morning we showered, in the cold (it was 13F outside so the room wasn't much more) and headed down to reception. We complained and was told that these issues would be resolved immediately. They weren't. Most of the reception staff didn't care and had to look up simple info like when the bar was supposed to be open etc. It took several more calls and a final visit to reception when the issue was finally escalated and we were moved to the 31st floor to a better (less broken) but smaller room with a better view. The new room solved most of the issues, though the doorlock was still intermittently faulty - a fault most of the other guests we spoke to seemed to agree with. The director also kindly sent a bottle of bubbly to try make it right which we appreciated and went some way to salvaging our trip. To be honest, we were so tired of complaining that we left the remaining issues outstanding as it was really spoiling our trip. Room service was dire at all times. Always at least 35+ minutes if you wanted just a coffee (no facilities in the room) and the bar regularly didnt have coffee (this is NYC for Christ's sake!). Lucky there were 2 starbucks within a block or two though it was very dissapointing not to be able to have breakfast in bed a couple of times or at least a drink before setting out. If you have to stay here, I'd recommend the mini market on 2nd ave (right out of the hotel, right again onto second and it's on the right). And for breakfast - also on Second Ave - the Townhouse Cafe had the NICEST staff and the food was great value. On the left hand side, a couple of blocks down on the left hand side of second. Conclusion. Wouldn't stay here. The Helmsley wasn't cheap and last year we paid a little more for the Hilton Times Square which was light years better in terms of facilities and service.

We absolutely loved the stay here, apart from a few hassels with the room(which I will get to later). Location of this hotel is so great, in east midtown on a busy street(42th) with aprox 15-20 min walk to times square and 25-30 min walk to central park. The hotel is right next to Chrysler Building and Grand Central Terminal, which is great for the subway (which we didnt use much of, instead we walked pretty much everywhere, location being so convenient) Our room was very huge and just great; we had two double beds (the biggest and most comfortable beds ever), a near spotless bathroom with a huge bathtub, a flat screen tv, and big windows which made the room well lit up. We did however had some issues though; there was a problem with the toilet and upon arrival the windows couldn't be sealed shut, resulting in some noise from traffic the first night, even being on 33rd floor(im a very light sleeper). The next day we spoke to reception and there was a guy to help us in 5 minutes. People at front desk were very kind, helping with all kind of questions. Very nice. There was a restaurant at the hotel that looked nice; we never tried it though as we always ate out. Same with breakfast, we took food from PAX next door(cheap and good) to our hotel room, or went to Pershing Square (not cheap but good) right opposite Grand Central Terminal. Pershing Square also had good valuable lunch and dinner. There's also a good mexican restaurant near the hotel which is recommended; it's called El Rio Grande and it's on 38th street just off 3th ave. I highly recommend this hotel for it being so good located, the friendliness of the staff and the cleanliness and high standard of the rooms.

Less than two blocks to access subways at Grand Central. I stayed for two nights (Weds/Thurs), booked in a king room. I'm a Hilton Diamond, but couldn't find a Hilton property <$500/night for this trip, so found this alternative at hotels.com for $360/night. When you arrive, you literally walk right into the registration desk. There isn't much lobby to speak of, which means at peak times, it can get quite congested and hectic at check-in. Still, check-in was friendly and prompt. I got my keys and headed to my room. Unfortunately no keys worked, I returned downstairs and got new keys. When I got into the room, I walked into a room already occupied (thankfully the guests were not there). It turns out the front desk wrote the wrong room number on my key folder (thus why the first keys didn't work). They then wrote the correct room number, another set of keys, and back up I went to find a double/double room, not a king, which I had reserved. After my third trip back downstairs, they corrected it and upgraded me to a corner premiere floor with an LCD-TV. The rooms and the hotel is definitely showing its age, but perhaps that is part of the appeal they are going for. It reminds me of the Waldorf in style...floral bedspreads and drapes; really looks like something out of the early 80's. Bed is comfortable, though linens are not the best quality. Pipes are quite loud, but given the age of many buildings in NYC, that isn't too unusual. The room and bathroom are generously sized (#3719) by NYC standards. Room service was quick, though quality was lacking and didn't match the price ($38 total bill for breakfast). WiFi is free in all rooms and public areas, a real rarity at higher end hotels. Good speed, though it does slow down a bit in the evening hours. The fitness center on the 6th floor has a good supply of cardio equipment (maybe 4-5 treadmills, 2 elipticals, and 2 bikes) as well as dumbbells (though no bench) and a small supply of machine weights. To save money, as I did, this is a good alternative. But personally, I wouldn't choose this over my usual properties in NYC (Doubletree on Lex, Hilton on Sixth, or Millenium Hilton downtown).

The rooms are very spacious and all appear to have been refurbished to a high standard. The bed is huge and super comfortable, pillows great, air conditioning and heating [all through one unit] was great too.The bathroom gives you choice of tub or shower and the towels are high quality. The room has a safe and hair dryer and 'his and hers' dressing gowns and if you request it, they will send a refrigerator up to you room and set it up [invaluable for your bottled water, beer/wine for the room]. Once your reservation is confirmed send them and email request for the refrigerator before you travel and it will be on their system when you check in. They do not provide tea or coffee making facilities but room service will provide this for you all day long and not expensive. We were on the 29th floor and there was virtually zero traffic/horn blowing noise. The lifts are high speed and with six lifts runnig all the time, you have no waiting about, even on a busy check out period. We had booked an Executive King Room through 'Hotels.com' but you can book direct through the Hotel too. The staff are excellent in every respect. The bell hops are cheary guys and whilst you need to tip them all, it is part of the New York experience. A guy called Bernado checked us in and he was mega polite and helpful; but so was every member of hotel staff that we spoke to. They gave us a voucher for a free bottle of wine if we dined in the Hotel Restaurant, which we did on the first night and the ambiance and food in the restaurant was superb; The food was excellent and we both went for the New York stripp steak-one cooked medium and one well done and they were both cooked to perfection. The free bottle of wine was a superb bottle of Chardonnay [there was a choice] and it was not expensive in our view.The Restaurant Captain was very attentive and a most pleasant guy with a good sense of humour. The concierge was excellent and advised on all local restaurants/ Diners and sight seeing and marked up maps for you- we went one evening to 'O'Niels Irish Bar and Restaurant' a stroll from the Hotel and had a great evening there and had Dublin Bangers with Mash and Onions and it was great -very reasonably priced BUT very busy in the dining area -all the food that we saw served up looked super.Back at the hotel, the concierge checked out our train departures for Long Island and were most helpful.The Helmsley Hotel is located at 212 East 42nd Street and it was, in our view, a super location to get around. Checking out was also a painless experience.SO, IF YOU ARE GOING TO NEW YORK DEFINATELY STAY HERE- IT IS BRILLIANT!! A couple of other things you might find of assistance: Getting a cab between 4pm and 8pm can be a pain but be patient. DO NOT take a non yellow cab-plenty of Lincoln type cars will stop and wave a taxi card at you but these are unregulated in New York and are not recommended to use as you can get ripped off big time. The yellow cabs are pretty cheap [compared to London Black Cabs] If you are going to New York for the first time, mixing sight seeing and shopping is a mighty task to undertake and you are on the go every hour of every day; if you can, spread it over 4 days minimum and it is then both manageable and enjoyable that way. We highly recommend the Gray Lines open top Red Buses which are 'hop on hop off' BUT buy the tickets on line first as it is cheaper [from the UK anyway] We paid $44 each for a 2 day pass which was great value and gave us 48 hour access to the three loops. These were 'Uptown loop' [Central Park and Harlem etc]'Downtown Loop' which covers all the rest of NY Sights and then the 'Brooklyn loop' but we did not go on this last loop due to lack of time [needed an extra day for this really]. The ticket also included the night tour which is NOT hop on hop off. Once on it, it lasts about 2 hours seeing the NY Skyline lit up. With the Gray Lines 48 hour ticket you also get a free ticket for the NY Water taxis so you can get over to see the Statue of Liberty. BE AWARE that you will queue for these buses but it only takes a 20 to 30 minute wait max and you get on -everybody wants to be on the top deck of course so it takes a while for the buses to get around through traffic -there are other bus service providers but Gray Lines are the best. We do recommend that you take the Staten Island ferry -it's free and you get the best views of Manhattan and Ellis Island and the Staue of Liberty and it only takes 20 minutes each way with the boats running all the itme ALSO, if you want theatre tickets DO NOT book these at home. Go to the Marriot hotel in Times Square and go the the ticket office there as the tickets are half price. If you want to go up the Empire State Building, get there for 9.30 or 10am or you will dislike the queues and crowding- early is the very best time to visit and worth the money for the experience and the view. GIRLS -if you want UGG Boots there is a shop called DAVID Z.COM yards from the Empire State [there are a few in NY-check it out on line before you travel] and they have a great selection PLUS they do the Classic tall boot for $167 INC TAX and this is about $40 cheaper than Bloomingdales.Also, if the GUYS like Cons or Vans, these are cheap here too -Converse about $43 INC TAX If you want super cheap designer gear you MUST go to 'CENTURY 21' which is opposite Ground Zero/World Trade Centre site. Top designers really really cheap BUT be warned it is VERY busy in there with serious buyers. IF you are travelling on Long Island, we recommend both the LIRR Railway [you get it from Penn Station under Madison Square Garden] -it is very clean and safe as every train has guards/ticket collectors and it is easy to use. It runs ON TIME!! Also, if you want to see Long Island [if you are going up to the Hamptons] try the 'Hampton Jitney' -a luxery coach and whilst twice the train fare, it is very efficient and good views. Check it out on line for time of trains and buses -it's dead easy and again, they ALL run on time. If you do go up to Montauk, at the tip of Long Island, check out the light house and the local views BUT for the best dining go to the 'HARVEST ON FORT POND' this is a real food experience. Not only is this a superb restaurant and very nice ambiance, the food is very different is two respects - Firstly, the food is most excellent in every way but Secondly, this is a 'family meal restaurant' which means that when you order sometihng a HUGE PORTION arrives and it is for the family to share -it is not recommended to try this restaurant unless there is a minimum of Four or you will need to take away a dooggie bag [or doggie carrier bag]. This goes for all items on the menu, so when you see a Pizza for $17 DO NOT think it is for one -it is HUGE. Again, if you are going to Long Island make a day to visit a TANGER OUTLET [we went to the RIVERHEAD Location] - this is dying and going to shopping heaven and ALL at major discounts and I kid you not on that one!!! BUT BE WARNED - It is massive in size and it will take you all day to get around it -plently of choice to eat in the food court though. We recommend a car to get to this place by the way and it is a LONG WAY from central New York and not a a day trip. Well, we hope that helps any of you that have hotel choice concerns and especially if it is your first trip to New York. It is a great place to visit BUT if you do not plan it properly, it could be a nightmare -SO spend some time on the internet and plan your trip -REMEMBER to take trainers or good walking shoes because NY is vast and what seems short on the map is not quite as short as you think it is. Last thing if you live in the UK -get the 'AA Guide to New York' -easy to carry and invaluable -it was the best thing we invested in and a week or so pre-read helped us plan a memerable trip.GOOD LUCK & HAVE FUN!!!!!!!", "Date": "September 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cNot bad\u201d", "Author": "CopenhagenKad", "ReviewID": "UR20058342", "Content": "Professional and friendly staff.

Instead of attempting to help the group, or individual travelers such as my wife and I, many members of the hotel staff decided to hide in their glass enclosed offices. When I confronted one, asking for help, he responded, \"I'm busy.\" Then went to play with something on his computer screen. Check-in took more than 20 minutes. Several times during our stay, the keycard reader for our room became inoperable, requiring a trek down to the main lobby (40 floors down), to have a new key issued. This is unacceptable in a major hotel. Checkout was also no breeze. The rate charged was HIGHER than the rate initialed at check in. The manager denied the rate was different, but upon my demand that she find the paper that I initialed, she admitted that there was a mistake. Be warned: look very closely a the rate your initialing.

The street was already packed with people lining up to get through the checkpoints (at 42nd St) to go down by the FDR Drive to see the fireworks. All the nearby restaurants, bars, etc. were filled with waiting lines. We got in line and went down to the river. We stood in amongth thousands of our closest friends behind the chain link fences and jersey walls until 9:30 when the fireworks finally went off. In hindsight, while we were close to the 42nd St. entrance, I would recommend going down near the Seaport for a better view of the fireworks - there are 3 barges in the East River, but we saw it all as one big mash - in the distance. A great disappointment - no music, just a crush. Then made our way back to the hotel - thank goodness it was nearby, but we were thirsy and starving, like everyone else. The line to the restaurant was huge, so we lined up for the bar. Got in, finally, had multiple cold drinks and a small pizza and quesdilla - they were fine. Went to bed. Checkout fine.

My expectation was that it would be a very snobby and stuffy environment ---boy was I wrong. I book on Travelzoo frequently, and I often get the associated low level of service for the low price (second class citizen treatment).

She pulled out the map of Manhattan and pretty much planned out trip for the next four days. It was like having your own tour guide. She was just amazing and her routes were fantastic. If you want to experience New York, just make sure that you speak to her. She gave us some insider tips (take the Staten Island ferry to see the Statue of Liberty since apparently, you can no longer go inside. The ferry is free.) and recommended some great places to eat (try Sarge's Deli, 548 3rd Ave, between 36th Ave and 37th Ave).

Room was fine with a king sized bed, flat panel TV, regular sized bathroom and in room safe. Apart from the street noise (just typical New York with sirens blaring and horns honking) and the occasional door closing (not sure why it is necessary to make doors so heavy that when they close, other rooms shake. Be nice to your neighbours and gently help the door close.), everything was fine. We did not eat in the hotel or use any of the facilities (there are a couple of computers for guest usage but they cost).

This hotel represents high quality and value for money. When I return to New York, I would not stay anywhere else - and I would certainly recommend it. Unfortunately for the hotel 3rd Avenue was being re-surfaced during the beginning of April, so I am sure some customers found it noisier than normal.

Returned to check-in a couple of hours later but still no smoking room ready so we accepted a non-smoking room instead and were assured it was a nice city view room - it was on the 30th floor, we could see the Chrysler and were delighted to find we had two beds instead of one to share. The hotel's staff were always very helpful and the bar was friendly. The beds were extremely comfortable and the in-room safe was a plus. Pax Deli next door to the hotel is ok for breakfast but if you walk up to the Pershing Sq Cafe (less than 5 mins, same side of road) they do a fabulous breakfast and it has a great atmosphere. The Capital Grille just a couple of mins up the road on the other side does a really nice dinner; it's not cheap but the staff are attentive and it's a pleasant treat. In the other direction is McFadden's Bar which serves some lovely fish dishes. You should have a cocktail at The View bar in the Mariott on Times Square, the views really are great & if you go for the sunset it's really quite pretty. Overall the hotel's location is great with Times Sq about 15 min walk and 5th Ave shopping a bit less.

Spotless room with huge bed and even comfy chair to sit after a very long day of walking .Only complaint for me is the lack of tea /coffee in the rooms however this is easily resolved from the Deli next door .

The hotel room was very well maintained with all mod cons, including LCD TV, recreational dressing gown and huge fluffy towels and was really warm, which was great as outside was so cold.

My wife and my self had a very pleasant and comfortable stay at the Helmsley. It's location is perfect for exploring the city, Grand Central Station only down the street, Times Sq a 10min walk one way and The Empire State a 10 min walk the other. The hotels claim of 4 stars is bit high in my opinion, I would gladly put it at 3star, not 4. The lack of a minibar, tea and coffee making facilities in rooms is a loss. There is very good cafe next to the hotel called PAX, head down there first thing and grab a coffee and some breakfast and take back to your room. We also booked a no smoking room which we got. but unfortunately the room next to us must have been smoking as we could always smell smoke, in my opinion if one room is non smoking then the whole floor should be! The bathroom was clean but a little dated, as was the decor of the room, I understand there has been some refurbishment but not on the 10th floor. The view form the room was not good, and there was some work going on to repair a flat roof that we overlooked. I have read other reviews and seen the hotel managers comments that the workers start around 10am, well they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t! I regularly observed them there between 7 and 8am...I was up so not to much of a problem but for late sleepers I could imagine it being a problem if this work continues much longer. If you do stay here try and request a high floor room so you have a better view, I wish I had asked but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really know until I had got settled. But lets be honest you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come to NYC to spend time in your room. On a plus side the room was very BIG and the bed even bigger and very comfortable. Harry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bar is a very pleasant place to unwind after a hard days shopping and the bar food is very good, try the mini cheeseburgers.

I took my mum to NY, and I'm glad I chose so well! Yes, it's pricey...most hotels in the city are. Great, friendly service (I read the reviews here and was worried about that), a nice, clean spacious room and an AMAZING VIEW (see pics). We were on the 38th floor, and the only problem we had was that the lock on our door was dodgy..it took at least 6 tries to get the door open, and after getting someone to come and 'fix' it, nothing changed. Tiny problem in the long run though. Oh, and you have to request a fridge, which we did but never received anything. We ended up buying lots of water at the nearest store and stocking it in our room. The location is unbeatable - smack in the middle of everything. Go outside, look up- Chrysler building. A 2 minute walk to Grand Central, a quick walk or taxi/subway straight to the major avenues and Times Sq. Subway station is a minute or 2 away from the hotel, and there are plenty of Starbucks around to keep you going. In the other direction 5 minutes away is the UN building. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant as it was so expensive, but we had a few Apple Martini's and mini-cheeseburgers at the bar (both delicious!). There's a great place next door which serves excellent, cheap food for a quick breakfast or lunch- so do that instead. All in all, we had a wonderful first trip to NY, and it was nice to have this hotel to come back to at the end of those exhausting days. A tip - e-mail the hotel a night or two before you arrive, and request a room on an upper floor with a view of the Empire State.

Firstly this is my only fully negative review of any hotel in NYC! After taking the advice of previous reviews on TA, on arrival I asked for renovated rooms on a high floor for myself and friends, the reception just snortled and put us in raggedy old rooms on the 11th floor directly above an adjoining roof with very very loud work going on. I assumed (wrongly) this could be sorted out the next day having arrived very late, no such luck! A different yet similarly rude receptionist just told me to get on with it. I started to wonder whether it was becasue I had booked through a well-known online hotel provider rather than with the hotel directly I was woken up by a telephone call at 8am each day by somebody speaking a foreign language but shouting \"housekeeping\", I think it was their way to get people out of bed and out of the room as quickly as possible so it could be cleaned. The noise from outside was unbearable, from the works on the roof, people next door and people outside the door, it was constant! The view was dreadful and depressing! The tap wouldn't allow for the shower to be used, only the bath, yet again nobody cared and just expected the guests to get on with things, which of course we did! I do not like writing poor reviews but will make an exception in this case as the overall experience was very very dissapointing, and when you're travelling from the UK (with transatlantic flight costs) it is very important to stay somewhere that gives excellent service with added benefits of views etc - you will not get this at the New York Helmsley.

BEST: - location is close to subway lines at Grand Central Terminal, can walk to 5th Ave. - spacious bathroom, long marble countertop, good water pressure, and outrageously thick, fluffy towels - good sized room filled with king bed, desk, night table, chair and ottoman, and tv cabinet - good illumination - arrived in the city at noon and was allowed to check in with no hesitation. Nice!! WORST: - overall, a bit worn - lack of electric outlets. Nowhere to plug computer on desk and I had to unplug hair dryer before I could plug in my cell charger. - noise from outside hall.

We didn't personally choose this hotel as it was selected by my husband's staff members. I have to say that the location of this hotel saved it from a \"terrible\" review. My complaints are mainly about the noise. I realize that New York is loud and busy but single pane windows don't work for a hotel of this calibre. I swear I heard unloading trucks and conversations from the street below at 4 and 5 am nevermind, all the sirens and honking cabs till the wee hours of the night. It was ridiculous because we were on the 25th floor. Then, they gave us a room across the hall from the lovely ice machine that served the whole floor. There was no door on the ice making room if you get my drift. Our room was small for all four of us. I had inquired about the room size prior to our arrival and I was assured that it was plenty big enough...NOT! The beds were just 2 double beds. Neither my husband or I are large people but I ended up grabbing the extra blankets and laying on the floor because the beds were so small. Any movement from my honey and I couldn't get to sleep. Then, there was the no minibar and no little coffee pot for a drink in our room. That's just ridiculous for a hotel in this city, charging as much as they do, and apparently a 4* hotel....NOT. OK. Here's some more. Never once did the bellmen/doormen(not one of the 4 standing around in their lovely long, warm hotel trenchcoats) come to open the door of our cab as we piled in or out in the bitter cold. Also, the morning that I was leaving with my daughters, I called down to the bellmen in hopes they would help me with my luggage (and I would have tipped them generously). However, I let it ring forever and no one picked up. I ended up carting my luggage down to the lobby by myself...thanks! Apparently, the hotel also almost ruined the company breakfast for 60 guests that was planned in November by my husband's company in advance. It seems the staff member that was organizing the function didn't show up for work the day of the event. No one else on staff at this hotel was aware of it apparently--too hard to believe. It was booked way in advance and confirmed the day prior. Nice! Great management. My tip for any and all visitors to New York City is to try staying at a real 4 Star hotel. I bet the Hyatt just a couple of blocks over would be a better stay. You can bet that I will be staying anywhere else next time I visit NYC.

And at the risk of being overly critical, there was a need for touch up paint on the doors, but the rest of the room was fine. The rooms are good-sized for NY's primo area and all in all, I remain very satisfied with my experience. The price of $200.00 a night for this area is hard to beat.

I read many of the reviews AFTER I booked this hotel and I have no regrets. True, there is no coffee in the room but room service will bring you a pot of good coffee for 5.95. The staff is amazing and the location couldn't be any better. My husband and I went here for our one year anniversary and now want to make it a yearly tradition with our whole family. The location is perfect-you have easy access to everything. We only took a cab once and that was to the airport (LGA). I would recommend as a tourist to get the Greyline 3 day hop on hop off pass. It is well worth the $ (112.00/per person). Note that the museums \"are donation only\" but they will ask for a certain amount-if you aren't planning on making a day of it, I would suggest maybe 10.00 rather than the 20.00 asked for. They will accept that, in fact will ask if 20.00 is okay. The people are incredible. I was apprehensive to go because of the past reputation of the city but it is now one of the safest cities in the world-I believe it! It is winter time and I am a clothes horse but if you want to see the city, do what I did and bring a few pair of jeans, some warm sweaters (winter time) and most importantly, very comfortable shoes. We walked miles and miles-I wish I had brought a pedometer so I could gauge how far we walked. The hotel also has a pretty nice workout room as well. Our room was on the 29th floor-we did have somewhat of a view of the Chrysler building but the room was so nice it wasn't an issue. The only negative thing that I can say about the room is that the lighting is very dim-especially the bathroom lighting. If you want knock off purses, skip Canal Street and go to Ground Zero, there is where you find the nice knock offs but the sellers are pretty discrete. We got 5 for $140.00, 4 Coach and 1 Kate Spade, very nice ones. Enjoy your stay, the hotel is fabulous and the food is really good and the prices are comparable to most of the restaurants.

We accepted this room which I was really glad about as we had only booked a standard room and this was an upgrade to a premier. I cannot remember the room number but it was the last number in the hotel. We walked into the room and it was spotless with a lovely view of the Chrysley building and a fantastic vie of New York itself. There was a flat screen television on the wall and an empty fridge for you to put your own things in. Concierge were also very helpful, our hairdryer wasnt working so they were up within 10 minutes with a replacement. Also the toilet flooded one morning and a plummer was up within half an hour!! I loved the location of the hotel, just out of the hustle and bustle of times square but only 10 minutes away when you wanted to walk in. Chrysler building just over the way and central station about 2 minute walk away. The Pax deli next door was delicious, I took our breakfast to our bedroom one morning and the hotel saw me taking it up and did not seem to mind at all.

We were even able to choose a smoking room on floor reserved for smoking rooms. A lot of travellers really appreciate this comfort vz standing on the street corner having a quick puff.

Look to the left and see Chrysler building in all it's glory, and to the right you can see the United Nations building. The bathroom was also very modern, clean, lots of towels, shampoos, soaps etc. and also had a small refrigerator which was fantastic. The Hotel is really classy for the price we paid, very close to many of the main sight seeing attractions which is perfect when you are on a sight seeing mission as we were. We were out for the most of each day, but when we returned from our sightseeing, the rooms were made up and everything was just perfect. We unfortunately did not sample the hotel's food, as we were on the go, but grabbed breakfast next door at PAX or up 42nd at the Grand Central Food concourse where there must be more than 40 food outlets, with every type of food conceivable and at reasonable prices. Our compliments to the management and staff for being so polite and helpful. I will always go back to The New York Helmsley on East 42nd.

We did not eat at the hotel but instead had breakfast at 'Pax' next door (good value food and handy). We found a great place to eat in the evening (Libretto's on 3rd. Avenue). Out the hotel door and turn left. Left again on 3rd. Avenue and you will find it a seven minute walk away on the right of the avenue. Great atmosphere loads of good italian food and nice wine at a good price. Family loved it. Wo Hop on Mott Street in China Town was another good experience for a family meal. This chinese 'cafe' in the basement is busey as it is well used by newyorkers (which is why we tried it after seeing the natives going in). If your stuck for time (as we were one evening when going to a show) a nice way of having fast food can be found at a no frills outlet just past and next door to McDonalds on the left past Grand Central (up the 42nd.street from the hotel). Here you can have a pizza or pasta dish made up to your own preference while you watch. You then sit down and eat it piping hot out of a plastic bowl with plastic knife and fork and a bottle of soda or water. Tip for the trip would be as we did. Go up Rockerfeller Centre in the morning and the Empire State in the evening (we went up at 11pm and found the ques to be very short). We found that newyorkers in general were either very rude or very nice and rather than get annoyed, we let there be a competion to find the rudest and the nicest.

I checked out the reviews here on tripadvisor and thought it looked a safe enough bet. We were planning on being out shopping and sightseeing all day long so all we really wanted was a clean bed and bathroom - nothing fancy. However, we didnt receive this..... On the first night my mother got into her bed and found a long black hair beside her which obviously didnt belong to her and when she pulled back the covers the sheets were stained with blood and had hairs all over them from a previous occupant. The sheets hadnt been changed from the previous guests, instead the housekeeper had simply remade the beds with soiled linen. My aunts bed appeared to be stained with urine or something else equally unsavoury. This is just not acceptable in a supposed 4 star hotel. The most basic function of a hotel is to provide a clean bed to sleep in and for over EURO 230 a night it isnt too much to expect. I simply cannot express how disgusted I am at the lack of hygiene displayed and the complete lack of pride the staff/hotel owers have in their establishment. I wouldnt invite someone into my home and ask them to sleep in soiled sheets let alone expect someone to pay for the privilege! I have been in hostels that were cleaner than this room. In the second room which my sisters and I shared there was blood stains on the carpet and the mattress bases were heavily stained but at least our sheets were clean. The rooms are badly worn and in serious need of redecorating. We were staying on the 19th floor and these are the old unrenovated rooms. After reading the reviews here it would appear that the renovated rooms are far superior to the tatty lower floors which really are not suitable to be let out. When we complained to the on-duty manager about the condition of the rooms all he could do was apologise but said that as I had paid upfront he couldnt compensate us for the stomach churning incident. I filled in a customer comment card and both my aunt and mother wrote letters to the general managers outlining how awful the rooms were but we have not heard anything back as yet. It is only 48 hours later but with something as serious as this I would have expected an immediate response. The location of this hotel is really excellent and some of the staff were very friendly and the food in the restaurant was great ( we ate there the first night before the soiled sheets incident) however this is all overshadowed by the dirt of the rooms. If a hotel cannot provide its patrons with a clean bed what else is it lacking? My advise is DO NOT STAY HERE unless you're guaranteed one of the renovated rooms!

With the exception of the helicopter trip, everything was within walking distance. The rooms were big for a New York Hotel. a HD flat screen LCD TV in our room and a comfortable bed. The room was on the 32nd floor and looked across the city skyline to the Chrysler building. Importantly the room was clean. The bar in the hotel was comfortable enough but to be fair, we were not in NY to see a hotel bar and only stopped off for a drink. We found the staff to be extremely helpful and courteous. I have seen some comments about the staff and I guess that it is just the luck of the draw. On Paddy's Day, the staff were all wering green flowers and I was chatting to the porter (Joe) about this and when we came back down to the lobby to go out, he was waiting with lapel flowers for my wife and I. A nice touch. The Pax deli is pretty nice but also walk down the street and opposite grand central, there is a lovely restaurant that serves great breakfast. They advertise it as the best in the world... I must say, it is pretty good! For a non-expensive activity, try Central Park. There is an Ice rink in the centre and some great views of the city. We walked back to the Helmsley from Central Park via 5th Avenue and visited St Patricks Cathedral. One regret was not going to the 'Top of the rock' but that is a must for next time. Locals tell us that the views are better than the Empire State Building. For nightime activities, there is no shortage but behind Grand Central station on 43rd btwn Madison & Vanderbilt you will find Annie Moores Irish pub. We didn't try the food but the beer and service was pretty good. If you do go shopping, there is a shop in the Manhattan mall that I particularly enjoyed. It's called Brookstone and is full of gadgets and gizmos as well as having massage chairs. Great place to spend an hour while the wife goes shopping! Also, bring your passport to Macy's.

The outlet stores are full of good deals and we opted for the Jersey Mall as it was 30mins on a bus from Port Authority and $10 return on the bus versus $38 and 90mins to woodbury Common.

The hotels location is second to none you have the Empire state, 5th Avenue, Grand Central, Chrysler Building, Times Square etc all within a few minute walk.

We called the switchboard who were very helpful, who put us through to the on-call doctor. The doctor suggested getting something from the local chemist. This was at 11 o'clock at night. It was only the two of us girls, both in our twenties, so I went down to reception to see if I could get some help. I explained the situation to the reception staff, who were very little help and very off-hand. The door staff were also very rude and did not offer any help, even though it meant a woman going out late at night alone in a city she wasn't familiar with. I felt very upset and completely abandoned by the staff, considering I had no choice but to go out alone to find the medication my friend needed. Time and again during our stay the staff were rude and off-hand with us, clearly favouring the older patrons. They obviously saw us as being young and potentially poor tippers!

Location-wise the hotel wins me over again. Fantastic shops such as Gap are literally a minute away. Times Square is about a 10 minute walk and everything else is nearby. The Crysler building is literally opposite the hotel and The Empire State building is quite close too. We also walked from the hotel to 5th avenue to do a bit of shopping.

Everything else about this hotel wasn't so great. It's two stars, maybe 2.5. Although the copy on the Expedia site has been changed -- no doubt due to me -- one of the reasons I booked this hotel was for \"complimentary wireless service.\" If you are on the lower floors it's all dial up. If you're on an upper floor, it's a dsl cable that isn't operational. At least it wasn't working in the room I was in, which featured a spaghetti of wires beneath the desk, not all of which were hooked up. An \"IT\" person was supposed to come up to the room to fix things while I was out but apparently never showed. I was, however, told there was \"free wifi\" in Bryant Park just three blocks away... (Bryant Park is by the Library between 5th & 6th - it's lovely place -- also where they hold Fashion Week). You can access wifi in the hotel's Business Center, but they charge a chunk. Beyond all that, the place was falling apart and on the wrong side of shabby. In the \"renovated\" room I was moved to: 1) There was garbage in the trash can by the desk 2) Three lightbulbs in the cut glass fixture around the mirror in the bathroom were burned out 3) The hot water knob on the sink was missing a finishing piece 4) The sink drain was an extremely slow drainer... 5) And scrawled onto the interior shower curtain were the words \"Too Short. Too Short.\" True, but even worse with the scribbles. When I decided to do some evening ironing so I wouldn't be so hurried in the morning before a meeting, I first thought the iron wasn't working. It turned out that the bottom outlet in the two-plug outlet I plugged into was dodgy. The top plug apparently worked because a lit lamp was plugged into it. My room had two beds so, given everything, I analyzed them closely before deciding which one to get into. One bed was rather poorly made, with a dust ruffle askew. I opted for bed #2, I don't know how anyone thinks this is a clean hotel. There's chipped paint, bad seals, spots on unholstery and carpets. It made me wonder whether some of the reviews I've read were plants. Having visited New York mostly for business many times, and stayed all over the island, I can tell you with absolute assurance that you can do better. Next time, I certainly will... I tried the Helmsley because the reviews sounded good, I'm always looking for new places (depending on the season, NY can book up so it's nice to have options), and 3.5 stars for a mid-price hotel was impressive. Beyond the location, which is convenient, especially if you want to catch the bus shuttle to LaGuardia across the street from Grand Centrel, this hotel is a bust.

Three of us sharing a room on the 39th Floor. It's in a fantastic location, just a few mins walk from Grand Central Station and Chrysler Building. Bus Stop across the road will take you all the way across 42nd Street to the West side for access to any of the Piers. Uptown/Downtown trains are available at Grand Central Station subway. The room was very well presented. We had a lot of trouble with the new flat screen TV and had to phone 'Tech Support' a lot of times, but I cannot really fault this as I believe that the flatscreens had only recently been installed and there were some teething problems which will get sorted out. The room had a double and a single bed, nice size en-suite with loads of towels, hair drier and other necessities. Only one dressing gown, but I'm certain we could have asked for more if we had really wanted them. There was fridge and a safe, ironing board and iron (didn't get much use!!) The elevator took less than one minute to get from ground floor to 39th, so no holdups there and as there are 6 elevators, there was rarely a wait. The reception staff were very efficient, it only took about 3 minutes to check in and the same to check out. The front of house guys were very friendly. Right next door to the hotel a very good coffee shop called PAX, while a three minute walk took you to Duane Reade Pharmacy/convenience shop for anything you may have forgotten to bring along. There is a very nice bar called Harrys just off the foyer and also a very good restaurant called Mindys where breakfast prices were quite reasonable. We did not use Mindys as we wanted to check out the local diners. (Johns, 45th street - very good, Comfort Diner, 46th Street - great, Brooklyn Diner, 57th Street - spectacular, though twice the price of the others) Our room was a 'Premier' room and it was slightly more expensive than standard but the few dollars more was well worth it. For anyone a little nervous of heights, you should make this known on booking so that they will allocate you a room on the lower floors.

We were on the 29th floor yet it was just as noisy as being at street level, why the room doesn't have double glazing to reduce the noise, beggars believe. Another annoying thing was the TV. It was stored in a cabinet. The cabinet doors would only open a small amount, so basically if you weren't directly in front of the screen you couldn't see it from any other angle in the room. We had a double bed and only one person laying on the bed could see the screen. We had an early morning call at 6 am even though we didn't arrange this. I'm certain this was arranged on the automated system by the cleaners in our room as we hadn't left a tip in our room every day. We had every intention of leaving them a tip on the last day, but due to this incident they got nothing. The hotel tried to charge us for room service even though we had nothing, again I think this was the cleaners ordering something from our room.

Top tips, ask for a room thats away from the street, if you want a good view then you gotta suffer the noise that goes with it. Take breakfast at Pax's deli next door, it's not the greatest, but the prices are resonable for Manhatten. Buy all your snacks, crisps, biscuits and drinks from Duane Reade ( 100 yrds away ), turn left out of hotel and then right, it's on the far corner. A 2 litre bottle of water from the Deli costs $4.00. Where as at Duane reade 4 litres will cost $1.00. Be prepared to get ripped off all over the city. I'm surprised they don't tax the air.

This was also on a non-smoking floor so I went down to reception and requested a new room and they said that the hotel was full but to come back down tomorrow morning which we did. I decided to pay the US 50 (excl) per night to get an upgraded room and this was really worth the money. Our new room was south facing on the 38th Floor. The views down 42nd street were amazing, with the Chrysler building virtually right in front of us and you could just about make out the neon lights of Times Square in the distance. The room was the same size but has been updated with nicer d\u00c3\u00a9cor and a better bed. The HDTV Plasma screen was also a bonus with many more cable channels than our old room and complimentary internet through the TV. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat in the hotel restaurants as the prices were a bit steep and so we made use of the Pax Deli next door which was really nice. Grand central is only a 5-10 minute walk down 42nd with some nice and reasonable priced restaurants down stairs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but you are spoiled for choice in NYC. The other hotel guests were a mixture of tourists, business men and flight crew and even though the hotel was full it never felt over crowded. On return to JFK I used the Airlink shared taxi (through their website) which cost about $15. This was really quick but I was the last pickup on the way.

I could only hear it when someone was dispensing ice. I can't say that it bothered me at all. Also, in regards to noise, there was some hammer-type noise coming from the floor above us. This happened on two of our four mornings there. I'm not sure if there was renovation or if our neighbors upstairs were up to something. I'm a heavy sleeper, so this didn't bother me either, and I only noticed it when I woke up. The staff was very helpful and pleasant at all times. I did not feel as though anyone on the staff constantly had a hand out for a tip. We were, of course, happy to tip them as they were pleasant - and it's just what you do in NY. When in Rome, right?

After searching the internet for a reasonably cheap holiday to New York, we came across this hotel. As this was to be our first time in New York we requested a king size bedroom with a good view. When we arrived, we were really happy with the appearance of the front of the hotel, with the bell boys outside opening the doors for us, made us feel important. Check in was very fast and efficient, considering there was about 20 virgin reps checking in at the same time. The receptionist was very pleasant and informed us she had upgraded us to an executive room at no extra charge. We were on the 41st floor (very top floor). On walking into the room, it was huge (for a hotel room). The bathroom was lovely decorated, as was the whole room. Our bed was huge, we had a flatscreen huge tv mounted onto the wall. The best bit was to come, we opened the curtains and the view of the Empire State Building was just amazing. The cleaners changed our towels everyday, and tidied our room when we had made a little mess. The bell boys were very informative. There was however two things we wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so happy about. Although we took part in the New York \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tipping system\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I did come across one rude bell boy. He carried our luggage on the last day to a store cupboard 2 feet away and would not give our tickets to us unless we tipped him and just stood there holding his hand out. Another thing to be aware off is the phone in the room. We did not intend on using the hotel phone. but our mobile phones would not work in New York, and the pay card we had purchased would not work either, we resorted to using the hotel phone to inform people back home we were there safe and well. You know what its like when your away you can never remember the international codes, then the code for dialling out of the USA. So after about 4 blank attempts at trying to phone home we eventually got through. What we wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t aware of for all the times we had dialled the wrong numbers we got charged for even though we never even spoke to anyone on the other end of the line. We spoke to the receptionist and informed her we would not be paying the $225 dollars they billed us for as we had not spoke to anyone.

The room was unremarkable, very \"motel-like,\" perhaps because the TV was small and on a stand rather than in an armoire. Of the few outlets in the room, only the one into which the TV was plugged was actually accessible. The others required crawling on the floor or moving furniture, only to discover that the outlet might not actually work. The climate controls were rudimentary at best, and the AC seemed to run constantly no matter what the temperature setting. I asked for a fan, and housekeeping delivered a fan that had no knob. When I finally found a working outlet, and a pair of tweezers, I discovered that the knob was apparently missing because the fan did not work. I requested a second fan, and this one had a broken blade than sat at the bottom of the case and impeded the rotation of the other blades, which made the fan jump around like one of those cartoon alarm clocks. When I called Housekeeping a third time, they did not answer, so I took my fan to the lobby, where I was forced to circumnavigate the ridiculous late-night security features. These consisted of blocking the entrance to the elevators from the side of the lobby nearest the front desk, forcing people to walk all the way around the lobby for no apparent reason. However, the manager was able to convince Housekeeping to provide me with a non-damaged, functional fan. The beds were quite brick-like, and the pillows were uncomfortable for reasons that I cannot quite put my finger on. The tub had a tendency to back up during showering. Last but not least, there was an ice bucket, but there was no information regarding the location of the ice machine.

We had a great time in the city and our experiences at the Helmsley contributed in no small way to our enjoyment of the Big Apple. The Hotel is centrally situated and is very close to Grand Central ; this was of special advantage to us as it is pretty easy to get to Grand Central from anywhere in the city. The staff in the Helmsley were helpful and courteous at all times ;when the elevators developed a problem on a busy Sunday morning,the staff facilitated guests through the use of the service lift,for instance. We were particularly impressed with the concierge service. We stayed in a Deluxe King bedroom and we both agree that the ambience of the room was excellent( We were at the top of the Hotel on floor 41 so traffic noises were within reason).If you haven't been in a big bed before, then this is the place to go! Room was cleaned every day,we got plenty of big and small towels and the New York Times arrived at our door every morning. The TV set was of high quality but we didn't get much time to sit and watch. The radio was good ( FM seems to focus on music and AM on talk shows in NY ) One problem we had with the room was the lighting. It was difficult to read ; the table lamps proved good lighting for getting about generally but were not conducive to reading. It was difficult to read in bed....it is unfortunate that lights aren't provided over the bed to allow guests to read in comfort while resting in bed. We didn't take breakfast in the Hotel and we only had late night drinks on one occasion; the drinks were very expensive but the bar is very attractive. Although we didn't do it ,we were surprised to notice that guests are allowed to take food to their rooms.....for instance,I met a guest in the lift with a large pizza !! Coffee....very nice coffee..... was available in the foyer free of charge in the morning ; we are not sure if this is common practice in New York but it was a plus for us in this hotel. This hotel is a little expensive but ,on balance, it is worth it. We would stay here again .It is clean,has courteous staff and the bedrooms are attractive.

Summary: Very good quality, great value for money, would def stay there again and recommend it. Expedia rate it 3.5*, I'd give it 4.5*. Great deal through Expedia - could have paid slightly more for a high floor executive room on the hotel's own web site. Pros: Friendly and helpful staff, large clean rooms, lots of towels and good toiletries. Iron and ironing board. 3 phones, cheap local calls from room. Reasonable range of TV channels plus pay to view movies. Great location. Cons: Low floor (8th) on 42nd St - a little traffic noise during the rush hours but no great problem for us and quiet at night. Blinds don't open/close easily - need replacing, but curtains open/close easily giving complete black out at night. Carpet a little worn and could do with replacing, but these unrefurbished rooms are much better than I had expected from other reviews on this page. No in room safe in standard rooms.

Plenty of storage and hanging space. Oblique view of Chrysler from room at front (42nd st) and a better view of the Empire State from friends' room at back (43rd st). Cocktail bar good value for money for us Brits as the \u00c2\u00a3 is strong right now. Waitress had a dry sense of humour - loved her. 15% service added to bar bill automatically and highlighted - very honest and reasonable. Strawberry Daiquiri's very artificial and not very strong. Good bar snacks; free hors d'oeuvres during happy hour (5pm to 7pm). Tipped the bell captain a dollar a bag for looking after our 8 cases on checkout, and tipped another dollar a bag to a different guy when we retrieved them. Tipped the doorman $5 for loading them into the taxi. All seemed quite happy, and you expect to have to tip in these situations. Deli next door has excellent food, but self service and quite busy. Andrew's coffee shop on 43rd near the side of Grand Central very cheap, good American breakfast, friendly service. Pershing Square (under the road bridge over 42nd outside Grand Central) very good quality food (real maple syrup!) but poor luke warm coffee, slow service, and 3 times the price of Andrew's!

Sure enough when we came back to collect them it was a different porter who was very rude when we refused to tip again for lifting the bags out of the closet. It's such a pity that this spoiled what was otherwise a great stay. My advice would be to tip the first guy, and refuse to tip the second.

However we were greeted by friendly and helpfull staff although we were booked into smoking rooms, (not the fault of the hotel it was the travel companys fault). They made sure the rooms were still ok for us and I can say we were pleased with the overall quality. We arrived late but they informed us that there was a free shuttle bus going to Universal Studios in the next hr and could at least find our bearings and have a look around tonight. The staff printed maps and specific locations that we required for the following day/s and the bar was small but pleasant after a long day out. Starbucks and a great basic shopping centre across the road and various eating places in walking distance made this a great location. A taxi back from the 'Walk Of Fame' only cost $15 dollars so you can stay out longer without having to worry too much about getting back to catch the last shuttle from Universal Studios at 8pm.

We were in the LA area to make a delivery, and figured we would stay the night and have some fun in the big city. The Sportsmen's is close to many great restaurants and bars on Ventura Blvd, so we didn't have to travel far. We enjoyed a lovely meal at Ahi Sushi the next block over, and had great cadillac margaritas at MexiCali a few blocks down the other way. Yes, the hotel is older and slightly warn, but the place has a great funky vibe going on. The lobby bar was only open in the evening, but we enjoyed great company with our fellow travelers over delicious mai tais and conversation about LA and Studio City. We had such a great day at the Sportsmen's, we decided to stay another night and soak up more of the city. The hotel is conveniently located with many restaurants, bars and shops within a few blocks. There's a grocery store across the street for those forgotten items, and it's just a few blocks off the freeway, making it very convenient. There was a some type of movie being filmed when we first got there, but in no way did we feel it distracted from the common areas of the hotel. The second night there was a huge class reunion party in the gardens by the pool, but the kids were having a great time, and quite frankly the noise of their revelry was downright cheerful. The staff we dealt with at check-in and other times were all very helpful and pleasant. When we initially checked in, the gentleman at the front desk asked if we had a AAA card, and he was able to give us a great discount with our card. He didn't have to do that! All in all, we've decided any time we come back to the Studio City area, we will definitely stay at the Sportsmen's Lodge. I was hesitant to reserve here initially, due to the myriad of unpleasant reviews, but I can say we were very happy with every aspect of our stay -- thanks Sportsmen's for a great weekend!!

Looked good upon check-in, older, little funky- parking was easy.Was told no continenal breakfast disappointed, also thought travel book said rooms had frig and microwave, there weren't any. Funny- moldy, antiseptic smell in our hallway to our room. I could ignore that, if the rest were good. The room was fine, as promsed pool acess. The heated pool was great, the jacuzzi has a warning sign that it will strip your hair color. Couldn't stand the smell, it burned my eyes. Don't think it has to be that harsh, other places manage to tone that down. The walls are very thin, we could hear our neighbors tv. But all of this isn't the worst of it, at 6am on Sat morning we were wakened by noise outside our room, workers were sitting up tables for some event right in front of our pool acess. I called the front desk to ask what was the deal, they denied anything going on out by the pool. I said I see 6 round tables- oh those tables, the front desk said. Oh, tgey offered to move me, I was sick and I was leaving the next day, I wasn't moving. Yes, I could squeeze by the table in a wet bathing suit, but I wouldn't. There were other places to set up the lunch for the group there, why in my pool acess?? I happened to be very sick before their lunch, so I never got a chance to be inconvienced by the people. That said, I had to stay in my room that night, and I was jolted out of sleep at 8pm, by \"Karens \" dj. I wish I wouldn't have been sick, I would have joined the party. There is an open area and the noise just travels in between the building and bounces around. It was so loud, luckliy, I had ear plugs with me, so I could sleep my sickness away. Never been sick in a hotel room and I had the misfortune to be stuck in my room here. Bottom line at this place, EVENTS COME FIRST.

Long story short, I drove from San Diego for over 2 hours with my 3 year old daughter to surprise my husband for his 40th birthday. His company is located in this area, knowing that many of his colleagues stay at this hotel I booked a room for one night. At roughly 11pm the nightmare began. The room next to us became increasing loud and obnoxious as the night went on. From loud laughing, yelling and talking to finally sex that became so loud anyone walking by within earshot would have been able to hear it. I called the front desk a total of 3 times starting at 11pm to voice my concerns. I was told they would call the room and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153take care of it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Working in the hotel industry myself in the past (Westin Hotels) I know the importance of customer satisfaction as the customer is PAYING for a night away to get peace and quiet and most importantly, sleep! Something my family was NOT afforded last night at your establishment. After 3 phone calls to the front desk I was offered a room change at 1am. Let my say for common sense purposes that option was NOT possible. My 3 year old daughter was finally asleep after all the noise that kept her up. At that point changing rooms would not have been feasible. I want to be reimbursed for this nightmare of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trip\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to your hotel. In essence, I paid to be kept up ALL night by ignorant guests at your hotel. What is more disturbing is the lack of pure good judgment on the part of your employees who told me \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we will take of it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd then the manager \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would like you to calm down\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd offering me a 25% discount. Given what we put up with last night you people should be reimbursing me IN FULL, so that I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel the need to repeat what happened with your hotel to every single one of my husband business associates. As previously stated, your hotel is where most of them stay when here on business. I am expecting someone to get back to me regarding this letter ASAP. My sister is a journalist for the local paper and I would not want to have to get the local media involved as it would severely DETER guests from ever staying at your hotel again. My experience and being offered a 25% discount in short, NOT ACCEPTABLE. If I am not reimbursed I have no problem writing to the head of your establishment, the federal trade and better business bureau to ensure this NONSENSE doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen to the next person.

There is nothing like being on vacation and sitting by the pool with a nice cold drink. We were looking forward to relaxing for the weekend. Unfortunately, that was not the case at the Sportsmen's Lodge. We were never informed that the pool was a public pool! It was hard to find a chair to sit in and the pool was crowded, nothing relaxing about that. The service was awful, the waitress was not only slow but couldn't understand our food or drink order. It took her 20 minutes to understand what we wanted then another 10 minutes to put it in the computer only to put it in wrong and another 20 minutes to fix the problem. Not only could she not back -up the bartender, there was only one bartender who was great but constantly leaving the bar to deliver food to the pool area. We waited two hours for our food then another hour for our check. When we went up just for drinks we waited an hour so we would each order two drinks only to have them get hot in the sun otherwise it would be another two hours before we got another one! That was only Saturday! On Sunday morning we decided we would eat in the cafe, food was ok but again 2 hours to get food and there were only two other tables in our area. We started our day early, by 10am the pool was filled with what we named \"the bracelet people\" again no place to sit and no towels. We were there for a wedding so we all together had about 15 rooms. We were also told the hotel was sold out, so why would you have public swimming at your pool when your hotel is sold out and no where for your paying guests to relax or swim. We had one table and two lounge chairs between 20 of us because there was no other place to sit, we had to alternate who sat and who stood. We even had a person come sit in the middle of our group! I had two rooms in the hotel and that is not what I paid for! In all my years of traveling (34 yrs) I have never seen anything like this! On Monday morning we checkout early and ate breakfast elsewhere. Your hotel is poorly managed! I would have put a sign up a month before that the pool would not be open to the public that weekend because the hotel was full. I think if it was not for the convenience of the banquet hall next door you would not have the amount of guests staying in your hotel. I know that when I come out again and it is for a wedding there, I will not stay at your hotel. I will drive the extra time it takes to stay elsewhere. When we checked out we were asked how was the wedding, we said \"great\". And then we were asked how was our stay and we said \"Not so great\", we were never asked why it was not great and what was wrong with our stay. Again poor management! I did learn one thing and that is from now on I have to ask a hotel if they have public swimming so that I do not book there.

After some hunting around I found the ADSL router in the room (yeah, really.. some borked internal DSLams or something) and cycled the power, which restored service. What was the real big issue though was the speed. The room advertised \"high speed internet\" but the actual speed never peaked above 0.2 mbit (which isn't even enough to play youtube video at the lowest quality), with dropouts and massive packet loss. The technical support department, again, did nothing to help. The net is free, granted, but given that it was completely unusable, i'd have much preferred to have paid for a decent service.

Our flight into LA had us arriving well after 10:00 PM, yet we found the staff to be welcoming and friendly. We had booked the studio suite poolside, and found it to be quite roomy with a couch and chair/ottoman. Windows lined one wall with views of the pool and the hills across Ventura. We noted when we got to the room, that the refrigerator was not there as had been the expectation..a call to the front desk brought an attendant with the fridge within 15 minutes! We also received exceptional service from housekeeping staff, pool bar, and Cafe staff! I have even observed maintenance staff working to clean around the pool and parking lot areas well into the evening. The price of the rooms seems to be reasonable for the area.

There is also no shop there for forgotten neccesities or souvenirs like in most hotels, though there is a grocery store across busy Venture Blvd. and drug/ convenience stores nearby.

I think the hotel should eliminate these from their pricing structure as it made us think twice about staying there. They give you a parking pass and instruct you to place it on your dash.

It had a timeless kind of feel to it with all the pictures on the walls of old Hollywood actors and film-makers. The check-in staff were nice and helpful. We were helped with our bags as soon as we arrived so we didn't have to personally lug them to our room. A man by the name of 'Justino' was especially helpful and happy to help with anything we needed. He took our bags to our room for us and was very thorough with explaining everything. The lobby has an open fire, couches, bar, hair salon and business centre. We didn't use the internet though as our friends staying at the hotel had a laptop. The restaurant (Patio Cafe) is cute and decked out in all old-fashioned seats and tables. You feel like your in an old-time movie. The food was FABULOUS for reasonable prices and was able to be taken back to the room. The bathroom was squashy, but seemed to be OK for just the two of us. The shower was hard to work out at first, but I guess that's because we aren't from the United States! The TV had MANY, MANY channels which we enjoyed and had plenty of pay movies which are either old, classic, in cinemas or just released on DVD. The beds were the most comfortable I have ever slept on and the pillows were amazing! I wanted to take one for myself! ;-) hehe Sleep was interrupted one night (we were on the 2nd floor). Kids were very noisy and a bus was parked outside the hotel with it's engine running which seemed to go on ALL night! We asked to move to the 5th floor, and the staff gladly helped us with that the next day. They also provide free wake-up calls!! We were pleased to see a table and chairs with an extra lamp in the room and got a \"Welcome to LA\" book to read. There is cupboard and drawer space and a nice lil balcony with a nice view of the mountains. Not sure if it was Laurel Canyon that we were looking at??? Downsides: -One elevator was out-of-service for the duration of our stay making it slower to get to and from the bottom of the hotel/lobby -Front desk people said there was no other way to get to Warner Bros studios apart from taking one of their private cars (Over $100 just to Burbank one way!!!) We ended up using public buses and got there for $5 return trip each!!!!!!!! Always explore all transport options! There is always more than one way!!! -Chemicals in the pool & spa were VERY strong, I'm guessing because of the large size of the pool. If your kids have sensitive skin I would just be wary of that. (But they should be fine because a little girl with severe skin problems went in the pool and she seemed to be OK surprisingly. But the kids did smell of chemicals when they got out. So there are pros and cons to the pool which is a great size though and can fit something like 150 people) -Noisy kids in the room next to us and people constantly slamming doors! -The perv looking down on the kids in the swimming pool one morning from the 4th floor. This is LA, watch your children!!! Apart from these few gripes, we liked the hotel and would probably stay here again. But not for long term. You can get better value elsewhere.

Furniture and carpet were in good condition, the bed had an extremely comfortable pillow-top mattress, and the bathroom was lacking the grout stains or smeared caulk that you see in truly run-down hotels. Each room had a nice porch area with chairs and a small table (the hand rail desperately needed painting, however). Overall, a great value at our $95/night rate. One aspect of the hotel that really stood out was that it is located in a nice neighborhood, rather than alongside a busy highway (although the highways are only a few blocks away). Ventura Blvd. around the hotel was fun to walk upon arrival. There are loads of shops, restaurants, wine bars, coffee shops, etc. The hotel cafe was fine for breakfast, but we were really pleased with the 24-hour deli/diner (Jerry's?) a half block down Ventura Blvd. for breakfast and late dinners/snacks. An Italian restaurant across the street (Risotto's) also deserves mentioning for very good fine dining. The supermarket across the street (Ralph's) served as our tailgate headquarters (we were going to the nat'l championship football game) and had everything we needed except a crying towel. A Starbucks is also just across the street and a Pete's coffee about two blocks down Ventura Blvd.. The olympic size pool surrounded by the courtyard was a big surprise and made me wish it weren't January. The most serious complaint that I had was not being allowed to use the luggage cart at check-in or checkout. We had to unload a Ford Expedition that was filled to the ceiling with all seats folded down for full cargo capacity. The cart really would have helped. We were told its use by guests was prohibited by their insurance company, but I think they should talk to their insurance carrier, or maybe another one. I haven't heard of a wave of luggage cart litigation gripping the country. I would have spent $40 on bellhop tips getting all that gear unloaded and later reloaded into car.

The switch for the lamps on the nighstands were on the lamps themselves (I've stayed in hotels where I had to get out of bed to turn off the nightstand lamp), There was a recycling container for paper, cans, and bottles (nice touch!). There is a card for breakfast service that you hang on the doorknob. There is a \"do-not-disturb\" sign you can hang on the doorknob (Yes - I have actually stayed somewhere that did not have \"do-not-disturb signs!). There is a back entrance that you can access with your room key (which is near the elevator and much closer to the parking lot). The wi-fi service is an additional $10 for 24 hours.

There was only one bar of soap (instead of one for the sink and one for the shower). My biggest complaint, however, is regarding the shuttle service to Universal Studios. The current driver is consistently late leaving the hotel for the park and leaves the park early when bringing guests back to the hotel. The driver is required to write down a return time from the park (there are only 3 to choose from) for each guest he brings to the park. I chose 5 PM. I arrived at the pickup spot at 4:50. I waited until 5:15 to call the hotel because the driver never showed and I was told that he had already completed his 5 PM pickup. Then I was put on hold while they \"tracked him down\" but he couldn't be found. The hotel took my number and said they would call me back as soon as they found the driver. I decided to just take a cab. I was already back at the hotel by the time the front desk called me back. The shuttle service was the main requirement when I was researching hotels, so for this to be the subject of my biggest complaint is very disappointing. Like the title of my review states, don't stay here if you plan on using the shuttle to Universal Studios. Note: My reservation confirmation stated that parking was $10 per night. I was not charged parking for my stay, but I do not know if it was because it was comped due to the shuttle service incident, so if I were you I would call the hotel directly.

The \"free\" breakfast was pretty limited but got us going. Pool was wonderful, hot tub a little small but manageable. Drinks at poolside was very expensive but what bar in CA isn't. Many reviews stated loud on the weekends but our stay during the middle of the week was very quiet. Hotel a bit difficult to get out of on a busy Ventura Blvd. but not impossible. Shuttle to Universal was prompt and very convenient. Only real negative was the room service. Tried to order the pizza special but no luck. Called and no answer the first try, 2nd attempt they put us on hold for several minutes. Finally called the front desk and they referred us to a ma and pa pizza joint...pretty sad to lose business but in the end, great pizza. We did the Universal package (free park, free breakfast, 7 day tickets) which was a good value for a 2 night stay but if I had to pay the $159.00+ nightly rate, I would look elsewhere or keep watching for a better deal.", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern California", "Title": "\u201cFunky but fine.\u201d", "Author": "TravellingwithTeen53", "ReviewID": "UR41654926", "Content": "We liked our stay here.

I suggest that you book this hotel at least a month in advance so you get the Advance Purchase rate, which is much more reasonable. (The peak rates are ridiculous for a 3 star hotel!). I had a rather uninspiring street view from my balcony, but pool view rooms are probably too noisy, with the DJ playing by the pool all afternoon, kids splashing around until quite late and rowdy adults at the pool bar in the evenings! For a hotel that welcomes many international guests, they can only cash $50 worth of travellers cheques each day, which was rather frustrating! This hotel is excellently located for trips to Universal Studios (tickets and transport arranged by the hotel) and Warner Bros Studios (I highly recommend the Warner Bros VIP Tour!) And it's not far from the nightlife in West Hollywood. But it's a very long drive to the beaches, what with the incessant traffic.

I really have mixed feelings about the place. Overall, I would say I enjoyed our stay, but there are some aspects about this hotel that one should be aware of. The location is excellent. Very close to many of the usual tourist attactions in LA-Universal Studios, Hollywood, Beverly Hills, etc. Our room was very clean and comfortable, although we were disappointed to learn that we could not get a roll away in our room that already had 2 queen beds. The public areas in the hotel are looking a bit worn. I suspect the hotel was at one time \"the place\" to stay in the Valley. If you check out their website, they are sort of pretending to be something they are not anymore. One of the main reasons I chose this hotel was because of what apearred to be a great swimming pool, which is of course of significant importance if you are traveling with children. I must say that the pool itself was truly excellent. It's huge, heated, and very clean. There are plenty of lounge chairs and a nice pool bar. You can tell that the pool is the main focus of the hotel. Half of the rooms have a pool view as we did with a second floor balcony and it was really a nice view. But here's the rub. While the pool is great, the people hanging around it are really not. As has been suggested in other reviews, it can get pretty loud at night if you have a poolview room. Right below our room there was a group being pretty loud until 10 or 11 at night. I can't blame them-they're on vacation and having fun. But it kind of sucks when you're on a 2 hr time change and you're trying to get some sleep. Luckily we were not there on a weekend night when it sounds even worse with live music. One night there was a group of ten 17 or 18 years old playing in the pool, and being loud welll after the pool had closed at 9pm. To the hotel's credit, I did see a hotel employee come out at around 10p to tell them that the pool was closed, and after about 20 min of continuing to screw around, they finally got out, and after another 30 min of making more noise at the poolside they finally took it inside. Another aspect of the pool that bothered my wife more than me, was that it really wasn't a great \"family atmosphere\". Nothing terrible, but watching some fat 50 something year old guy making out in the pool with his wife/girlfriend/bimbo in front of my kids just isn't really cool. So, would I stay here again. Maybe. My kids actually enjoyed it a lot. They loved the pool. I had my earplugs with me so I managed. It was a fun place, and if you're a couple looking for a hotel with a good pool scene and don't mind staying up late, then you'll probably enjoy it.", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cNOT a family favorite!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Dynomutt", "ReviewID": "UR33905101", "Content": "We were here for business and friends.

More kids did show up while we were there, but this is definitely not a family atmosphere. The carpet was stained and clearly not cleaned in a long time, the ceiling in the shower was bowed - seemed to be from humidity and/or mildew. The room was always far more humid than outside. The cleaning crew often didn't replenish something... one day it was washcloths, a few times it was shampoo, soap, etc. This hotel charges about $10 for Internet Access, $10 for parking, and ridiculous amounts of money for the \"media center\" use ($3 just to get the computer to turn on).

We opened the patio to have a look round when we first got into the room & noticed the fly screen but didn't pay much attention to it. (we've never used one). Unfortunately we left the door open which was enough time for a few flies to join us. Daft as it may seem I couldn't sleep that night although my husband had got rid of all the flies we could see at the time, and he got rid of a couple more when we came in later on - I just felt like there were things crawling on me all night.

I was absolutely shattered the next day when we were doing most of our sightseeing. Other than this the room was spacious and the beds very comfortable. A coffee maker was provided plus a fridge and there was a hairdrier and an iron and ironing board. There was no safe in the room and when we asked for one of the safety deposit boxes at Reception there were none left. One of the Receptionists said he would let us know if one became available but one didn't.

I'll admit that it is outdated, for the most part, although some rooms were renovated a couple of years ago but the rooms remain very clean and spacious. The hotel has two restaurants, one casual and the other white tablecloth, and both offer excellent food at reasonable prices. The Olympic-size pool is wonderful for serious swimmers and frolickers alike, and a cute tiki bar offers every favorite libation. The grounds around the hotel could use some sprucing up, though. Some staff members seemed a little indifferent to the needs of guests but most were nice enough. The neighborhood is safe and walkable with many restaurants and shops located up and down Ventura Blvd., including a Ralph's grocery store just across the street that is open 24 hours. The location, itself, is very convenient to any other area attractions that beckon tourists. I highly recommend staying here if you don't mind a laid-back, unpretentious atmosphere. The rates are reasonable and the parking is free, which normally isn't the case in the LA area.

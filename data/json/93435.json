Arrived after a long haul flight to find rooms were not ready, they did however store our luggage until later in the day when the rooms were ready - arrived at our room to find no bedding on sofa bed - however, this was quickly remedied by the housekeeping team. Positives... location is very good, our room looked out to the side and was quiet - air con was a nice addition. The hotel is very dated, but to give housekeeping their dues it was spotlessly clean - they do the best they can. Lovely big room, ours was an open plan room with a king bed, sofa bed & small dining table & kitchen. Friends stayed in a massive two bedroom room which would be ideal for families. The 'Safe' for storing valuables was in a room beside reception, which meant you had to wait until they could take you through to access your belongings - the safe boxes were very long but narrow - just fitted a wallet, so no chance of video/camera equipment. There wasn't a charge though, so I can't complain too much. Overall, a great base to see the city - but don't expect too much from the staff (with the exception of Anne at the front door - who was very friendly & in charge of tourist info/bookings/tickets etc) the general attitude and standard of customer service was poor, but sadly seemed to be pretty 'normal' in New York...", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bloomington, IN", "Title": "\u201cGreat in every way\u201d", "Author": "INTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR126340893", "Content": "We had a wonderful stay here, 2 nights for a family-of-five sightseeing trip in NYC. After spending several nights in tiny chain motel rooms, our Junior Suite (2 queen beds plus sofabed) was HUGE, and this was so nice. The beds were very comfortable, and I loved the pillows. Everything was super clean, the bathroom and kitchenette were small but it gave us the sense of what it is like to live in the city. The shower pressure was good, the kitchen was clean, stocked with 4 plates, bowls, cups, cutlery, plus a few pans (we should have brought a spatula), full-size refrigerator and stove. There were plenty of places to put all our bags. So the room was excellent, especially for the money. The staff was also excellent, extremely friendly and helpful. We arrived before noon, and they were able to find us a room so that we could check in early and go out sightseeing; the day we left, they held our bags all day and we picked them up in the evening, and they were very kind to us and to the kids. The concierge was friendly and helpful about getting around New York. There was not much of a lobby, but we didn't need one, and the clientele seemed a good mix of families, teens, students, and other visitors to the city. We used their parking garage for our car; there might have been cheaper options nearby, but this was extremely convenient as it coordinated with the bellman. Finally, the location - perfect, a nice area, we walked everywhere, to the United Nations, back from the Empire State Building late at night, to Grand Central Station, it was not much walking at all (you have to expect this in the city). There were restaurants and shops nearby, although we didn't use any of them. Oh, and the website booking form was really good. One thing I recommend is booking more than 2 weeks ahead, because the rates then were fantastic, they went up closer to the time we stayed.

Upon arrival we asked at the reception if there was any problem about leaving the parking a few hours later than the 24 hours. I want to point out that we arrived in a vacation day so we would could had parked in the street for a few hours and so the car wouldn't had been over 24 hours in the hotel parking. His answer was \"don't worry about that\". So the car was in the parking lot for 29 hours in total. Before we left the hotel, I talked to the same person that the day before. My surprise is that they have charged me $ 27 without my consent (VISA) for those 5 hours.

Eastgate is fairly standard for the amenities that a converted apartment building offers. The rooms range from studios to multi room suites.

It was comfortable, clean, fairly quiet and a bit sparce in furnishings. There was a queen sized bed with a table, a nightstand with an alarm clock, a TV on a stand in the corner, a seperate chair and a dresser. I guess the large size of the room made it seem a little empty. This is probably a good thing if you have a lot of belongings with you and you need to spread out. I checked in around 1:30 am after a long day at work. The hotel clerk was very pleasant as was the doorman. I had forgotten a razor and shaving cream and was provided with both after asking if any was available. I was also offered ther toiletries which I declined. The bed was comfortable and everything looked to be clean. The room was a bit warm even though the heat was set low. Again, this was probably good given the outside air was below freezing. With the AAA discount I paid $85 before taxes and $103 after they were added in. Thie is excellent for a New York hotel with large rooms. The location is pretty good. The UN and Grand Central terminal are about 5 minute walks in opposite directions. Grand Central offers entry into many subway lines and you can get anywhere fairly quickly.

The food around the hotel is great. There are excellent grocery stores (D'Agostinos, Walgreens, another on 2nd Ave). There are a couple of diners, restaurants and fast food /great NY slice/bagel places nearby, all very short walking distance. Not to mention Grand Central's dining concourse. We stayed on the Westside on the 23rd floor. This was perfect. We did hear a bit of noise but nothing that bothered me much. This might be a draw back if you are a very light sleeper. There is a great little kitchen and a lot of room for NYC standards. It's unfortunate internet isn't free, but it's not too badly priced - $45 or so for the week we stayed. For someone like me, this is worthwhile. It is nice there is a printer in the lobby as you end up buying tour tickets/broadway tickets you don't want to search for a printer. It does come at a price though. Housekeeping was excellent. The rooms were so clean. I guess the table was a bit chipped on the side but honestly, I don't care. It was clean, a great location for someone who has been to NYC before (or even someone who hasn't, as long as you aren't on very limited time). It's not luxury, but it is far better than I expected. If you know it is 3 stars, you will be very content. I got a bit worried as I walked in as the lobby is tiny and the corridors look a bit dingey, but upon opening the door I breathed a sigh of relief - big rooms, clean sheets, clean bathroom and not anywhere near as dated as I expected after reading trip advisor!

The laundry in the basement was available all day long and I was able to get a washing machine and dryer both times I needed to. We had to pay for wifi, and the weekly rate was not too bad. Because I had trouble with accessing it a few times, the cost was totally refunded to me, which was not necessary but much appreciated. The area is a quieter one for NYC, but close to bus routes and not too far to the subway. NYC is a city for walking anyway, so we were happy with where the hotel was located. Perhaps first time visitors might want to be in a more vibrant area, or if you want night life this might not be the right place. But for us it was ideal. The staff were friendly and helpful at all times, from those at the front desks to the cleaners to the doormen.

Having a kitchen and dining table was also great. We didn't cook any meals but was lovely to be able to spread out, bring back salads etc and sit up at the table.

The price was right and the location was good (we walked everywhere from here). I was very concerned when we walked into the lobby.

I was pleasantly surprised when we walked into the spacious rooms. It really looked like it had been an apartment that was now a converted into a hotel. We had a kitchen, dining area, living room, and a 1/2 bath off that area. Then the bedroom was very large with some seating and an attached full bath. The room was spotless but very dated. Clearly it was maintained well, but the decor really needs a do-over. The kitchen had very clean, but very old appliances. The cabinets had new doors, but the cabinets themselves were metal. That means old. It didn't bother me at all because I was after the value and we sure got that. Overall, the room was very clean, the staff was extremely helpful, and the location was great. I would most definitely visit this hotel again and would recommend it. NYC can be very expensive and rooms short on space, so this was a great find. If you're looking for a boutique hotel, modern or stylish decor, this is not the place for you. If you're looking for lots of room, cleanliness, good location and great value, then definitely check this out. We did not experience street noise and slept very well.

I spent a whole day trying to find a hotel in a good location that would accommodate the 5 of us. If you are traveling with only 2 children you have many options. If you have more than 2 children you can't fit into most of the decent hotels in NYC unless you pay for 2 rooms. On advice from fellow trip advisor users I found the Eastgate Towers. We paid about $200 a night with our AAA card for a 2 queen bed junior suite that also had a small kitchen and pull out sofa. The $200 doesn't account for the almost 15% tax. BE AWARE: When I made the reservation in January I was sure to clarify that I needed a room with the 2 queen beds. Then a few days before arriving called again to make sure my reservation said 2 queen beds. No one ever told me that the 2 bed suites were based on availability. So upon arrival I was very disappointed to find out that they didn't have any 2 bed suites available. The same thing happened to my sister-in-law who was traveling with a party of 6, 2 adults and 4 children. I met another woman in the lobby with 3 children who it also happened to. The hotel tried to make it right by giving us 2 roll-aways for free (normally $30 a night). There was plenty of room in the hotel for the 2 roll-aways. Problem was they were very uncomfortable, the pull out sofa is bad too. We had already been on the east coast for 6 nights and were exhausted, so was really disappointed that my kids weren't getting a comfortable night sleep. Having one bed in a room for 5-6 people isn't acceptable. That being said, the hotel was in a GREAT location, was clean, and the staff was friendly. It was great having a kitchen and saved us tons of money by making breakfast in the room and some lunches. There is a small grocery store a block away. The rooms are large. Seems to me they used to be apartments. Ours had 3 closets in it and a table that was big enough for all 5 of us to eat at. If you're picky about decor be warned that is very outdated. Halls can also be loud. You can hear people coming and going all hours. Because of so few choices for our size family and the good price, I'll probably stay here again and try again for the 2 beds.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ladispoli, Italy", "Title": "\u201cunique vacation, already suggested, back in November\u201d", "Author": "izio2000", "ReviewID": "UR115435831", "Content": "First impression wasn't superlative, but maybe we were tired from the trip.

There happened to be a special 'suite deal' on and we paid $1300, including taxes etc, for the whole thing! In mid-town. In July. For more space than (we understand) comprises most Manhattan apartments. It seemed almost too good to be true - I even emailed the hotel to double check I'd booked what I thought I'd booked. I had - and it turned out to be even better than we hoped or expected. OK, so the hotel is a little dated and in some places could do with a lick of paint. But it was clean and well serviced, all the staff we encountered were helpful and charming, the suite certainly had everything we needed (even down to a dishwasher which we didn't!) and the hotel is in a brilliant location for exploring everything New York has to offer. We especially liked the fact that this area seemed a bit less touristy than some, so the bars, restaurants and shops nearby (including the fantastic bagel place) were used by locals. The Eastgate Tower proved a superb choice for us and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. Yes, there are some negative reviews on Tripadvisor but we had been encouraged by the management's response to them and felt that on balance this was a good bet. We're so glad we went with our instinct! If you're looking for buzzing, contemporary, beautifully decorated hotel with a fancy lobby and lots of frills, then the Eastgate Tower probably isn't for you. If however you want your own basic New York apartment where you can really spread out, get Chinese delivered to your door when you're knackered, get a great night's sleep or watch TV in another room if you're the only member of the family suffering jetlag, AND save hotel costs to splash out on taxis, great meals, shows and more of the NYC experience, then you can't go wrong.

What can I say about this hotel, apart from the fact that it was wonderful and far far better than I expected and believe me when I say I have extremely high standards! We had a suite on 23rd floor and the amount of space was unbelievable! We had a big king room and a large twin with 2 double beds. And oh my goodness are they the comfiest hotel beds I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever slept on! There were 2 wardrobes in each room and a further 2 storage cupboards in the living room. The dining table was great for eating and for spreading out our stuff to plan each day and there was ample space if we did want to have the full 6 people in the room. The full kitchen (which had everything you would need) could have been used for full meals but we just used it for snacks and the large fridge for keeping drinks cool and snacks which we got at the shops 2 minutes from the hotel. I did request a kettle on our 1st day and we had it within 5 minutes. The bathrooms were small but again had plenty of cupboards, ample towels and the shower was always hot and powerful. The hairdryer was also surprisingly powerful! The room was spotless and cleaned every day by house-keeping who also kept topping up our coffee supplies which we were grateful for! Some mention the d\u00c3\u00a9cor is old fashioned, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not really. It gives a much more homey feel to the hotel and I much prefer that than somewhere that is contemporary and all white tiles. We had 3 lights in our room, so when we wanted lots of light we had it. The curtains don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t close properly though, so if you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep when the sunshine comes in, make sure you take an eye mask with you! I usually sleep with one anyway so it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter to me. The corridors are a bit dark as they are papered a dark blue, but you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay in the corridors, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let this put you off. Also there are only 2 lifts, but they are really fast so we were never waiting more than seconds. A big plus was that we could open all of the windows to let fresh air in and to keep the room cool during the day. To shut out the noise outside at night, we put the air con on. I saw some weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure how to work the air con, but the controls are under a flap on the top of the unit. The lobby was small, compact and clean and had a computer (which I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use), sofas and a unit filled with tourist leaflets. All you need! Location wise was also great! The hotel is approx 7 minutes walk to Grand Central, the same to Bryant Park, 15 minutes from Rockefeller Plaza and 20 mins to Times Square! We had no problems flagging taxis right outside the hotel apart from on a Friday night but we got one by the time we walked 2 blocks. There was a great diner 3 blocks away when you turn left out of the hotel called Scotties which I can highly recommend and countless other diners and deli\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a 1 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 3 minute walk away. There is also a Starbucks and a Pret a Manger beside Scotties and a McDonalds at the bottom of the block from the hotel to the right, so plenty of places to get free Wifi if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to pay for it at the hotel, which is what I did as I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need it constantly. For the smokers or those that just want to sit outside, there is a little garden patio area at the side of the hotel which we loved just to relax in at the end of a days shopping. The staff were also superb. Unfortunately I was quite ill on the day of check-out, but they let me stay in the room for an extra half an hour so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to rush to check-out, which helped so much. Patrick was also superb! He stored all of our bags for us (and there were many) and he also booked a transfer to the airport for us (only took 25 minutes). We felt very well taken care of. This is the 2nd time I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in a hotel in New York and I can safely say that this was the bargain of the century and one of the best hotels I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed in.

First off, our junior suite was an OK size, it looked like a former apartment with a cramped full kitchen and tiny bath, plus a small living room that unfortunately wasn't separated from the bedroom. Despite its size though, the entire place felt dated (think \"1970s chic\" without the chic) and thus not at all comfortable. I thought it would be a place my family could hang out and relax in between sightseeing but we couldn't be out of there long enough. The carpet constantly felt dirty and there was still food in the dish strainer when we checked in. Some of the glasses felt greasy upon first use. The trash can lid in the kitchen was broken and the TV was the old-style big-box model type that wasn't very sensitive to the remote control. We woke up with bites after our first night but I checked for bedbugs and didn't find any and my husband guessed that perhaps there were dust mites instead as parts of the room did feel rather dusty and caused his allergies to act up. As for the location, I didn't find it convenient at all, and I love to walk. The closest subway is Grand Central, which is great for food but the lines that run through there weren't main ones so we almost always had to transfer anyway. Plus, I thought that being out of Times Square would mean a quieter room but I guess because the building is so old and the walls are so thin, you can hear everything, such as the ambulances wailing by and cars honking below. I could even hear our neighbors' running water or when people were talking outside in the hallway. Speaking of the hallway, it always reeked of smoke, even though the building is supposed to be nonsmoking. Even the elevator smelled like smoke sometimes too. I guess you get what you pay for though because the price isn't too bad considering its size and that, after everything, is a hotel room in New York. Still, I think we could pay a similar price for a nicer, albeit smaller, more conveniently located room elsewhere. One other thing I should mention is the staff. While the housekeeping staff was quite friendly and always greeted us, the front desk staff could've cared less when we were standing right in front of them and the doormen/bellmen always looked like they'd rather be anywhere else but helping customers. It was as if we were an inconvenience to them for staying there. I also thought it was odd that although checkin is at 3, we arrived at 215 and were told our room wasn't ready yet. Now I know we were early, but it was less than an hour before checkin. We've arrived at other hotels as early as 6 a.m. and have been shown to our room right away; this was one of the rare times we were unable to check in early and although I know it's never a given, just the fact that it was so close to checkin time anyway but were denied makes me wonder. All in all, next time, I'd stay elsewhere. The good thing was that since we were out so much, we saw everything on our itinerary, plus more, so I guess that's something, right?", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albuquerque, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location & Value\u201d", "Author": "JulianneNM", "ReviewID": "UR109510663", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel in May for a 5-day mother-daughter vacation with my Mom and we had a great experience.

Because it's not on a main busy street, it was relatively quiet at night (for NYC). We found it was significantly more affordable than other hotels located just a few blocks away.

Eastgate is a hotel in the Affinia group, located in Murray Hill, and offers apartment style accomodations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c actually extremely large suites!!!! I booked the suite on the Eastgate website after reading about a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on 2 bedroom suites in a thread in the NYC forum. I love the forums!!!! Arrival - We arrived by Dial 7 car service from EWR around 11:30 a.m. to store our lugguge until check-in at 3:00. When we dropped off our luggage at the hotel to be stored, the desk clerk advised that our room may be ready before 3:00 and gave me her card to call back and check. I verified that we were getting a two bedroom, two bath suite and asked what floor our room was on and was told the 8th floor. She advised that she could check us in now, so that when we return, we could just stop at the desk and pick up the room keys. With that said and done, we hit the streets. Lobby - The lobby is very small, with two desk counters, a sofa set, coffee table, TV, and short wall loaded with tourist brochures. The two elevators are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153right there\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the lobby as well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all in a small compact area that was crowded just a few times when we were passing through. There is no restaurant in this hotel. There was an ATM when you first entered the lobby, but I never really looked at it or used it. The desk staff and bellmen were always very courteous and polite. No issues there. Just like clockwork, when we returned about 6:00 p.m., we stopped and picked up the room keys, only to find out that we were on the 15th floor instead of the 8th floor. The desk clerk handed me an Eastgate Tower envelope with my name on it, and when I opened it, I had a wonderful surprise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we bagged a BAG (Big Apple Greeter)! Our BAG had sent a fax to my attention at the hotel to advise me of our meeting time for our personal tour! See my trip report. It's a work in progress at the moment, so stay tuned for info about about BAG experience. http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k4447113-Trip_report_Biting_the_Big_Apple_with_the_Boys-New_York_City_New_York.html The bellman retrieved our luggage from storage and we summoned the elevator. The elevators are small, but during our 5 day stay, we never waited too long for one. Several times, however, they were too full for us to get in, so we had to wait for another one. There was also another elevator around the side to the right, but we never took that one. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for guests or not. The suite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Upon exiting the elevator, the hallway is very short. There were only seven suites on our floor. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if every floor was like that or not. Our suite was 15G, very roomy, and very clean. The rooms were quiet. We never heard a peep from any other rooms or from outside while we were there. The suite looked just like the pictures posted on the various travel websites and in travellers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reviews. It was kinda stuffy when we first arrived probably because there was no air circulating. We sprayed some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smell good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room spray and the musty smell went away. The furniture is dated (which we already knew), but we were hardly in the room anyway, and just wanted a comfortable, roomy place to lay our heads. And the beds were VERY comfortable!!!! I had two pillows on my side of the bed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one was soft and one was hard. It was good to have a choice or to use both if you preferred. My girlfriend and I stayed in the bedroom with the one queen/king size bed. The boys stayed in the bedroom with the two queen beds. The sofa in the living area also had a queen sleeper, that my nephew slept on for three of our four nights, leaving one empty bed in the boys\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bedroom. There were three TVs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one in each bedroom, and one in the living area. There was plenty of closet space, drawer space, and floor space. We were not bumping into each other with every step or turn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was very spacious! Decent dining table and four chairs in the living area. The bathrooms were identical in size and layout, small, with very little counter space, but manageable. We kept most of our toiletries on the bedroom dresser. No big deal there. The hot water in our bathroom was plentiful. I never asked the boys about their water temperature, so it must have been fine. The first day, we did not have any washcloths in our bathroom, but there were two on the second day. Plenty of hand towels and bath towels though! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure what the boys had in their bathroom. I never went in there. Mainly because I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if they lifted the lids when they peed.... Eeeewwww! On our last night, the toilet in our bathroom wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t flush and you could hear the water constantly running. We had gotten in late once again, so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call since we did not want to be disturbed and just wanted to get some sleep. We were going to be checking out in the morning and storing our luggage until the car service pick up at 4:30 p.m. for our 7:25 flight. Both bedrooms, plus the living area had an AC/heating unit. I never really figured out how to use them properly, and with two women \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hot flashing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153night sweating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd throughout the night, we really needed it to blow cold air on demand! Ha! The unit in the boys\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room seemed to not be cooling very well on our second day, but they never complained, so I never called to report it. If our visit would have been later in the spring or summer, I would have called the front desk to have them check the boys\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 unit and instruct us how to set our unit to blow \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really cold\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for hot flash/night sweat relief. For the most part, this was no big deal either. Kitchen - The kitchen was nice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c full size refrigerator, with a stove, dishwasher, and microwave. Glasses, plates, and eating utensils were provided as well. Nearby Places \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we went to D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122agostino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Market on 3rd Ave to stock up on a few staples. My girlfriend and I also ate at Good Burger on 2nd Ave. on our first night there. The boys were crashed out. We wore them out that first day, so combined with the early morning flight, they ran out of gas. Ha! At Good Burger, the burgers were, well, good. We also shared a Good Burger salad, and it, too, was good. On Thursday morning, we went to Sarge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Deli to buy sandwiches for our SOL/Ellis Island adventure. Sarge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is on 3rd Avenue near D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122agostino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Good friendly service, huge sandwiches \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very good!!! Grand Central Terminal is only a short walk away, and it was our travel hub during our entire visit. We bought 7 day unlimited Metro Cards and used the subway the entire time we were there. The Metro Cards were well used and well worth it... Summary \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The Eastgate Tower is not luxurious, but still very nice. It is a decent place to lay your head, and it fit our needs perfectly. We were only in the room between midnight and 8:00 or 9:00 a.m., and I would much rather spend my money shopping, touring, eating, etc... I would stay at Eastgate again in a heartbeat, especially at the rates that we were so lucky to get...

No one mentioned this when we checked in-like maybe we would not notice. After complaining to the front desk AND getting the manager, we were told they would take $50 off of our rate (basically charge us the full price of the room we got) and move us first thing the next day. The next morning we dropped off our two room keys, told the front desk that we packed our bags as instructed and expected to be in the new rooms by 3:00. The manager, Donna, had never mentioned any of this to the new front desk worker but she said she would take care of it. When we returned after 3:00 there was only 1, 1 bedroom available. The same manager, Donna, then claimed we never asked for 2, 1 bedrooms(regardless of the reservations made in January). After MUCH discussion we finally got the rooms we reserved. When we checked out the $50 credit was only taken off of one room until we complained AGAIN. Now for the Affinia group affiliation-don't even bother thinking you will get the preference items you can reserve at their site. I reserved a guitar for our stay on-line and called the hotel directly the week before our stay to confirm the guitar request. I was told by the Eastgate staff it was in our reservation.

The room was on the 9th floor and we had a good view with the top of the empire state building. The room was HUGE and had tons of closet space and two bathrooms (1 full, 1 half) which was great in the morning. The staff was very kind to bring us extra pillows and blankets because there wasn't much on the beds. The full size fridge was great and we bought breakfast items and drinks and stored leftovers. The living room furniture was comfortable and the TV's both worked well. As others have said, it was clean but not fancy, but the housekeeping did a great job every day to bring clean towels and make the beds. Conciege quickly brought us misc. items we needed, like salt and a corkscrew. For the down sides: The appliances were extremely old, and since there was only 4-5 plates and cups, we hand washed regularly. Once we tried using the dishwasher but it was very loud and took forever, then everything came out dirtier than they went in. The biggest complaint which made us miserable was the loud window heaters. None of us slept well because every time they came on, it banged and rattled and scraped so loud that it woke us up. The heater in the bedroom didn't work well and seemed to not even come on when it should so I was up in the middle of the night several times trying to adjust it.

I didn't mention it to the staff because I assumed it was going to be the same building wide and that we may get used to it after the first night (we didn't).

We stayed 5 days in early November 2010, and it exceeded our expectations on all counts. Things we loved: * HUGE, and (I mean REALLY BIG) room! We booked the Junior Suite and we had so much space it was just a shock! * Kitchen facilities: It was so fantastic to have a full-size fridge and all the kitchen supplies and utensils to be able to have breakfast in the room. Meant we could have breakfast in bed before getting out and about for the day. * Loads of closet space: Ample room to hang clothes, as well as store your suitcases and other bits and pieces * Bathroom: Was clean and functional, with a tub for soaking in after an exhausting day * COMFORTABLE BED!! It was a really great bed, we slept very well every night we were there. * Housekeeping: They did a great job and our place was spotless everyday when we cam home. Linens changed daily. *Coffee maker: The coffee machine was just fab, and we loved the Wolfgang Puk coffee that was generously replenished every day * Helpful staff: All the staff who we dealt with were extremely helpful and gracious. They went out of their way to assist us with all the questions we had, and provided us with great maps and other bits and pieces. *Location, LOCATION! I thought the hotels location was absolutely perfect. It was a 4 minute walk to Grand Central, from there we got to anywhere in NY that we wanted to go. We walked to many places too, such as Rockefeller Centre, Empire State and Times Square. *The best thing about Eastagte Tower is the price! We paid just on US$200/night booking about 6 months out and paying up-front with Expedia, so we got a great deal. Some things that could be improved: *I guess the rooms are dated and could use a refurb, but I dare say that such an excercise would lead to a significant rate rise, and would probably be out of my budget then. I know people mention the dated decor, but seriously, it is clean and in good repair, so who cares if the place is a bit daggy? *Hotel's restaurant has been closed now for quite some time. But, with so many dining choices in Manhattan, I probably would not have eaten there anyhow *The Wi-Fi in our room had a week signal unless I sat very close to the door. I believe we were on the 7th floor - it wasn't cheap either, so that was dissapointing. In summary, I absolutely recommend Eastgate Towers to anyone who wants a clean, comfortable, roomy place to stay in Midtown Manhattan, without having to rob a bank to pay for it! If you don't mind some 80's style decor, you will find that this hotel is an absolute gem.

She kept insisting that they were doing me a favor not charging me for the roll away bed we were getting instead of a real double bed. The thing is, I reserved the two beds & sofabed because one of us had back surgery and needs to sleep on a real bed, alone. That left the other four of us to share what she was offering now - a roll away and a sofa bed. One of the kids ended up sleeping on couch cushions on the floor.

I chose it because it was more affordable than other hotels in Manhatten but I was soon to realise why! The hotel is located near the UN. It is about 3 blocks walk to Grand Central Station and about forty-five minutes walk from Time Square and all the tourist precincts. The whole hotel was in need of renovation and all the common areas and rooms were dingy. The restaurant was being renovated while I was there but this was not advertised in advance and meant that I had to go looking for breakfast every morning (The Frontier Grill on the next block proved quite good!) The rooms have a small kitchenette so it is possible to self cater if you are prepared but the facilities are dingy and so one doesn't feel inclined to prepare food and eat in. I also had trouble with very ancient and noisy air conditioning systems in the rooms which made it hard to sleep and to get the right temperature. The final straw, however, happened on my second night when I was woken at 4am by suspicious scrabbling in my suitcase. When I turned on the light, a brown mouse jumped out of my bags (he had been snacking on some nuts I had brought off the plane) and ran around the room. I called reception and asked them to come and deal with the situation but they didn't come until I rang again 20minutes later (apparently they went to the wrong room). When the night porter did arrive the mouse had vanished and he sat down and watched as I packed my own belongings in preparation for chaging rooms. Eventually at 5.30am I was transferred to another room (which proved to be a 2 bedroom suite). I must say that the Duty Manager was most apologetic when I spoke to him and I was allowed to keep the suite for the remainder of my stay at no extra charge. They also refunded the cost of the disturbed night so I appreciated their efforts to rectify the problem. All in all, I would not recommend this hotel until it has undergone a total refurbishment. It was not worth the cheaper rate to be so far from the main tourist attractions and in a place in need of a major makeover!", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Porto Alegre, RS", "Title": "\u201cwell located and people very nice and friendly\u201d", "Author": "abrao", "ReviewID": "UR98565980", "Content": "The hotel is very well located, people are very nice and friendly.", "Date": "March 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSpacious, clean & great location!\u201d", "Author": "streetwise45678", "ReviewID": "UR98124412", "Content": "The hotel looks a little dated from the outside but inside, the rooms are spacious and clean; as are the bathrooms.

Overall, the place is very clean and the accomodations are good. We had an ample size room for 8 girls that even had a little kitchenette. It worked out perfrectly for hosting our soire. After a pleasant stay, I recently booked this hotel when I needed to stay in the city for a wedding. I called ahead of time to request early check-in. The hotel standard check-in time is 3pm and I was hoping for a 2pm check-in so that I could shower and get ready for the wedding, which was to take place at 3:30pm. I was told that early check-in could not be gauranteed, but that my request has been noted. I was also told that the hotel has a full locker room for their gym facility. Not wanting to go through the hassle of showering and getting ready for the wedding in a locker room, I called again a few days before my arrival and was told I would most likely not be able to get the hotel room early since the hotel was booked in full the night before. This made no sense to me considering check-out time is at noon and they had 3 hours to prepare rooms for 3pm check-in. Surely they could have one room available by 2pm for me? I arrived at the hotel a few hours early since my train got into the city that morning. Again I was fed the same story that I could not check-in early. When I inquired why, I got the same response about the hotel being booked in full the night before. I explained that I didn't understand how this worked and that it seemed unreasonable that my request of an hour early check-in could not be granted. Fortunately after going back and forth, the receptionist phoned their nearby, sister hotel land transferred me there without any problems or additional payments. Overall, the hotel is not bad, but if you have to check-in early, I'm sure you can find a better place!

In the rush to leave in the morning, and with my mind on him and not me, I somehow left my diamond engagement ring in the room. I have worn this ring virtually every day for 36 years, and didn't even notice I didn't have it on until we were home later that evening. I had no idea where the ring was and called the hotel not knowing if I had even left it there. To my great pleasure, Yvrose, the Executive Housekeeper, immediately told me she had the ring. The housekeeper who cleaned the room, Elizabeth, had promptly turned it in and the ring was placed in the hotel safe. Since they couldn't know for sure which guest left it in the room they waited for the guest to call. Yvrose couldn't have been more helpful in arranging the return of the ring via Fedex. This was arranged on Saturday morning (I discovered the ring missing late Friday night), and since the safe was locked until Monday she had to arrange for the return of the ring in her absence, since as luck would have it she would not be in the following week. I subsequently spoke to Carol who confirmed the return of the ring, and called me the next day to make sure I received it. The hotel is a great find if you don't need a fancy lobby and all the trimmings. It is in a lovely convenient neighborhood and all the staff people we encountered were extremely pleasant and helpful. They upgraded us to a larger suite when we checked in (we really couldn't have cared less so it was a pleasant surprise). While the rooms are a bit dated, they are huge and comfortable. I will say the bathroom was small, which didn't concern me since it was fine for our purposes. The small galley kitchen had a large refrigerator, sink, stove and microwave, as well as some kitchen supplies. For a family it would be perfect, and for anyone visiting friends who doesn't care about hotel trimmings it is a hidden treasure. The building obviously is a converted apartment building so the rooms are truly enormous, especially for the price we paid (we booked directly on the hotel's website).

Great value, and the staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. There's no restaurant but plenty of good places to eat out for breakfast, and you can order in from nearby places at all hours if you wish.

In the spring I travelled with my husband and 2 children and stayed in a 1 bedroom suite. This time I travelled with an 11yo daughter and stayed in a Junior Studio Suite. Once again, I found the staff at the Eastgate to be proffessional, courteous and efficient. The room was large and clean, but as mentioned in almost all reviews, it is old and dated. The beds seem new and are made up in lots of white linens and are quite comfortable. I didn't do any cooking, nor did I have any desire to cook ... , but did use dishes, because we got takeout. I was surprised that there was only one pot and no pans in the kitchen. Although, if I had actually needed them I would have called housekeeping and asked. The kitchen I had in the spring was better equipped, but perhaps in the larger units people actually cook more. (But not me!) This room had a door that could be unlocked and opened to connect it to the room next door. It was secure but because of that door, sound from the next unit seemed to travel, and it just wasn't as quiet as during my first visit. Nonetheless, it worked fine for us. I was disappointed to see that the Frontier Diner on the corner of 39th and 3rd closed, but we were content with bagels from Daniel's and Scotty's on 39th and Lex is good for a sit-down breakfast. I enjoy getting out first thing in the morning and am not bothered by lack of breakfast in the hotel. If I really wanted it, I'd stock in cereal and fruit from D'Agostino's grocery on 3rd. If you are looking for an upscale fancy hotel, this isn't it. If you are bothered by mirrors that have gone dark at the corners and visible cables inside your closets, then stay away.

Location: We were visting NYC on a vacation. Location was very important to us to get around the city. We used the subway and walked, a lot!. The EGTH is about a 10 min. walk from Grand Central station. This is a hub for the NYC subway system, allowing you to travel east & west (line 7); north & south (lines 4, 5, 6). We conveniently walked to the following sites- NYC Public Library (15 min); Empire State Bldg (20 min); United Nations (5 mins). There were a few nice restaurants nearby, but not a ton of selection. Amenities: The hotel at one time was an apartment bldg, so each suite is spacious (not your typical tiny NYC hotel room). Each has a kitchen too, which was very handy for light meals. We were anxious to get going on our sightseeing, so it was great to grab breakfast as we got ready in the mornings. We didn't waste time sitting in a restaurant for breakfast, when there's so much to do in NYC! There are 2 grocery stores nearby to buy food for your stay. Just like many reviewers have already commented the furnishings in the room are dated, but they were clean and the beds were super comfortable- just what we needed after a long day of siteseeing! I should mentioned that the bathrooms were spotless- I'm a bit of a neat-niq so I can spot dirt from quite a distance, and this room fully met my picky standards. Value: What deal this hotel is for comfort, cleanliness & location! We booked months in advance on the hotel's website and booked one of their \"special\" rates that were being offered at the time- this was a great deal for a one bedroom suite (2 adults & 2 teenagers). What a pleasant surprise upon check-in to be upgraded to a 2 bedroom (& 2 bathrooms) suite. It was fantastic to have that second bathroom (my daughter could occupy it solely each morning without causing a family feud!). Service: Because we were so focused on siteseeing, we didn't spend a lot of time at the hotel. But the few interactions we did have with the hotel staff, were pleasant. One thing I did like, was that before I left for our trip, I checked tripadvisor reviews periodically. I liked that the hotel manager took the time to respond to most reviews, whether positive or negative. This suggests to me that he takes pride in his hotel and strives to respond to the needs of his guests. It you're looking for a luxury high end hotel, this probably isn't the hotel for you.

The only thing letting this hotel down from being a 4 star is the need for an update and the outdoor area, where the restaurant used to be.

In fact, after one teen took a shower the first night we were there, the next morning the tub still hadnt drained and I had to take a shower in ankle deep water. 2nd bathroom, same thing, didnt drain completely after the first person's shower. However, as we were preparing to leave the hotel for the day, I mentioned to the maid in the hallway that both showers were clogged, no exaggeration, maintenance was at our room before our entire party could get out into the hall to wait for the elevator!. I fully expected we would be dealing with tub draining issues our entire stay, I was wrong, never had a problem again. On another evening, one of the kids unwittingly locked the bathroom door as he exited, we called downstairs to get maintenance to come up and unlock it, and no kidding, he was there within 5 minutes!! I also highly commend the maids, they were accomodating on the days we let the kids sleep in, they would come late in the afternoon to clean the rooms. And they made the suite look as though no one was occupying it, everything was picked up, beds made, abundant clean towels, vacuumed, kitchen was spotless, they were great, cant say enough good things about the maintenance and maid staff!

We stayed at the Shelburne last year and loved it but the room we wanted was not available this time. So after reading a reviews and getting a great rate on the Affinia website, we chose this place. We knew what we were getting into ... and we were quite pleased. Most of the previous reviews are accurate. The place needs a facelift, but is clean and spacious and the staff is pleasant, helpful and knowledgeable. We had a 1 bedroom suite ... the living room/dining area is HUGE ... with a sofabed, easy chair, desk, tv, dining table and chairs and plenty of room to move around. My 11yo did a lot of dancing ... just because she could -- lol! The bedroom had two queens, a nightstand, a 6 drawer dresser and TV. And plenty of space to move around. Large closets and a \"linen closet\" helped us to put all our suitcases and 'stuff' away so the room didn't get that cluttered look. The first two days were were there, we knew there was a large group of school-aged kids staying there for some kind of soccer event. We saw them in the halls and elevators, but once in our room ... we NEVER heard them. Our 8th floor corner suite was quiet ... The beds were comfy. Lots of white linens, even 'encasing' the blanket. The upholstery on the easy chair was worn, yet it seemed clean ... like the it had been steamed clean or something ... the wooden furniture and baseboards were nicked. But nothing horrendous. And that was all over-ridden by the space. We were a reasonable walk to Grand Central station where we could pick up multiple subway lines. 2nd and 3rd ave have everything you could need: pizza, bagels, deli, diner, grocery store and drug stores. The door man found us a taxi when we were leaving w/ luggage, other than that, if we wanted a cab we walked to 2nd or 3rd (depending on whether we were heading uptown or downtown) and never had trouble hailing a cab. I never cooked, but liked the spacious kitchen, with full sized fridge and even a dishwasher. We kept ALL our drinks cold, made coffee and microwaved popcorn. We got take-out one night, and it was nice to be able to sit at a table and eat normally rather than sitting on the edge of a bed an balancing everything on our laps like we'd have to do in a 'regular' hotel room. Bagels, cream cheese and nova from Daniel's on 3rd were great ... we ate our fill and refrigerated the rest for another day.

The hotel staff were professional and courteous, despite the slow check-in process, since we had to wait for our room to be cleaned well past the traditional 3pm check-in time. The hotel restaurant was closed, due to efforts to expand the existing hotel lobby, which is sorely needed -- the lobby can get a bit cramped even with only 10 people in the lobby!

Apart from the separate bedroom, it had a living/dining area, a large bathroom & a small self catered kitchen. We were on the 8th floor, so had a pretty good view of the buildings. The hotel itself is quite dated, but if that's not a problem, which it wasn't for us, then it's fine. The location is pretty good...you're about a ten minute walk to Grand Central Station. There are various shops just down the road from the hotel (convenience store, chemist, liquor store, pizza, burgers, McDonalds, chinese etc). The convenience store is very handy for bread, milk etc. Although it was freezing (snowing) outside when we were there, it was always toasty warm in our room. Some nights, we even slept in a sheet. The housekeeping ladies were always lovely. The only problem we really had, which isn't a biggie, was that every time we wanted to watch a pay per view movie, we had to keep ringing reception to get it uploaded, which was a bit of a pain, but as I said...no biggie. The only other little complaint was sometimes there was a weird smell on our floor once we got out of the elevator, but the smell was never in our room, so it didn't matter. There is a laundry in the basement for you to wash & dry your clothes. Definitely buy your own detergent as I brought some laundry powder from the lady at the counter & it ruined some of our clothes (bleached some of the colour out). This was really annoying because I specifically asked her if it was safe to wash my clothes in it & she said yes.

It is only a few blocks from Grand Central Station. He had stayed there before with his band and they had very large 2 bedroom suites they felt were great, we had a one bed Studio suite room on this visit. The room we had was 25C, which is on the top floor with a nice view of the Empire State Building and the surrounding streets. We had requested in advance that we had a room near the top with a view ideally-as we were on honeymoon! When we arrived there we were greeted and quickly given our room key. The foyer was nice-very christmassy and welcoming. The corridor on our floor was very dated and faded and this was par for the course for the rest of the interior-basically it was all quite outdated, things were scuffed & marked. It was a very large room, lots of storage space, little kitchen area and bathroom - there were a few unwanted hairs in the bath, even though the place otherwise seemed spotless. It had a fairly cool view I thought! As the rooms are self catering, you can cook some meals yourself or at least have breakfast at home a few times-that in itself can save you a few bob! There is a lovely fresh food market in Grand Central Station that I would recommend if you were planning to cook a meal in your hotel room. The Hotel staff were consistenly pleasant and helpful and the room was serviced every day. There are loads of diners nearby to get a great breakfast in - our favourites were French Toast and Bacon, or Pancakes and Sausage!! I would recommend Scotty's Diner (39th & Lex), the Frontier (closest to Hotel, come out door, turn left, keep walking and its on the corner on the left before you cross the next avenue) or Sarge's (36th and 3rd, or maybe 37th..) - all of these had lovely breakfast. Scotty's do fabulous burgers too as we discovered very late at night -they are open 24 hours too!! There is a 24 Duane Reades nearby (they are a mix of pharmacy and grocery- have alcohol, sweets, medicines and very cheap make up!!) Murray Hill as an area is nice, we have stayed in that district before, the streets feel safe late at night, we never saw any trouble. The hotel is nice, I wouldn't pay anymore than we did though- I would confidently say too, that I suspect there are some pretty crap rooms in this place, so If you have a price you are happy with, request a top room with view to get best value. If you are not experienced with New York, then you should learn now, what we would expect from a standard Jury's hotel or Days Hotel bedroom in Ireland, would be considered positively brand new and luxurious for new york! You just have to accept this, lower your standards BIG TIME, unless you are prepared to spend an awful lot of money, expect small rooms, outdated facilites and no frills for a Manhattan hotel. You will always hear traffic noises - this area maybe had a fire station nearby as there were sirens going off constantly and the air con unit was seriously loud - if you need your sleep, bear this in mind!

Most of these hotels you have to go outside to turn yourself around. NOT at Eastgate Towers. My room was large. It had room for closet, a desk, a small refrigerator, microwave, and even cabinets with a few glasses and dishes. The Bathroom was large enough to close the door and not feel like you were on a cruise ship bathroom. It even had a double medicine cabinet with mirror and a vanity cabinet with extra towels, toilet paper, etc. My only 3 star rating is that it is a solid 10 minute walk to Grand Central to catch subway.

Now I'm going to sound like one, and that's not my usual style. I picked the hotel because of the good rate, especaily for a suite. I had stayed at the Affinia Gardens in March and loved it. (Same chain.) At this hotel: check-in was weird. They never cited the agreed-upon rate or the number of days of the stay. I asked for a room on an upper floor. They assigned me to a smoking floor without telling me that. The room itself smelled like stale smoke. The furniture was shabby. We wound up leaving a little early -- the night before the morning of our scheduled check-out. when I called down to tell them that, they told me they would not be able to show me a printed bill or statement at night -- which means I never saw my room rate -- not at check-in or check-out! I thought the maid service was sloppy. (Smudgy, streaky toilet rim when I checked in.) Then there's the little things: in this day and age when people travel with laptops and other equipment, you really have GOT to offer those little in-room safes. Not here. I also really hate having to pay for internet service every day, call down, get a new password every day, etc. And those of us who like to fall asleep to quiet, gentle music really appreciate having an iPod docking station or at least a CD player at bedside.

I was a bit concerned when the hotel came up as being categorized as a 2.5 star by Priceline standards.

Firstly, the hotel itself is literally two blocks from the Westin W Tuscany on the east side of Manhattan. The neighbourhood is a safe and clean part of the city. The hotel isn't that close to the subway but in Manhattan \"close\" is a relatively thing because you can be at the subway in about 10 minutes. The hotel is a converted apartment building so each room has a kitchen and livingroom area. My suite had a king sized bed and was basically a bachelor apartment. The furniture (as most noted) is old and could be replaced. The room and hotel have everything you'd find at a regular hotel. There are plenty of towels, toilettries, pay per view movies, individually controlled heat/ac, etc. The bathroom was old but clean and well stocked. I snuck a peak at the fitness centre on the second floor and it had a universal weight machine and some cardio. Not bad. The checkin staff were REALLY friendly. They told me all about the hotel and local restaurants as part of their greeting. I will say, for Manhattan these rooms would be considered HUGE! Most hotels give you a cubby hole and call it a room. Since this place was an apt, you'll be much happier with the size, especially if you're travelling with a family/children. Having a kitchen is a definite plus if you're going to be in the city for a long period of time. I am rating this a 4 because it really was a great price for the City. However, as hotel standards go, this is probably a 2.5 or 3 star property since it really needs some updating. Definitely would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Manhattan.", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Paul, MN", "Title": "\u201cGreat for what it is\u201d", "Author": "latte4me", "ReviewID": "UR24648950", "Content": "Just to be clear: this isn't a high-end hotel (ala Hilton, Westin, Hyatt) nor is it a chic boutique hotel.

This trip was for a family holiday. The hotel is in a great location and is wlaking distnace of a lot of attractions. I have to agree with one of the previous reviewrs and say that while the hotel is clean it felt a little grubby and is in need of a major refurb in terms of the decor. We stayed for 10 nights and the while the towels were changed daily the sheets weren't changed at all during our stay. On the first night the sofa bed in one of the rooms we had booked was full of crumbs and had no covers on it. We contacted the housekeeping staff and had to wait four hours for the bed to be made and cleaned so that someone could sleep in it. The noise from the corridor also made it hard to sleep at times. We were located in a room adjacent to what we think was a staff room and the door to this room was closed by a bang throughout the day and night which was quite irritating. The lifts were also slow and hard to get into at peak times. We found the front desk staff to be quite unhelpful. They gave us wrong advise on a number of ocassions. This was in relation to a range of things, for example on new years day they told us all of the major department stores were closed, which was in fact incorrect and theytwere all open. They gave wrong directions and seemed to try to push bus tours and booking these type of things through the front desk. This happened throughout our stay, we were careful to double check any information they gave us. When it came to checking out we found that the service of the front desk staff really failed. It took over an hour and a quarter to check out. One of the rooms was over charged, another was chraged out without telling the person having been told at check in that the credit card was a security thing only and that no chrages would be made until check out and the third rooms money was miss counted by the member of staff who found that they had made a mistake after very reluctantly agreeing to do a recount. The staff member at this point was quite difficult to deal with. It was a very bad way to finish off the stay. Overall I was very disappointed with my stay at the Eastgate. I am a frequent visitor to New York and don't intend to return to the East Gate,. I would also be very reluctant to reccomend it to a friend as we had so many problems.

We had to take a train leaving from Grand Central Station which is just a short walk away. There are plenty of restaurants and shopping nearby. Our one peeve was that we could not turn off the heat. Thankfully, the window opened so the \"fresh\" air coming in cooled things off to a comfortable temperature. There is virtually no lobby. All the workers we encountered were friendly and helpful. We even parked in the garage in the building. This cost us $34 per 24 hours including all taxes. Not bad for this expensive city. We'll be interested to see how the renovations affect the pricing.

We arrived on a red eye into JFK and showed up at the hotel at about 7 a.m. and they allowed us to get into one of the rooms (the other one wasn't ready yet), which allowed us to catch a couple hours of sleep before we headed out to explore the city. (We also had a late flight home and were more than happy to hold all our luggage until we left). We were pleasantly surprised that there was a full bath and a 1/2 bath (sink & toilet) in each room. We went to Gristedes and bought some groceries (there's one a couple blocks away) and ate breakfast in the room every morning. The kitchen only has the essentials (including a toaster) but everything was clean and in working order. We ordered in pizza one night and had plenty of room for 8 to sit (4 chairs at the dining table plus a desk and chair, and a chair in the living room and the sofa which turns into a bed). Our rooms were also on the 18th and 23rd floors and had views of the city (although the Empire State building was blocked by another building). The hotel itself is located in a mostly residential area (Murray Hill) and there aren't any hotels immediately adjacent to it, so it is fairly quiet. However, the closest subway station is at Grand Central, about a 10 min. walk, which doesn't seem bad until you have to walk back to the hotel from there after already walking around all day! Of course you can always catch a cab to avoid walking, but we are cheap and walking affords you to see more of the city anyways!

Okay now for the part I don't like to write about but this stay started off as a complete disaster. We arrived for the 3pm check-in time that the hotel stated. We were told it would be 20 minutes more as the room was not ready. The bellman took our luggage up to the room while we went and sat outside. We checked back 25 -30 minutes later and were told the room still wasn't ready. The front desk person asked housekeeping to call her when it was done. She explained that the previous party had stayed for a late checkout... not sure why we had to suffer though... We checked back bit after 4 pm after sitting outside on the table and chairs next to the abandoned restaurant that once occupied the hotel building. When we went in and asked, the front desk person still hadn't heard about the room. She called housekeeping and they said that they didn't know if it was done and that the front desk should send the bellman to check on it. The bellman was no where to be seen at this point so we had to wait until 4:30 when he went up and gave the okay. We received our key-cards and headed to the room. Arriving in the room we found it to be dated but fairly clean and very spacious with nice city views... room 17 G. However, even though we booked a \"two queen beds and another queen bed suite\", we got a \"two queen bed with two twin bed suite.\" We even had Expedia call for us to verify that was what we would get but we didn't end up with it after all. The front desk explained that it can not guarantee a room type even though an Eastgate reservation person had guaranteed this to Expedia. We had to have a portable twin bed brought up so no one had to sleep in the living room. It was at this point we noted that the air conditioning in the twin bed room did not work, so we placed another call to the front desk and they said they would send up maintenance. They arrived within the half-hour and looked at the a/c unit. He determined it was a broken condenser and said the entire unit would be replaced but he had a new one. A short while later he returned with the massive unit and began to do the replacement. We were unable to unpack as this room was the scene of some major construction! About 30 minutes later he determined that the new unit was also bad and decided to try one more unit. The dinner hour was upon us and we were starving... but we had no idea if we would be keeping this room as it was partially un-airconditioned and it was 90 degrees outside. After waiting another 15 minutes or so, I went down to the front desk to discuss the general suckiness of our visit thus far and to speak with a manager. She arrived and her name I believe was Donna. She was very nice and helpful. She said she was willing to move us to another similar suite (2 queens, 2 twins) but it was on the 13th floor which was the smoking floor. We weren't too thrilled by that. She asked us to come see it and smell it with her as she felt most people don't smoke much anymore. We went her and it was nice and did not smell that much and had more up-to-date kitchen appliances. At that point, my cell phone rang... it was my wife and she informed me that the new a/c unit was in and working, so we went with Donna the manager to confirm. It worked great! Unfortunately it was now 7pm which was 4 hours from our scheduled check-in. After unpacking, we got to eat and proceeded on our late evening with the kids who were antsy and cranky now. Things seemed to be progressing... at least until I laid upon the most uncomfortable and squeaky twin bed I had laid upon since my childhood. Fortunately the days events had tired me and I slept well. The next morning, we all showered and tossed our towels on the floors in the bathrooms. We returned from a theatre matinee around 6 pm, ready to shower and go out to dinner at a nearby restaurant. Showers were put on hold because there was not one single towel in our room! So, of course, I called the front desk. They said they would tell housekeeping. 30 minutes later, no towels, so I called again. Again they said they would be right up. Another 30 minutes passed as I was about to reach for the phone again, the towels arrived... but there were only 3 of them... for 6 people. I asked the house keeping person why and they told me that they had run out of towels. Weird. They have tons of extra a/c units but lack towels? Well, some of us skipped showers and I went to the front desk on the way to dinner. I told them about how silly the towel situation and they promised more towels. When we returned from dinner, there were stacks of towels in both bathrooms and an extra big stack in the living room. I guess they bought more??? Anyway, After that our remaining three days were quiet and went smoothly. 2 of 4 nights/days were just fine.. is 50% okay for a visit that cost nearly $2k?

The location is in Midtown close to Grand Central Terminal, which is the closest subway station and about 6-9 minutes depending on the subway entrance. The UN is a few blocks away, and there are many restaruants and small markets nearby. Eastgate Tower is a 25 story tower with just 5 units on each floor. The lobby is cramped, but the staff is courteous, and we were able to get a nonsmoking room that we had previously requested. The elevators are small, but during our stay, waiting for elevators was not a serious problem. We stayed in a unit on the upper half of the tower in a unit with a view of the high rise next door that was about 20-25 feet away, so there was no view. The first thing you notice about the unit is that it is spacious but worn. Except for the bathroom and kitchen, it is a relatively large unit. However, the place seriously needs a new paint job inside, new carpeting, new vinyl in the kitchen, new tile in the bathroom and newer furnishings. Also the unit can use sound proofing from the 3 elevators in the center, and also use newer and quieter air conditioning units. Water pressure was good, the hot water was hot, the air conditioning and kitchen appliances worked. There were no bugs, but there was a strong pesticide odor in the kitchen cabinets. The rooms were cleaned everyday, but only as to what the eye could easily see. For example the inside of the refrigerator was relatively clean, but there was a thick layer of dust on top of the refrigerator. Same about the towel racks. The carpet was dark and likely hiding a lot of dirt, and we did not dare to look under the bed. Pros: Spacious, good water pressure, has kitchen appliances, and relatively safe neighborhood.

For breakfast we recommend Sarge's and Frontier on 3rd and for dinner nearby Patsy's pizzeria also on 3rd. Tony's sushi just around the corner on 2nd was fab. Two notes of caution. Margarita Murphy's bar on 3rd very near hotel left such a bad taste in our mouths on St. Patrick's Day for overcharging and rudeness ( 15 bucks for 2 beers before a tip!!!) that we passed their door for the remaining 6 nights of our stay. Also the Italian restaurant Il Fagioli (I think)that the hotel recommend as their restaurant is closed wasn't great and rude staff too. The New York rudeness is a myth, it's a fast town and some people are rude everywhere. Last tip-Coney Island-do it!

I have a few complaints and warnings I wish to give other potential guests. The first is the parking. There is valet parking next to the hotel and it is very expensive at $35.00 per day! To be clear, that is $35.00 + taxes + tip for the valet. There are plenty of parking lots around the area, but because there are so many one-ways, it gets confusing and you may be tempted to just park beside the hotel. Thats what I did and the car came back three days later with a huge scratch on the side. Because it is winter and there is lots of salt everywhere, we did not notice the scratch until later. So beware of the parking beside the Eastgate Towers, it is a rip off and your car will probably come back with some sort of damage! (Note that the hotel offers no discount at all, which is surprising because La Quinta, which is only a few blocks away gives you 50% off your total parking just for staying at the hotel. ) The second complaint deals with the reception of the hotel. There is one person at front desk and one or two \"attendants\" that stand around and open doors for people. If you have lots of luggage when coming in, the attendant will take your things and follow you up to your room. You will not be asked whether you actually want assistance, or desire to have a strange man follow you to your room, it will just happen. You will then be expected to provide a tip and the end of the encounter. This type of behaviour is quite strange for a budget hotel, so be prepared and have tip money handy. Lastly, regards the service. We went during restaurant week and we could not find one person at the front desk who could actually recommend a restaurant (and not simply read off the Zagat's survey). There is no concierge (i know it is a budget hotel), but a great alternative would have been to provide 5 or 10 minutes of free internet on the computer located in the entrance. Instead, they had some ludicrously expensive fees to surf the net even for a few minutes. So in conclusion, you will be comfortable inside your roomy hotel room at the Eastgate Towers, but do lots and lots of research before heading out, or else it will put a serious \"ding\" in your budget in more ways than one.", "Date": "January 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria, VA", "Title": "\u201cGood Value Good Location\u201d", "Author": "travelingnewbie", "ReviewID": "UR13063378", "Content": "My partner and I stayed for two nights over the MLK weekend.

I've stayed in New york before and this is by far the best hotel i have found to date. The reason i'm writing this review so quickly is that i noticed the 2 star review below me and the fellow giving the hotel a hard time. After seeing the review's low rating i read it in full and was surprised by everything they were saying! The lobby is too small? What does that matter? Are you sleeping there?? For the record their experience was totally different to the one i have just had and it seems that i must have been passing them in the corridor everyday! This is truly a hotel to recommend to friends. NY is notorious for packing in as many hotel rooms into a building as possible, meaning the customer often recieves a dinky room ... After experiencing this previously, one of my main criteria was to book a hotel whos rooms didn't look like a broom cupboard and the Eastgate certainly didn't let me down. The Studio room that we got was absolutely huge compared the other hotels i have stayed at in NY. It had a walk in closet, nice bathroom, a small sectioned kitchen (gas hob/oven, fridge, toaster, microwave, coffee maker) and a large main room and i only booked the basic Studio room (room 2E if anyone is interested). As some other reviewers have said, a agree that the decor was slightly dated although it was kept really clean and house keeping did an excellent job of tidying up every day. The location is between 2nd and 3rd on 39th street, meaning the area and roads are rather quiet. I heard the occasional siren and honk of a horn but nothing that could be considered a nuisance. As for attractions, the Eastgate is slightly further than most, although (unlike the reviewers below me) if you come to NY you expect to walk a distance everyday. Time Square and the Empire state are wel within walking distance taking around 15/20 minutes, although i would say if you come to NY to catch the buses everywhere then get something a little closer. There are loads of places to eat from a nice posh restaurant round the corner to a McDonalds on the corner of 2nd/39th. A 24hr pharmacy is on the otherside of 2nd Avn and a Supermarket is one block north to fill your fridge with cookies and Dr Pepper. The staff are brilliant, everyone i talked to, whether asking directions or getting recommendations for a place to eat, i found to be helpful and friendly ... definately top marks there. Myself and the lady have already said that the next time we come to New York we are staying at the Eastgate, it simply is an excellent hotel to stay at. I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind walking an extra 5 minutes to attractions, and if your willing to make the sacrifice you get an oversized room, excellent value for money and a hotel that i will be visiting everytime i return.

First impression at 11pm arrival was shock at the tiny, institutional looking lobby, and horror after transporting my own luggage upstairs (security guard/bellman had gone on break) at the depressing, shabby, filthy two double bed (despite request for one king) studio suite - located between the elevator, gym and compactor - that cost $400 for the first night. (Quikbook booking gave different rates for each night.) Was told there were no other rooms available until it was discovered that the door to this room did not lock. Was sent to another horrible studio for the night and the next morning given the choice to upgrade to a junior suite. Much larger, seemingly cleaner (NO ancient bedspreads but the floors were just as grimy.) New rate was slightly higher. I forgot to mention AAA membership at the time of the adjustment and was not allowed to apply it when I called Management the next day. I stayed at the hotel for 12 nights for about $4500. For the most part, staff were extremely polite and helpful. They assured me that renovations were \"going to start any time\" for as long as they'd been working there (20 years in once case). Door to the junior suite failed to lock half the time unless properly jiggled but it was still shocking to come home to a wide open door at 1 a.m. Beds hard as table tops but no bugs. Air conditioning effective. Laundry located in basement next to housekeeping. Many foreign guests seem to be a reflection of nearness to U.N., as are numbers of security personnel with big dogs. Nice scenic walk on First Avenue to UN and Tudor City. Express buses do not stop at 39th street. Don't know if I would stay here again. Would not recommend it to friends without many caveats. Sadly disappointing. Had high expectations which were not met. Probably families staying in larger suites have more modern accommodations.

The room was huge, even NOT by NYC standards. I've stayed in hundreds of hotel rooms, including suites, and this one was probaby one of the largest I've ever experienced. There was a big dining room with a family-size table, a huge living room with a sofa, chair and TV, a full kitchen (although small), a large separate bedroom with two queen beds and tons of closet space, and a small bathroom with tub. We could not believe how much space we had. You could easily have 6 or more people staying in there, comfortably (except for sharing the small bathroom). I'm assuming the building used to be apartments. I booked my room through Priceline. I think it was about $165, well below what you would expect to pay for such a big space in NYC. True, the furniture is dated and somewhat worn, but who cares? If they updated everything, you'd have to pay way more. How much time do you spend in the room in NYC anyway? The room was extremely clean and the front desk clerks were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is definitely in a convenient, relatively quiet and safe location - lots of restaurants, shops, businesses, etc. around. It was about a 15-20 minute walk to our Broadway show.

The Eastgate has worked beautifully every year - they have so many options to choose from, room-wise. One bedrooms, two-bedrooms, studios - whatever your needs, they have a room that fits. For the last two years, we've had our baby with us on the trip, and both times, they've been able to provide a REAL crib (not a flimsy pack and play) for her to sleep in. This year we discovered that they also have high chairs for your room upon request, and they do stroller rental too, if needed. They seem to bend over backward to be family-friendly and accommodating. The hotel is tucked onto a quiet street between two busy avenues - quiet enough, but easy walking distance to the Grand Central subway stop, pharmacies, grocery stores and restaurants. The rooms themselves are HUGE by NYC standards - lots of room for a toddler to play after a long day in the stroller sight-seeing. The kitchenette is particularly useful when traveling with kids, as well. It is true that the place needs a renovation - it's getting a little shabby with scratched and dented furniture and threadbare carpeting, but it is kept immaculately clean by the very friendly housekeeping staff. I did not hesitate to let my two year old play on the floor - it was quite clean. I almost hate to write this review - I kinda want to keep the place a family secret. But the hotel deserves commendation - the staff are so friendly (seems to be the same people working there for three years in a row, so there doesn't seem to be much turn-over), and the price for the location (and for the square footage) is SUCH a bargain that I felt I needed to let others know.

The best thing about the Eastgate: a lavish amount of space at a reasonable price, both exceptional by New York standards. We had a large living/dining room with a tiny kitchen; a bedroom with attached bathroom; a separate powder room; and two closets. This allowed me the luxury of staying up as late as I wanted, reading or watching TV, without disturbing my partner who had to be at work early each morning.

Safety deposit boxes are available in the lobby too. The onsite restaurant was closed for renovations when we stayed. Nearby, there is a McDonalds, a pharmacy and a cornershop at one end of the street, and a couple of nice breakfast places at the other. Around the corner is a strip of 3 pubs, which all seemed to do a fair enough trade. Grand Central is only a 5 minute walk away (I don't see how anyone could describe it as further away... the entrance you need is more or less at the corner of 3rd and 42nd) and this means everything in the city is only a change of a train away. Fashion Avenue is about 20 minutes away, Times Square a few minutes more than that, and Central Park about 25 minutes (all walking distances).

The neighborhood is safe, with small groceries and fast food options nearby. We grabbed coffee each a.m. at the Starbucks on Lexington and 40th and bagels at Bagels & More on 39th & 3rd Avenue. There isn't much in the way of restaurants or shopping in the immediate area, so you'll need to venture out for these. The walk to Grand Central was an easy one and we took the subway everywhere. Sites such as the Empire State Building and Times Square were easily walkable, as is shopping on 5th Avenue. If you're traveling with kids and need a cool break in the sightseeing frenzy, visit the St. Vartan's playground on 1st Avenue just a few blocks from the hotel. Our kids loved it and we enjoyed sitting in the shade and relaxing after a full day of walking. The Eastgate Tower isn't fancy, but it's a great value for NYC and was the perfect set-up for our family of four.", "Date": "July 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "High Wycombe, UK", "Title": "\u201cFanastic Hotel, Great Staff\u201d", "Author": "DanielJW", "ReviewID": "UR8023110", "Content": "Both myself and my other half stayed in this hotel mid-february (during the snow) for a long weekend.

A lounge/diner with four seat table, sofa bed, 32 inch TV, kitchen with dishwasher, small bathroom and bedroom with two queen beds and 21 inch TV, plus lots of storage. Then there's the view.

I had to pay an extra $3.40 to print my airline boarding pass. It was $3 for 7 mon. and 20 cents per page to print. This was on top of the $9.95 for internet in my room. It was minimal but annoying. Also I would have liked a comfortable armchair. We had two desk/dining chairs and had to always sit on the bed to watch TV. The room was plenty large enough to accomodate at least a simple wood/upholstered seat armchair.

We stayed in a 1 bed studio suite which was very spacious and clean with en-suite bathroom and a small kitchenette. Clean towels and flannels were provided daily along with some excellent toiletries from Judith Jackson Spa (shower gel, soap, facial soap, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, mouthwash) so no need to bring your own! The room was much bigger than we needed for our short stay and would be ideal for people staying more than a week. We were on the 17th floor so it was very quiet - no street noise and no noise from other rooms despite there being lots of children in the neighbouring rooms. The location is within easy walking distance from Grand Central station, giving good access to the rest of New York and is also very close to the Chrysler building and the UN. The area felt very safe to walk around at night. Also close by is the Frontier diner where you can get a decent breakfast (they'll also deliver breakfast to your room for no extra charge). But if you fancy more of a treat, try Pershing Square outside Grand Central. The pancakes were amazing and the waffles were huge. Probably a bit pricey by US standards ($12) but a bit cheaper compared to London, given the sheer size of the food. This was our first time in New York and we were surprised at the short opening hours of most shops and attractions at the weekends (10am - 5pm). This meant we struggled to do more than two things a day. I would definitely recommend going to the Top of the Rock at the Rockefeller Center.

Cab ride would've been a $45 flat rate. Our first experience at the Hotel wasn't good...the front desk person wouldn't provide our room at 1:00 pm as it \"wasn't ready\". The bellman overheard and volunteered to check the room himself. I think he saw that I had planned to have the girls nap (had been up since 4:00 am) right on the lobby couches until the room was ready and smartly offered to get us in. Not sure why the front desk didn't check to see, but it helps to be persistent. Room was already made up and available. Housekeeping was then great with quickly providing extra linens and towels. The room was very large. We had a \"1 bed suite\" ($270 first night, $215 second night). It wasn't really a suite with a door to the bedroom, but it had a sitting area as well as a table with 4 chairs. Kitchen was adequate--just used the refrigerator and freezer. Furniture was a bit worn and dated. Blankets provided for the pull-out couch were filled with holes. Bathroom was tiny and not as clean as it could've been. The hairdryer was especially dirty, and there were several cracks in the mirror and tile. Bed was comfortable and the room was quiet on the 10th floor. The heat didn't seem to work very well, but we were still comfortable. We didn't spend much time in the hotel, so we weren't that fussy. We felt very safe. I had stayed at the Affinia Dumont also in the Murray Hill neighborhood--which was a much more upscale property but a further walk to Grand Central Station. However, prices there have increased significantly. I was very happy with the room and with our stay at Eastgate. The bellman arranged a town car for us back to JFK for a $50 flat rate. Nice driver; enjoyed much better than a cab ride. Kids loved it! The location of this hotel is great--walked to Grand Central Station, Empire State Building, all the great restaurants on 3rd Avenue, Times Square, Bryant Park, and even to Rockefeller Centre. Only took 3 cab rides in 3 days. The Gray Line double-decker bus tours are outstanding. You can get on and off at various parts throughout the city (buy tickets online for a $5 savings). Guides are very entertaining. You can start at Times Square and go from there. The girls loved the city, especially the tour of NBC. Our only regrets were not making it out to the Statue of Liberty and wasting time going up to the top of the Empire State Building--too long of a line and the girls were quickly bored.

Also, i will mention that i have stayed recently at the affinia manhattan on business and had a very good experience as well (although i prefer the eastgate location).", "Date": "April 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood location - plenty of space\u201d", "Author": "RPFLondon", "ReviewID": "UR7348014", "Content": "Most positive aspect was size of rooms.

None of us are in our first flush of youth, but we walked almost everywhere safely day and night. Grand Central; Empire State; Times Square; United Nations; Central Park, and Macys were easily reached on foot. We did get a tour bus (well worth it) Downtown and broke the journey to \"do\" Brooklyn Bridge, etc. There was a 90 minute wait for the ferry to land on the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island, so we went on the free Staten Island Ferry which passes close by - a much better option, and the views of Downtown on the way back are stunning. One thing we British are used to at home is easily accessible loos when we are out and about. I had read there were none in New York, but they are there if you look in all the places named above. Eating wasn't a problem, and the Townhouse Diner at 2nd Ave and 38th Street can be highly recommended. The flight to/from Gatwick/Newark was good, and the Supershuttle from the airport was a free tour of New York.

The staff were very helpful...and very courteous. We flew in via Newark and decided to be adventurous and took the Newark Airtran connection to Penn Station and took a cab from there. For a family of 5, the train ride and cab ride to the hotel cost us $78. On our way to La Guardia on our return trip we asked the hotel concierge to reserve a cab for us...and since there were 5 of us, the concierge said we would need a van. Of course, the taxi-minivans were the only ones that we could get around in. Again, to our pleasant surprise, a shiny, black Lincoln Navigator was waiting for us promptly in front of the hotel during our day of departure. BTW, this ride for a family of 5 was very reasonable compared to our train/cab adventure (albeit La Guardia is closer than Newark)...this \"limo\" ride cost $50 + toll + tip.

We had 2 queen beds, a sofa bed, a well-equipped kitchen (with microwave, stove, dishwasher, toaster, coffee maker), dining room, and 2 TVs! It was nice to have room to spread out and relax, and have some late night snack when we felt the munchies! That, plus we had views!

Granted, I reserved the JW bi-level suite for the party to host about 45 people and my fears of the rooms were quickly put to rest. Yes, the hotel can use some updating to include the room decor (previous reviews) but the hotel was overall clean and very professional. The moment I arrived the JW was on it. From the valet, the front desk, bellman, etc. everyone was top notch. The amount of \"stuff\" I had brought was no longer a worry. Everyone took the worry from me and place it on the JW staff. Even throughout the day until guests arrived the staff followed up in every way. Personal visits to the room, phone calls, extra tables and whatever else was needed was no problem for the JW.

The layout of the hotel is odd, with the small lobby and drive in the back. They indicated that they are preparing for a major remodel. Be prepared to circle the block to get to check-in. The location of the Marriott across the street also ads to the confusion, but traveling is an adventure. Shula's is in the hotel and has the best cobb salad I've ever eaten. I grabbed lunch at Shula's before heading out for the day. The staff was wonderful and the food was amazing. I have access to the lounge for Marriott perks members. I was amazed to find that it closes on the weekends. None of the other properties I've ever visited had such limited hours. The food was good, but there was a cost for drinks. Soft drinks were free. It was not set up for the casual pleasure traveler that travels on the weekends. Room service is a bit limited, since it come through Shula's. All in all, the property was clean and pleasant.

Marriott is beautiful! From the murals to the chandeliers to the view from the upper floors, simply beautiful! We stayed for several days and enjoyed almost every minute. The exception to that statement comes from the fact that they charge for every little thing. We had a room on the 28th floor, Concierge level booking, and were told by Central Booking that internet (in our room) would be free. No! It's $14.95 ... PER DAY ... PER DEVICE! My husband and I both had laptops and the kids both had ipods and everyone had to agree to the $14.95 a day charge for internet service. And it's not even great/reliable service. There were plenty of times it didn't work at all and we had to call IBHAN and complain and they would contact the hotel \"engineers\" to fix the problem. It would be okay for a little while and then it would get slower and slower and slower....... or not work at all. Rooms: We had a single room w/ 2 double beds. The beds were small but comfortable. The bathroom was small but very clean and had plenty of counter space. You get a coffee maker but no microwave and no refrigerator. Location: Two blocks from Bourbon. Close enough to enjoy the party but far enough away to leave the chaos and noise behind when you return to your room. CVS and Walgreens are just 2 blocks up the street, as is McDonald's, IHOP and Krystals. Tipping: If you are opposed to tipping for services, do NOT stay here. On the first day of our stay, we had tipped out to the guy that helped unload our car, to the guy that brought the stuff to our room (not the same guy), to the guy that later brought the car back down to us that evening, to the concierge lounge staff in the a.m. AND the p.m. They do not loan out luggage carts and allow the guests to handle their own luggage. Parking: $35 per day. I stayed here years ago when it was the Le Meridien and I believe the parking was only $9 a day. Why hotels in NOLA charge so much for parking is a complete mystery to me. They are storing your car. Not washing it, not waxing it, not servicing it ... just storing it. The staff in the Concierge Lounge are wonderful. Very friendly, very helpful, and always working very hard to keep up with the needs of the guests at breakfast and evening hor devours. The coffee was always fresh and the food was fantastic. The breakfast each morning was the same (eggs, oatmeal, bacon, bread items, pastries, cereal, fruit, yogurt, meats, cheeses, fresh juice, etc. Evening hor devours (only available at Concierge Level booking), were always different and a meal in itself. Salad, tuna shooters, meatloaf w/ cubed sweet potatoes, soup, grilled chicken and pasta, tortellini w/ lobster sauce, ribs, shrimp creole w/ rice ..... these are just a few of the things we enjoyed during our stay and it changes each night. They also have a dessert bar from 8-10p.m., with 2 or 3 things to choose from. NOTE: The Concierge Lounge closes at noon on Friday and does NOT re-open until 2p.m. on Sunday. If staying over a weekend, you will need to eat breakfast elsewhere. Shula's steakhouse on the ground floor offers a breakfast buffet and menu items. We did not eat at Shula's, as it is VERY expensive. The breakfast buffet is $20 per person. Fitness center and pool: Top-notch and unlike most places we have stayed. Lots of exercise equipment available and the center itself is beautifully decorated. The pool is on the roof of the 7th floor and although not heated (cold even on hot days because of the wind up there), offers a fantastic view. Staff: The bell hops are very friendly, the front-desk staff is nice but very business-like in nature. The cleaning staff were all very friendly and helpful. But the Concierge Lounge staff won our hearts! Taxes: Our bill reflects Sales Tax, Occupancy Tax, Room Tax AND Parking Tax. This easily adds $40 to your bill each day, on top of $35 for parking each day AND $14.95 for internet a day. Throw in the tips and wow, now you may not be able to afford that trip to Bourbon Street after all. It makes sense that this hotel caters to mainly to those traveling on business (and not so much families), as it is my guess that the company is picking up the tab, not the traveler.

Like many of you I rely on the reviews from Trip Advisor before making a decision. I must admit, some of the reviews had me a bit concerned, but after 4 days in this hotel I would definately stay there again and recommend it to friends. Lets be honest, anyone can find something to complain about; but in a city known for it's seedy sinful excess the JW was a great retreat to comfort and luxury. The positives were many. 1.)Location. You can't beat it for a large chain hotel. It is located at the corner of St Charles and Canal. This is just about a block and a half from Bourbon Street and The French Quarter. You also have easy access to the St Charles trolley car (Which takes you to the Garden District and the Warehouse District) and the Canal Street Line. There are also plenty of shops directly across the street to buy beer and other items to take up to your room. 2.)Service. Top notch, especially given that many of these employees are assaulted with a never ending stream of drunkards. Despite probably hearing the same dumb comments over and over and over, the staff always remained patient, upbeat, and friendly. This was not my expeirence at other places in the city. Although we arrived early on our flight we were immediately given a room. On one occasion, it had been raining and the front desk provided us umbrellas. On another, I ordered room service late at night and my shrimp Po boy showed up in about 10 minutes, was delicious, and had about 30 gulf shrimp in it!. The kitchen called a few minutes later to see if everything was to my liking. But the best example is when a women was getting arrested in the lobby and the staff apologized to us for the disturbance! 3.)The Room We had a king bed room on the 24th floor. It was immaculate. The bed and linens were extremely nice and it was one of the best night sleeps my wife and I have had in a long time. No problem whatsoever with noise especially consider that the weekend we were there was the start of Mardi Gras. The room was made up every day and new towels were brought in. 4.)Amenities My wife visited the spa and was quite pleased. There is also a Shulas steakhouse which we tried for breakfest. Although Shulas is your typical ubiquitous steakhouse type restaraunt the breakfest we had there was pretty good albeit a bit pricey. If I had to give a few minuses it would be these--and this is being quite nitpicky. No mini-bar in the room Hair Dryer sucked. I needed a pen to write with and housekeeping did not provided that after the last guest left. Others have said this was not up to the typical JW standard. The newer JW's like the one in Indianapolis are over the top. This is an older hotel but compared to the other options available in New Orleans their should be no concern with quality.

The good: excellent staff - my first room had a noisy ceiling exhaust fan that I knew instantly would bother me so I just hauled my belongings back to the front desk and they happily gave me another room which they also said was an upgrade. The room was really nice, I loved the layout and it was very, very quiet.

They also don't try to nickel and dime you like some upscale hotels. And the location couldn't be better. You are literally steps away from just about anything. The bad - truthfully, I didn't have any complaints.

It is the staff which makes this hotel something more than your typical Marriott. The doorman Albert was exceptionally friendly and helpful. He greeeted us by name whenever he saw us.

There are other shops for food and soda right on Canal St. Also, the hotel restuarant (Shula's) had a rather pitiful breakfast buffet with poor service. Instead of eating here, go across the street, as there are tons of restaurants open 24 hours. Aside from the food and gift shop, everything else was FLAWLESS. Do not hesitate to stay here.

The room was clean and spacious with a lovely view of sunrise over the Mississippi. The location was great and there are countless good eating places nearby. But look at the menu before stepping foot into Shulla's, the restuarant in the hotel. It's pretty expensive. I was at a conference here and the hotel food was excellent too. The staff was friendly and hospitable but overall it didn't seem as if one department knew what the other was doing. I think the management needs to work on more synergy among departments. Before I arrived and when I checked in, I inquired about the $15.00 daily internet fee. I asked if it had been waived for our conference and the person at the desk said no. Three days later, after using a tether on my blackberry to get online, we learned that, indeed, the internet fee had been waived. My first day here a housekeeper came into my room before I could get to the door saying she wanted to count the towels. It was a bit unnerving to have someone just unlock the door and walk in. There were directions in the room about how to use the features on the phone but none of them seemed to apply to the actual phone in the room. Not even a staff person was able to figure out how to retrieve a message. He had to call the desk. Then there was the TV. It seemed we were here during the hotel's transition to HDTV. I arrived in my room one afternoon to find the TV turned to high volume and no remote to turn it off. My luggage had been moved as were other items. I thought I was in the wrong room. The woman at the desk told me the housekeeper always leaves the TV on after cleaning!!! Has anyone ever heard of that? I eventually found the remote hidden behind the coffee container. It didn't work. A very nice man came and dismantled the TV so I didn't have to listen to the loud music and ads. After about 2 hours an engineer came and fixed it. The nice man offered to have champaign sent to my room. I opted for a glass of wine.

Bourbon St is a 5 minute walk which is perfect. You can pick up a trolley within 100 yards. We've stayed on Bourbon St before (Royal Sonesta) and while it was great to be in the \"thick\" of things, it's also nice to get away from it when it's time to get some sleep. The rooms at the JW are larger than those at the Royal Sonesta as well. Everything you will ever need is 1 block from the JW. Drug Store, Beer, wine, liquor, etc. It's all there. Even a coffee shop just outside and to the right of the JW. It's basically connected. Rooms are standard JW rooms. Comfy beds, great views (we were on the 28th floor out of 30) and we could see the river and the city. It was really nice. There is a bar downstairs at the JW but it's small and we found the service to be sub par there. Just one bartender who wasn't in much of a hurry to do anything. Not to fear, you're in New Orleans! lol. There is a Shula's Steakhouse attached to the hotel and the bar there is nice with great service and selection. We stayed at the JW for $139 / night and I'm a platinum member so got a great upgrade. Marriott is always good at taking care of Platinum Elite members so I do enjoy those perks. The staff is superb from top to bottom. If you have stayed at JW Marriott properties before, you will not be disappointed.

We really enjoyed staying here and even with five days of fun, we didn't get to nearly all the New Orleans things there are to see and do. So we'll be back, and we'll stay at the JW. It's in a great location if you plan on spending time in the French Quarter; the trollies literally stop right out in front, and good restaurants abound. (The hotel is right on the edge of the French Quarter.) Because of that, there's absolutely no need to rent a car; in fact, I think having a car would be an expensive pain--parking's outrageous and difficult...like any big city. Lots of good stuff to say--maybe even a few things that haven't already been mentioned. Someone complained about the concierge availability but we found just the opposite. Melissa was easy to meet with, and very helpful and knowledgeable about the area. Happy to book some tours which were the highlight of our trip. Wish I remember his name, but one of the doormen was truly outstanding in going beyond the call of duty when we wanted a refrigerator, and when we had a problem getting back in our room one day. He was so helpful, friendly, outgoing and funny, too! Let me mention the good stuff first, and the not so good last. Beds are very comfortable, and our maid service was efficient, friendly, and competent. Good room lighting is important to me, and the JW excelled in that; for example, there was a really well designed, effective, adjustable-position LED reading light mounted on each side of the bed. Also, there's a power strip on the back of the large desk for those myriads of chargers and plug-in thingies so many of us bring with us. Medium size room which was fine for two. Really speedy elevators. The lobby is very well laid out with lots of comfortable sitting areas and tables so you can sip a drink (or free lemonade) and play on your iPad real comfortably. OK, here's some of the not-so-good stuff. I suppose room configurations vary here, but our room had a Motel-6 size bathroom with a Motel 6 size counter area. Matter of fact, I've been in Motel 6 bathrooms which were bigger. For that reason alone, I didn't rate this JW a 5. The $15/day WiFi charge is kind of outrageous (it's free in the lobby, however). It did work well and it was fast. I dunno; maybe in the better hotels such as this one, that price is reasonable and customary--I don't want to be unfair. But if you have 3G access, however, I'd use that first. The view from the room was awful--great view of mostly rusty air conditioning units and other roof tops. I blame that on myself, however, because I should have asked first and didn't. So ask when you reserve and/or check in. Speaking of check in, we asked for and got a late 1:30 PM checkout with no problem (checkout is normally noon). But all in all we really liked it here and as I've said in the headline, I'd definitely book it again.

Quite puzzling as I had left my cell# for reception to call when our preassigned room was ready. No call was rcvd. I must say though that the front desk staff were quite courteous. Room was clean and nice sized. Room fridge and mini safe ( you'll need a chair to be able to view yr contents ). Bathroom/counter space was small, however shower is good due to curtain design. Not great water pressure so the shower was just enough to get by. No bathroom fan so expect the misty mirrors. Checked out the 8th floor outdoor pool and there was no locker room adjacent to their nice gym/workout area which you pass through to go to the pool. With late checkout time at 1 p.m. for most guests who may request such, there is no courtesy shower/room to allow for you to wash up from that New Orleans heat/humidity induced perspiration. Their lobby bathroom is one alternative. So at around 4 p.m. I opted for the less frequented of spots and went a floor up to the conference room level to change. It was a morgue up there. Found a tucked away area by the piano with a table and did a quick change. Figures a security guy would stroll by as I was about to put on my belt. He suspiciously asked, \"can I help you ? \" for which I simply replied, \"only if you want to dress me ! \" I then told him I was a guest and my room #, but that didnt seem to be enough for him.

The pool is small and it has no hot tub, which would have been nice after a long day of walking. But, the kids enjoyed the pool. Parking is expensive, but it is great to not have to worry about driving where you want to go and know that your car is safe. I would recommend this hotel to anyone new to New Orleans. One thing to know that is helpful - as you approach the hotel on canal st, drive past the hotel, and turn rt on magazine st and then rt on commons to the Marriott parking in the back, where you can drop off your car and check in.

This was taken out of our bill by the manager on duty when we were checking out BECAUSE MARRIOTT MADE SO MANY MISTAKES during our stay there. We didn't ask for it, we were given by the manager because there were so many problems and mistakes by Marriott staff. I see this charge as ANOTHER MISTAKE in a chain of mistakes during our stay with JW Marriott New Orleans!! I thought this was behind us but obviously it wasn't so here I go again telling/writing someone what happened. 1) We made a reservation for the \"romance package\" which included champagne and strawberries when we arrived. When we arrived it wasn;t there, so we called and asked that it be ready in the evening when we get back from dinner. When we came back, it STILL WAS NOT THERE. Then the manager came late with the package, apologized, etc. 2) Our breakfast was charged to our room eventhough it was in the package 3) In our last day, even though our package included late check out, and further, even though we asked again for confirmation of our late check out, and further more even though there was a \"DO NOT DISTURB\" sign on the door, here came loud loud knocks on the door (as if a landlord knocks on a unpaying tenant). There she was, the cleaning staff!!! I remember staying in W and ordering room service, and I received a call saying \"Sorry sir, our room service is outside your room but can't knock the door since you have a do-not-disturb sign on\". 4) Now this!! I get charged the $xxx which was provided without asking for it as an apology. How incompetent a hotel management system and staff can be!!!! Obviously, it is a system, process and HR problem.

At 5:00 AM I heard a tapping on my door...got up and looked out, and there was a guy cleaning the doorframes of all the rooms. Are you kidding me? 5AM???? Went back to bed and at 8:00AM I heard a noise at the door again. Housekeeping had key in door and was walking in. Good thing I had top latch secured. Noise in hallway all night both nights made for a very long 2 nights without much sleep. We used the pool on the 8th floor on Friday afternoon. There was one other couple there and when the woman got out of the pool, she walked 2 steps then slipped on the very slippery tile surrounding the pool and landed flat on her back. Her husband went to get ice for her, but I was amazed that no one from the staff came to check on her. When I got out of pool, I too almost fell. Wrong type of tile to be around a pool. Location is great, and hotel is very clean, but I think I will look elsewhere for my next trip to the Big Easy.

I remember when it used to be a Le Meridien. Then it was the Grand Hotel, now the JW. I love the location.

Complimentary bottles of water, ok pool, friendly staff, I can recommend it. I had one disappointing experience recently: I called the concierge and asked about where the free walking tour starts in the city and when. I could have googled it within a minute (if the room had free internet). But it took the concierge (it was the bell boy) over an hour and three calls to my room to get me the info, which proved to be totally wrong. That\u00c2\u00b4s not to their normal standard. Also, they try to sell the tours at the desk, that they get a cut from (local operators). I insisted of using Grayline but they would not give me their brochure. I also asked for the next Bank of America ATM and was sent to the Mariott across the street, which did not have one. There is free wifi in the lobby. I wish they will soon put it in all the rooms. Also, the TV variety could have been bigger. The Shula steakhouse was really very expensive. Did not eat there but don\u00c2\u00b4t understand why other people do. It is way overpriced.

The main reason we stayed here was that my husband has a lot of Marriott points so we were able to get a free room for both nights. Here are some highlights/lowlights: 1. Room- Our room was clean and well-furnished however it was small and had 5 sides, but 2 of the walls had large windows overlooking the French Quarter so that lessened the feeling of claustrophobia 2. Internet Fee- As other reviewers have noted, $12.50/day is excessive for internet access. My husband has Marriott Platinum Elite status and they wouldn't agree to waive this charge for him so it is safe to assume that everyone has to pay this much. 3. Fitness Facility - There is a decent sized gym however: a) it is very warm with little ventilation and b) it was full both mornings we went (9 am) so be prepared. Also the TV on my treadmill didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. 4. Sassy Room Service People- We ordered breakfast from room service both mornings. The first morning our order was perfect, however the second morning they made some mistakes (even though we had ordered the same things as the day before). When we called them to ask them to rectify the errors, the Room Service lady on the phone was argumentative and wanted to go on and on about why she sent the order the way she did. Regardless, it was wrong and no one wants to spend their time or vacation arguing w/ Room Service. Just fix it and be done, people! 5. Location- The hotel is on Canal St. which means that it borders the French Quarter (but is not in it) which can be a good or bad thing, depending on your view. 6. Parking - We did not have a car but if you are planning to bring one to the hotel, call to ask about parking charges in advance as they can run as high as $30/day in that area. Also, ask the hotel about parking garages in the area which charge less. They will not come out and offer this infor but they tell you if you ask. 7. Concierge Level - Since my husband is a Marriott Plat. Elite, when he booked the room, they said that we would have access to their Concierge Lounge (free food and drink - yay!). We went there to have a drink around 5 pm on Friday after checking in, it was closed. Sadly, according to their sign, the Concierge Lounge is closed during the weekend. . All in all, the JW Marriott was a pleasant enough place to stay since it was free. However, at their rack rates of $250/night, I wouldn't pay money to stay there.

I cant think of a single reason I would stay in a place that has mold in their showers for 200.00 a night again.

From checkin to checkout, all staff members were very accomodating and had a great attitude. You cannot beat the location of this hotel - it's located at the heart of Canal Street, just a block from the French Quarter. The streetcar lines on Canal and St. Cahrles are easily accessed. There are a ton of restaurants within walking distance, as well as a nice one inside the hotel. (Shula's steakhouse). There's also an expansive bar and lounge area just adjacent to the restaurant. For day drinks or evening cocktails, you can visit the main bar and lounge area close to the lobby of the hotel. The area can accomodate a large amount of people and you can also order food from the hotel menu. The Guest rooms were just ok, very clean, but a butoverpriced for what you get. For $200 a night you get a \"Deluxe\" room, which is quite small. I called ahead to make sure that the room I chose would have a decent size flat panel LCDTV in case we watched the big game in the room. Unfortunately, the rooms only had a 26\" older tube TVs. Maybe it's just me, but I think any moderm 4-star hotel should have nice flat panel LCD TVs. Lesser hotels have made this leap. Also, the rooms we were in lacked a certain cohesiveness - the decor was strange - nice modern bedding, then an ugly brass lamp, then a nice New Orleans-themed picture, followed by a out-of-place themed picture with ugly framing. The TV armoir/dresser was tasteless in design and hideously large, it took up entirely too much space and was an eye sore. The room wasn't all bad, the did provide a few small extras such as a alarm clock-radio with a docking station for an iPod, which we actually used. There was a writing desk and chair, as well as two oversized chairs. I may be splitting too many hairs, but when you spend $200+/night, you notice these things.

The room is large enough (we were in one of the wedge-shaped rooms) but the light switches are placed in exactly the wrong locations - you have to be well into the dressing and the sink rooms in order to find the light switch.

He didn't tell me who he was but later I realized he was a security guard. He then called someone and another 5 to 10 minutes later the front desk clerk came out. He then called the valet who also wasn't where he should be, and had my car parked. This was 45 minutes after I initially pulled in. Although this is poor service, what was MOST concerning was no one was watching their front lobby. Anyone or any group of people could have just wandered in.

Great City! Great fun - hotel was pretty good but just a few minor details they could work on and it would be just perfect. They need to vaccum their rooms a little more frequently and thoroughly. We upgraded to a plush bed that was great, the room location was good and the room size was definitely adequate. Sometimes housekeeping gave us water (bottled) and some days not. There is an in room coffee maker that is quite convenient. We did get an mini bar charge of six dollars when we checked out - which was an error - but at 5:00 am check out - it was a minor error and we could not be bothered arguing. Didn't use any of the ammenities (pool/salon/restaurant) as there are sooo many wonderful places to eat in NOLA (like NOLA!). Service is friendly just about everywhere. Everyone on the street greets you all day long, no matter where you're at. The hotel is block away from an IHOP - which comes in handy if you're looking to eat big and walk it off! Which is what you'll do. I recommend the walk through the Garden District - take the street car from St. Charles to Jackson and get off and walk around the beautiful homes. Walk back to the hotel - not too far (as long as you are comfortable walking and able) the cobblestones and some of the brick walks get to be a bit ankle wrenching. Walk along the Mississippi and take the Natchez steam boat - one evening ate at K-Paul's - good food - rich - but service is very cool compared to NOLA (Emeril Lagasse's) where you are actually \"waited\" upon - make reservations for both before going - they are very busy. Dress is pretty casual for most places or you can dress up if you like. Bourbon street is close to the hotel and is just unbelievable until you see if for yourself. Really nice antique shops if you like that thing close by. Shopping is a little sparse but oh well! Like I said there are some great restaurants all over to pick from - don't limit yourself if you can. The pralines are great everywhere! Didn't do Cafe du Monde because it was always busy and didn't want to wait in line. Really like NOLA and would go back to visit anytime.

First visit to New Orleans. While this wasn't a bad hotel, I don't really think it was worthy of the \"JW\" label. It seemed more in line with the regular Marriott brand. Although the hotel's address is on Canal Street, the actual entrance for parking is off of Common Street, one block behind Canal. The lobby is actually fairly impressive - very modern looking, and check in was quick and easy. We were given a corner room on the 28th level. The room was a decent size - larger than a regular room, at least - but it left something to be desired. The furnishings were old and could stand to be updated. The bed, while not uncomfortable, was nothing special. I don't know if it was the standard Marriott bed. The flat screen TV was nice, but there was one time where we turned it on and the majority of the channels weren't working. The bathroom was a bit on the small side. One evening when we were showering before heading out, the hot water didn't work. Condensation from the air conditioner dripped from the ceiling continuously. To Marriott's credit, they gave me some bonus points and offered to change our room due to A/C and no hot water problems. We kept this room since we were checking out the next day. The concierge lounge was closed over the weekend (no surprise, but still not cool). The in guest service directory was missing several pages, including room service menus. When we called late one night to find out what they had and place an order, we were told they only had two late night offerings, neither of which we wanted. Surprising and disappointing that a \"high end\" hotel in such a large tourist destination doesn't offer 24 hour room service. The best thing about this hotel its location. You aren't immediately in the French Quarter, but all you have to do is cross Canal St, and you're there. The staff was generally helpful and nice. Shula's Restaurant was great for the breakfast buffet and getting a quick drink before heading out to the Quarter. Also close by are the casino, Canal Place shops, aquarium, and other downtown attractions. I'd stay here again for the right price, but will probably want to check out something else on my next visit to New Orleans.", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manhattan, NY", "Title": "\u201cJW Marriott New Orleans - Relaxation, Convenience, and a GREAT View!\u201d", "Author": "HotelJunky84", "ReviewID": "UR46413758", "Content": "I have had the opportunity to stay at the JW Marriott on numerous occaisions throughout the past couple of years and the hotel has always exceeded my expectations. Originally, this hotel was a Le Meridien that converted to the JW Marriott flag - so expect a great hotel experience with excellent service. Location! Location! Location! If you have ever been to New Orleans, then you know how important location is. If your goal is to hang out at the clubs on Bourbon Street during the night or shop for antiques on Royal Street during the day, you could not ask for a better location! The JW Marriott rises prominently off of Canal Street - seperating the Central Business Disctrict from the French Quarter. You will find it easy to step out the front door of your hotel and enter into the world of America's only European city. Within a few blocks of the hotel are numerous restaurants including the Dickey Brenan's Palace Cafe which is located directly across the street. Overall, this is an excellent location that combines comfort with safety and security. Public Areas The JW Marriott offers a free flowing floor plan on the main floor of the hotel. If you enter from the Canal Street entrance, you will travel through the arcade area which includes numerous shops and the world famous Shula's Steakhouse. From the arcade, you will find yourself at the hotel's lobby bar which offers bi-level seating but never really seems to entertain too many guests -- which is not unusual considering it is located 2 blocks from Bourbon Street. Continuing along the path, you will find public restrooms and a gorgeous jazz rotunda that depicts the New Orleans music scene through a massive wall painting which carries you into the main lobby. In the main lobby, you will find the concierge, guest elevators and the very attentive front desk. Located on the upper floors, you will find the outdoor pool and fitness center. Unfortunately, the hotel does not offer locker rooms or shower facilities in this area of the hotel. However, they do offer a rinse shower located next to the pool. Rooms! The rooms at the JW Marriott are typical of an upper class Marriott hotel and offer excellent views of the French Quarter or downtown if you are able to get a room located on any floor above 15. While classically styled, the furniture in the rooms could use a bit of updating but this is not a major downfall of the hotel. If you enjoy comfy beds that feel like sleeping on clouds --- then this is the hotel for you! I would have to say that the major con of the rooms at the JW Marriott is that the bathrooms tend to be a bit on the small side and makes for a cramped situation if more than one person is trying to use the mirror at the time. Overall I highly recommend the JW Marriott New Orleans to anyone who is traveling to the city and would like to treat themselves to a luxury hotel that offers convenience and safety. As a person who travels to New Orleans on a monthly basis, I can honestly say that this is 1 of 10 properties that I would probably recommend for your upcoming trips.", "Date": "October 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cThis is a JW???\u201d", "Author": "ChocolateAnything", "ReviewID": "UR46335085", "Content": "We went to New Orleans for a cousin's wedding, and traveled with our 2 year old. I was excited that the branding was a JW Marriott, the highest end of the Marriott chain. However, it was less than glorious in person. The lobby was modern with an interesting frosted glass pillar with changing colored lights, which entertained my kid during check-in. But when you looked up at the ceiling, there was such bad water damage (from Katrina, no doubt). The service was fine and attentive. We had the corner concierge level room which was not as spacious as I thought it would be. The decor was very old and dated, which was absolutely surprising that this was a JW. There was a large LCD TV, but the channels were sparse and none of the channels were in HD (not taking advantage of the TV). Then again, none of the hotels ever do. Our bed was satisfactory, nothing that I'd rave about. The view was nice. We did love the ipod dock. The bathroom was very small and outdated as well. It was difficult to wash my little girl in the tub because it was so dark in the bathroom. The pool was teeny tiny and closed the first day we were there. They offered us to use the Marriott Hotel pool across the street, but it seemed like too much to do just for a short swim. On the day that the pool was open, the water was freezing cold, which again, surprising as a JW hotel. We dipped our toes in and that was it. Breakfast at the downstairs restaurant - Shula's - was our highlight. Starbucks coffee, delicious and plentiful variety of buffet foods, hot and cold. We had great service as well. The morning that we had to catch our flight, they allowed us to make a take-out package to eat on the run. The location was decent and away from all of the nightly noise. We walked everywhere.

Marriott hotel on Canal Street. The room charge was $269.00 per night and I had to change rooms three times until they showed me, \"one of our new rooms with cherry furniture\". When asked why they would rent a room with furniture falling apart, lamps that don't work, dirty carpet, scuffed walls, bathrooms with lavatories at hip height (I am 5' 4\" inches) and generally dirty bathrooms, their reply was, \"well we are upgrading our rooms and this used to be a Meridian Hotel, so its not our fault\".

To make matters worse, the Saturday evening front desk girl was rude and nasty when you checked in, called and asked to switch rooms or ask a general question. To further the horrible stay, the hotel had rented out a large number of rooms to pre teen/teenage girls on a choir tournament. The noise of young girls screaming in their rooms and in the halls until 2:30 a.m. each morning was unbearable! Did hotel staff help? Not much and these girls were chaperoned by middle aged adults!

I recently stayed at a Hotel Intercontinental, which is Holiday Inn's \"Ritz Carlton\" and their rooms and staff were far superior.

The Shula restaurant located inside the hotel property was horrible and New Orleans is known for its fabulous food. Try Brennan's Palace Cafe across the street from the hotel, its fabulous.

Prompted to be concerned given other reviews that complained about dated, small rooms, I called the GM's office before my stay to make sure I avoided getting accommodations I'd not like. Jacqueline Simon in the GM's office was amazing, and note to her boss--she is worth her weight in gold. She listened to my concerned, promised to look into the comments on Trip Advisor, and assured me that my room would be a nice one. She added that she quite liked the rooms in the hotel, but a thorough renovation was planned in the near future. I was so impressed with her--she listened, she owned the problem, she personalized my concerns, and promised she'd take care of it. I was even more impressed at check-in. The front desk had clearly been clued in, and had a 28th floor corner room waiting. The agent who checked me in treated me as I were a VIP, and I received a warm welcome. A great start. Again, kudos to the Front Office Manager. (One off note: I asked the concierge for directions to the Farmers' Market--and she tried to send me to the French Market. . .a different place. When I tried to clarify, she sent me to Magazine and Julia Streets, where the real address is Magazine and Girod, a few blocks away. Since guests seek out a concierge for accurate information, that was a major miss) Nice, well trained staff can be let down by a property in need of repair and updating, though. The lobby has the look of a circa 1992 bank office building, complete with rather cheesy, all-too-corporate looking chandeliers. The hotel hallways were scuffed. And what prompted the adverse reviews of the rooms was apparent, once inside. The hotel tower is unique, in that it is at an angle to the street grid of the city. The layout provides each floor with 8 corner rooms, and these rooms, while a bit larger than standard accommodations, have an odd triangular floorplan. Interestingly, the corner reduces, not increases, the amount of window space of these rooms. These rooms have a king size bed--don't think two doubles would fit. All seems smaller as a result of low ceilings. The bathrooms have a choppy configuration as well. The sink is separate from the room with the toilet and shower/tub. The watercloset itself is all marble, but rather small. Overall, the decor is dated. Wall graphics from the late 80s, early 90s colors and moldings--despite a flat screen and the trademark Marriott beds--these rooms need an update. Now, I should mention that I got this room for $49 per night on Priceline, and as such, this is an amazing deal. The lowest rate on Marriott.com for the same period was $139, and the upgrade made it even a better value--I'll bet that the Marriott employee rate wasn't even as low as $49. All the same, as a guest who's stayed at other JW Marriotts, this hotel would disappoint at full price. In fact, there are other mainline Marriotts that are nicer, and more updated. The Marriott Marquis in Atlanta, where I recently stayed, has a far better room product. The hotel has a nice fitness center that is free to guests--kudos, as hotels who charge for gyms earn the enmity of travelers who try to stay fit when on the road. One of the two ellipticals was out of order, but there were many treadmills and good weights. The outdoor pool is small and disappointing--scarcely bigger than a backyard pool with a rather cramped pool deck that gets more shadow than sunworshipers might like. Things like parking, in-room movies, and internet were quite expensive--$14.95 a day for broadband, and $13.95 for a movie were notably dear--as was $30+ daily parking with tax. The hotel's location is great. Right on Canal Street, and just across from the French Quarter, the hotel's back door is right near St. Charles Avenue for the famed streetcar. The river, Harrah's Casino, Jackson Square, Bourbon Street. . .all is close at hand. At Priceline prices, this hotel is a winner. But most guests don't stay here on $49 rates. Unless you do, you may want to wait until they renovate. When they do, this will be a hotel to consider.", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New England", "Title": "\u201cWould I book at a Marriott?

This is a 4star hotel with good recommendations online as I regularly research hotels, restaurants, etc before we leave home. I had paid and confirmed twice by phoning the front desk during the week to let them know that we would arrive late (approximately midnight). When we arrived at the airport there was a \"skeleton crew\" working because, we were told, most employees had not shown up to work. We waited a long time for our bags and at 12 a.m. I called the hotel to confirm that we would be leaving the airport shortly. I was very nervous because it was our first trip to New Orleans and we had concerns about our safety there. I was also concerned because it was late at night, we'd been travelling all day, and we just wanted a good nights sleep in a safe section of town at a brand name hotel. The woman who answered the front desk when I called at midnight said \"Actually you won't be staying here tonight. We're overbooked.\" I thought she must be mistaken. She didn't realize I had already booked a room AND paid for it by credit card weeks before. I replied \"Oh, I've confirmed and paid for a room. I'm already booked.\" She said \"No Ma'am, we're overbooked. We have no room for you.\" I told her \"But I confirmed my room already. You gave away my room?\" She replied \"Ma'am, we're overbooked. There are few rooms left in the city. If you take a cab here we can give you a voucher for another hotel and you can walk there. It's not far from here.\" Walk in a strange area of New Orleans with luggage after travelling 14 hours? At 1 am? To a hotel I know NOTHING about??? Really? I cancelled and requested a refund. As of 2/26 this refund had not been processed. Priceline intervened and refunded my money in full after a dispute was filed. It has been 2 months since our trip. Since then, Marriott had the administrative assistant to the general manager of the JW Marriott in New rRleans contact us by phone to explain the policy. We weren't available by phone to discuss the policies due to our busy lives. However, after several emails back and forth, the resolution Marriott has offered us is that they reserve the right, per their policy, to rebook your reservation to another hotel with whom they have a relationship. That is IT! It doesn't matter if you've paid. It doesn't matter that you called to confirm twice. You could arrive in a city that is new to you and be told at check in that you are being given a voucher and must relocate to a new hotel. No refund. Nothing complimentary. Not even the cab ride over to the new hotel was offered. Remember that we were advised by check in that it was just a short walk at 1 am with our luggage after 14 hours of travel. Due to this official corporate policy, per the corporate office to my inbox, I would never again recommend Marriott to anyone. While corporate assures me that this is a \"rare\" occurrence, it seems to me that once is more than we could stomach.

The rooms at the JW are rather small, but that's the norm in NOLA. I had a corner room with a bit more space. The furniture was rather worn out (not \"distressed\" to make it look old, but simply frayed and chipped). The TV was old, the picture was fuzzy, and it completely lacked the color red (probably a burned out circuit). Sure, I was not in New Orleans to watch TV, but nevertheless. I had three additional problems with the room (the safe did not work, the light bulb above the shower was burned out, and the shower curtain was dirty). I reported these problems in the morning. The same evening, I returned to my room and surprised to find that the problems were not fixed! I called and talked to the Night Manager, who apologized profusely and promised to send someone right away. They eventually replaced the shower curtain and fixed the safe while I was out for dinner. They never replaced the burned-out light bulb. In general, I found the hotel staff (e.g., porters) to be inattentive and uninterested in their jobs. For example, they opened doors for customers while continuing to chat with their buddies. No big deal, one would say, but this hotel used to have impeccable service prior to Katrina. The Concierge Lounge is large and elegant, with decent views of the French Quarter. They serve an above-average breakfast. Overall, if you demand top-notch service and accommodations, I recommend waiting until Marriott decides to renovate this hotel (and upgrade its management).", "Date": "August 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Danbury, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cSt.Patricks Day in New Orleans\u201d", "Author": "joshlufsgirl", "ReviewID": "UR17589112", "Content": "Myself, my two friends and my parents headed down to new orleans for the St.Patricks day holiday.

Room service was some of the best we've had and certainly the hottest food we've ever recieved from room service. The location of the hotel is 2 blocks from Bourbon Street on the opposite side of Canal, so walking to the French Quarter is a breeze, regardless of Bourbon St. or Decatur. Also a short distance to Harrah's. Service was exactly what you'd expect from this type of hotel, nothing short of the best. This was our second trip in as many years to the Crescent City and we loved it so much better this time. Our favorite night stop is the Famous Door which features live music (rock and roll) with a crowd that is not too old, or too young. We found two great \"local\" places to eat this trip. Coop's is just across from Margaritaville and some great local eats including the usual suspects plus pasta and great crab claws. The red beans and rice is great as is the gumbo, the jumbalya has rabbit and sauage and is great as well. Didn't have anything that didn't get eaten. Also, a little further on the far side of the French Quarter from where we stayed was a place called Port of Call. We all had the filet, but the burgers looked just a good. They only serve baked potaoes which are fantastic, and salads with a great blue cheese dressing! Be prepared to wait at this place, as lots of locals frequent, especially on the weekends. Some places we heard of from many locals, but did not get to, were Jaques Imos (sp?) and Tujagues. the first is a ways away and has a music place next door called the Maple? The latter is only a couple block from Coops on the same street (823 Decatur). We will definately try both of these next time. The two places we ate at are very casual. At Coops you may look inside and turn away, which we almost did, but venturing inside was one of the highlights of the trip. Also Port of Call is nothing fancy to look at, as the 5 other people thought I was crazy to make them walk all that way once they saw the outside. Funny, no one complained on the way back! One final comment on the JW-The pool is a decent size and located on the roof on the 8th floor, but the seating is very limited.

I was originally planning to spend two nights here, but wound up moving from the Marriott a day early due to sub-par service and renovations which were not disclosed prior to arrival. There was no problem in arriving a day early as occupancy rates are running about 15% for hotels in the area (at least the Marriott-branded properties.) The rooms portion of the hotel is 30 floors high and is sort of an X shape. My room was a deluxe corner king on the 29th floor with a view of the river (between several other hotels!) The room was not overly large, and was somewhat pie-shaped. To the right of the door was a dresser with several drawers and what was a mini bar. It had nothing in it, but it was locked so I was unable to use it to keep anything cold. I guess I could have asked to use it, or for a fridge, but I decided it wasn't necessary. Next was a closet with a safe inside. Also, a nice fluffy robe, an iron and board, and a couple satin hangers in addition to the normal wood hangers. Opposite the closet was a counter that was about 8-10 inches wide and maybe 5-6 feet long. Not sure why it was there, but I found it a good place to keep extra beverages and stuff. Next came the sink, followed by the tub/toilet in a separate, small room. Nice thick towels and \"nirvae\" toiletries in pleasant scents. The room had a king sized bed, a nightstand, desk, TV atop another small dresser, a desk and chair (nice and padded, not the usual office type) and an armchair with an ottoman and glass coffee table. Windows are not floor to ceiling but are big enough (and on part of two walls) that you can see out of them from the chair or the bed. The hotel is a bit noisy. I heard some street noise though not as much as at the regular Marriott. However, I did hear noise from above and next door. Also, on two nights I was awakened from a sound sleep in the middle of the night by noisy kids or young adults. I was not the only one who complained I later discovered. The concierge lounge was closed for the weekend. Actually, it would remain closed until the 4th of July when the crowds were due to pick up for the \"Essence\" festival. I was given coupons for a continental breakfast buffet in Shula's as well as a $15 discount to be used in either room service or Shula's for dinner on Sunday (when the lounge would normally be open for hors d' oeuvres). The Continental buffet had lots of fresh fruits, nice pastries and cereals, plus some meats and bagels and lox with all the fixings. However, for just $2 more, you could get the entire, hot buffet. Considering the retail price is $16.95 and the Continental buffet is $11.95, you can't beat it! The omelet one day was great, but the waffles on another occasion were a bit too sour and took very long. It was early and the mix wasn't ready, then the waffle maker wasn't hot. Again, others also mentioned the sour taste of the waffles. The server did, however, keep me apprised of the situation several times. Shula's is a chain of steakhouses named for the famed coach. Prices are listed (on the lunch/dinner menus) as \"market price\" which generally means to me that I need to win the lottery! Prime rib was $32.95 and was a 32 ounce hunk of meat. I went at about 5 PM so I was able to order the prime rib sandwich off the menu for $15.00. Tasty, but it could have been hotter. I must say though, every single staffer in the place-bartenders, servers, managers, hosts were so pleasant that I told the manager when I grabbed a quick snack upon checkout. My room also had a partial view of the outdoor pool which is on the 8th floor. The Marriott was sending its guests over to use it since theirs is closed. I didn't check out the pool but the people in it seemed to be having fun. The hotel is very clean-I noticed nothing broken or dirty and I always look for this stuff! Actually, I usually don't have to look for problems in a room-they find me! I really have nothing bad to say about the JW Marriott. I wish all other Marriott-branded hotels were run this well. As I had an early flight, I booked on line with the N.O. Airport Express shuttle. It's $13 and they pick you up right at your hotel. My shuttle arrived 10 minutes early and he made one other stop. There was one person already in the shuttle when I got on. We were due to get to the airport at 8:10 but we arrived well before that. The driver was nice and I would suggest this service to anyone needing such transportation. I found them by \"googleing\" N.O. Airport transportation but I think there is also a link on the NOLa airport website. For those flying Southwest out of New Orleans, many of the food places were not open. Not sure if this is due to the holiday, post-Katrina stuff or what, but be advised that there isn't much to eat in the terminal. That of course, is subject to change, but I had trouble even getting a cup of coffee. While I most likely won't return to NOLa in the foreseeable future, I would select the JW without hesitation.

Last year we had been washed out of our previous April haunts, the Fairmont and Ritz Carlton, so we tried the JW. Location adjacent to the French Quarter was very convenient without the noise and bustle. While fairly quiet last year because of Katrina, the JW worked out fine so we booked it again. We always come for the French Quarter Festival so I booked well in advance and got a good rate on the Marriott website, but keep checking back periodically as the rates often change and you can often rebook at a lower rate which is what I did and ended up with an even better rate. Hotel this year was more active than last, as was the City in general; Canal Street starting to look more like it had pre-Katrina but still with much work to be done. Art museum re-opened which I recommend, especially on a rainy afternoon. Stayed in a nice corner room, as we had last year; quiet and spacious though the bathroom is small but the outside vanity with sink makes that a non-issue. Room was in good order and the bed most comfortable as it was last year. Our request for bathrobes was promptly filled. While the price for internet and unlimited calls spiked up two bucks from last year, a small annoyance, it is a wired service which is faster than wireless so at least their is some bang for a buck grudgingly paid. Hotel is well maintained with a pretty decent exercise room containing five tread mills and several elliptical machines among other equipment, as well as a small outdoor pool.

The review on here that really made this hotel appeal to me was the one that spoke of this hotel previously being a Le Meridien and having fabulous beds. I love a nice bed in a hotel, and this hotel did not disappoint. The beds are wonderful, and wonderfully made, with a triple sheeted duvet. The hotel just finished a renovation, so everything is clean and new--I wore white socks around the hotel room and they were still white after three days. The things I loved about this hotel: Fabulous beds Friendly service Great location--across the street from the quarter, just a short walk to the riverfront--easy streetcar access. The things I didn't love: Pool was small and cold, very mildewy smelling workout room Overall I was happy with this hotel. We were very comfortable, and the service was good. Perhaps the pool was cold because it had been raining, and it continued to rain throughout our stay so we really didn't use it. I liked being able to walk everywhere. The location was great for us. It certainly is a large, convention-type hotel though, so it had a definite corporate feel to it. It didn't have a real New Orleans feel to it, but I didn't really expect it to and for my purposes that was fine. The main reasons I picked this hotel is because of the repeated comments about it being clean and the beds being great, and both were true.", "Date": "June 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas Texas", "Title": "\u201cSay No to JW Marriot-New Orleans\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3493569", "Content": "I've stayed at Marriots before and had top-notch service, but this was one of my worst hotel experience ever.

I decided to go to the restaurant and eat, but wanted to leave a message at the front desk for when she arrived. I was told a paper message would be thrown away and given the impression that a message would be ineffective. Obviously this JW Marriot has inefficiency issues with messages.

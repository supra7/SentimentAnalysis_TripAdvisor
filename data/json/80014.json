A continental breakfast was included in the room price - AND you could upgrade to a full HOT breakfast for just $5 - which we did and it was a hot and hardy breakfast with pancakes and eggs in addition to everything already available. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Beds were medium hard - good pillows. the room had a refridgerator and microwave - was near the pool and hot tub which was being used even though it was February - so I assume it must have been heated.

For the amenities, service and comfort I would have expected to pay quite a bit more. Breakfast was amazing--though by definition a continental breakfast is just coffee and roll or pastries this hotel had a full hot breakfast with made-to-order pancakes and eggs plus oatmeal, a variety of (not old!) pastries, bread and bagels (with toasters right there, plus cream cheese and butter), coffee, orange juice, apple juice, and apples/oranges. We actually left quite full each day and for free. The staff was very nice and helpful and went out of their way. The pool area (which had a hot tub) was clean; the pool was heated so even though it was cool during my stay I still swam. The hotel was near many excellent restaurants (loved Georgia's Greek Cuisine and Taste of the Himalayas Indian food) and stores, plus several buses are nearby and it's close to the Old Town transit center. The rooms were clean (no unpleasant odor, something I fear from former smoking hotels!), the bed was comfortable with a nice thick comforter. The room had a fridge, microwave, tub/shower, wifi, a/c unit, hot water machine and instant coffee. We used the free hotel shuttle on February 28th, it was very handy, took us to the airport for free and the shuttle had a 5mile radius which would cover downtown, the zoo (Balboa Park), and Seaworld. I didn't see that mentioned on their website or I would have used it to get an airport pickup. I will definitely stay here next time I visit! For the price I paid I expected much less. The only thing I could think to complain about was that the outside walls were thin and it was quite audible when people were loud outside but we were in a corner room right near stairs which made it more heavily trafficked. (Oh, and I agree that the coffee wasn't great.)

There is a computer in the front lobby that you can use to print your boarding passes and check e mails on a first come first serve basis. To get around you really need to have a vehicle which we didn't and regretted it. There isn't anything around for quite a few miles except hotels, free ways and homeless people sleeping under the underpasses and near the property. There is a security guard at night doing rounds on the property. There is a shuttle at the hotel that will take you to the zoo and sea world daily at different times during the day, just make sure to register the day before. The shuttle was good and there isn't a cost but they strongly encourage tips. The pool is at the very back of the property and was private and clean, but not overly big. The Trolley Tours does stop just past the hotel which you can get and off at your leisure from the morning until evening for adults $34.00 & $17.00 cash only if paying the conductor or cheaper to buy online.

My family and I were supposed to have a somewhat extended stay here and after 1 night, I simply couldn't do it. I did not sleep. This is honestly the worst stay I have ever experienced in a hotel and I don't ask for much-just a safe, clean, quiet, cool place to sleep. This hotel was none of those things. Our room had a sliding door that leads directly to the parking lot-the only thing that keeps you separate is a flimsy bar-not very reassuring. There was a large group outside of our door arguing for a long time early in the evening. Then, my husband and I noticed the room wasn't cooling even after about 2 hours. We called the front desk and they sent a maintenance man (who arrived very quickly by the way-only positive thing I can say about the stay) who overrode the system so that you could set the temperature all the way down to 48 degrees. Guess what, still didn't work! He said if it didn't work after 15 minutes, tell them the following day to switch rooms for the remainder of the stay, though he did warn us that the 3rd floor is very noisy because that's where the air-conditioning generators are located. As if the heat wasn't enough, the noise from above was AWFUL!!! It sounded like the ceiling was going to cave in. Called the front desk and they said they would send someone to check it out. Didn't stop until about 4 am. At that point I went into the front area and killed 2 ROACHES on the cabinets!!! Called front desk and they blamed it on the greenery. Oh, I'm sure it has nothing to do with the huge gap between the door and the floor. Disgusting! Also, while it is close to Seaworld, the other hotel that we ended up switching to in the hotel circle was just as close, and didn't have adult shops, strip clubs, and women of the night everywhere-and it was cheaper before the satisfaction discount was applied! Bottom line-don't do this to yourself. Because of the horrific experience they discounted my stay 50%, leaving me at $65 for a sleepless night, but because I was so exhausted, I was in no mood to argue. I paid $80/night at a wonderful hotel in the hotel circle and could not have been happier to get away from this seedy motel-and I stayed in one of the Suites!!!

At the front desk I was greeted by Yessica who could brighten your day with just her smile. She was also very knowledgeable of the areas sights, places to dine, and attractions. Chris (who drove the Shuttle bus to the MCRD and back among other places) was most professional, went out of his way to accomodate, let everyone know that he appreciated our graduating Marine's service to our country, and of course was very knowledgeable of the areas sights, attractions, and places to dine. I was treated by every staff member that I encountered as if they were pleased to see me, glad that I was there, and that if there WAS a problem that it would be taken care of promptly.

It's not new, but was not dirty and as gross as I've read in other reviews. An effort was made to provide some decor and make the best use of the space to the comfort of it's guests. I did not do my research BEFORE booking (I ended up doing it while we were there during \"#ell-night\")--this was a spur of the moment trip to SeaWorld and since we live in LA, I just needed something close to the park for the night. This wasn't even the cheapest hotel available. I paid twice the lowest local rate and expected that there was some ascending quality built into that especially since I booked into the suites side of the hotel-assuming that this would be a even more of an upgrade in quality and privacy which turned out to be a wrong assumption. We arrived in the daytime, and I knew there was something off when we had to cross a back street to an unsecured lot, with unsecured stair access to our room where there were some people laying around in the lot and alley. We returned from the park after dark and on the way from the freeway noticed the GIANT strip club not too far from the hotel. And then the OTHER giant strip club. And the adult shops. We live in LA. We're not prudes. But when a hotel has a family-friendly themepark as part of its name, it better not be across from a t!tty-bar. Or a regular bar that plays live, loud music until 2 am that echos into your balcony area. When that shuts down you can finally have a moment's silence to enjoy the sound of your neighbors doing stuff with the call girls they've invited back to the room through the paper-thing walls. How do you know it's a call girl? It's when the hotel door shuts and a single, clacking pair of heels heads back down to the parking lot. Over and over again. All night long. Toss in a bunch of shady characters milling about in the open hallways earlier in the evening and I would describe our evening in this hotel as waiting out a Zombie-apocolypse.

It had to be the WORST hotel we have EVER, and may I emphasis EVER, stayed at! After we had checked in and got our room key we went to our room, arms loaded with our luggage, and found that the clerk had given us the wrong room. She was friendly though and gave us the right room. As we walked into the room there was a terrible odor. It seemed as though the room had never been cleaned. But it looked ok and so we stayed. Later that evening as we were preparing for bed I took my socks off and of course they were black, which was grose but have had that problem before in a hotel. As I went to turn on the light near the bed a horrible odor came from the carpet near the bed. Everytime I turned over in the night I'd smell that horrible smell. I have no ideas what it was. 2 days after we checked in the toilet broke and we had to Manuel flush the toilet until they came to fix it, which was later that day. The very next morning the light over the sink, which is where you have to do your hair, burnt out. So we called the front office and they sent a repair man to replace it a half hour later. Which irritated me because we were trying to get out of the hotel to go to Sea World. But that wasn't even the worst thing. The very next morning, 3 days after we checked in we went to get in the shower to get ready for the day and there was NO HOT WATER!! We contacted the front desk and they informed us that the boiler had gone out and there was no hot water. They told us that they had some rooms available across the street that we could go shower in. So we had to load up all our personal products and trapes across the street to shower. Let me tell you it was a big hassle. When we returned that evening from our daily activities there still was no hot water. The front desk told us it wasn't fixed yet but should be in the morning. Which of course it wasn't so once again we had to load all our personal stuff up and trapes across the street to shower but this day it was raining so that made it ever worse. By this time I had had it with this dump and began to look around the area for another hotel. There was hardly any rooms available and the ones that were available were very expensive. So I couldn't afford to change hotels. Which really made me livid. We asked them if they would move us into two rooms across the street, with hot water, that had adjoining doors but they said they couldn't do that. Much later that evening the water was finally fixed and we were able to have a warm shower that next day. But when I showered the following day there STILL was no hot water. I refused to pay full price for that hotel and told the front desk that I wanted a discount for the inconvience their hotel caused me. They told me that they could give me a 25% discount off two of the days. Which was only a measly $30. I refused that offer and told them I wanted the suite room for the cost of a regular room. The clerk said she'd have to talk to the manager. After some wheeling and dealing they finally agreed to my offer. Which saved me much more than their first offer but even that wasn't worth the problems we endured at this HORRIBLE hotel. I would NEVER, EVER, EVER stay at the Days inn near Sea World again. Not only was our room terrible but the breakfast was horrible too. There was usually only one lady who cooked and served the breakfast. So we usually had to wait for 10 or 15 minutes to get our food. Even then it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that great tasting The breakfast room also had a absolutely terrible smell. Many mornings I felt like throwing up because it stunk so bad. Even the terrible area it is located in doesn't compare to how rotten that dive of a hotel is. Bums everywhere, nude bars on every corner, and panhandlers on every street don't even come close to explaining what a scummy place this hotel is. Day's Inn should not even want their name associated with this hotel. I would be embarrased to say this hotel was in my chain of hotels.

I say this because I feel I have a way higher \"tolerance\" than most people for sub-standard hotel rooms, and I have travelled ALL over and stayed in lots of questionable hotels. This hotel was BY FAR the worst one I have ever stayed in in my life. I was completely mortified when we walked in to the room. The pix online of this hotel made it look really nice, website boasted of a \"full\" free breakfast, suites, etc. The room was horrendous. We had to walk about a half a block behind the hotel and cross a street (w homeless people everywhere) to get to our room. Our room was very dirty, carpet was dirty, very bare bones furniture. The sink was literally RIGHT in the room with the bed. I was extrememly nervous that there wa bugs/cockroaches in room. I have never ever left a hotel and switched because I have been disappointed and let me tell you I was very close to leaving this hotel. The \"free\" breakfast was a complete JOKE: 1 type of cereal every day (corn flakes) No pastries or donuts, 1 type of eggs every day (scrambled) and pancakes only (I was told they had waffles when I called hotel when I was booking trip), 1 fruit every day only (very small oranges in a bowl), and only 1 type of instant oatmeal (plain), 1 type of juice every day (OJ), No toppings for oatmeal, no fresh fruit cut up, no variety in cereal, no bacon or sausage, no yogurt, etc. Everything was served on styrfoam plates w/ plastic utensils. I know I am coming off as sounding like a Prima Donna which I am not. But I have stayed at plenty of hotels that have had FREE continental breakfasts and they had so much more variety than this hotel.

When asked about the spare key for laundry room, Frontdesk claimed there is only one laundry key and janitor had it at that time so there was no way she could be of any help. If that were of truth, then this property would have broken the fire code thousands of time. Also she kept saying there were other guest calls for service and the janitor was dealing with them. I happen to find out the janitor was not servicing anyone but doing some normal maintenance the whole time. The frontdesk also denied any accountabilities for the water shutdown saying it was not foreseeable. But the truth is that when we arrived two days before which was a Saturday we already noticed there was water leaking at the building basefloor and cones placed around the leakage. My guess is that they didn't shutoff the water to repair because the high occupancy during weekend. They picked the following Monday. So they knew it ahead but because of the bad management they failed to notice guests. When people complained they just denied. b. Janitors incredibly ... how to I put it? crazy?

In reception Christina and Tasha also were very helpful. After reading a number of bad reviews, most of which were in our opinion unjustified, we were slightly on edge about staying at the accommodation. This was further compounded when a mix up saw our accommodation unavailable for the first night of our booking. The staff quickly found us accommodation nearby at the Days Inn expense and refunded a nights accommodation, dropped us off and picked us up next day from the alternative accomodation. From there on in nothing was a problem for the reception and shuttle staff who ensured our stay was enjoyable. The suite itself was nothing special, being somewhat dated in appearance. However, it was clean and the staff ensured that it was kept clean and well serviced. One problem that was experienced was the hot water shower needed to be set in a different position it seemed each day, but once you figured this out there always was adeqaute hot water. At the recommendation of the reception staff they located us on the top floor to provide for minimum noise. The beds were comfortable and the lounge area was a reasonable size and enabled us to put our daughter to bed and stay up a little later. The air conditioning was effective but a little noisy and we were glad we did not have it on all night. On the ground floor was the swimming pool, of reasonable proportions and adequatley heated and a spa pool. Some evenings it was a little noisy but if you went to bed the fact of having the lounge between you and the pool made it quiet enough. The breakfast was okay considering they were cooking for more than 400 people each day. It depended upon who was cooking what the serivce was like. The male cook always had a full tip jar and this was because he provided the best service. The women cooks were never tipped as much. As stated earlier, not having a car meant that we were reliant upon a shuttle. Tim, Gretchen and Chris were excellent in providing information about San Diego and were only to willing to get you to where you wanted to go and pick you up. There were some who complained that they got left behind because they turned up 10 minutes late to be picked up, but when you consider that the drivers needed to go on and get guests from other locations such criticism of the drivers was completely unjustified. If you were there on time you could guarantee they would be there also. One night we wanted to go to church and they dropped us off there on the way back to the accommodation from the zoo. Nothing was a problem for them and they became good friends, making our stay very enjoyable. One excellent aspect about the location was the proximity to HenrysMarket across the road. This was an excellent location to buy friut and bakery products at a great price. If you needed food then this was definitely the place to head for quality and service that surpassed the other supermarkets in the area. Also across the way were several reasonably priced restaurant/take out eateries and a bank that had helpful staff. Previous comments about the homeless being in the area were correct, but our experience was that with only one exception they were friendly and in the main ignored the residents of the hotel. We did not experience any problems with the homeless and the police came by every so often and chatted to them. We did not feel unsafe at all. As for the woman who said the rooms were filthy and their child got black feet off the carpet, she needs to realise that if you let your child run around on the seal outside that this is where you get black feet from, not the carpets in the suites. The worst thing about the place were some of the difficult and demanding clients who probably read the negative reviews and decided to be just as difficult.

We found the room to be very basic, but very suitable for our needs, and quite clean. The room had a separate bedroom area which worked really well for our family. Also there was plenty of room for luggage. The shower was ok and in line with what we found throughout our US trip (a bit different from australian showers!)

We had been placed in the back building over the road from the main reception area, so we had a long way to run in the pouring rain. We asked if the bus could come and collect us in the back street but were told that was not possible. We were all drenched by the time we got to reception!! Our departure was very bland - not one member of staff enquired about whether we had enjoyed our stay, or if there had been any problems. We also had a problem with the laundry. We wanted to do some washing but the laundry on our floor had closed even though the sign said it was open for several more hours. We rang the reception and eventually someone agreed to come and unlock the door, after questioning me for some minutes about me being mistaken!! I didn't start out to write this as a scathing report, because we actually didn't mind most things about this motel, especially given the reasonable price.

It was late and the hotel was lit poorly with greenish colored bulbs making it appear very unsafe and dirty. Once in our room which was a two room suite, we found the set up very poor. The double beds in the back room barely fit and the door to the front room caught on the corner of the bed making it difficult to open and close the door. The TV's in the rooms were super small and the furniture was very dated. We had a total of 10 in our group so we had two rooms. The other room was two double beds which was too small for my sister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family and she had to move to a suite since there are no queen beds. When we attempted to shower we all found the water would vary from absolute cold to scalding hot. We did complain about this and were told the boilers were not functioning properly, but because we needed suites, we could not move to the other building where the water was working. Also, the sink water never got cold only lukewarm. We found the night stand lamp didn't work, the microwave was missing one of the feet and wouldn't stay level because of it. The coffee pot in the room was a single cup maker and they would constantly leave only one packet of coffee; it was a suite that holds 4-6 people! We were on the second floor, and when we would step out onto the walkway, the ground literally would give under our feet. The laundry facility was dirty and we were not able to go into the hot tub because the water was so dirty. The elevator appeared that it would fail at any minute. The place is in serious disrepair and it is in need of a major overhaul. The lobby must have been photo'd with rented furniture or something because the lobby furniture is completely different than the picture. The website pictures show much larger TV's in the rooms and updated carpet and bedding that we did not have.

I believe rooms near the pool (no matter which floor) are quite loud (long pool hours). -> so if you like it quiet, request a room at the far end of the corridor facing Cauley Street. - The pool area is small and not very inviting with old chairs and tables and sometimes even the trash from last days.

One of our friends was charged $125 for the same room. They seem to up the rates near graduation time. The shuttle's are old and run down and only seat 9.

The hotel isn't in the best area but it is centrally located and easy to get to anywhere you need to go. The staff isn't overly friendly but when there was a problem with the TV cable, they were quick to get notes out to all guests letting them know that the matter was being attended to. Next door is the Tio Carlos Mexican Restaurant. It is nothing much to look at from the outside but inside is lovely and the food is brilliant. Remember to bring your appetite.

The biggest drawback to the arrangement was the breakfast provided. You were allowed two items from the hot breakfast selection ie: two pancakes or two muffins or one pancake and one muffin. There was cold cereal and some apples/oranges but, definitely no other healthy choices. No Yogurt, or other fruits available.

They had a continental breakfast spread that could of had a little more of a variety, but it was included in the price, so heck it was good. The pool & hot tub were ok, however we did not use it, due to the overcast and breezy weather. We paid $60 per night for a room which we thought excellent value.

The hotel staff is wonderful and very caring. The grounds are clean and well-maintained, and the amenities are very good. There is a nice heated indoor pool with access to the outside patio, and a small cafe that serves breakfast and lunch until 2 pm. The outside patio and pool has pavers and a glass fence so as not to block the ocean views. Ocean access is down about ten concrete steps to the beach, and there is a shower head at the bottom by your feet to wash off the sand. There's another outside shower just inside the gate on the pool deck. On the way to the outside pool, there are newer vending machines for soda, snacks, and ice cream; as well as an ice machine. There is a rack with clean pool towels, and a hamper for your used towels. Our room was oceanfront with a good-sized balcony. The only bad thing I can say is that the room air conditioner drains onto the balcony, so there is always a little water trail. Not their fault- it's no big deal. The room was nicely updated and very clean. There was a fully stocked kitchenette with a large refrigerator. The bathroom was also updated and well-lit. We had two double beds, while we only slept on one, it was very comfortable. We had already booked our stay for next month's Biketoberfest prior to this unexpected stay based on the reviews, and are very happy that we did. This will be the place we stay in Daytona from now on.

I've stayed at several of the hotels along the shoreline, and the Tropical Winds is, by far, my favorite. Firstly, we arrived at the hotel late in the evening, after a long day of travel, and the man at the front desk, Bob, was an absolute pleasure to deal with. He was fun and funny, and checked us into our room in less than 3 minutes (not an exaggeration) because he already had our keys set aside for us prior to our arrival. When we got to the room, we were more than pleased with its condition. It was clean and well-kept, with a kitchenette and a lovely view of the ocean. In the morning, we headed down to the on-site cafe for breakfast, which was delicious, filling, and inexpensive. I should mention that it is also adjacent to the pool deck, so access to the pool and beach are tremendously convenient. The folks in the cafe (Frank, Cam, Lily, and the cook - I apologize, I forget his name) really make you feel at home, like family. They are attentive, friendly, and efficient, and they are happy to serve you an amazing breakfast to start your day. The beach at the Tropical Winds is clean, quieter than near the boardwalk, and beautiful for swimming, laying out, or just going for a stroll. If you're looking for a bit of peace and quiet, this is the place to go. It's not a 5-star resort, so if that's what you're looking for, this is not the place for you, but the Tropical Winds is clean, comfortable, and on a less congested stretch of beach, with everything you could want (food, drinks, groceries, etc.) within a mile or so, all for a reasonable price.

The hotel is beach a front property. Cons : Staff needs further training on customer service and professionalism. Best if they get new employees who appreciate the opportunity of having a job . - The front desk attendant was extremely rude , I asked her a question and instead of answering the question she started arguing with me and my mother giving us attitude. Strangely enough the back door was open and what it seemed to be a manager was watching the whole thing. - Later on even though the room was ready she made us wait until 2:05 in order to check in. So she just stared at us for 15 minutes . No explanation or friendly conversation . We just stood there until 2:05 hit watching her do absolutely nothing else. -Same day we asked for towels from the front desk (same female)her respond was to search for the housekeeper working to get towels. The housekeeper only cleaned the room once out of four days , when we called the front desk to informed them ,the answer was \"ok \"... again we had to find the housekeeper cart in order to get clean towels and other supplies. At check out the front desk attendant was nice unprofessional , but nice .I called \"boo\" several times . Thankfully it was just my family and not one of my clients. I would never recommend a person to stay there and be treated this way is just not what a guest deserves and there is no traits of hospitality.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cClean and Nice...:)\u201d", "Author": "Lyk2travel", "ReviewID": "UR125841174", "Content": "We just got back from Daytona Beach, We were there for a baseball tournament...

Myself and three family members ended up booking a room here first through Special T travel and then through Holiday host after a three day stay in disney world. Upon arriving at this hotel myself and my family were all very tired from a long day at Disney world and then the drive up to Daytona Beach. I belive the pictures on the hotels website is very misleading. As we walked into the hotel, the lobby was very small, poorly lit, and just plain dirty. After checking in, we proceeded to our room, but upon opening the door we were taken aback by the TERRIBLE smell coming from the room. It smelled like something had died in it orw as rotten, either way it was UNBERABLE. Our room had two \" Queen size beds\" but were actually big enough to sleep one person. The sheets on the bed were once white, i suppose but were an ugly yellow color with dark and light spots on it, suggesting stains. Upon myself sitting on the bed, there was a huge stack of keys. This leads me to believe tht there was no maid service at all, and that maybe this hotel has \"Hourly rates\". The Carpet in the room was green and there were plenty of unidentified stains all over it, vairey in color. Everything in the room was greasy and dirty and disqusting. The envelope that was given to us with our roomkeys in it had hand written \"Security Tips\" on them written in magic marker. It said things like \"Use deadbolt at all times, Dont open the door to any 'worker' with out them presenting an employe Id, Lock up all valueable items before leaving the room\". This lead us to believe that they have had all these security problems before. Another issue was that we were promised an \"Ocean front view\" when actually the view we were given was a view of a parking lot. And then the bathroom was a completly other issue. The bathroom toliet was brownish looking and stopped up when we entered the room, and the bathtub itself was diseveled and DIRTY, there were bugs everywhere, and it smelled worse than anything you could imagine. This motel was SO BAD that my family and I came up with a rap \" Im a Ganster, Im a straight up G, this ganster hotel aint the one for me\". Its safe to say that we will never return to this hotel for the rest of our lives. It should be dimolished. After about half an hour in the room, we prompty left and rented a room elsewhere. P.S.

This hotel is a 5 star. I stayed here from April 17th through April 22nd,2011. I was on the 6th floor with a die hard view. Wow it was breathtaking. The 1st shift receptionist named Gwenn is fabulous. She is patient and very attentive to your needs and very friendly. Every time we passed by her she would make sure she said good morning or good afternoon. She's great!!! The hotel smelled clean and fresh at all times from your room till you reach the lobby. The cafeteria was awesome with decent prices for a full breakfast $5.75. The cafe workers exceptionally friendly treated you like you belong. Both pools were very clean and fun. The beach breathtaking and so clean. A place for anyone to go too and have homemade ice cream is Cow Licks wow so good and easy to get too. You start going south and will run right into it on your right side. All restaurants were right there and you could choose from so many. We have never gone there before but if I return I will stay right in this hotel. It is kept up from the outside to the inside. The rooms are so clean and a bed that swallows you that's how comfortable it is with extra pillows (relaxing). Everytime I was going to the beach or outside there was always cleaning going on. It was so refreshing to go to a hotel where you felt comfortable and got treated so well. The only problem I had was when I checked out Gwenn was not there yet and the red hair receptionist was there and she didn't even smile looked at me like I owed her something, I asked her a question and when she answered I said thank you and no response.

I looked at Roomsaver.com for who had coupon rates for the Daytona area then I compared that to people's reviews on trip advisor. I appreciated the latest comments in regards to their stay. Hopefully my review will help you with your decision as well. We booked our reservation and began our stay in the oceanfront efficiency (2 double beds). We arrived on March 27th. We were greeted by Bryan at the front desk. He was very friendly. He got us checked in and even recommended the best pizza place I have ever had! (Giovanni's - New York Style Pizza at its best) Some of the previous reviews stated that the hotel smelled. We never had a problem with a foul odor in the hotel. It always smelled fresh. Our room (207) had two double beds, tv, apartment style refrigerator, microwave, sink, 4 burner stove, with oven. There were basic dishes and cooking pan. They provided dish washing soap, dish towel and dish cloth. There was an electric can opener and a toaster as well. The room was clean and nicely decorated. There were NO bed bugs or any type of bugs in the room as a matter of fact. I did see the Orkin man during our stay but if anyone knows Florida it is the place that doesn't have the bugman coming that are the ones that have the problems. There were extra pillows on each bed which was nice. I would refer to the mattresses as being like the ones at an economical hotel (days inn, red roof inn, etc) Standard bed coverings. The room had two chairs and a table. The balcony had two patio chairs and two patio end tables. We were able to use the patio chairs to sit around the table inside. Though my daughters liked the idea of eating in bed the best. There was internet access available though for some reason I could get it to work on my laptop and not on my phone. (wouldn't be surprised if that was operator error). I wouldn't call it high speed internet but it was functional for our needs. The girls used both the indoor and outdoor pools. They were both very clean. The indoor pool was much warmer than the outdoor pool. We did not use the restaurant because we had everything that we needed. It did seem popular and had decent prices for breakfast and lunch. Ham and Cheese omlet with potatoes, toast for $5.75. Hamburger and french fries at $4.00. The down side to this room was the bathroom. It was very small. The door to the bathroom would open into the bathroom so if you opened the door it would just about hit the toilet seat. Hard to have more than one person in the bathroom at one time. When you travel with 3 teenage girls (a total of 4 women) the bathroom is an important part of the room. Even though the bathroom was a negative. The view from the balcony was a positive. Breath taking!!! We kept the door to the balcony open as much as possible to be able to hear the ocean. I was able to sit out on the balcony in the morning while the girls were sleeping and watch the sunrise and listen to the sounds of the ocean. It was also nice to be able to keep an eye on them at the pool and/or on the beach while sitting on the balcony. Tropical Winds was approximately 1.5 miles (per my cardiotrainer) from the boardwalk. This was a nice distance to keep us out the crowds but close enough to the attractions. Definately a good walk up and back (less guilt when eating the homemade ice cream from boardwalk area). Two nights into our stay I asked to see the different types of rooms that were available in the hotel. I was given two keys, one to the city apartment and the other to the penthouse. Christine, the general manager, was very accommodating and very pleasant. CITY APARTMENT Though we didn't stay in this apartment I thought I would share information about it. It is a two room suite. One room has a queen size bed, dresser and tv. The other room is a general room with a king size bed, sleeper sofa, four person table, tv, and efficiency kitchen simiar to the one in the oceanfront efficiency. Same size bathroom as the oceanfront efficiency. The city apartment gives a view of the city and not the ocean, thus called the city apartment. THE PENTHOUSE After staying two nights in the oceanfront efficiency and looking at the penthouse we opted to upgrade (about $40/night more than what we were paying for the oceanfront efficiency). The penthouse was perfect for us. The penthouse included a bedroom with a kingsize bed (economical pillowtop but very comfortable), dresser, tv, closet, and window view of the ocean. It had an L shaped living and dining area with a queen size sleeper sofa, coffee table, two sofa chairs, 6 person glass dining table, and plazma screen television. The kitchen was a full size kitchen with a full size refrigerator, full size flat top stove and oven, above the range microwave. This unit had extensive cabinet space as well as more dishes and pots and pans than the efficiency. The balcony was twice the size of the efficiency balcony and had a double sliding glass door to the balcony. The penthouse by itself may be small for some families but with 4 girls it was perfect. The penthouse also has an adjoining door to an oceanfront 2 double bed efficiency that could be added for a larger family. We were in room 801 which was considered part of the coral suite. Room 801 had a standard key lock on it. The door to the coral suite had a key card access that allowed access to the hallway for rooms 801 and 811. 811 could be also added to the penthouse if you have a larger group or family. 811 had a kingsize bed and a sleeper sofa and was a city view room. Several recommendations that I would make in regards to staying here: If you opt to use your kitchen to cook in, I would recommend bringing your favorite non stick frying pan. The pans are ok but weren't nonstick surface. When you go to the grocery store, make sure to get papertowels and napkins., They don't have any in the hotel and you will want to have them. I was glad I took an extra blanket. I know they would have gotten one for me if I wanted it; it was just nice to have one from home. Bring laundry detergent and quarters. There are two washers and two dryers on the second level. Only $1.00 to wash and $1.00 to dry which I thought was a great deal because I didn't have to go very far, If you want suggestions for places to eat, visit, see.. ASK The staff here was wonderful. Every suggestion I got from them was perfect.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Villa Park, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cLooking for a GREAT hotel?

We have yet to stay at the same place twice but Tropical Winds has since changed our minds about that. We don\u2019t like to stay too close to Main Street due to all the noise and traffic so the location was perfect. We were still close enough to all of the action so we didn\u2019t have to ride too far after a long day. Check in was a breeze and during bike week that can be a timely process. They didn\u2019t have enough parking for all of the bikes and cars but that is a problem at most hotels on the strip. At least this one doesn\u2019t charge per day for a parking fee, as many of them do. Our room was on the 8th floor and the view was spectacular. There is nothing like listening to the ocean while relaxing in your room. The room itself was clean and the decor was recently updated. The size was more than adequate for two adults and the beds were super comfortable. The mini kitchen worked out great for us. No more wasted leftovers. The housekeepers we\u2019re all friendly and each was very accommodating. Thankfully they have laundry room as this is essential when you\u2019re traveling on a motorcycle and have limited space for excess clothing. The poolside caf\u00e9 had great food and the staff treated us like we were long lost friends. A couple of them were from Chicago, as we are but I suspect they are just as friendly to everyone they meet regardless of where they\u2019re from. For being an older hotel, overall they do their best to maintain the property and the atmosphere is a very pleasant one. If you\u2019re looking for a great deal this is it. I did a lot of research this time due to my own paranoia regarding bed bugs and I\u2019m happy to report this was NOT an issue at this hotel. In fact I didn\u2019t see one single bug. Fortunately I did all of that research because a few of our other hotel choices were suspected of having these nasty little creatures. That is what led us to Tropical Winds and we could not have been happier with our choice. My hubby does freelance writing for motorcycle magazines and he\u2019ll be sure to let his readers know how accommodating and motorcycle-friendly your hotel - and staff are.

The indoor pool was a very small area with alot of condensation from the pipes above. To sit by the side of the pool, water was dripping down constantly. The outdoor pool area was fine (would probably be very crowded in the summer months), but unfortunately, the pool was not heated so the water was even too cold for the kids (15 and 9) to go in. The view of the ocean and the beach area are beautiful, cars are allowed to drive on the beach directly in front of the hotel, not much traffic this time of year, but may be a deterrent in the summer months. The staff was phenomenol! By the second morning, the staff in the cafe already knew how I liked my coffee! They chatted and were all very helpful and friendly. Check in was very easy, and even arriving hours early, they were able to give us a room. Because this was a short trip, our stay was fine.

From the moment you walk in the door you feel like you are among family - everything is spotless - our room was an oceanfront with full kitchen oceanfront on the top floor and was just perfect for us with everything we could possibly need including free coffee. Our housekeeper did an excellent job cleaning and the room was beautifully decorated and so comfortable - everything was shiny and smelled so fresh. Saturday and Sunday on the pool deck at lunchtime we were able to get $1.00 hot dogs and $2.00 Barbeque sandwiches - what a deal - they were served by the older gentleman who runs the caf\u00e9 - what a blast he is - he had adults and children in stitches. Since we had a bit of rain the indoor pool came in very handy and both pools were sparkling clean even with the large crowds on the weekend. Everything was in excellent working order from the elevators to the free wireless internet, the air conditioning, television . This is the only place I will ever stay at in Daytona Beach and I overheard a lot of other guests saying the same thing. In summary - the manager and staff of this hotel take pride in their workplace and go out of their way to make you feel at home!!

However, nobody wrote about the special odor it smells in this hotel. Maybe this is due to the food poeple are cooking, but personaly it was very unpleasant. I would say the same thing about the carpet in the room: maybe it's clean, but when you feel the humidity under the feet, you do not want to know what is hidden there... Location: 1-2 miles north of boardwalk. Quiet area. Perfect for the beach. We walk on the street in the evening. The street was dark. I cannot say I was feeling very safe with my family... Rooms: oceanfront with Kitchenette with balcony. GREAT VIEW!!! Great Tv channel choice (and the remote was very well working!!!) even if the TV plastic casing was broken... Fridge was perfect. Oven perfect too. Bathroom was a bit small for 4 persons. Excellent and Free WI-FI service. Matress was not very comfortable. Service: didn't have to ask special request, but one of the person at the desk was not very smiling, especially at check-out. She didn't ask any feedback about the stay... Value: Old building well kept. The owners fairly do their best to keep this hotel top notch but people \"living\" there are not necessarily helping. Two examples of the most disgusting thing I've seen in my 2-days stay: 1) Woman spiting from the 7th floor just over the pool area 2) Smokers on lounge chair around the pool taking the ground for an ashtray A little 101 course for those who are not used to live in society: a pool patio in not an ashtray: an ashtray is an ashtray. USE IT! It was very disgusting to see those cigarettes on the floor around the pool. Do those persons are doing that at home??? For those spiting from upper flor, I don't think I need to say something... Overall: very good price. With the quality you have when you pay less. However, when it's cheap, there is more chance to attract people like I described above... So, for those who have never been in a real 5-stars, please note that this hotel is far from a 5-stars.

The room was a little smaller than I expected from the photos, but the great location, view, and super-friendly staff more than made up for it! The hotel boasts 2 pools - one indoor and one outdoor. I was initially surprised that the indoor pool was not heated, but the hot temperatures in Daytona really made it unnecessary. The hotel provides towels for guests at the pool, and has plenty of nice seating surrounding the outdoor one. I never felt that it was too crowded to go to the pool deck. The poolside cafe is great. My family waited until the last morning of our vacation to try the cafe, and I wish we wouldn't have waited! It was by far the least expensive meal we ate at Daytona, and the quality was right on par with the more expensive breakfast restaurants near the hotel. Last, but not least, the best thing about the Tropical Winds Hotel is the staff. They were EXTREMELY friendly and really went out of their way to make sure my family had a great vacation.

We did use the outdoor pool and it was a green color. I asked and was told it was a fresh water pool, but it was ok. We swam in it and had a great time. The restaurant is little, but the food was good and we enjoyed it. We will stay again! Places to eat: Bertie's Luncheonette is located where the Publix store is It is in the corner. EXCELLENT pancakes. THEY ARE HUGE. Alfie's Restaurant in Ormand By the Sea just a few miles on A1A My husband got a HUGE seafood platter for 16.95 We both took our food back to the hotel.

To echo the thoughts of someone else.......don't judge a book by its cover until you had the chance to view it. Granted the lobby area is small........but who books a hotel room to spend it in the lobby? Not me. The balcony is a little small but plenty big for two adults to sit out and enjoy the warm weather and watch the sights (beautiful sunrise). The restaurant staff and food was top notch. if you are on a tight budget and enjoy eating out from time to time you will be pleased to know that the food is very cheaply priced but yet, quite good, especially the breakfast sandwich. Two can dine for under $10 for breakfast or lunch. The pool is a great lounging area in the morning and early afternoon.............this time of year because the days are shorter and in the late afternoon the hotel blocks the sun from the pool area. This is not a huge problem becuase by this point in the day you have had enough sun and are ready for a stroll down the beach. If you still desire to swim in a pool there is a small indoor pool that can be used. As for our room (411), it was a nice room with an Oceanview and it was quite large. Much to our surprise the carpet was in pretty good shape, next to new I would say. There was a king sized bed with a day bed if you had a guest or child with you. The bathroom was a little old but the floor tile was in new condition. The shower didn't have the pressure that one would like but again it was adequate to get the job done. The bar fridge was handy for keeping our water, beer and diet pepsi cold. Parking was not an issue. The staff that we encountered were all very friendly and helpful from the moment we checked in. The lady who checked us in and the gentleman who was there in the evening were all willing to chat and provide advice. The restaurant staff can not do enough to help out, they even provide some humour at no additional charge. The lady working maintenance was the most cheerful person working there.

One of the rooms had a whole in the wall, that we were charged for and torn sheets that no one could tell us which room it was in. We were charged after we left for taxes and for the whole in the wall that was already there. The manager would not contact the IRS about the form being legit. The hotel itself was clean, the pools were clean and the beach was nice. No crowds at all. But I would not recommend this hotel to churches if you are planning on using your tax exempt forms. Anyone else who stay in room 506 the whole was already in the wall by the air conditioner, so if they try and charge your for it, you seen it first on this review. They had it covered by plaster, NO drywall and if you lean up agaist it , which is what happened, it will reopen the whole. Watch your account. This is how we knew they charged us for all of this.

(Thank heavens for TA!!) Thank you to all the people who have stayed here and shared their views. But we didn\u2019t book it, we decided to take a chance when we arrived. There are so many choices of where to stay we could so easily have got it wrong. So we wanted to \u2018vet\u2019 the room first. Gwen was the first person we came into contact with in reception, we asked if we could see an oceanfront room - she didn\u2019t hesitate in giving us the key to 310. It was an efficiency, lovely clean, fresh oceanfront view on the 3rd floor, with the sound of the ocean in your room. We only checked in for 2 nights initially, but afteit\u2019s right on the beach, so we decided to stay here for the duration. We asked Gwen if the room was available for the time we wanted, it was, and the rates she quoted became cheaper per night the longer we stayed. Very happy with our choice, it really made our time in Daytona very pleasant. Also the sunrise is amazing, what a lovely way to start the day. Aircon/heating works a treat. It was a little cold during our stay, so the heating was a bonus for one day. The Coffee bar/caf\u00e9 on the ground floor is a lovely place for breakfast and lunch, either eat in there or \u2018to go\u2019 if you are round the pool. We had breakfast here on our first morning, it was delicious with lots of choices, and the wonderful man who served us is a real charmer, very friendly and a great host. Our room was serviced daily and very early too, we went out for breakfast about 7:30 every day, and didn\u2019t get back till late afternoon, so much to see and do in Daytona. But on one occasion we came back around 9:30 - 10:00am and couldn\u2019t believe our room had been done already!! Wonderful. We had clean towels every day, 2 queen sized beds which we found to be extremely comfortable - even the pillows were perfect. There are beach towels available as you go thru to the pool area, plenty of sun loungers available and access to the incredible Daytona Beach. This is the only place I would stay when I return, and next time I would book it, as Gwen told us we would get even better rates as we are repeaters. We chatted to nearly all the staff here , we found them to be very friendly people, always willing to pass the time with you. We rented a car from Alamo in Orlando, it was a Chevy trailblazer SUV, managed to do a lot of what we wanted to do, and as we had to drive from here to Atlanta airport on our last day, the 6 hour journey was a definite breeze, easy driving for my husband\u2026 but I think it was more down to my fantastic navigating!! We were given brilliant maps at the Atlanta Welcome Centre too which took us into \u2018car rental row\u2019 at Atlanta Airport to return our car to Alamo. We stopped for lunch and didn\u2019t make one mistake. Driving on Daytona Beach:- We did this with everyone else, but we drove ALL the way along, what a laugh, an RV had churned up the sand at the quieter end of the beach, guess what, we got stuck in that soft sand - right in the middle of a family beach party. While we were debating exactly how to get out of this. 2 American guys sitting with their family on the beach and 2 local boys in a pick-up came along, and before we knew it, they all pushed us out!! Thank you very much, if any of you read this for getting us out, but the guys all said this wasn\u2019t the first time and it won\u2019t be the last. Needless to say we didn\u2019t drive along the beach again. Next time we will get a proper 4 x 4 and try again. We love this place and the people - it is such a fun place, and the food! But I will be writing about food in the forum. We found a Chevy dealer selling tons of corvettes, We own/drive one in the UK, so that was great to see them all. Places we went to:- Inlet Harbour, Ocean Walk, , Flagler Beach, St Augustine for a nice drive out, So many eateries (as you do in America) So much still left for another time soon!", "Date": "April 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "montreal", "Title": "\u201cThis was a great surprise!!!\u201d", "Author": "mother70", "ReviewID": "UR15270675", "Content": "My family and I stayed here for a week.

He called last night to get a rate of 84 dollars that was listed online. Phillip the GSR on duty who answered said the rate for Sunday night was $99 and there was nothing he could do about it. My husband has worked for Marriott before and he was able to do that as a GSR, why couldn't he? I spoke with Reanna this morning the General Manager of the Fairfield Inn and Suites South in Indianapolis where we called last night and she said she stood behind Phillip and that he didn't have to us a lower rate and that their system wasn't updated yet to give that rate even if it said so online last night. She was absolutely rude, interrupted me several times and hung up on me. I spoke with the Jameson Inn and they were willing to give a good rate for Sunday night. I hope it was worth Marriott losing a customer.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wayland, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place and very clean\u201d", "Author": "mo4049", "ReviewID": "UR118980074", "Content": "Very Happy with service and clean.

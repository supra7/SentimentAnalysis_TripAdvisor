Because we were in Chicago in late February the rates with AAA were the best but this was offset by the high charge for overnight parking(downtown rates are all high), If you plan to use the public transportation buy a one - three day pass as this will really save you time and money, We traveled to Oak Park in 30 minutes for $2.25 whereas a taxi ride would cost you$25.00.

Great location, friendly and helpful staff, and a terrific value for a downtown Chicago hotel. Room: larger than average size for a downtown hotel. I've stayed in other downtown hotels costing 2-3x more than the Hilton Garden Inn and the rooms were half the size. Everything was well made, arranged, and very clean. I'm a Hilton HHonors Gold member, so I was upgraded to a nice king room on the 23rd (top) floor. No complaints. Check-in/front desk/staff: check-in was fast and easy. Staff was very helpful and friendly, both in person and over the phone. Location: can't beat it. Located on Grand between Wabash and State, just 2 blocks from Michigan Avenue and the Mag Mile. Weber Grill restaurant is in the hotel and serves breakfast. There is a Jewel-Osco grocery store across the street. The CTA Red Line subway station at Grand is just steps away from the main entrance of the hotel, very convenient. Parking: pricy but no different than any other hotel. $49/day for self-parking but if you want a cheaper parking option just use the parking garage across the street at the Grand Plaza ($34). Rate: very reasonable for the location. Hilton offers reasonable AAA and government discounts. Definitely would stay here again.

I was in Chicago for a weekend get away this past weekend and stayed at this property on Saturda night. Very easy to get to on the train. If you are coming from Ohare just transfer from the blue line at Jackson to the red and the hotel is literally right outside the grand street red line. Using Midway I know the hotel recomends trasnferring trains but I find it easier to just get off the orange line at State and Lake and walking a few blocks over than dealing with the tunnel tunnel at Roosevelt. It isn't much further of a walk from Lake than the tunnel is and you don't have to wait on a second train. I think the hottub is nice but the pool is too small. I have never used it since it's always full of kids whenever I use the hottub and would be too hard to swim laps in even if it was empty. Fitness center is small but well mantained. Checkin is always great. Last stay I was recognized as a returning guest to the property and thanked for my loyalty as a Hilton Diamond member. My room was ready even though I arrived around 11:30 a.m. and in the keypack was a letter thanking me for returning to the property. Was also given the two free bottles of water without asking. I was also asked if I wanted the free breakfast of the bonus HH points as my choice selection for that stay. The free breakfast is your typical HGI buffett and it's at the weber grill. Even at 10:30 a.m. on Sunday though there was a wait on a table so I sat at the bar. The weber grill is a great place for lunch or dinner and they have room charging privledges. You can also get a free starbucks drink of your choice and a pasty instead with your breakfast voucher. The guy that works the kiosk is really nice but their hours are awful, they are only open until 11 or 12 even on the weekends and they don't have much of a pastry selection. Business center is really nice for printing boarding passes and accessing the internet. The htels free wifi works great, very fast for a hotel and reliable. You can walk out the hotel and the red line is right there which is great if you need train service.

It's a good 'bedrock' hotel when you're looking for reliable and comfortable stay and when you don't desire all the frills of a four star. The area is great and walking distance to most of the major offices as well as close proximity to many great restaurants. Check in at the hotel is quick and courteous. Make sure you get one of their tasty fresh and warm cookies! The elevators in my humble opinion are too few for the number of rooms and may involve a slightly higher than average wait. Not a big deal - as long as you're not in a rush to get to the office! The room itself is slightly below average in size for Chicago but all the amenities that one requires are there including a nice desk and back supporting chair. It was also very neat and clean. The bathroom was clean and the water pressure was average. The toiletries are as you would expect for a HGI. The beds are comfortable and supportive and they provide 2 queens typically. As a gold member, I was entitled to a free breakfast at the attached Weber Grill restaurant. This was one of my favorite parts. The breakfast, which I asked to be made to order was fantastic. The omelet was exceptional and the pancakes were light and fluffy. The atmosphere here in the breakfast bar is very reminiscent of what you'd expect in an New York type upscale diner. I was impressed every time I was there. The parking here for in and out customers is valet only and they have a great text messaging system where you can request your car conveniently at any time. The valets themselves are also very friendly are are deserving of the tips they get. In conclusion, the Chicago HGI is one of my favorite hotels in the downtown area and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good reliable no frills stay.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toledo, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cIf you have to stay downtown, this is a good choice.\u201d", "Author": "Flyinlow427vette", "ReviewID": "UR117231127", "Content": "I have stayed in this hotel twice, once 5 years ago, and again August 2011.

However, this Hilton property exceeded our expectations and the price was incredibly low- $155/night avg cost for a 4 night stay. First the bad: Towels! Typical large, clean and white Hilton towels but they are as rough as sandpaper...medium course sand paper! Seriously it hurt to wipe your face they were so stiff. Other issue was the elevators on one day only 1 worked or the others were locked out- whatev, but you had to wait in line for one and the line was often 40+ people long and of course for the trip down you had to wait NUMEROUS times for one to have enough room to squeeze in since we were on 15th floor we just took stairs down. Thankfully this only lasted half of the day to my knowledge. Last \"complaint\" isn't really a complaint but you are deep in the heart of toursit mecca and since I use to live in Chi-town this does not appeal to me but if you are a tourist this could be a plus since there are numerous chain restaurants right near you in all directions. Lastly, room service is via the Weber Grill Restaurant- b-fast bar is $15 and not very good and room service ends when Weber Grill closes at 11pm. That is a bummer since when we get in at 1am and want a snack we have to head out. They do have a SMALL food closet next to front desk but not much to choose from your better hiking to 7/11. For the good: Clean modern rooms as you would expect. Check in was a breeze and they were very professional and polite. They also honored my request for an end room for quietness and it was quiet. Decent views fyi the hotel rooms start at floor 13 and go up to 23...I think. Small pool and workout room is on floor 12 and adequate as long as the children are kept civil or you get up early enough to beat the families. House keeping was on the ball! They even followed up on our requests and we gladly tipped them well daily for fresh sheets. I had the reservation in my name and my other half arrived from Seattle before I arrived from NYC I was expecting a HUGE hassle to get her on the reservation since I did the prepaid but they took care of it at the property and she was refreshed and waiting in the room for me. I really appreciated that. Overall I am still loyal to Dana, Four Seasons and Wyndham but now I know I have another option of a great hotel in Chicago- highly recommend this place for couples and short stays if you can handle being in the overly crowded tourist \"mecca.\" But if you know good food and the neighborhoods it's all good once you get a few blocks away and make the trip more like home.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful base with great staff!\u201d", "Author": "Sian48", "ReviewID": "UR116776261", "Content": "A great place.

Michigan Avenue is just a couple of blocks to the east. There are a ton of restaurants and shopping within a very short walk. You're about four blocks north of the river. One thing to note though - the website makes it sound like you're just a few blocks from Navy Pier. That's a little bit of a stretch. If you want to be close to Navy Pier or if you want to be in close walking distance to Millinneum Park/museum/planetarium/lakefront, you'll probably want to look at someplace closer.

He arrived promptly, told us he gets that call a lot and it's because we were on the 13th floor (the first floor of rooms in the building evidently) and \"the hot water comes from the roof, so you just need to try later\". Try later? You are a Hilton property right? He was very polite, and I believe I understand how gravity works, but it's ridiculous to have a hotel where you KNOW some of your guests are going to have cold water if they take a shower at peak usage, e.g. 8-9 in the morning. I went down to the front desk and she said \"No one has complained this morning.\" I said maybe they haven't this morning, but you can't tell me they've never complained at all, and she admitted that she does get that call from time to time. I told her I had the same hotel booked for three nights this coming week and I needed to cancel and move to another Hilton property. She moved me to the top floor so it shouldn't be a problem... for me anyway. Apologies to the poor schmucks on the bottom floors that day....

Once I got to my own room I found the tv wouldn't work for more than 2 minutes before it lost its signal and blacked out. The heating unit was very loud as well as the hallway was super loud. Paper thin walls and heavy closing doors. I was on the 23rd highest floor so didn't hear street noise. Can't imagine if that would have been a facor too...

Check-In: There was considerable waiting to check the car with the valet, to check the bags with the bellhop, and to check in at the front desk (only to find our room was not ready). Because there appeared to be many others in the lobby also waiting for their rooms, we decided to leave and return later. Unfortunately, the valet had already moved our car and were backed up with other requests. So, we ended up walking. One plus is that the hotel is conveniently located within the heart of the city, and makes for an easy walk to many locations. However, we were traveling with someone who has physical limitations; therefore, easy access to our vehicle would have been more ideal. Room: The room was smaller than I imagined when looking at hotel photos. Though amenities are offered, not all were stocked. There are no in-room safes and a waiting list for safe deposit boxes, which are located behind the front desk. Our room was only visited by housekeeping once out of the three nights there. There is a coffee maker with coffee in the room. No sugar or cream was provided though. And even though we were subject to additional guest fees (because there were three of us), no additional towels, cups, etc. to accomodate a third person were supplied. Check-out: You are given the option to review a bill that is slipped under your door the morning of check-out, and if everything is acceptable, you can call a number to have the charges applied to the credit card used to reserve your room. Even though I opted for this Express Check-Out, we ran into another problem once we reached the valet. We called the valet twenty minutes before leaving. Even so, we were forced to wait another ten minutes once downstairs, b/c someone had forgotten our request. When the attendant pulled up with our car, he did not give the key back. He, instead, ran inside the hotel for a moment, then presented another member of my family with a second hotel bill and asked him to sign the authorization. I took the bill and noticed an additional $200 in charges. Even though I had booked & already paid the Valet & Room Package - offered directly through the hotel - I was now being charged duplicate valet fees. I was forced to return to the front desk with the valet attendant and wait behind others, only to have the clerk reiterate to the attendant that I had already paid for both the room and valet on my original bill. Nonetheless, both charges were preauthorized on my card, and I only found out later that the additional funds were unavailable to me until all of the hotel charges were processed properly (which took several days). Furthermore, I wonder how many other guests signed a second slip presented to them, without realizing they were being overcharged.

The location is great....the hotel itself is only several blocks away from Michigan Avenue, easily within walking distance, however, being it was still cold and raining most of the time, we took many cabs....just a few bucks to Michigan Avenue and most of the main tourist attractions. Next to the front desk, there is a small room with \"sundries\" available...however, the selection is limited. We discovered that there is a full service grocery store right across the street from the hotel, which was really convenient....we were able to purchase snacks, water, fruit and easy stuff for breakfast (milk and cereal) from the market and then keep it in our room...much cheaper and more convenient than having to grab something every morning. Our room had a small fridge as well which was great. This grocery store was also a good place to pick up cheap post cards and reusable eco-friendly grocery bags with Chicago icons printed on them....I picked up several of them.....great souvenirs that actually are useful!!! :o) The hotel has its own parking garage which is very convenient if you have a rental car. I cant remember the price of parking, but it is very competitive with other parking garages; actually, it may even be a dollar or two cheaper than others. Parking can be a nightmare in downtown, so the fact that you can park in a parking garage and then take the elevator right down to your hotel lobby is fabulous. (NOTE: you do not need a car rental while in downtown...between walking, taking cabs and the public transportation, it is much easier, much cheaper and much less stressful to forego a rental car and rely on other sources of transportation). One of the nice attributes of the hotel as well (which many of the more expensive hotels do not have) is a FULLY COVERED area where vehicles can pull in to drop off passengers (taxi's, buses, limos, etc.) as well as a valet service....this was great especially as when we where there it RAINED MOST OF THE TIME....we could load and unload from our taxis and vehicles and not worry about getting soaked. There was also a small area you could park a vehicle when you were checking in and checking out. This covered area also had a small bench and smoking area, close to the main entrance, covered from the rain and clearly within sight of the front desk....I felt totally safe coming down for a quick cigarette at 3 AM because I was right out the front door of the hotel, the front desk could see me/I could see them and I was out of the rain!! The Weber Grill Restaurant is attached to the hotels' lobby....great food, great wine, great service, not too pricey. Check it out for great steaks, chicken, BBQ, etc. The front desk staff was always very friendly and willing to help answer questions, give directions, etc. One night, very late, I desperately needed some milk (I have a medical condition and alot of times the only thing that I can tolerate to drink/eat is milk)...the grocery store was closed and the hotel had no milk for sale....the front desk manager took the time to go in the back kitchen and do some investigating and reappeared about 5 minutes later with 2 big glasses covered with saran wrap of frosty whole milk. She didnt have to do that for me, but she did....she went above and beyond. I cant remember her name (it was a unique name) and she worked the night shift....she was awesome!!! (In fact, the entire front desk staff was awesome!!!) Our room was a little small, but adequate and clean. Maid staff provided us with extra towels and linens when we asked. The view from our room overlooked the rooftop of the next building and some neighboring apartments....that was a little weird, but hey, we were in Chicago!!! I didnt expect a balcony with a view of white sand beaches and palm trees!!! Street noise was not a problem for us at all, nor was noise in the hallways from other guests....overall, we had a great stay. I am planning on staying here when my husband and I return for my next (and his first) Chicago experience....I can truely say, this city is remarkable and The Hilton Garden Inn only added to my great trip!!

The hotel location is great, it is in the heart of the River North area, it is a short walk to both the Magnificent Mile and to the Chicago River and Loop area. Entrance to the Red line subway was steps away from the hotel entrance. Rooms were very clean, the mattresses were very firm and very comfortable. All four rooms had nice views of the City. Rooms were good size and had flat screen tv, fridge and microvave ovens. Bathrooms were also nice with good size. A few other reviews mentioned long waits for elevator, we never had to wait long for the elevator even though hotel was fully booked. Hotel also has indoor pool and fitness room. The issues: We booked four rooms backed in January. We called hotel two days before arrival and were told we only had three rooms reserved. Apparently someone at Hilton cancelled reservation for our fourth room and we had to speak to four different people and argue for 45 minutes before they agreed to give us back the fourth room. As far as check in, only 3 of our rooms were ready at 3 pm (which is hotel check in time) and 4th room was not ready until about 4 pm. One of our rooms had a problem with the cable TV and that room's TV only had about 8 channels available. Hotel claimed that the problem was with the cable provider but it was still unpleasant for the person who stayed in that room to only have a handful of TV channels to choose from. There was one morning when none of our rooms had hot water and everyone had to take a cold shower. Although room has nice new furniture, there is not alot of dresser space for storing clothes. There was another day when several treadmills in the fitness center were not working. Lastly, we made a reservation for the Weber Grill restaurant for 7 pm. We arrived at 7 only to be told our table was not ready and we had to wait for 20 minutes before we were seated. I do have to give an honorable mention to Suzanne, the front desk supervisor. She handled most of our complaints and did so in a very professional manner. Ask if she is available if you run into any service problems at this hotel. Even though our overall stay here was very good, there are alot of hotels in Chicago and when we come back, we will probably spend a litte extra money and stay somewhere a litte more upscale. I would recommend this hotel if you can get as good a rate as we did (about $150 per night) and book a city view room. Also be aware that parking is $44 per night, which seems to be the norm for downtown Chicago hotels. If you're looking for a cheap, decent breakfast (which you won't find at Weber Grill which charges about $15 per person for breakfast buffet), walk a few blocks to the Ohio House Coffee shop where you can get 2 eggs, 2 sausage, 2 bacon strips and 2 pancakes for $5.25 (must be the cheapest breakfast in downtown Chicago). Avoid Ed Debevic's restaurant which has very mediocre food and is obviously a tourist trap. If you like Hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches, walk over to Portillo's.

My sister, daughter and I had tickets to the Oprah Show. I made reservations for us to have a suite at the Hilton Garden Inn, Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile. I prepaid the reservation, as I wanted to guarantee that we would have our suite. We live in Cincinnati, and instead of flying, we decided to make the five hour trip by driving. I wanted to have a suite so we could have a better place to unwind. We arrived at the hotel, and I gave the valet our car, and he parked it. We went inside to check in. We were greeted promptly, and given our room keys. Off we went to see our little suite! Imagine my surprise when we opened the door to the suite, and we walked into a tiny room with two queen beds, which consumed the room. I immediately called the front desk to tell them a mistake had been made. A bad sign - it took me about five minutes to speak to someone at the front desk. The gentleman at the front desk, John, told me that I didn't have a suite reservation. I then told him I had written confirmation, and that I had prepaid - which the check-in person had already noted that I had prepaid my room. \"John\" said that the room that I was in was just as good as a suite, and I should be happy there. WHAT???? I told him I was not happy, as we had three adults, and I had advised that three adults were staying there in my online reservation request, and then I learned the truth. All of the suites were taken. I told John that I wanted him to find me another suite in another hotel. John said o.k., and about ten minutes later, I called back downstairs, and he told me that he had miraculously been able to get a room at the Embassy Suites, and we were so lucky!!! So, the three of us head downstairs to be taken to the Embassy Suites. This jerk is at the front desk when we go downstairs, and he is trying to ignore us. The young man who checked us in asked us, \"Is there a problem with your room?\" And I told him, \"Yes, we don't have a room, as my suite has evidently been given away, even though I prepaid for the suite.\" That young man was apologetic, and he asked who we had spoken to. Then the rude guy, John, comes over, and says, \"Go over to the Embassy Suites, turn right, and it is about a block down.\" Did I mention it was pouring rain???? So we walk through the rain, and go check in at the Embassy Suites. They request a credit card, so I give them my Amex, which they promptly charge the \"suite.\" The next day when we check out, we have to traipse back over to the Hilton from the Embassy, with our luggage in tow, to re-claim our car from valet parking. Nice, huh? I have to go back inside the Hilton so that they can do a separate charge for the valet parking, but I can't seem to get anyone to issue me a credit for the suite that I had prepaid for. I called the Hilton tonight, and I talked to someone who told me to leave a vm for the manager. I have now left her a vm, and I am awaiting a phone call to see what remedy is available for me. I am so disgusted by this hotel's treatment of their guests. Unbelievable! We did eat at two terrific restaurants, and I will review them separately.

Annoying! And very loud! This was after I switched it off!

The room is clean and quality. The noon checkout time is a significant perk for those of us who are not early risers. The front desk will tell you the breakfast ends at 10:30 when it actually ends at 10.

Great location, helpful, polite front desk staff. While the room walls are soundproof, the pass through and external doors are not. Aside from a non functioning smoke alarm (somewhat disturbing to have it hanging off the wall), this is an average HGI that isn't overpriced with a great location and nice views.

I also am a former Hilton Diamond Member. I have stayed at this hotel many times over the years, with the last stay having some major issues. The stay was so bad, Hilton sent a voucher to come again for a free nights stay. I let it expire and just recently decided to give the hotel a second try for a 9 night stay. Hotel Positives: Great location. Two blocks from Michigan Avenue, 1 block from State St. A grocery across the street, 1 1/2 blocks to Starbucks, and some fabulous restaurants within 3 blocks. Also, the red line is just out the front door for easy city transport. Hotel Negatives: Customer service, poor room cleaning, poor management. Before arriving, I called and told the manager that my last experience here was subpar and I was coming back and would like a smooth, stress free stay. The manager offered to honor the free night even though it was expired. Here is a snapshot of the stay: 1st night; Heater was broken and made a clanking noise every 26 seconds the whole night. 2nd day: The hotel had many key problems and issues. Enough to send apology letters out. 3rd day.....okay 4th day: Verbally insulted, lied to, and hung up on by April over a newspaper. Asked to speak with manager, she refused...said she couldn't leave a note for the manager unless she was told what about. Hung up on!! Spoke with manager about the matter, only to have him smirk and have very unprofessional demeanor. 5th day: the room was half cleaned. Arrived at night to a room with a dirty sink and toilet, no towels, dirty glasses, no toiletries. Called down and asked, and in return received towels, cups, and a bag of coffee/cream 6th day: Return to the room in evening to again find an uncleaned room. Towels were left on bed..not in bathroom. 7th day: okay 8th day; Room partially cleaned again. No towels again! 9th day: Went to check out and took the voucher down to be credited. Two managers had said they would be glad to honor it evn though it had expired. Gave it to Ronnie at the front desk, she said she would credit it. Two hours later, go to check out and notice it was never taken off. She then says it can't be used, even though 2 managers said they would take it. (It was their offer, not mine as I had said it was expired.....and only wanted a SMOOTH stay). Spend 1 hour arguing over the fact that they were renegging. Finally had to call Hilton Corporate, who then called the hotel and made them credit the voucher. After all this, never did get a formal apology and never heard from the GM....only shift managers.

The hotel rooms were fantastic, really big and comfortable luxury beds - just perfect. I never ate at the hotel so can't comment on that. The only downside is that the hotel staff were very rude, every time I asked them how to get somewhere they would snap back 'get a cab' which was not very helpful as a tourist!

The staff at the front desks changes often. Most of the staff isn't really that helpful. We asked once for a restaurant recommendation and was given the answer \"there are a lot of restaurants, here is a list\". That isn't really what I was looking for.

We're now in the second week of our stay and I must say, I'm really disappointed in the hotel. Don't get me wrong, the hotel itself is ideally placed with the red line El (Grand) right outside the door and the Mag Mile within walking distance. Also, the staff are friendly and the room bigger than expected, clean and tidy. Our main issue is noise. From everywhere. We're on the 13th floor and can hear absolutely everything either of our neighbours does, especially when in the bathroom which is embarrassing for both parties! You can hear word for word everything your neighbour says if you're in the bathroom whilst they're talking in their own room. At nightime, you can hear the toilets flushing on either side and if someone decides to have a late night/early morning bath or shower then believe me, you'll know about it! Also, even with the \"do not disturb\" sign positioned on your door, you'll be sure to hear the maids as they go about their daily duties, shouting out to each other from the other end of the corridor. We've also had other guests stand outside our door and have animated conversations on their mobiles, or with other guests in the middle of the night. The air conditioning unit is another story altogether and for the first few nights, ours was coming every ten minutes then going off again. We reported this and were advised an engineer would look at it but haven't heard anything since. We've came up with our own way of making sure the outburts are now shorter so our sleep isn't disturbed too much during the night. We considered asking for a room move but reckon all the rooms must be the same, we've came to the conclusion that the walls are made of tissue paper.

They said they would call housekeeping. Nada. I call housekeeping, they quickly brought toothpaste and brush for one, we needed 2, plus do they have a bathrobe?

We keep trying and finally after about 15 minutes we are connected with room service. Room delivery was speedy and the pizza was good along with the Mrs. Parks house cabernet.

The red line also takes you to Wicked, get off at Randolph and Washington. We always found a queue at reception, the staff continuously stopped dealing with customers to answer the phone, maybe a telephonist would solve the Q problem. The room was a little gloomy but clean, the air con was one of those huge old boxes and was very very loud, nothing subtle about it at all. The traffic noise was considerable but in a downtown hotel that is to be expected. However this faded into insignifcance when compared with the constant mysterious droaning noise, the sort of noise that hurts your whole body and not just your ears. We hoped it would go but it didn't, we tracked it down to pipes lurking behind a door on the opposite side of the corridor, I asked for a different room. The hotel was fully booked and it would be midnight before the staff knew of cancellations, the receptionist promised to call before she went off duty to let us know if we could move, she didn't call, she promised to get us earplugs, they didn't arrive, she promised to leave a message for the next shift, someone was to call us at 7.30am, she didn't appear to leave the message and they didn't call. Finally after explaing the whole story again the following morning we were moved, a lower room, worse traffic noise but that was ok.............until the dripping started. I awoke in the early hours to hear water dripping onto the ceiling above the bed, it was very annoying, I left a note and a generous tip for housekeeping and asked that they report this problem. I returned from my day out to find it had not been resolved, the guy on reception said he would deal with it immediatley, I returned after Wicked went to bed and woke in the early hours with drip drip drip....So 3 sleepless nights in the Hilton Garden Inn. On the plus side, breakfast in the Weber Grill was good, very attentive staff and eggs, pancakes and omlettes made to order. Cosmopolitans at the bar were great. Out and about, exit front door and turn right, walk along a few blocks and you will come across a good Irish Bar, Fado. On this same street you will find a Rain Forest Cafe, a Hard Rock Cafe and the anniversary McDonalds, the poshest Mickey D's you will ever see and the only one I have ever been in where the food in real life is as good as the photographs. You will also find a stop for the Hop On Hop Off tour which was very good value but it's the luck of the draw when it comes to guides. We had Baron \"the sexiest tour guide on the planet even if he did say so himself\" he was interesting and funny, the next guy wasn't so hot. Good stops are the Navy Pier, a little quiet during our visit, the art museum which had more Monets than you could shake a stick at, the aquarium, fab penguins and of course Sears Tower, well organised and no real queues. We saw Wicked which was good but not great, Elphaba has a tremendous voice but lacked a bit of stage presence, Glinda saved the show. I should add that we watched Mary Poppins on Broadway the previous week, it was totally fabulous and perhaps this jaded our view of Wicked just a little bit.

Do try Osteria via Stato, just around the corner on State Street. $39.95 prix fix menu that is incredible and thus why it was named to the Bon Appetit magazine top 50 restauirants in the USA. Great value. Back to the hotel, the bed is very comfortable and the window opened althought the noise even on the 21st floor could be a little loud but it is a big city. We thought the room size was just right for 2 and would definately stay here again for its value, service and location.

If only that were true! We were initially assigned a fully accessible room, although neither of us requires nor requested such an accomodation. For those not in the know, full accessibility features a cavernous washroom with double-wide door, an extra-tall toilet, has a curtained-off alcove lined with rungs of handrails in lieue of a bathtub, and displays an inconveniently-placed showerhead (think YMCA). This was, in fact, a \"problem\" for my soak-craving partner, so we immediately called to request a new room. In exchanging the keys we were relieved of our two coupons for free bottles of water from the ill-stocked and un-manned pantry beside the front desk. Upon arrival one floor up we noted that, contrary to our registration profile, we were directly between the elevators and the ice machine, and that this new room was also accessible (although not to the degree that the previous one had been). Tired from our flight, we endured the almost constant traffic outside our door and within the wall at the head of our bed where the elevators whirred and hummed until the next morning. We also had to unplug the noisy (and empty) bar fridge, which commenced emitting a sour smell. A second call to the front desk generated assurances that the bellboy would be up momentarily with keys to a third room. After 15 minutes a third call prompted the receptionist to inform us she would be delivering them personally. As we waited in the hall outside our room with all our baggage for a further 10 minutes we had to let ourselves back in to answer a call telling us they were now actually really truly on their way. Meeting us by the elevators we were assured that we had been moved to a corner room on the second-to-highest floor, far from the elevators and stairwells. It was, in fact, not a corner room, and was also directly across the hall from a stairwell. It did, however, have a normal bathroom and a better view. Over our short stay I noted that housekeeping did not thouroughly clean the tub and toilet, nor did they fully replenish the amenities on more than one occasion. The bedside table contained not only the requisite bible, but also a discarded porn magazine! Most troubling, though, was that this hotel does not offer room service, opting instead to rely on the services of third-party restaurants in the neighbourhood that close early, open late and specialize only in steak and pasta. As such, we requested cutlery and plates from the front desk to eat our carry-out of Indian food, but they simply never arrived...

We saw a taping of \"The Jerry Springer Show\" (bizarre and sureal), went to see the musical \"Wicked\" at the Oriental Theater (highly recommended) and went to see the Black Hawks defeat the St. Louis Blues in overtime (!) at the United Center. We ate excellent meals at both Heaven on Seven and Redfish (see my seperate review for Redfish). We also ate at Mother Hubbards which seemed more like a drinking establishment and not a dinner place (I would not recommend the ostrich burger). The HGI was an excellent base for our stay and was within walking distance for virtually everything we did (although we did take an express bus to and from the hockey game which is highly recommended at $2.00 per person each way). The Sears Tower was quite a hike from the HGI but it was a lovely day so we did walk back AND forth (but hey it gave us license for eating a great dinner with no guilt)! After taking a cab from Union Station we checked into the HGI on Monday but our key card did not open the door properly and took many tries (typically 4) to get the door to open. This problem happened virtually each and every time we tried to get into our room. Frustrating yes, but we learned to laugh about it and took bets on how many times it would take! Once inside our room we instantly noticed there were no pillows -- bizarre but we phoned down to request some and we were told they were to be sent up. Later while unpacking we noticed there was not an iron, only an ironing board. When we went out to grocery/snack/wine shop at the Jewel-Osco store (how nice to have a full service grocery store so close by) across the street later that afternoon we asked the front desk to send us an iron and also mentioned the room was still without pillows. They apologized and assured us everything would be taken care of. When we returned 30 minutes later there was a knock on the door and an iron appeared but still NO pillows. It was only after a phone call from the front desk checking on the iron, that we reminded them that we still had no pillows. The pillows were then quickly dispatched. I hate to sound like a complainer as these were certainly minor issues but they seemed odd as a cleaning person would certainly notice the absence of pillows and probably notice the missing iron. By the way -- the rest of the week the cleaning service was excellent so this could have been just a strange occurrance. I would definately stay at the HGI again and the rate of $139 per night was VERY reasonable. We are not needy nor demanding people so the king bed non-smoking room we requested (and received) suited our needs just fine (really it was GREAT)! We also loved the business center where we could check our email, and I was able to get more info regarding the express bus to the United Center saving us tons of money on a cab. We also appreciated the mini-refrigerator but did not use the coffee maker nor the microwave. Unfortunately we were too lazy or too tired after some late nights -- that's our story and we are sticking too it -- to use the pool or the exercise center but they looked great. Also kudos for the blackout curtains at the HGI and they should be standard at every hotel as they overlap in the center so there is not a large ray of light streaming into the room each morning. All in all we had a FABULOUS trip to Chicago and the location and ammenities of the Hilton Garden Inn really allowed us to enjoy our stay.

The rooms are clean, small, and just OK. Housekeeping is a weak link. The first day of our stay we returned to the room about 4:30 and no housekeeping. We went downstairs to wait in the lobby. About 5:15 I asked at the front desk where I was told \"there is no daily housekeeping unless you call\". That seemed impossible to believe, but I complied by asking for housekeeping every day. (The desk clerk said, \"You really want housekeeping every day?\") We are not difficult people, but even a Motel 6 has daily housekeeping for heaven's sake. They then put \"a rush\" on our room, and 45 minutes later we had clean towels but no clean sheets. We paid $139 and for that price I gave it three stars. Any more than that would be inappropriate. Valet parking is $36 a day, but we needed the \"unlimited\" aspects of that service. Unfortunately, we forgot to factor that in for a \"written in stone\" Sunday morning obligation, and were almost late when it took the better part of an hour to get our car. We had called ahead, and the valet boys were too busy counting their tips to go and fetch our vehicle. Finally, one of them asked if we needed help and we said we had called for our car before we left the room. At that point, one of the boys actually stuffed the folding money back into his pocket and went to get our car. Upon leaving, we waited several minutes for the valet boys to pocket their tips before moving a car that made it impossible for us to exit. Not cool. As Hilton Honors members we thought we would receive preference for our request of a \"high floor\". Not so. We were originally placed on the 13th floor, and it was only because I asked about a corner room that we were placed on the 19th floor. And there are 23 floors, so that wasn't a \"view\" room. True, we are only \"gold\" level not platinum. Even so, 2 bottles of waters seemed like a minimal acknowledgement of our Hilton loyalty. While we were there we walked 50 steps to another Hilton property, the Homewood Suites. I talked to a staff member there who was really open about the property where Honors Gold members are automatically assigned to the 12th floor which we verified as being completely non-smoking and comprised of actual two-room suites which had all the amenities of Hilton Garden(free hot breakfast) plus free cocktails/dinner in the evening Mon.-Thurs.. A better choice if you have the extra $50 a night considering you also get a kitchen and guest laundry. All in all, having stayed at many downtown hotels, Homewood Suites is the best Hilton choice. Embassy Suites down the block has a crowded noisy lobby, minimal room furnishings, and is the most expensive.

Room - This is an older tower hotel, so the rooms are small as to be expected but adequate for 2 people. Air circulation was good and the bedding and furnishings were fine. Staff - Despite a late arrival, our King N/S Upper Floor was confirmed. The front desk staff guy was great, pointed out Bijon's American Bistro a couple of blocks away for a late night dinner. Also, when we needed a bandaid, instead of pointing us to a drugstore, they just gave us some from their own cabinet. Housekeeping was efficient and the room was clean. Amenities - A delicous breakfast was had at Weber's. We did not go there for dinner or use pool/gym. Lobby is rather small and except for a small nook with snacks/toiletries there is not much else in the way of services. Weber's is their only restaurant. Price - rate through Hilton Website was $170 nt for a midweek stay. I am sure that a weekend rate is less and probably would include breakfast.

They moved us to a higher floor on check-in when they heard that our relatives were up there. Housecleaning crew didn't clean our room till after 4 pm on Friday. There is no breakfast buffet but there is a corner bakery down the street with great breakfast choices. One suggestion: you may want to choose another place to eat besides the hotel's weber grill restaurant. Chicago has so many great places to eat.

This saved us quite a bit of money, being able to eat breakfast and a light dinner/snack in the room. I loved the location, too. There's a subway stop right outside the doorway of the hotel. We parked our car at the hotel ($21/night, no in-out privleges), bought 2-day CTA visitor passes for $9 each and used combinations of subways, els, and buses to get around Chicago. Two nights we ate dinner at restaurants within walking distance of the hotel (there are LOTS of restaurants nearby!). We ate breakfast in our room 2 mornings, but on Saturday morning we ate downstairs at the Weber Grill. They had an excellent and very reasonably priced breakfast buffet.

The Webber Grill downstairs and PF Changs supplying room service are also great as I was there on business alone, and food is excellent. The bar is very friendly and having Starbucks morning coffee available in the lobby is spot on. The pool is very small and workout area adequate, but you can go next door to the \"Crunch\" Gym if so inclined. The location of this hotel is second to none. Slap in the middle of town, a block from Mich. Ave with everything else in walking distance. Staff are very friendly and helpful, my only complaint is that the room service seemed very sparse on a Friday and my room still had not be cleaned by 3pm, however this was the only time.

I was staying there for a wedding a few weekends ago and had a blast. Location: It is very centrally located and the advantage it has from it's rival hotels located on the Mag. Mile is that it is not crazy busy when you step out of the front door. The Mag. Mile is less than a 2 min. walk away. Several times, when my wife and I went shopping, we were able to run back to the Hilton and drop off our bags. We also had a couple of nice morning runs down to the Navy Pier and got to see the Air Show practice one of the mornings. Staff: People were very helpful and willing to help. The young, tall African gentleman at the door was helpful with my bags when I arrived and equally as helpful when we left. We must've asked about 50 questions to the front desk on recommendations for late night bars/clubs/eats and they accomodated each one. Rooms: Room was very clean and we did enjoy having the mini-fridge in the room w/ microwave for all of the left over food we had after eating out! We stayed in 2205, second floor from the top and had a great view of the Chicago skyline, including the John Hancock Tower. I will post pics soon. I would definitely stay there again next time I go!

We stayed for three days and I was overwhelmed by the friendliess we recieved. The Webber Grill is a great restaurant with good old American sized porrtions and a large selection to choose from. Also the hotel bar had informal and friendly staff who were up for a laugh and once again couldn't do enough to make us feel welcome. The Hotel is located beside the magnificent mile and is therefore great for this who love to shop etc etc. Also there are plenty of bars / restaurants nearby for socialising and late night drinking!! I use Trip Advisor to help me book hotels and have never before written a review. I must say that the staff here were by far the best I have ever experienced. Everything from booking restaurants to recommending good nightlife to arranging travel to and from baseball games was all part of the service provided the guys at the Hilton.

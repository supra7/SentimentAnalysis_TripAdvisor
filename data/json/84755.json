The rooms were fine for $90 a night, the breakfast was pretty bad, and, worst of all, the shuttle was essentially non-existent. The shuttle is operated by a third party, runs only a few times a day and stops at numerous other hotels. As an example, the first ride of the day leaves for seaworld (the only shuttle to sea world for the day) -- about 16 miles from the Galleria -- at 7:20am... but doesnt arrive until 8:45am! Coming back from sea world there is also only one shuttle. This is the same for all other parks (epcot, magic kingdom, etc.) albeit transportation once on the disney resort is pretty easy... and actually finding the shuttles on time is another story. Thus, you will end up taking a lot of taxis, which run between 20 and 40 each way. I would not recommend staying here if your goal is to get up to the Disney property.

Free parking We are happy with our choice of this Hotel, and will certainly stay at the same place on our next visit. This trip was for visiting Disney World, Sea World and Universal Parks. Since we were not going to spend much time on Hotel premises, we were not interested in a Resort Hotel. Although this Hotel had a pool and a small gym, we had absolutely no time to use any. It is 2 miles from Animal Kingdom. You can see Animal Kingdom from the upper floors. Few miles to all the other parks as well. Dozens of all types of restaurants on the main road. Supermarket and gift stores across the street. The supermarket was a good help. We stocked up supplies for water, snacks to carry to the Parks. The water in the parks costs $2.50 per bottle. We purchased 24 bottles for $7.99 and kept them in the car trunk. Daily free breakfast - bread, gravy, scrambled eggs (or pork). And them oatmeal, cereal, juice, milk, canned fruit, and a whole lot of usual breakfast items. That saved our breakfast money every single day. Rooms were in great condition. The appearance was also nice. It was not the usual gaudy Hotel appearance. Staff -- super courteous, helpful, friendly. Guest services -- super courteous, helpful, friendly. Checkin/out -- clean. ----------------------------------- Suggestions to the Hotel: ----------------------------------- 1. Room has adequate light bulbs, but light is inadequate. There should be at least 1 or 2 bulbs with more light. All the bulbs have very low light. 2. Fresh fruits for breakfast (instead of canned fruits). 3. Real bagels for breakfast.

However - we did have a huge problem with the fridge \"knocking.\" We asked for maintenance every morning and evening, and it never got fixed. Annoying. Wi-fi worked so-so for us in the room. Not as great as home, but it did the job. Rest of the hotel - The halls and lobby (and elevator) could use a good updating. Especially the furniture in the lobby....gross! The pool was kind of gross looking and small (you could not see the bottom), but again, we were just there to rest our heads after exhausting, all-day trips to the theme parks. If that's what you're looking for and nothing extra, this is a good hotel for you. I wouldn't rely on the shuttle service, it seemed to run too late in the morning and very off schedule during the day for us. Luckily, we had a rental of our own. If you want a hotel that's more like a resort this is not the place to go. I would highly suggest staying on Disney property at the value resorts - $20 or so more a night and you get a much nicer place with a much more magical experience. Also, the fact that they charge a \"resort\" fee is a little ridiculous, this is by no means a resort, it's basically a Super-8 with a bit fancier of rooms. Now, $6/night isn't a big deal - but it's just more annoying than anything. At it to the room rate, but by no means say it's for amenities. All-in-all, we probably won't go back. Reasons being, lack of updating and non-responsive staff. Not a total deal breaker, and if you can get an amazing deal for a trip that will be spent 90% of the time outside of the hotel - by all means go and stay here. We will likely stay on Disney property again, with all the deals they offer, it's worth an extra $150 or so for the week to get the \"magical\" vacation experience and no dilapidated hotel experience.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cNice nights sleep\u201d", "Author": "TeacherTawny", "ReviewID": "UR115909748", "Content": "The hotel is located a few minues from Disney where I attended a conference.

Although the rooms were nice the service was almost non-existent. Here is a short list of the pros and cons of this hotel: Pros: 1. Good location, located right near the highway. The drive to Disney World was approximately 5 minutes, and to Universal Studios was about 20 minutes. Perfect if you plan on spending most of your time at the theme parks. 2. Nice rooms which included a fridge and microwave. You could tell the rooms had been updated fairly recently with fairly modern furniture and flat screen television. 3. The maid service was very good. Rooms were always clean and they went to the extra mile to make art out of the towels and kleenex. A nice touch. Cons: 1. The customer service was almost non-existent. The staff ignored you completely unless you approached them. There was never a \"hello\" or \"goodbye\" and not even a \"how was your stay\" or \"have a good trip\" when you checked out. We don't expect exceptional service from a 3 star hotel but this complete lack of service, or even a hint of friendliness was quite surprising. Be aware of the desk in the lobby which they refer to as \"guest services\". This was nothing but a thinly veiled front to push timeshare. When you went to speak to them about buying park tickets (which they sell) they would quote you a price and then explain that you would need to go to a breakfast offsite the next morning before you could get the tickets for that price. They would push you to accept, as it appeared the individual was getting a commission. If you told them you were not interested in the \"breakfast\" and would pay regular prices for the tickets they lost complete interest and did not want to help anymore. They even went so far as to call us in our room the day after we checked in to let us know of a free \"welcome gift\" which we could pick up. This of course gave them an opportunity to pitch the time share. The gift, which we saw them give to others, was a bag of microwave popcorn. We were very disappointed that a hotel would be this deceptive and pretend this was actually a guest services desk. 2. The shuttle to the parks: Fortunately we had rented a car but those who intend to rely on the shuttle should be aware that it only goes to Disney World twice each morning and once to Universal Studios. 3. The breakfast was extremely limited, even for one that is free. The first day when we got there well before the breakfast was to end they informed us that they had run out of bread for toast. Fortunately, there are lots of places nearby for breakfast, including Denny's. 4. While the rooms seem to have been updated fairly recently, the same obviously has not been done for the common areas of the hotel. There are lots of other hotels in the area for a similar price.

The location is great being in close proximity to Disney, but it is on a pretty busy strip of tacky tourist shops. In fact the best way to find this place is to look for the enormous mermaid. The place itself has a nice neutral decor and decent TV in the room(but with few channels). In all it is a great value for such a clean place.

The person at the front desk was an asian male that was so rude(I dont remember his name, but please see attached a picture we took of him) it really ruined the rest of our stay. We had originally reserved 2 King rooms, and upon check-in he told us there was only one king room (# 514) and one double available (room #403). We were ofcourse upset, because the rate we had paid was for 2 king rooms. He told us that the rooms arent guaranteed, even though we paid a higher rate for a king room. We then said that wasn't fair and that we should have been notified that we werent going to be given two king rooms ahead of time. This person simply shrugged his shoulders and in a very rude manner said \"well you can cancel and go some where else if you want, but I cant help you\". Needless to say we took the rooms he had available because, where else were we going to go at almost 1am? The next morning I asked to speak with a manager, I think her name was Catalina or Carolina? She is a hispanic young woman, with long black hair. I expressed my concerns and discontent with the person at checkin, and she was very nice and apologized and assured us that we would have another king room available to us in the afternoon. She said she was going to leave a note a the desk and she was going to hold room 517. All we had to do was pick up the keys when we got back from Animal Kingdom. As I predicted, when we got back to the hotel around 7pm, Michael at the front desk had no idea we were supposed to move to room 517 and notified us that it had already been sold to someone else. He called the manager \"catalina\" and offered to \"comp\" one of the nights in exchange for having to settle for a double room. We accepted because at that point, we only had 2 nights left and wanted to unpack our things already! He was very nice, but the point is that yet AGAIN we were not given what we were promised and it totally ruined our experience at the Galleria Palms. Upon checkout, Michael at the front desk had indeed credited one night for the double room. The problem is that he credited the cheapest night !!! Which isnt fair and we had a little dispute that it should have been the average rate of all the nights. He finally agreed and we got the credit, but once again there was another issue and another technicality. It was just TERRIBLE. In addition: The included \"breakfast\" was nothing as advertised. At the front desk there was a sign that showed all the different menu items that would be available and in actuality less than half the things on there were actually given. Part of the reason why we chose this hotel was the value, and the extra ammenities offered (breakfast, free shuttle to parks, king room). Sadly we could attain only a small part of those ammenities. The free shuttle was either too early every day, or too late. We were only able to take it once, and had to wait almost an hour in the lobby for it. This needs to be worked on. Overall, the rooms were clean, very nicely decorated and it still was a great price/value. However, we will NEVER stay here again. I'd rather pay a little bit more and be treated well and actually given the things that are promised in the advertisement of the hotel.

The hotel was quiet and the beds were comfortable. There was a small supermarket and liquor store right across the street, and many restaurants within a five minute walk-Black Angus was by far the best. Galleria Palms was a one minute walk to a bus route just in front of IHOP on 192 (#55 bus-go online for the schedule (lynx) $2.00 each way or $4.50 for an all-day pass) that took us to a Super Walmart and a Super Target; two excellent places to go for reasonable shopping and grocery items. We purchased a lot of food at these two places because we personally don't like to eat out a lot and the free breakfast at the hotel was the same each day. The hotel provides a free shuttle to the theme parks, (you can transfer to any of the other parks via the transportation center at Disney-Disney buses, boats or the monorail will take you where you want to go) but the time between drop-off and pick-up at the theme parks is somewhat long. Because of that, we met up with a great taxi driver named Habib Aboutayeb, who provides a flat-rate taxi service to and from Orlando Airport, the theme parks, and wherever else you want to go. He was, by far, the most reasonable and knowledgeable taxi driver we have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He knows the area very well and was most helpful to us during our visit. Kissimmee is approximately 30 minutes from the Orlando Airport, and if you don't rent a car-funnily enough it can cost more for a car rental than to take a taxi to the theme parks and back-he is by far, your best bet. His number is: 407-408-0439. He can also be reached via email for reservations: m.moha14@yahoo.com The front desk clerk is more than happy to contact him for you if need be. Kissimmee is a very hot and humid place in summer. We all managed to get heatstroke while visiting, so be sure to drink lots of water and Gatorade (you can take your own non-alcoholic drinks into Disney Parks and Universal) and although you may not feel like eating, be sure to eat a lot of small meals throughout the day. Enjoy the pool at the hotel; it is bound to rejuvenate you after a long day at the Parks. For those purchasing tickets to Disneyworld, save your money and don't get the parkhopper ticket-you can basically plan to spend one day at each park- we bought a 7-day parkhopper and it took us 4 1/2 days to visit Epcot, Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom (Tusker House Restaurant was phenomenal!) and Hollywood Studios- we hit a park a day.

Disney area hotels also suffer with high occupancy rooms (families) for long durations (a week), banging around in a small room. Add in the high humidity and maintenance for any hotel in this area is a constant nightmare. The Galleria sits just back from the main road and might be hard to find. It's a classic multistory single hallway building. It's located in an area full of trashy gift shops and fast food choices. Generally in good repair, long hallways are cooled with a single A/C unit so I can imagine the heat in the summer. The hotel was almost empty on my 1 night stay and check-in was fine, though somewhat disorganized. The $5 resort fee is sadly common considering this is by no means a 'resort' but illustrative of the owner's attempt to increase margins (advertise a lower rate, but charge more). Rooms were in good standing and as the photos others have posted. Room lighting is a bit dim overall, but adequate, Bathroom was clean and OK for illumination. Toiletries are bare minimum, so bring your own. The free wireless Internet basically does not work from the room and I ended up going to the lobby.

I struggle on my family vacation recommendation, the small pool is nothing special for kids and the hotel location is not on the beaten bath.

Only complaints we had were with the water pressure in the shower- a little too light for my comfort and getting calls in the morning about buying park tickets. That was annoying but it only happened two mornings. Good breakfast, although the same thing every morning- eggs, sausage, toast... juice, coffee. Also the \"gym\" is only 1 treadmill and 1 bike.

Very clean and it included a decent continental breakfast which was served 6-9AM but the eggs and sausage were served after 7AM because most of the people did not get up early (like we did). Was decent, but don't expect the spread you find at the Grand Hyatt or a Four Seasons. If you want to eat like a horse there are several buffets very close including a Golden Corral. All and all, great location not only from the conference resorts but from Disney World as well. Would definitely stay there again next year. The restaurant next door (WILDSIDE) was excellent and decently priced. While I was there, I recommended the hotel to a friend who was coming down the next day and he said thanks for the great recommendation after the conference. The money we saved, wife and I went to DisneyWorld for a day, also attended a birthday party, and still had money to spare compared to the resort.

I negotiated a deal prior to my arrival of what was going to be a two night stay with my wife. First of all, the hotel is OLD and RUNDOWN. It has been several different brand hotels in the past. The parking lot needs to be re-paved. There is VERY POOR lighting in the parking lot at night (although that's great for thieves. They like it nice and dark). They actually have a banner covering up the name of the last hotel. Very hard to see, especially at night. But what ruined it for me was the bait-and-switch trick they used on me. I had negotiated a deal for one room with a king bed for two nights, and got confirmation. Upon arrival, I was told for the price I got I could not get the king bed, I get double beds. The king bed would cost me an additonal $10 per night (plus the additional taxes) . After several minutes of conversation, they basically called me a liar, would not budge on the deal, and let us walk out the door over $20. Not too smart considering they are only running 62% occupancy. We got our credti card re-imbersed, walked across the street, a got another room for two nights. After thinking about my decision for a couple of days, I have concluded I made the right decision by leaving. Can't imagine what might have happend should I have had any problems during our stay. It's just and old hotel that has passed it's prime and needs complete renovation. The price might be good, but you get what you pay for - old nasty hotel and poor service.

Hit's are good location off of 192 and therefore 10 minutes max driving to the Disney Parks. Breakfast is just ok. Nothing great, but I've had far worse. They should spring for some waffle makers to go along with the biscuits/gravy, eggs, sausage and of course the usual pastries. 4 kinds of juice, coffee, tea, cereal and some canned fruit pretty much describe it. Not bad really. Does get old after a few days. Pool is quite small and nothing special as it is located right next to the parking lot. Different restaurants within 5 minutes walking distance are the IHOP (right out front) and the New York Pizza World (very very good pizza) and Colorado House of Beef (not bad, not great). Lobbies are hot and not airconditioned past the lobby floor. Rooms are quite large (300 square feet), with very good beds and external airconditioners that are quiet. Pillows are those typical very thick foam pillows that work great for setting up in bed, but lousy for sleeping. We brought our own. very nice 32\" flat screen TV.

I will give my pros and cons and try and address in my experience some of the concerns placed here. Overall the hotel was perfect for our needs. Great price as well!!! I went for 7 days for my honeymoon. I am probably considered crazy by friends and family when it comes to hotel cleanliness. I am terrified of hotel showers and beds. The room was amazingly clean. It passed in my book. The room was perfect for our stay. The size was just right. The only flaws I would have to say would have been the lack of concern for our towels and the pool. Being that we were on our honeymoon (and that I have a worry wart for a mother that has passed certain traits on to me) we kept the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on our door the whole time. One, obvious we were on our honeymoon and two being that we were going to be park hopping I didn't want to carry around a huge purse all day. So I would leave my purse that had belongings or information that I wouldn't want disturbed. Not to say that anyone would steal, you just have to be really careful now a days. We would call every other day for towels and the staff really weren't too helpful with getting us that stuff. It was even mentioned that if we took our \"Do Not Disturb\" sign down that we would have an easier time getting them. Now as for the pool, it was very small and located in the parking lot, but if you are parking all day long it doesn't matter. We never went to the pool and could have cared less about it. Those are the only two complaints I have and they really don't matter because the price and location are amazing!! To address on my experiences with some of the concerns I have read on this site with the hotel are; the halls being hot, the entrance to the hotel, timeshare sharks and the showers getting hot. As far as the halls being hot, I didn't care. They were hot, but we had a nice working air conditioner (worked VERY well) in our room. The entrance is extremely hidden. Thanks to Trip Advisor I already new this going in and had no trouble locating the hotel, but I can def. see where that would be a HUGE problem for some people. We never experienced any timeshare sharks we did however on the first day get rushed about buying our tickets (that we had already purchased). The man wouldn't stop talking but we got away and found a side door and never saw them again. Don't let this bother you, because in MOST of the gift shops and restaurants there were the same people set up doing the samething. You are going to encounter that almost everywhere it seemed for us. My husband would be very upset with me if I didn't address the shower. The shower was hard to work and did not get very hot at all!! He was very disappointed by this. Some days were fine and other days you would wait for it to heat up for what seemed like 15 minutes and it just wouldn't get very hot at all. Overall after weighing the pros and cons of this hotel I would stay again and again. For the price you think you are going to get a roach motel and it is quite the opposite. I loved it! The pictures on the site are very true to our experience. Our room looked just like the pictures and I was very pleased!!

The price was $49 a night, which appeared to not be a special (even the hotel site offered that price). Included in that rate was a morning breakfast every day.

It came with a plasma TV, free Wi-Fi, coffee maker, microwave, refrigerator, and hair dryer. These are unheard of at a $50 hotel. Parking was free, and the hotel allows cancellations up to 48 hours in advance with full refund. Again - unheard of in 2009. I checked in at 2pm and got my key at the front desk with no speech (others have claimed a 10 minute timeshare type speech). My only issue with the room was that the marble floor tiles in the bathroom are very slippery, even when not wet. Also, the elevators are really, really slow. I did not check out the pool at all. I have stayed at Orlando hotels that were rated 2 stars higher than this, but were not nearly as nice as this. They should be charging at least $75 a night for this place.

We made our reservation, however when we arrived it was not the \"King Bed\" that was stated in the reservation, it was the 2 double beds. They didn't do anything about that. We co-sleep with our 2 yr old and the queen bed was a bit too close. Beds are super soft, lots of pillows. There is not a wet bar in the room as stated on their website nor is the toiletries from bath and body works. What you get is a 1 inch round face soap, 1 small hotel bar soap, 1 small bottle of shampoo, 1 bottle of lotion. Bring your own. Not enough for a family to wash with for 2 days. The bathroom floor was full of long black hair, and toothpaste dried up on the wall paper, mold was starting to form in the shower grout. All of this could of been cleaned up using a toothbrush, I did try it w/ a rag without a problem. Bathroom does have 2 sinks inside it. Which was nice. Water very hot and lots of pressure. In the room, the fridge made a noise all night, but that was on our 2nd night and it was 10pm so we slept through it. Can't control the temp or turn it off on our own. A bed light was burned out upon arrival, no tv guide, or any type of \"instructions\" in the room like time of breakfast, time pool is open and closed, etc...just a tour book on the local disney park and a menu for room service from outside places. It was quiet, no outside noise from your window. There was a sink in the room, however water didn't come out of it, not sure what that was for. Check in was simple, no one told us to get a parking permit or sent us to the person at the \"buy your theme park tickets here booth\". We didn't bother with the free breakfast, it is over at 9am. But there are plenty of all you can eat for 3.99 breakfast coupons to be found for the local restaurants. Also there is a cracker barrel down the road, or chick fl a, or mc donalds or burger king. Super target is near as well as a Publix and cici's pizza. Lots of survivors shops and mini golf nearby. It is a bit hard to locate this hotel. The hallways are hot, but that is understandable, who wants to pay to cool the halls. The ice machine worked, however, coke machines on 1st and 2nd floors did not work, don't know about 3rd and 4th floors. there are 2 elevators, and it takes a few minutes to wait for one. Pool was nice, 3-5ft deep, and there are changing color lights in the pool under the water that is pretty cool for the kids. OH< just so you know, pool closes at 10pm. There are side doors you can use to enter the building you don't have to go through the lobby, you need your room card to access through the side doors. We paid 54.00 a night. Which is a wonderful price for the area. We live just 90 min away from orlando and have been at several hotels in this area over the past 20 years. We have stayed at higher end hotels and lower end hotels. If you need a room to sleep while your busy at the parks or for a convention or job, this is the place for you. No game room or fitness rooms, just nice rooms. Also on our second day the room was not cleaned until 3:30pm. We were gone from 9am - noon and then to the pool for a few hours, so it was a bit disappointing to come back from that all day to a dirty room with no clean towels. When the maid did come, she just made the bed and moped quick and wiped down the bathroom, empty trash, and left clean towels. Only a 10 min top job so why it took till 3:30 pm I will never know.

There was a time-share guy at a desk in the breakfast area, but he stayed in his cage and didn't bother anyone during the 4 days we were there. The HOTEL is set a little back from 192-Irlo Brosnan. Very quiet. No road noise or commotion. Super close to the Disney Parks. The hotel is about 1 mile from the park road system. You don't even have to get on I-4.

Tall cupboard to hang dresses and pants with a set of drawers inside. Plenty of drawers in closet and dresser to unpack all of your clothes and traveling needs. Small cupboard under microwave to organize/store any of your food, plates, etc. Comes with a nice microwave and refrigerator. Counter in room is granite. BATHROOM has marble floors and granite counters. Very nice size. Nice shampoo, conditioner and face soap. Although they NEVER replenished them. Housekeeping seemed a bit passive-aggressive, but they did keep the room nice and clean. There is a bit of difference between the queen rooms and the king rooms. QUEEN rooms are typical. KING room has a little section with a small couch and table. Try not to get the first floor. It has a granite floor, which makes the hall noise echo loudly from people going to the elevator. Great free wifi - iron - ironing board - hair dryer - swimming pool. Lots of restaurants and cheesy gift shops close by Free shuttle to and from the parks at scheduled times BREAKFAST - Much better than \"expanded\" continental breakfasts at most hotels. I would call it a full breakfast. Fair, but good enough fuel to avoid a stop at a restaurant. Scrambled eggs - scrambled eggs with sausage mixed in - pancakes (horrible) - biscuits and gravy - assorted sweet rolls and cakes - fruit loops - wheat flakes - bread (toaster available) - juice machine (orange, apple, punch) - coffee - tea - apples - canned peach slices. POOL is situated in such a way that it doesn't draw one in to relax and sit around for the day. Kind of wedged in between the parking lot and building with little folliage.

That's a problem in winter, as Orlando's temperatures are cold enough that, most days, their unheated swimming pool is unusable. Bad if you're travelling with kids during those months. Also, the neighborhood -- while incredibly convenient to Disney and loaded with inexpensive places to eat -- is a bit depressing. This is not the worst stretch of Route 193 (go east of I-4 to see that), but it's not great either. Think tourist trap on steroids.

It was also about 1 mile from the Disney exit which it made it that much quicker to get there. The CONS of the hotel I would have to say the is skip the morning breakfast, just didnt look too appetizing to us and even though there was an elevator it could have been a little quicker and the sign could have been bigger for the hotel, but thats it!

My family and I have stayed at this hotel before when it was a Hampton Inn. And that's what it is. A remodeled Hampton Inn. They do offer breakfast in the morning until 9am. It wasn't the best, cereal, toast, mixed fruit and little powered donuts. We got creative and made PBJ with what they had. They have a variety of drink from juice to hot chocolate, tea, coffee, milk. But it got us going in the morning and was free. They have a small pool but was too cold for us to swim. The front desk staff seemed friendly and said Hi as we would walk by. There is a theme park ticket discount booth however you have to go see a timeshare. We got our Disney tickets for $369 for 3 adults and 1 child for 2 days. The timeshare tour was a not that bad. They do bring 2-3 people over to talk you into it and it all sounds like a smart thing to do, but too me it was too much money, so when I was tired of the pressure I just simply said I didn't like the resort...they didn't like that and gave us our tickets and off we go. I would probably not do it again unless I was short on cash. They push you a lot. but we save a lot of $$ doing it. The hotel does offer a shuttle to the theme parks, but we did not use it as it only had ONE pick up time and also picked up other hotels. We drove and parked ourselves. Well worth the extra money. So bottom line, clean rooms, free small breakfast, friendly staff, very close to all Theme Parks. Plenty of fast-food around, Walgreen's down the street.

The picture shows a Hampton Inn and it WAS a Hampton Inn that was bought by a company named Meridian. The hotel staff was courteous and the rooms just like pictured online and clean! Close proximity to Disney (about 3 minutes) and to Sea World (about 10 minutes). My kids loved breakfast and the room was rather spacious with fridge, flat screen TV, coffemaker, double bathroom sinks, granite countertops and a sitting area. You really can't ask for more with a price of $69.99 per night. I would let someone going here know just a couple of minor details-The road going to the entrance to the hotel could use some spiffing up but no big deal. It would appear they have converted to a Condo timeshare judging by the corporate name-Meridian Condo Owners Assoc. and there was a very friendly man and upon arrival he wanted to give us our \" Welcome packet\". I have stayed at Caribe Cove-VERY NICE- and Vistana, and several other timeshare units and it is no big hassle, just tell them no thank you, as we did, and we were left alone. Finally the pool area is extremely simple, just one long square pool with some lounging chairs and tables..no bar or restaurant, but when you are at the parks all day it really did not matter to us. There are many restaurants within a short walking distance and anything you could possibly want within a 10 minute drive. Finally, one thing about the negative reviews...most of them appear to be when the hotel ran out of water for about 1 day at least 6 months ago.

We changed plans due to the storm and decided to extend our stay in Orlando for 3 days. I saw reviews on Galleria Palms, and decided to give the hotel a shot. We drove up to the location, who had recently changed from Meridian Palms, to a sign that had a name change covering the \"Meridian\" with \"Galleria.\" My husband looked at me, and rolled his eyes, telling me we'd found a real dive, and that so far he was not impressed. I was worried that my record of booking good hotels was ruined! I went into the hotel and checked in, and we warmly greeted by the front desk. She confirmed my information, and I was given our keys. We went to the room. and it was just as pictured. The whole hotel was extremely well lit, bright, and recently renovated. The double sinks in the bathroom were an extra bonus, and the Bath and Body Works toiletries were a nice touch. Breakfast in the morning was not your 'typical continental breakfast.' It featured Seattle's Best Coffees, Teas, assorted juices, milk, cereals, eggs, meats, fresh pastries, fresh fruits, breads, etc. The pastries were not typical hotel donuts, but fresh cakes and struesels. It was truly a well-maintained breakfast area that would satisfy picky eaters, and one that satisfied a 'foodie' such as myself. The housekeeping staff was truly the best, however. Our room was impeccably cleaned every day, better than I have ever seen by a housekeeping staff. They were observed pulling out fixtures and vacuuming under and around them, even when just refreshing rooms for guests staying there for longer terms. After we checked out, I noticed I'd forgotten my lap-top in the room. I was mortified, and contacted them that evening. I was told that housekeeping had gone home for the evening, but they took my name and phone number advising they'd find out the status of it in the morning, and also said I could call back in the morning. I called back in the morning first thing, and I was advised my lap-top was in the general manager's office. Since we were in Clearwater, we chose to drive there and pick it up. Crisis averted! I was delighted with their care of my valuable possessions and their great attitude. All in all, my experience with the hotel was fantastic. I'd highly recommend them for a great stay and great value.", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, FL", "Title": "\u201cSuprised and Amazed!\u201d", "Author": "swtgapch", "ReviewID": "UR18802806", "Content": "This was an awesome hotel.

It's been through several different owners and several different names, but we've always loved it. The last time we were there in February we were a little disappointed with breakfast. That was one of the perks of the hotel and one reason we kept coming back. As a Florida resident we can usually get a Disney value resort for the same price as your hotel, and with it being right on Disney property and being able to get free parking in Disney parks, usually the only thing that kept us coming to this hotel was breakfast. This last weekend the breakfast was just as bad as in February. I used to eat fruit, real fruit not from a can, nor rotten. Now it's peaches in a can or rotten oranges and bananas. There would be yoplait yogurt which was great and skim milk to drink. My daughter always had waffles, sausage patties and eggs. My hubby would have a bit of everything and my other daughter would have raisin bran cereal, a bagel, again not hard, and a donut, not old and stale. The other thing was that they now have timeshare property gurus in the lounge, we do not like that at all. It interrupted breakfast. When we checked in I was told to go over there to that desk and get a coloring book for my daughters, not only was there no coloring book and we had been lied to but then I was hounded about getting free nights for some timeshare junk. This makes the hotel unbecoming, if you want to sell timeshares that's their prerogative, but put the desk somewhere other then the lounge and don't lie to people to get them there. Next, I didn't have automatic checkout as usual, I disliked that. I got to the desk where a young lady was talking to family or friends on the phone. After waiting for 5 minutes an older lady came over, Asked me for my last name, I told her and said the first letter was B like boy. She said v like victor? I said no, b like boy, or banana. I waited two or so minutes, then she said v like victor? I said no ma'am, B like a-b-c- ; b like boy; b like banana; b, then spelled my name again. Then the girl got off the phone, came over pointed to the screen and finally I got a paper to sign, which I already signed when I checked in and the I got my copy and they said nothing to me, no questions about my stay, no thank you for staying with us, nothing. To me, this was just appalling. At this point I am not sure I am going to stay there anymore. I've always referred people to the hotel, in all I know at least a dozen have stayed there, but I will not be referring anyone anymore nor do I think I will be staying there. The rooms are clean, immaculately clean. They give you bath and body works toiletries. There is a micro and fridge in every room.

It was a good place to stay. The location is off the main drag, so it's quiet. The rooms are clean and well-appointed [I'm especially picky about carpets, and these were very clean] and the towels are restocked and the beds are remade every day. The breakfast buffet is stocked with milk, juices, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, various fruits [not very good selection], cold cereals and oatmeal packets, various pastries and muffins, breads, bagels and English muffins, and sometimes biscuits, hard-cooked eggs and sausage gravy. Perfectly adequate, and quite a money-saver. It opens daily at 6am. The only pool is outside the lobby, is quite small, and is not heated. Quite a shock after a hot day in the theme parks! The Lynx bus stop is almost directly in front of the hotel, and the #55 bus can get you to the WalMart Super Centre when travelling west, or you can cross the highway to the bus stop on the other side and catch the #55 going east. Ask for a transfer to the #56 bus which will take you to the Disney Transportation Centre where you can catch a Disney bus to any park. The cost of the Lynx is $1.25 per adult, and 85 cents for school-age children. It runs roughly every 30 minutes all day until about 9pm, and is much better than the shuttles provided by the Galleria, which have very poor time schedules. The restaurants in the neighbourhood of the Galleria are great. The Bob Evans is about 10 minutes walk east, on the same side of the highway. Excellent childrens menu. The IHOP directly in front of the hotel is also good.

We prepaid our reservation through Travelocity and received a great discounted rate. We were excited to stay at this hotel as it looked very nice on the website and it was a great location. We arrived on Saturday night around 8:30pm, tired from traveling all day. The hotel looked pretty full and the lobby was busy. We gave the manager at the front desk our name. He clicked around on the 'puter for a minute or so and then said that he did not have a reservation under that name. I thankfully had a copy of the confirmation from Travelocity so I pulled that out to show him that we were confirmed for a three day stay. At that point, he claimed that he never received the reservation from Travelocity, and that they have had this issue with Travelocity before. I asked if he had any rooms available that we could reserve and he said he had no vacancy, but that he could offer me a room at the hotel's \"sister\" property a couple miles away for the same rate, but we'd have to pay for it upfront and then negotiate with Travelocity to get our money back on our \"confimed\" reservation, since it was Travelocity's fault for not faxing them the reservation. Because we were very tired and just wanted a place to stay for one night before trying to figure out what to do for the next two nights, we went to check out the sister property which of course was not nearly as nice as the Galleria Palms. We checked out the room and then told the desk clerk that we might be back (if we couldn't find anything else.) The clerk pressured us to book a reservation right then, as the room may not be available later. (Funny because the hotel parking lot was nearly empty.) To make a very long story short, we knew something didn't seem right about the whole situation. We think that because we had prepaid through Travelocity at such a low rate (about $60 per night,) they had an opportunity to sell our room for more money and double booked our room, \"lost\" our less profitable reservation, and then conveniently blamed Travelocity for the mishap. And on top of all that, they wanted us to spend the same amount of money to reserve a room at their less than desirable \"sister\" property. No thanks! We ended up staying a few miles away at the Comfort Suites (clean and nice, by the way.) We called Travelocity and they agreed to refund our money and our refund was in our account by the time we returned from Orlando. Bottom line: Beware of the Galleria Palms.

Continental breakfast is fine-the usual fruits, waffles, bagels and coffee-with a nice seating area. It all went downhill, however, when the water lines broke and we were without water from 2pm until 8am the following day. As another traveler stated, management disappeared and left no instructions for the staff. We were repeatedly told, over the course of the evening, that the water would be back on in \"30 minutes\". The staff then tried to say several hotels were out of water that day, even though they had said earlier that a pipe had broken in their hotel . They did not offer anything to the guests-no bottled water, no restroom availability, nothing. They barely apologized for the incident, as they continued to insist it was no one's fault and *these things happen*. Sure, these things happen, but in the hospitality industry, one must go the extra mile to make sure that guests are happy and taken care of! The next morning, I called downstairs and politely said I would like a refund for the night we had no water.The front desk person told me that I was *the only person who had asked for a partial refund* and that there was nothing he could do-I would have to call the general manager on Monday. Funny when I went downstairs there were several other disgruntled guests asking for just the same thing. Someone finally insisted that the front desk call the general manager at home, and she authorized refunds over the phone for any guests who asked. As someone who had worked in the tourism/travel industry for many years, I was appalled at way guests were handled. A general manager who leaves her inexperienced staff to handle a MAJOR issue has no business being in charge. She should have come in that morning to help the staff deal with the situation, especially since the hotel has a policy (which we saw posted at the front desk) in which all refunds must go throug the general manager. Shame on her for leaving her staff hanging! And the put-upon attitude of the staff that people would *dare* ask for refunds for the night they had no water was not appreciated.

The free continental breakfast consisted of choice of two cereals, toast, bagels, mini-muffins, pastries, hard-bolied eggs, freezer-style waffles, fruit salad, milk, tea, coffee, orange/apple juice. The staff made every effort to keep supplies stocked but arriving late meant that some things were unavailable. The wireless internet was free and worked well (if you have your laptop w/you) but the sole computer in the lobby required a fixed fee of $5 + $1/printed page... a little excessive. Mapquest and other \"direction\" sites have you turning right after the hotel off of US192 onto but you can turn directly onto Maingate Lane from US192 just before the Tourist shop with the 30ft Mermaid just after Marker 6. The \"Maingate Lane\" street sign is hard to see but you can't miss the Mermaid on your right just after where you should turn. The hotel is about 500 metres ahead on your left... if you drive past the Radisson on your right, you've gone too far. There is a low-pressure time share office in the lobby which will get you discounted tickets if you want to waste a day being pitched a time share deal. The desk staff appeared indifferent but not unfriendly and the housekeeping staff were excellent. I managed to get a $70/night rate by calling directly to the hotel which was quite a bit better than the $89 rate I got from their website. Either way, I would definately stay there again... 5 minute drive to Disneys' Animal Kingdom and only 20 minutes (northeast on I-4) to Universal Studios.

Go until you see Houlihans (purple sign) on the left. Take the road between Houlihans and McDonalds to the hotel parking lot. Second thing to know is to book an even numbered room. These face the trees and not the road. Before we unpacked, we could tell the room was too small for 2 people and asked to be moved to a double. The front desk informed us that this was not possible since we booked through hotels.com. Twice during the week we asked for directions to Kennedy space center (60 miles away) and St Augustine (100 miles away). She offered to mapquest, but after getting burned by mapquest once already, we were hoping for some local knowledge. We told her not to bother. The previously mentioned Houlihans is a great place for happy hour. And the food is pretty good. It is great when you can walk home from a happy hour. The breakfast served at the hotel is as advertised. The housekeeper never knocked. Yet the room was made every day when we came back. The tolietries were from Body Works; nice!

The hotel is located on a side road where it is far enough off of US 192 so traffic noise is not an issue. #2 The staff was very friendly. Since this is a smaller property, the staff members recognize their guests. We were always welcomed back from the parks with a smile. #3 The rooms were perfect. When you look at their web site, that is exactly what you get. Our room had two queen pillow top beds with four pillows each and a large body pillow as well. A microwave, mini fridge, wet bar and coffe maker with an ample supply of Seattle's Best Coffee and tea. Black granite counter tops. And the feature I loved best: a 32\" flat screen HDTV! The bathroom had two sinks and the shower had a rainmaker shower head that also pulsated to relax your body after a long day of walking through the theme parks. A collection of high quality Bath and Body Works soaps, lotion, shampoo and conditioners. All of this made it hard to leave the room each morning. #4 The free deluxe continental breakfast. Very, very tasty. Every morning there was waffles, biscuits and gravy and hard boiled eggs too! Along with fresh bagels, breads, mini donuts, brownies (which were more like chocolate cake!), 3 different types of cold cereal, oatmeal, coffee, tea and three different types of fruit juices. This saved us lots of money. But if you prefer, there is an IHOP and Perkins restaurant within walking distance. Everything was very fresh and tasty. My blueberry muffin tasted fresh out of the oven. I am still amazed at how good this free breakfast was. I only suggest be there before 8am. The dining room is a bit small and seems to fill up quickly. To sum it all up: this hotel is perfect for individuals, couples and families up to 4 people.

We were very happy, especially considering the reasonable price. The reception looks a little tired but the room itself was fantastic (our room was on the top floor - great views!). The bed was huge and comfortable, the pillows less comfortable (they were firm and also quite high). We tried the buffet breakfast on the first day and didnt rate it (I cant eat sugary sweet things for breakfast) but there are so many great places to have breakfast nearby, it wasnt a problem. The hotel pool was lovely and not busy in the late afternoon/early evenings when it was nice to have a dip during the hot weather. The hotel is in a fantastic location in Kissimmee just outside the main tourist areas (just off the I4, a few minutes drive from junction 64) and its so easy to get anywhere from there. We hired a car immediately as it is the easiest and best way to get around, plus its cheap. You can literally be at the Disney parks in minutes plus you dont have to battle through the traffic of International Drive. Parking was never an issue at this hotel. The best part is that it is AWAY from International Drive which was always congested, noisy and generally a huge headache! I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Tip: DONT do the timeshare tours! They try to sell them to you in the reception area and they do offer good discounts for the parks, but they really put the \"hard sell\" on you, and although they say the tours are only 90 minutes, in reality, we were stuck in there for closer to three hours and missed an entire morning at the park. It wasn't worth it for the $60 we saved, and we ended up tired and stressed out.

There was also either a bowl of tinned fruit salad or chopped fresh melon and some whole fruit too. The staff were a bit slack in re-stocking food though.

Ours had a desk, fridge, microwave, and dresser you could hang shirts on. The king size bed was comfortable and the pillows were very comfy. My bedspread did get loose but it wasn't an issue for the most part. The AC works well mainly because the room is so small that it doesn't take long to cool it down. There is a flat screen TV, which is a very nice perk. That spoiled me a bit and I enjoyed watching TV before going to bed on the flat screen. There are quite a few channels to choose from as well. The bathroom is nice and the shower is a good size. The shower has plenty of room and the shower head has different settings as well. The shower gets steamy quick so you may want to open the door as soon you finish with your shower. I wish there was more lighting over the sink, it was hard for my wife to put on makeup with the lackluster lighting. I had a hard time putting on my contacts. I think the hotel should put up another light over the sink and that could easily be fixed. The walls are a little thin and I could hear people walking and talking in the halls. The lighting in the rest of the room is good once you find the light switches. SERVICE/LOCATION: Fast and easy. The hotel is in good shape. The location is right off 192 and the tollway. If you are leaving Disney you can take the tollway and then make a left at 192 and bypass the traffic on 192. This will get you back within 20 minutes from the park. The distance to the park isn't far but traffic can be heavy especially on the weekends. This makes the short trip to the park seem longer. The toll will cost 50\u00ad cents. They sell Disney tickets at the hotel too. The rooms were clean and housekeeping did a good job (I wish they had not forgot to replace the kleenex when it ran out, though). They have a shuttle to Disney but we didn't use it so I can't rate that experience. BREAKFAST: They have the standard items on their free breakfast (cofee, juice, milk, bagels, toast,oatmeal, & danishes). They also have a waffle heater and you can make your own waffles. They do a good job stocking it up. I will warn you that by 9:30am the waffles will run out and many items will be running low. The coffee is good, the bagels aren't very good, but the waffles are very good. It is busy in there and expect there to be a lot of people there. If you feel like some eggs and bacon, there is a McDonald's and Hoolihan's next door. Overall, it was a good experience and since we got a good deal for the room that made it even better. I would recommend this for people who are in a small group (1-2 people). We would go back to the hotel again next trip we take to Disneyworld.", "Date": "March 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cIt was nice!\u201d", "Author": "vacationersthere", "ReviewID": "UR7154942", "Content": "This is a nice hotel to stay on a budget.

The only disappointment I had was that the keyboard to the computer was supposedly broken. Then I ask two days later and they told me the whole computer system was taken away. This was very inconvenient for me being that I am taking online classes and I could not do any work for 4 days. I was told to go to the library and get online if I needed, but that would not work, because the library does not stay open that late. Other than that everything was fine with the hotel.

We ate dinner at Epcot and Universal but also had a chance to relax and catch our breath at a nice Italian Restaurant outside the park. (Get away from amusement park fare.)

We decided to ask in the Meridan what was up, and low and behold - this was the new hotel name, but we were never notified. Most of the staff was very helpful, but there was young gentleman who was there most of the time we passed by the desk, who wasn't very willing to be helpful. I brought my emailed confirmation which stated the rates that we booked it at, and an additional notation that we were entitled to a AAA discount upon arrival. We got there, and he informed me that we were not entitled to the AAA discount, it was discontinued under the new ownership. (Finally on our last day, there was a young lady at the desk who once I explained things to her, along with having my confirmation email, was very happy to give us the discount.) The elevator was a big problem area. My family and I did not mind walking the stairs - afterall, we were going to all the parks, lots of walking involved. However, we were there for 7 nights, and the elevators had an 'Out of Order' sign on them for about 4 days. We didn't mind, but there were several elderly people there during the beginning of our stay, and that may have been taxing for them. 4 days without the service was 3 days too many. On the days it was actually working, we noticed that there were always lines at the elevator. The breakfast was very disappointing. The fruit (apples and oranges) always looked bad; fruit salad looked like a bunch of canned fruits thrown in a bowl, a couple mornings there were cold waffles - but the breakfast consisted of muffins, bagels, toast, danish - it was just all starchy things, not much of a variety. Several of the people had mentioned the coffee all day, and the cookies that were put out. That is one of the discontinued things under the new management. The air conditioner was incredibly noisy, but we couldn't turn it off since it was 90+ degrees everyday. And, our room had a bizarre, odor to it. It wasn't a normal musty odor, it was that plus something else we just couldn't figure out. But, our room was clean. Beds were decently comfortable. I wish I could say I'd stay there again, but I probably wouldn't. I'm sure that the others who raved about it, may be a bit disappointed if they return.

I was able to get a hopper 5 day pass to Universal Studios & Island of Adventure for $78 on fleabay. So I decided to stay for the whole 5 days & get the most out of my vacation. Originally I was supposed to stay at the Comfort-Inn, at Int\u2019l Drive for $65 (mil/gov) discount but I cancelled when I booked here with lastminutetravel.com for $41.80. I pretty much know all the cheap & expensive motels/hotels in Kissimmee & Orlando & this is my first at this location. So the property is under new management/ownership & as of December of last year the renovations are supposed to be completed. So let\u2019s get started & see how this hotel ranks among the many flea-motels in Kissimmee. THE ROOM For the price that I got this shouldn\u2019t be any surprise about what to expect. At first I was kinda regretting the switch from the Comfort to Meridian but it was way worth it at the end. The rooms have been renovated with new carpet, furniture, bed & a 26\u201d lcd monitor. They have either a room with one king bed or one with 2 queens. The bathrooms were also re-done but the lack of good house keeping has already started to show the mildew & tear & wear from irregular maintenance. The rooms are really small & I mean small; perhaps the smallest I have ever stayed in so far. Everything is crammed in, from the desk to the ironing board. There\u2019s not much room to move around, my girl & I bumped to each other every morning trying to get ready for the parks. The room I stayed in was the executive unit which has a king size bed. I thought of going with the Family unit which isn\u2019t any bigger & it comes with 2 queens but the price was a big difference so I booked the executive unit. (yes I\u2019m cheap like that!!) THE BATHROOM You have a vanity & a shower (no bathtub) which I liked. There was plenty of water pressure & the towels were clean & soft. You might wanna ask for additional ones since they only give you two. The only thing that I found about the bathroom which I already have mentioned is the cleanliness around the shower. Perhaps since they only have one cleaning lady cleaning; well at least that I saw, the mildew is growing like crazy. In a few months the bathrooms are going to be in the same shape they were before renovations. LOCATION This location is for folks that want to go to Disney Theme Parks since it is very West in 192 & I mean West. Anymore West & you\u2019ll end up in 27 (Okeechobee). The good thing of being so out West is that the hotel is very quiet. Not much action anywhere for the exception of the parking for the Hoolihans which is right in front of this hotel. If you don\u2019t have a car then you\u2019re SOL. They do offer a complementary shuttle to all parks but you\u2019re on their time & terms. They pick you up early & bring you late. There\u2019s no in between hours for those the want to sleep in a little. So once you\u2019re in the park you\u2019re pretty much stuck there for the duration. No calling for early pickup or special hours if you wish to change & head out again. So for the native if you have a car you should be fine, for the non-native well rent one if you have the budget. If you\u2019re going to anywhere else other than Disney then you\u2019ll be doing some driving. Overall I was not disappointed with the Meridian. If you could get a good price on the rooms then stay here. The staff was nice & they answer all my questions.

Got a new room. It is small, very small, with just a shower no bath. All the furniture and carpeting and bathroom fixtures were new as was the bed, drapes, and bedding. My husband bought me a memory foam mattress at home and I thought this bed was just as comfortable or even more so. When I checked in, I ask for the last room to be renovated. She gave me the 3rd floor end which she said were the last ones to be fixed-up. It has a convection oven (which I didn't use because I had never used one before and I didn't know how.)It was brand new too. As well as a plasma TV on the wall. All the stuff in the breakfast room was new too. It did have canned fruit and also a make your own waffle machine. They had two women working the breakfast room and they keep everything well supplied. When I first arrived, I had second thoughts because I am so picky. The hallways and the elevator hasn't been renovated yet and that worried me so I asked to see a room first. I was impressed with the room. I also had problems with the toliet. Ours keep running every 10-15 minutes. It kept waking me up the first night. So, we kept the fan on and shut the door the rest of the nights. I did report it but no one fixed it. The bath room did have a state of the art shower head. I travel a lot and I haven't seen one like that before. They are selling the rooms as condos. I thought that was real strange. They are so small. But the girl on the front desk said a person could either keep the rooms for themselves or rent it out for income. I am still real confused about that. I don't know how someone could make a profit with those rooms and pay for all the help involved.

I'm a cheapskate, though, and this place SOUNDED perfect: we need (ha!) high speed internet, preferably wireless. I wanted a room with a microwave and a fridge, and my husband wanted a place with free breakfast. I liked the location a lot, and it was cheap - $65 a night for the 'executive' suites, or $75 for the family suites. Executives come with a king bed, and Families get two queens. The hotel swore up and down that they had been totally renovated, just completed, and was now a collection of \"Luxury Suites.\" We are easy to please - give us a clean room, a clean bathroom, and basic security, and we're going to be alright - so I booked the room. We checked in sort of late on Wednesday - about 10:00. The woman at the front desk was tired but friendly, and got us checked in right away. We were given a room on the second floor right next to the stairs and a big security door (which didn't actually need a room key to open.) We were concerned that the heavy door would be opening and closing all night, but apparently people are lazy and take the elevator down the hall when they came in, because we only heard it a handful of times. The room was small, but well appointed - a large king bed, a granite topped desk and a matching nightstand, 'Refreshment Center,' and wardrobe closet thingie with drawers and hangers, as well as a nice coffeemaker, small convection oven, and fridge. The TV was indeed a flatscreen - the thing was huge! I think my husband wants one now =) The bathroom area was nice, very clean, and I LOVED the shower enclosure. All the free soaps and stuff are from bath and body works, and we never got the same stuff twice - cool stuff, too. While we never even used the (very cool) convection oven, and only barely used the fridge, I was glad to have them. The internet was only wireless in the lobby - we had to use a plug in unit, which meant only one of us could use the internet at a time, which was a hassle but not a huge problem. I'd probably rate this hotel a 3.5 star, but I'm calling it a 4 instead of 3 as my rating because of the included amenities.

The location of the hotel was spot on, and seemed to be used mainly by business people on short stay. We had clean towells daily, and bedding every 3 days.

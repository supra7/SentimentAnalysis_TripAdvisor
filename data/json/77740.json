HoJo's the last weekend in January, 2012 to attend the LA Fitness Expo. Was travelling alone so just needed an inexpensive place to rest my head. I was pleasantly surprised. True, the place was a bit shopworn, but my room was clean and included a fridge, working TV, ironing board and iron, hair dryer, coffee maker with supplies. Everything worked, no problems. The continental breakfast included coffee, donuts, cereal and milk, danish, bagels & cream cheese, bread , butter and jellies, assorted juices and a toaster...What more could you want? I don't understand the comments about the free continental breakfast. It was much more inclusive than most. The parking was indoors just adjacent to the hotel (no need to walk outside). The young lady that checked me in was most helpful and there was plenty of ice in the hall ice maker. No problems with my bed or anything else. I live in Las Vegas where for the price of my room ($74.00) you can stay at a luxury resort during most of the year, but for Los Angeles, this place is a steal. Close to the Convention Center and a zillion Korean restaurants to explore. Also a short ride to Lafayette Park for some R&R.

The room and the fittings were old, but nothing was at breaking point or dirty. The housekeeping ladies cleaned my room daily, changed the bedding, vacuumed, dusted, pretty much everything you could ask for! My flight back to the UK left around 5 pm, and so I had plenty of time between handing back my roomkey at 12, and having to be at the airport around 3. While handing back my roomkey, the man at the reception (can't believe I didn't find out his name!) called the houseleeper and asked if I could keep the room until 2 without any extra charge. This the housekeeper agreed to, and I got to stay in the comfy room until my flight, rather than having to sit in the lobby or go out wandering by myself.

I chose this hotel because it looked decent (All that I was expecting was decent), however this hotel was by FAR the worst hotel I have ever stayed at! When booking the hotel my only expectations were that it would be clean- that was it. This hotel however was by far the dirtiest, and most ruined hotel I have ever seen- I would not think they would use this as a homeless shelter let alone let people stay here and pay for it! To keep this short, I will just list some of the things that were wrong with this nasty hotel: FIRST and foremost was the bathtub- it was so old and clearly never cleaned that it had turned yellow mixed with black- it clearly needed replacing. Me and my friend were disgusted to even step into it- we had to put a towel down when taking a shower and once we were down the towel had turned a brownish color. It had also been obvious that the shower rod had been replaced after failing (or most likely reused in a different spot, because they didn't even bother to patch off and paint over the huge holes it help after assumingly falling down. Secondly, the top of the TV cabinet had NEVER (seriously!) been dusted, the dust on top of it was permanently stuck there and would have to be scrubbed in order to get it off. Thirdly, the bed sheets smelled like sweat- when we got to our floor the first thing we noticed was that alot of people doors were open the entire time, and there would be \"ladies of the night\" coming in and out all the time. Fourth- the bathroom sink was outside in the bedroom (alright, no big deal) however there was paint chipping from the sink which had clearly been painted with regular paint as opposed to actual sink paint. Not only that, but there was a HUGE rust hole in the sink that you noticed when looking into the mirror, it was very gross. Fourth- the old tube style TV we had in the room did not turn off, we were able to turn the screen off by turning off the receiver but the TV never actually turned off, so we had to listen to the buzzing noise from the TV all night. Fifth, all the walls were REALLY dirty, cracked, and had paint chipping everywhere, especially the bathroom. When we first got to the hotel our toilet paper was all blue after being soiled with what I am assuming was toilet cleaner. One morning, my friend stepped on something in the hotel lobby that injured her foot ( she was wearing sandals), and the hotel didn't even have a bandaid to provide her with. Also, I would never even think of making coffee in the coffee maker, it was so dirty and had coffee burned into the warmer, very gross. Overall, all I can say is that I wasn't expecting much, no frills and a clean room, but this was just ridiculous! I would NEVER recommend this hotel for ANYONE, and I am EXTREMELY serious about this place being a dump. Please DO NOT stay here, I really am the type of person who doesn't need frills or anything but this was disgusting.

The carpet was stained and had a few rips in it. The ceiling had water stains. The television would not turn on. The Wi-Fi was hit-or-miss. Worse yet, the bathroom was virging of filthy. The shower curtain was hanging on to only a couple of rings, having been torn off of most all of them, and the shower curtain rod was threatening to fall off of the wall. The toilet wasn't well-installed into the floor and had a slight wobble to it and the toilet seat had way too much play in it.

You are in a good central location to do all the parks from Knotts Berry Farm and Disney to Six Flags Magic Mountain. The parking is free and a security guard is usually present so we had no worries with the hire car. The rooms are spacious, have a mini fridge, air conditioning and heat if needed. The bath rooms really have seen better days but are clean and we found the water pressure to be so great that it was like having a power shower, although the showers were fitted for short people, not so good for my hubby who is 6\u20196. LOL There is also a coffee maker and the supply of coffee, tea and sugar is topped up daily. Bedding is always washed and daily maid service very good. You also get a good sized TV with many channels. The breakfast is fine as long as there are not too many people already in the breakfast room, not many seats mean you could end up having to take your breakfast back to your room. Getting up early is advised! The breakfast consists of tea, coffee, juice, water for your drinks. To eat is white and brown bread, cream cheese, jams, butter, croissants, donuts, mini muffins, yogurts and fruit. There are two toasters and a microwave that you need to time with your watch as the timer is broken and any food you bring will explode if you forget the watch. \uf04a There is a TV in the breakfast room and free papers just outside. A washer and dryer on the 3rd floor which takes 25 cent coins, a dollar for each wash or dry\u2026very handy!

We provided our drivers liscense, credit card, names of employee, proof of payment, and signature to make reservations. When the two employees got to the hotel that night they were told that no reservations had been made. Even with paperwork in hand, our employees were told they did not have a reservation. Interesting how they recieved all our vulnerable personal data...and we did not receive a room in return. When I called to let them know that we had lost close to $600.00 dollars in lost wages, time, and transportation expenses at their mistake, they said they never input the reservation and wanted to offer a 15% discount on a nights visit in the future. That totals $19.00. That's customer service for you.

I rented two rooms for myself and my accompanying staff and both rooms were supposed to be nonsmoking, but smelled of stale tobacco or mold.

Because of the delay of finding alternate accommodations and being in our continuing education course we checked out about one hour late, were dinged for 50% penalty!

So the chain didnt work. That was the worst part because we werent staying in the best part of town. So we asked for a new room. When we went to the next floor up to our new room i noticed that all the doors said non smoking on them. That was a good sign. When we opened the door the room was gross. It hadnt been cleaned yet and it was 5 in the afternoon. Also there were more ashes on the desk. But I do have to say that after the room had been cleaned this room was so much better. I was disappointed to go up to the whirlpool and find it empty. Its was the cleanest room i had seen so far. Next the whirlpool was the sauna. It was a little to scary for me.

Sadly, it all fell apart on the first night. I couldn't find the hotel and phoned them up, only to find they had no idea where the Metro station was and couldn't guide me. The Wi-Fi wouldn't work - I phoned them up and was told \"Yeah, sometimes it doesn't work,\" and when some of the lights didn't work properly and the taps constantly dripped, well, I wasn't entirely happy. Plus the hotel managed to lose one of my parcels -after they signed for it- meaning presumably Mr Lee is now wandering around showing off a Homestar Runner t-shirt - good for him. He won't see my business again. If you're literally after a room and don't need to deal with the hotel staff AT ALL, you should be OK. The rooms have pretty good cable (including FX, Shield fans) but the staff are terrible and really bring the place down. Also worth noting was the fact the \"Best Western\" part of the big sign outside the hotel was painted out - very telling. Comedy moment?

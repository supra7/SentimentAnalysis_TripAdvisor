It's also minutes from the airport, yet does not have that \"airport hotel\" feel. Staff is friendly. Cons: Pricey compared to nearby airport hotels (we paid $200/night). Rooms are small. Indoor pool is nice, but loaded with chlorine (atrium smells like a hot tub). Our daughters' eyes were burning after their swim. Concierge level cocktail hour is just a cash bar on the 8th floor. Food and drinks are not included in the upgrade. Now for the warnings: Do not trust anything the Marriott reservation agent tells you. I made our reservation by calling the hotel directly and being transferred to Marriott's main reservation center. I normally book online, but wanted to know why the rate was so much higher than the last time we stayed at this property. I was told it was because of the holidays (our stay was Jan. 3) and because the hotel was almost completely booked. I was told there were only a few rooms left and I should book immediately. When I told her I am a Marriott Rewards member, the agent very nicely offered to upgrade us to concierge level and she said she'd put us in a corner room since they're larger. Great! But when we arrived, none of that happened. The desk clerk didn't even have any notes in our reservation about that. We asked if the hotel was booked and he said \"no\" and that it was practically empty!! The reservation agent lied. We asked if he would honor our promise of concierge level and he said he would. We got to our room on the 7th floor, only to find the concierge level is on the 8th floor! The desk clerk lied to our faces. We were not in a corner room and despite the hotel's near emptiness, we were put in a room next to a family with an infant that cried much of the night. We don't chalk this one up to a horrible experience.

Here is a tip - never stay in a North American hotel on a Saturday night if you can avoid it. There's a ninety percent chance there will be a stag party, a hen party, a wedding party or a sports team staying somewhere in the hotel. There's a good chance somebody will be running the halls, shrieking, at 3 in the morning. Kudos to Marriot. We were on the fifth floor and it was quiet as a mouse all night.

What we like - and still liked this year after several years' break - is that although it's a big chain hotel, at an airport, it has a much smaller feel to it than most such hotels. When you enter the Reception area, the style is reminiscent of some of those lodge hotels you find in national parks - all stone and wooden beams - and on a more modest scale than many large hotels. The staff seem helpful and friendly, and the rooms comfortable and well-equipped as you would expect. The rooms are built around a large closed atrium in which there's a pool. We've never tried the pool but we like the fact that it's there. It does mean that about half the rooms face inwards onto this area; we've always had rooms facing outwards, which I think may be better. The restaurant also is not bad for a chain hotel - we've eaten there several times in the past so did so again this time, and again were very happy with it. The restaurant doesn't seem very large but there was no problem getting a table, either for the evening or next morning for breakfast. Breakfast is good - but you have to make a choice between the extensive buffet (including freshly made omelets etc) or a la carte. Both were fine but you can't mix and match the two options, which made the choice harder as some things were only available on one and not the other, and vice versa. You have to pay to park at the hotel - I can't remember how much but it all adds the cost. As there's a Hertz rental office in the hotel, I suppose a good option might be to take the hotel shuttle from the airport, then pick up one's rental car from there the next morning - saving on a day's rental, and the cost of parking. It's just a thought. So - overall - this hotel is perfect for a night after arriving from afar.

The reunion was all I had hoped it would be and more. Plus, we discovered a perfectly lovely hotel! Our beautiful room was exceptionally comfortable - and the indulgent bath amenities were the most fragrant and luxurious I've experienced in a product provided by a hotel. (Even the shuttle driver was well aware of the popularity of the product line and supplied me with ordering info as he delivered us to the light rail stop for a zip into Seattle.) The lobby decor here feels slightly rustic, with post and beam construction, but with an elegant, modern edge. The rooms are modern and good sized with large windows and lavish bedding. There is a nice pool in an atrium and the soaring ceilings and rock fireplace are reminiscent of a contemporary mountain lodge.

A couple that we were traveling with had a room on a lower floor, and could smell the chlorine a bit. Still, this is one of the highlights of the property from an 8-year-old's perspective. The restaurant was a touch pricey, but the breakfast buffet for the kids was reasonable, and kept them going for most of the day. Adults may want to stick to picking something from the menu.

I expected just a bit of convienence but instead found a wonderful welcome to Seattle in an unexpectedly luxurious setting. The hotel itself was lovely, evoking a sense of Northwest charm. The lobby was comfortable and inviting, with a bar that overlooked the garden style pool/atrium. I enjoyed a delicious jumbo shrimp cocktail with a generous glass of wine. It was a wonderful way to relax after a very long day of travel, especially knowing that my room was just steps away. The location was as convienient as can be - minutes from the airport with shuttles running at frequent intervals. (I know this for a fact since I used the shuttle several times, having forgotten something at the hotel and using the shuttle to pick it up before I flew out of town). The staff - the front desk, the shuttle drivers. the bartender, the waiters at breakfast, the store clerk - all of them were wonderful - friendly, professional and helpful. (One desk clerk seemed to be having a bit of a bad day when I returned to pick up my forgotten item, but I, too, was feeling a bit rushed and inpatient - still, it was nothing that detracted from the overall experience). Perhaps tellingly, there seemed to be quite a few flight crews staying at the hotel. In my experience, I haven't found too many airport hotels that would be worth the visit besides the convienence - the SeaTac Marriott is an exception. It's a nice hotel, airport or not!

When I arrived by myself with my two children the woman at the desk checking me looked at my two kids and then at me (who were, by the way, perfectly behaved but a little tired) and said I had been \"upgraded\" to a room on the 3rd floor. I said, No, I paid for a reserved a room that was poolside. She again insisted I had been \"upgraded\" (how getting moved to a far away room with one bed for the 3 of us is an upgrade, I just don't understand) and no poolside rooms were available. I said that at least one was available 6 hours ago when I called and PAID for it. This went around for a bit until she obviously realized I wasn't stupid enough to believe it was an \"upgrade\" nor would I be budging until we had our POOLSIDE room (which is the SOLE reason I chose to stay there). I did not appreciate the change in room nor the way it seemed as if it was done when she sized me up as being a mom traveling alone. That was my distinct impression. Fairly annoying and I hate my kids to see me treated like that. When we walked away, my older son remarked, \"Obviously she didn't get the memo to NOT MESS WITH MY MOM.\" That pretty much sums up how the front desk experience unfolded. I was NOT pleased but remained polite, but firm. It should have never happened, though. Despite that, the room was clean. Small but comfortable. Bed bug check was clean. No sign of them and no bites overnight (I always check). The pool was great as always. The only reason I gave service 3 stars was because of the cook at the breakfast buffet. He was awesome! Not only did he gladly serve my kids their somewhat different tastes and didn't make them feel different for it, he knew we were headed to an event and helped us out with a better way to get there and some other things to do in the area. He even went and checked on parking for us and got us a great map and pointed things out to us. Parking is ridiculously expensive. I recommend this hotel because the poor service seemed to be isolated to the front desk (and maybe even that particular woman---I am not sure). I may stay there again but I don't enjoy being hassled and treated like a second class citizen after driving 4 hours so maybe not. Also, the parking charge is outrageous and adds quite a percentage to the bill if you figure it into the room cost. Total ripoff.

Then we got packed and went down to the Aqua Terra restaurant and had their \"Good Start\" breakfast buffet. You got coffee or tea, juice, fresh fruit, danish & pastries, eggs done anyway you requested, sausage, bacon, hash browned potatoes and pancakes. Everything was fresh & hot and our waiter would refill our coffee and juice. The cost was $13.95 plus TX and gratuity. We were really glad we did the buffet, because our trip from the hotel to the airport to catch our bus ride from Seattle to Vancouver was long (approximately 4 hours from hotel to the cruise ship) with no stops to eat.

(Note - another reviewer said there were only five floors; this is true in parts of the hotel, but there is an annex with 9 floors that is separate from the main courtyard area.) I ordered room service for dinner (the crab sandwich and a salad). The food was delivered promptly and was quite tasty. The room itself was small, as many airport hotels are since space is usually at a premium. The bathroom was particularly tiny. However, the bed was quite comfortable, and there was plenty of work space. There are also robes in the closet. The workout room was spectacular - one of the nicest anywhere. There were numerous ellipticals, treadmills, and bikes, all with personal TVs and headphones provided. There were also several weight machines. Fresh fruit was provided along with a refrigerator that offered cool towels. There were plenty of sanitizing wipes, cups, water, everything for an enjoyable workout. The pool area is quite lovely and peaceful. There are plenty of tables and chairs scattered around. Of course, I had to take photos of the huge totem pole. Very cute! The small gift shop has prepared items for a quick breakfast. I grabbed a fruit cup and a bagel and cream cheese and it was quite reasonable and fresh.

To complain about this, is like to complain about McDonald's charging for fries and a coke with a burger. If you don't like it, stay in a non-business class hotel.

The reason Fairfield doesn't charge is because they are an economy hotel geared more toward thrifty travelers. So I have no complaints about the charges for extras because I expected it. I got this room on a Thursday and Friday for 129 which was a good value in my opinion. This is especially true considering I went to the flight museum and to Alki beach one of those days.

The first stay was not the best, but the subsequent ones got better, and they have obviously taken some of the notes on the comment cards seriously. The hotel is located near SeaTac with a frequent shuttle. There is a tower, 8-9 floors high, and an atrium area that is about 3-4 floors high. Note, the tower rooms really have no view although some are advertised as having Mt. Rainier views. (Maybe before the trees grew!) Regardless of where you are, in the tower youwill be looking at the roof/ventilation or the roof/associate entrance. Avoid rooms ending in X16 and X18 as these are a bit noisy when the trucks show up. Odd numbered tower rooms will be a little noisy from the AC but frankly it wasn't as bad! The bathrooms are small, and double double rooms are a little crowded. King rooms seem bigger and have a chair and ottoman. All have been redone very recently but don't have the big flat screen TVs. The desk is pretty roomy and there is a cabinet and 2 small drawers...not the greatest storage. Rooms in the atrium area are noisier for some reason. Aside from the noise from the pool (and functions if there are any being held near the pool), it seems that the walls are thinner....last time, I actually thought someone left a cellphone in my room it was ringing so loudly. Food in the hotel is good-could be better. It is a bit pricy. The restaurant is due to be redone 1st quarter 2008. Desserts however, were tasty, and since I had some issues with my meals, they were free! Try the chocolate cake, it is VERY good! The lobby/bar are nice but the music is a lot too loud! One of the songs played has some sort of random spoken sounds...very disconcerting! Internet is part of the $9.95 wired for business package so if you don;t make calls, it's too expensive. I don't know when Marriott will get it through their brains...STOP CHARGING FOR INTERNET! There is a business center with 2 computers and an ethernet cable that you can use for free. Also, you can get free use of internet in the concierge lounge. There are only a couple other dining choices in walking distance (Dennys and 13 coins-which I think is also too expensive.) Other than that, and restaurants in other hotels, you need a car or a cab. Self parking is $16 per day, valet is $22-very high, but it's the norm for cities! Be careful in the shower...tubs can get slippery (I fell). I was able to get a rubber mat, but I also informed the GM and several other people of the situation, and that housekeeping needs to rinse carefully. The hotel is very clean. I even noticed a housekeeper vacuuming the rock wall outside of the restaurant. The staff was friendly, remembering me by name, and by my luggage-which seems to go someplace else when I come to Seattle! Seems that this is also a popular hotel with cruisers as there were a large number of folks heading off to Alaska on Vision of the Seas...maybe this is a Royal Caribbean pre-cruise hotel. Some people hate the pacific northwest design of the hotel-the lobby looks like a lodge. Frankly, I think it is appropriate for the area. There are plenty of places inthe area, but all in all this hotel is nice for flyers or anyone needing to be out inthe SeaTac area. It's about 30-45 minutes to downtown and you can hop on a bus at the airport (I also think there is a stop at the end of the hill) or drive.

The hotel was almost fully booked when I made my reservation and I was not guaranteed the non-smoking king that I prefer.

Each of the lamps was bright and all had electrical outlets in the base to accommodate cell phone chargers, etc. The bathroom is also completely new, floor to ceiling. The countertop is granite and the sink was large and deep. The showerhead was about eight inches in diameter which delivered a lot of water without being too strong. Lighting in the bathroom was good. The main lights turn off by themselves and a night light comes on automatically. I think the difference in the room being accessible is that it was a little larger than a standard room and did not have a closet door. The bathroom door was large and the vanity did not have any shelves under it so that someone in a wheel chair could easily use the sink. The combination tub and shower had hand rails and there was a shower chair in the bathroom. I had access to the concierge lounge on the 8th floor. It had also been complete renovated.

I was not able to enjoy the hors d'oeuvre ether evening, but did take advantage of the cookies and milk one evening. Parking at the hotel is $14.00 per night and internet access $9.95. The Amex rate for this stay was $189 per night which was comparable to other hotels in the area. Taxes add about 12.5% to just about everything. The hotel has a fairly complete gift shop which was handy because I did not bring any liquids in my carry-on luggage. I was able to buy a small toothpaste and deodorant and I like the new Marriott shampoo and conditioner in the room. I have stayed at the Marriott Sea-Tac Airport hotel quite a few times. I have always liked the service and atmosphere of the hotel. The renovations have made the rooms beautiful and very comfortable. The location is great and the service is excellent. I can recommend this hotel highly.", "Date": "August 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHit or miss\u201d", "Author": "rcmjr", "ReviewID": "UR5492273", "Content": "Stayed here on 2 separate occasions recently.

When we arrived at the Sea-Tac airport, we called for the free hotel shuttle and it arrived about 15 minutes later (we were told 20 minutes so it was early). Driver was very friendly. It was only a 10 minute trip from the airport to the Courtyard. Check-in was fast. Only problem was I thought we could get a free shuttle to the cruise ship but it was too far. But the desk staff did arrange a Town Car service to pick us up next morning. We were guaranteed a non-smoking room and got one. No smell of smoke at all. Room was large with 2 queen beds with down quilts, an overstuffed chair, desk and chair, vanity mirror and bureau with t.v. on it. Very clean. Bathroom was 2-part with toilet and tub/shower in one large room, with the sink and mirror in a separate area outside. Made it convenient. Dinner at Charley's restaurant in the hotel was good and reasonably priced--Western burger with fries and Patty Melt with fries each under $8.95. Breakfast buffet was good too with bread, bagels, omelet bar, fruit, hot and cold cereal, yogurt. We were very pleased with the hotel--especially the cleanliness--and would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "July 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver Island, BC", "Title": "\u201cPretty impressed\u201d", "Author": "madge62", "ReviewID": "UR5332865", "Content": "Stayed one night here after dropping off our daughter at SeaTac.

Despite being a Platinum member of Marriott Rewards (100+ per year) I was not upgraded to the concierge level. This is my 5th time this year to this hotel and previously disappointed. I was told by Janet Burruss, Rooms Operatons Manager \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Concierge rooms are available for sale to the general public, but as a Platinum member you get first priority when there are upgrades available, but we are not able to guarantee a complimentary upgrade, as sometimes a particular room type may be sold out. Reward members get second dibs on left overs. (Where's your customer loyalty over the almighty dollar?) Room was small, carpet worn out and had ripples. My room overlooked the loading dock and the room was extremely noisy. Had a shower head that had a super saver head. It took a while to get the shampoo out of my hair. The furniture was old and damaged. One of the phones did not work and the toilet ran intermittently all night. It was all reported the first night and a maintenance man did attempt to repair, but with no results. I attempted to change rooms, but was told the hotel was sold out and no other rooms were available. I left and went to the Hilton about 2 blocks away. (HILTON HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ----------) The front desk folks were young and inexperienced. They didn't care I was checking out due to problems and they made no attempt to make the situation right. The parking was OK. A little expensive at 12.00 per day when other hotels in the immediate area are free. The food in the restaurant was good and moderately priced. The bed was outstanding, but the other problems forced me out. I have put this hotel off limits for my employees and have made Hilton SeaTac our Hotel of Choice for the Seattle Airport location.", "Date": "October 12, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Marriott Seattle Sea-Tac Airport", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d100610-Reviews-Marriott_Seattle_Sea_Tac_Airport-Seattle_Washington.html", "Price": "$156 - $259*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3201 S 176th Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Seattle</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">WA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">98188</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "100610", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/0d/d1/0dd1ae3427d1bb2f4d6415db852f3a415large.jpg"}}

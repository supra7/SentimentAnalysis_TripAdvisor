Stay FAR away. I stayed here with some friends over a weekend and all I can say is stay FAR, FAR away. The towels probably had been washed, but they were so dingy and stained that it was hard to tell. The staff was rude, the floors were dirty and there was a room service tray that sat out in the hall for 48 hours (it was still there when we checked out). In addition, our friends in another room had people partying in the room next door until 6AM and the hotel staff did virtually nothing to quiet them down. For the same price, there are much better options downtown. Frankly, I'd sooner sleep in a cardboard box.Big Sandy", "Date": "Mar 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR346346607", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Pleasantly surprised I was in Phoenix in March 2005 for a convention and found nearly all the downtown hotels were booked by the time I made my reservation.

The room was dirty -- not filled with trash, just a ratty rug, ratty draperies, etc. On my first afternoon I took a shower and upon exiting the tub I noticed palmetto bugs - a half dozen of them - around the bathroom window... after 15 minutes of shooing them out the window and dropping them down the toilet, i checked the rest of the room to find that there were two dead buds on the rug... The hotel responded poorly... no credit was given to me (although promised by the desk manager who i spoke with)... there was no continental breakfast and the cost of breakfast was laughable ($5 for 3 stips of bacon)... i wouldnt wish this place on my worst enemy", "Date": "Mar 17, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR998045777", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "sox1fan"}, {"Content": "Hidden Little Treasure. . . . We recently stayed at this property for a convention; Don't let the facade scare you away. The staff was wonderful, along with the accommodations from check-in to check-out. Though the hotel is tucked away from the main strip and hard to find, it is a gem in the desert. The hotel has an old Las Vegas feel to it (the Lobby is decorated with Marilyn Monroe photos, apparently she stayed there while filming her movie; Bus Stop). For a small hotel, it is nothing fancy, but the charm and the nicety of the staff makes it all up for it. Rooms are located in a courtyard with a pool with towering palm trees.

After a long day, I pulled the sheets down, hopped into bed, and settled my head into the stink of a previous visitor's cheap perfume. I almost vomited, and spent one hour in the shower trying to scrub it off. I switched to the other bed, and used my t-shirts as pillow cases. When I told the attendent at the front desk of the problem the next morning I got, 'That's interesting, another guest complained of a yellow stain on their pillow just the other day. They really need to do something about housekeeping. Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do about it here. That's a housekeeping problem.'Rather than try to explain to the attendent the merits of caring about other functions of the hotel other than the those within arms reach, I left as soon as possible.What a disgusting, miserable place to spend the night.", "Date": "Jan 14, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR377589658", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d74687-r19529938-Ramada_Inn_Phoenix_Downtown-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "HotelID": "74687", "Price": "$156"}}

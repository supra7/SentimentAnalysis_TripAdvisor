We were pleasantly surprised at the warm, welcoming attitude of the staff, as well as the large clean suite we stayed in for the week. We were in a two-bedroom suite and it was quite spacious. It also had a refrigerator and microwave without any additional charge, which other hotels in Branson are famous for charging from $10 to $20 per day for these items to be added to your room. I'm always worried about the level of cleanliness of the room, and I was very happy with the suite. It was very clean and smelled clean. The first night we had trouble with one of the thermostats in the front bedroom. The staff member at the front desk left her post and immediately came to our room to assist us with getting the room to the temperature we wanted, and she couldn't do enough to accommodate us. She even called when she got back downstairs to check on us and see if we needed anything further. I highly recommend this location. My two words of caution involve computer usage and parking. If you are a business professional who needs to use a computer at this location, there is one in the lobby, but you must stand to use it - so beware. I was able to get a good signal from my room, so I didn't have to use their computer. Also, a couple of the nights that we were there, the hotel was sold out and the parking was tough. There were places to park, but it was quite a walk if you came in late at night. Other than those two items, everything was fantastic. This hotel also offers a free breakfast with the room, so that was definitely an added value. If you are someone traveling that wants a friendly, clean place to stay that is also very quiet - this is it. Addtionally, for safety features, it has interior corridors which I consider much safer than the multitude of hotels in the Branson area with exterior corridors. My standards are very high when traveling, and I can recommend this hotel as a cut above in the Branson area where many of the hotels are older and not as clean as they should be.

We were in Branson for a family reunion and wanted a place that would not be overly expensive, but still provide an acceptable level of comfort. First the hotel itself........We were absolutely delighted with our stay. At check in we were greeted with smiles. Any time we had questions, the staff was there to help with suggestions, maps etc. Our room was exceptionally clean. The maid service repsected our privacy and we never felt as though we had to clear out of our room by a certain time so they could clean it. Amenities were plentiful and furniture, carpeting, quilts etc were in superb shape and top notch. The breakfast was what one would expect from a facility such as this...... eggs, sausage, waffles, biscuits and gravy, donuts, bagels, cereal, juice and coffee. All in all good food and the bins were always full. The breakfast room itself was a bit small and at times finding a seat became a bit difficult but many folks simply chose to take their food back to their rooms and no one from the hotel objected. And if you were a bit patient, a seat always seemed to open up. There was a gift store off the lobby and it was convenient for some of those small needs as well as several souvenirs. NOW.... a word to the wise about the \"Choice Priveleges\" program. As with any program such as this, make sure you read the fine print and understand all the rules and regulations. We jumped on board because of their advertisement that said \"Stay two nights....get one free.\" With more than twn different name hotels from which to choose, we thought this would be a snap on our two week vacation. Well.......not quite! You see, you gain points for the nights you stay in one of their hotels. You then redeem those points for your free stay. If you want to use your points after two nights for a stay in \"East Overshoe\", you might be able to, However if you want to use your points for someplace worthwhile, you will either need 4-6 nights to accumulate the points necessary for the one free night, or wait until the \"dead season\" to use them. Choice will tell you they explain all that, but in reality, they don't mention it nearly as often as they say \"Stay two nights, get one free.\" And of course that promotion ends in early August (when the real busy tourist season is over). Just be careful. We booked this hotel on it's merit. That was a wise choice!! It is affordable and very nice in every respect.....including the price. It is a wonderful hotel at a great price in a very popular town. Just don't book it to get a free night.....unless you are going to stay in several different Choice Hotels for the next week or so. We've stayed 6 nights in a Choice Hotel and STILL don't have enough points to stay in a hotel in any tourist area in Wyoming, Missouri, Montana or South Dakota. But try the Comfort Inn at Thousand Hills. Consider what you get for what you pay......you will be pleased!", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "smilesunshine57", "ReviewID": "UR115550583", "Content": "We stayed for a week and this hotel was the best.

We are avid trip advisor users and try to post whenever we travel......hey we take away a lot from TA reviews..might as well contribute once and a while! :) Last December, we previously researched and stayed at another Myer Hotel property in Branson (Best Western Music Capital inn). The reviews on that property were amazing and we were sooooo happy - the service, quality and cleanliness were SUPERB! So when we decided to return for a quick overnight trip to Silver Dollar City, we were disappointed that they were sold out. After a little research, we chose this Myer hotel property (there are six Myer owned and operated hotels in the area). Like its sister property, this one was high on trip advisor's Branson hotels as well. (I think #3..and there's A LOT of Branson hotels!!!) We booked over the phone about three weeks in advance since we received up for a coupon through their webpage (it's a easy 15% off your 1st stay just for signing up). What a great and friendly guy Mick (?) was..a lovely brittish fellow! :) So helpful and sweet. We also called the day before we arrived to reconfirm details of the reservation (room type/rollaways, etc) and spoke with Stanley. He was so nice as well. We stopped by the morning of check-in and although they didn't have our rooms ready, we met Stanley and another gentleman at the desk .Both greeted us and were so kind! When we returned later that evening to check in - both desk attendants were just as helpful, thorough and kind as well. Actually- every employee we came in contact within the hotel were the same way. This company must take great care and pride in hiring the right employees! To our surprise Stanley had upgraded us to a larger suite for my husband and two little girls. I think the hotelwas very full and rollaways/and our preferred room weren't readily available. We were soooo appreciative of that thoughtfulness. Most importantly everything about these hotels are IMMACULATELY CLEAN!!!! The rooms, bathrooms, halls, pool, breakfast areas, etc. I wish all hotel chains could take training from the Myer's family/staff. I mean ABSOLUTELY SPOTLESS. For this reason alone I would return again and again to these properties..and any others they own and operate. Too bad they are only in Branson. (haha) The indoor pool was fun for the kids (open late too!) as well as the game room and sweet ice cream vending machine- they loved it. Breakfast was nice and pretty comparable to a Drury Inn, on a smaller scale. We do a lot of traveling all over the country as a family and also both work for a major worldwide hotel/resort brand. We are so impressed by the Myer hotels. We only come to Branson maybe once or twice a year to bring my mom. (She likes the shows). haha But when we do we will be sure to choose one of these incredible properties again and again!

I don't think I would stay again during the summer because of this reason.", "Date": "July 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheboygan Wi", "Title": "\u201cgreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "Ron R", "ReviewID": "UR7416450", "Content": "Tripadvistor Member Wisconsin (April 2007)....Stayed four days, the rooms were clean and enjoyed the extra sink.

The free continental extended breakfast was good.

The staff is very friendly and helpful and made you feel at home. The king room we stayed in was very clean. The continental breakfast with the extras was pretty good (biscuit & gravy and waffles). The indoor pool is nice but not large and the nearby jacuzzi felt good and holds about 10 people. The hotel is located on the yellow bypass route which makes for some easy navigation around some of the traffic (remember, I said SOME of the traffic). If you need something extra, don't be scared to ask because the staff is very helpful.

The check in guy was great and the hotel itself is fine. Room was a good size and large enough. It was freezing - we turned the a/c off as soon as we walked in and it never got to a comfortable temperature Very little in the way of kitchenware, only one saucepan! That was not a problem for us since we were only staying one night but would be a hassle for anyone planning to stay longer. The room had not been properly cleaned - garbage not emptied, coffee maker still had old coffee in it and the top sheet had been tucked in - looked like there was only one sheet on the bed. We called down for more bedding before realising what had happened! No coffee, no sugar (only sweet and low) ... basically the cleaning stuff had not done their job. Other than that it was fine, comfortable and quiet, close to some shops and restaurants.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cExtended stay better than prior reviewed\u201d", "Author": "prodigiouswizard", "ReviewID": "UR117336354", "Content": "Keeping in mind this ban extended stay hotel, I found the past reviews to be unfounded. Pros: * pretty clean and great location near major highways. They only clean your room once a week so if you trash it it will smell but you know that going in. * quiet when we were there but again I suppose your neighbors make a difference. Their staff is gone at late night so I can see complaints may not go anywhere. * free parking, great room price, area is safe, can get on priceline Cons: * $5 wireless fee * of course continental breakfast sucks but so what?", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cAwful, cheap place. Walls are paper thin.\u201d", "Author": "markh1975", "ReviewID": "UR99997464", "Content": "First, the place is terribly constructed. Every door, even though each one has a automatic closing mechanism and could be adjusted to close quietly, slams very loudly. I was staying on the second floor (out of three), next to the stairwell, and every time the door to the stairwell closed, my entire room would shake. Even when the door to the outside at the bottom of the stair wellwould close, my entire room would shake. A couple of the nights there was a person above me, and every step this person took literally shook the entire room. I even had the privilege of listening to my upstairs neighbor have sex at 2 a.m. I called the front desk to complain, but no one answered. I could clearly hear the bed squeaking, among other things. The shower hot water literally took about five to ten minutes to warm up. Some of the cabinet trim was falling off. The place seemed as if it was constructed as cheaply and quickly as possible. I asked to move to the third floor, and the staff was very helpful and provided a room for me. I packed up all my stuff, and went up to the new room, only to find out that it was a smoking room! The staff failed to tell me that the entire third floor was smoking, so kept my original room so as to avoid the disgusting stench of the third floor. I entered and exited through the far-corner of the building which is supposed to be a secure entrance, but it was never locked, even late at night. Just some observations: Why provide a full-size dishwasher in each room, but only two sets of plates and utensils? Why provide a cutting board, but no chopping knives? Why have an entire floor of smoking rooms? Are a third of the customers really smokers? It is disgusting. The \u201cexercise\u201d room was a joke. The treadmill was broken, and I told the staff and they didn\u2019t even know it was broken. On the plus side, the staff was friendly, helpful, and well-meaning. I could feel their frustration knowing that their facilities were built with such shoddy construction. In the future I will be doing all I can to avoid staying at a Homestead Suites. Since I paid $25 per night on priceline, I don\u2019t feel particularly ripped off, just disappointed that any business would be run so cheaply and with such little pride. I think this hotel is a dead-on perfect example of American business mediocrity, where the business is run as if its customers are too dumb or lazy to care about quality. If I had paid anywhere near the advertised price for this room I would be asking for a lot of my money back.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "natebanta", "Title": "\u201cEssentially a Motel 6 with kitchens\u201d", "Author": "natebanta", "ReviewID": "UR95945846", "Content": "The Good: - It was near our event. - Easy Freeway Access - Rooms have kitchens and a pullout bed for extra sleeping room. - Muffins, fruit, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate are served in the morning.

Strange to have pull-out beds, but no pillows. - The trash can in the bathroom had not been emptied. - The room is supposed to hold 4 people, but it only had two bath towels. - They have an indoor pool, but the water was ice cold. They could at least try to make it room temperature. - There was a large party going on in a room on the third floor. It disturbed numerous guests. But it seemed to be the front desk girl's friends, so she did nothing about it. In fact, they came down to hang out with her and chatted loudly through the night.

No A/C in any of the hall, the A/C in our room was stuck at 50 degrees so we froze all night. When we asked for extra pillows in the room we were given bed sheets to cover them with as they were \"out\" of pillow cases. The trash bins all along the outside of the building were over flowing.

I can't believe how inexpensive it is, and I appreciate having a little kitchen set up with a fridge, and a desk to work on. It is very important to me that I have hotel room windows that open. It's right next to the freeway, but the building has a series of courtyards that muffle the traffic sounds. I'm a woman alone, and I feel safe there. It's on a busy commercial road with every kind of restaurant I need, or I can just nuke something from Trader Joe's in the microwave. Yes, it's minimal service and no free shampoo but I never use that stuff anyway, it's always some off brand. I never eat the free \"breakfasts\" at hotels, either, so I don't miss that especially with a fridge in the room for yogurt, fruit and milk. They clean the room and change linens weekly which is about what I do at home. If I want clean towels or sheets I can get them from the desk. I've stayed here three times and will do so again.

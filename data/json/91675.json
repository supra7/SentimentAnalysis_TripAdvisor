I have previously stayed in their suites and they are first class...spacious, comfortable, have everything you could want, king bed, jacuzzi, frig, coffee pot, large shower, two big screen TV's, comfy large sofa, dining table and chairs, huge windows overlooking the indoor park....and the casino has all the fun slots that I love to play, a great variety of restaurants...a movie theatre, a pool, and I think they even a bowling alley! I was there for four days and didn't even have time to explore it all. What a thrill to have my favorite Duncan Donuts coffee each morning, have cocktail hour at Friday's in the evenings and sit down to a nice Prime Rib special at the nice steakhouse they have there too! This latest trip I enjoyed their 8th floor king bed room overlooking the park and musical water/light show, and I thought the rooms were spacious and reasonable.....plus when I checked out, they checked in with a casino host and were nice enough to comp me my room based on all the fun play I had during my stay. Their staff and other guests were friendly, it was clean and well maintained and truthfully, while there might be fancier places to stay in Vegas, I don't need fancy when I can have all this in one great little package!", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cHome away from Home\u201d", "Author": "Dr_Chuckie-n-CarCar", "ReviewID": "UR126418237", "Content": "I have been visiting Las Vegas annually since the early 90's and for much of that staying in Strip Casino's. As the years have progressed, the Strip has become more crowded, Latino's standing on every corner not associated with a Hotel passing out escort service cards to men, women and in some cases children and driving it has become a nightmare. Casino's that were staples have gone the way of the dinosaur. New ones taller and featuring more glitter have replaced them. We used to love going up on the Stratosphere Tower for a romantic dinner and breathtaking views of the valley and strip. No more. The unfinished new Casinos and Wynn, Encore, Aria, among others have reduced the view to something the cost of making the climb is no longer worth. Like the universe the only constant in Vagas is change. Unfortunately in my eyes, This is change Vegas could do without. We stopped staying on the strip because of the headaches associated getting there much less driving it. We started staying on the Boulder Highway at Sam's Town and re-discovered what we loved about Vegas all this time. To be honest I hope all you visitors will hate it stay on the strip and allow me to revel in this gem. The food is good and the Mystic Falls park is a great place to sit and relax, We make time to enjoy this park along with the pool every time we come to Vegas. Access to the strip, downtown and LVMS are the best you can ask for and if you choose to stay here and do not rent a car they have the most complete bus schedule to get you where you want to go anywhere there is a Casino in this town. Did I mention how much you will be amazed by the room prices vs. the strip? We all make choices when we choose to spend time in Vegas. Most of us make them on what we have been told about the attractions associated with the Casino/Hotels we are planning on staying at. This is a bad call. Those attractions are available to you no matter where you stay. Off strip is cheaper and will remind you of the Vegas that is slipping into the sunset to be no more. That is why it is so popular with local's. Sam's is a self contained city that has something for families, singles, and the rest of us. The next time you book think outside of the box and rediscover why you started coming to Vegas in the first place. We have become loyal patrons of Sam's and see no reason to change that anytime in the near future. Give them a shot and you will be suprised at the hospitality and friendliness of the staff.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cedar City, UT", "Title": "\u201cWish It Was Better\u201d", "Author": "lilbigmac", "ReviewID": "UR126193804", "Content": "We stayed based on a friends' recommendation but didn't enjoy as much as we hoped. The service was great but the room was lacking. The mattress was sunken on both sides like a 'W' and very uncomfortable. The sink was very slow to drain and we found out the next morning the tub barely drained at all. The A/C wouldn't go any lower than 68 degrees though it was obviously much warmer than that and would turn on and off about every minute and was very loud. The connecting door that went to the other room also had a large space under the door and when the people next door checked in at midnight and stayed awake for the next three hours, we heard every word they said. We had a rough time with one of the servers at TGIF one night who seemed to be oblivious to everything we said after we told him we don't like seafood and we had just eaten steak the night before, he continued to try and up-sell us on steak and seafood specials. Then, when our little toddler started to get fussy and sleepy we asked if we could just get a dessert to go and get out in a hurry, our waiter disappeared for at least 10 minutes. A manager finally came out to give us our dessert and we just told him we couldn't find our waiter and needed the check so we could go. I don't want to sound pessimistic. The front desk staff was very polite as well as the reservations staff when we called. We also had a great young waitress at TGIF one morning and the rest of the staff was great in the restaurant. I was also impressed by the friendly housekeepers that greeted us in the hall every time we walked past.

The atrium is filled with trees, bridges and life-like animals that are animated. It also has restaurants, bars and a cool laser show on the waterfalls. Some have said the casino is smokey, but I've never noticed it and I've been there a few times in the past couple of years. I do like the casino, they have loads of slots spread out so you never get that stuffy feeling you do in some other casinos. The buffet is good, and so are the other restaurants. If you want quick food, they also have McDonald's, Friday's, Subway, Panda Express, Sbarro and Dunkin Donuts, etc. For other-than-gambling fun they have a bowling alley, movie theater, outdoor pool and salon.

As for value, the weekday room prices are amazing, and may overcome the other faults of the property during the week, but the weekend room prices were high and then this hotel does not compete well against many other casino hotels in Las Vegas.

However, if you are looking for a hotel that has the old-school feel of Vegas Casinos from thirty years ago, has multiple on-site entertainment options, and cost 1/2 to 2/3 less than most of the famous strip hotels, you may consider Sam's Town. My wife and I spend the President's Day weekend (2/17/12 to 2/20/12) in room #599 at Sam's Town, our second stay in the last year. We travel to Las Vegas for a combination of business and a get-away, and find Sam's to be an excellent price/value hotel and casino. THE GOOD: Our experience at Sam's has been characterized by clean rooms; clean, albeit smoky public spaces; friendly, accommodating staff from the valet to the maid service; and good dining options that range from the cheap (McDonald's), to mid-range (TGI Friday's, and a large buffet that runs from $10 to $18 depending on meal and night), and a nice steak house. There are no celebrity chefs here, but good, reasonable food in big portions. Parking is ample and easy. And while I personally do not recommend Las Vegas as a vacation destination for children, the on-site bowling alley, multi-plex movie theater, and nifty atrium with a laser and music show several times per night does give the little ones something to do...escorted by an adult of course. THE-NOT-AS GOOD: The casino shows its age, with low ceilings and a smoky atmosphere. The beds are not the super-deluxe sleep systems you find in the pricier resorts, and tend to be a bit soft for my taste. And some services, such as bell service, takes a little more time on busy weekends than at other high-end resorts. But overall, the convenience and price makes up for these few detractors. Finally, if you are driving, and want to spend time on \"The Vegas Strip\" without staying there, be aware most of the large Casino Resorts on the Strip have huge, free, 24-hour self-parking garages that allow you to park and walk the strip. These garages are monitored by security, and very safe.

The laser, light and water show was even better than we remembered, due to advances in laser technology. The coupons we received at check-in saved us even more money. We did not need to leave the hotel to have a great meal, or a fast one. Available within the hotel are: TGIFridays (we had an outstanding meal of steak and lobster there), Panda Express, Subway, Dunkin' Donuts, McD's, Billy Bob's Steakhouse, Sabbarro Italian, a very good and reasonable buffet, and a great Mexican restaurant I've forgotten the name of. We enjoyed a movie at the 16 screen theater, could have gone bowling if we hadn't been so beat by walking the CES venue. The second day we were there, we slept in then took the hotel tram to the Strip and back-we didn't have to fight the convention traffic! My only complaint was that the hotel shuttle doesn't operate until noon. When there is a convention in town, they should be running by 9 or 10 a.m. Sam's is 6 miles east of the Strip at Flamingo and the Boulder Hwy. You can't even get lost; just look for the Flamingo on the strip, turn on Flamingo Blvd., and head away from the interstate. Our room was good sized, our beds and pillows were so comfortable, and everything was clean and in good repair. They do need to upgrade to flat-screens and stop charging for wi-fi in order to compete with some of the much more expensive hotels. We could barely detect any cigarette smoke in the gambling areas, and their players club gave us more usable coupons to save us money. One was for a discount at Shepler's Western wear, which is on the second floor. We took advantage of it to buy my husband a black belt, as he had forgotten his. I got a discount off the clearance price of a nice souvenir. There was also a gift shop on the first floor with reasonable prices. One evening we went in Ruby's club and listened to the great country band. They have different bands on different evenings. We used a coupon for a 2 for 1 margarita and watched the laser, light and water show for the second time in the atrium. The beautiful atrium in the center of the hotel has trees, rocks, streams, waterfalls, forest sounds and real-looking animals that move. You can pay a little more and have a room overlooking the atrium where you could watch the show from your window. This is a great place for families too.

In Vegas, you spend most of your time out of your hotel, so we never made full use of the range of amenities - bowling, cinema, shops, pool etc - although the atrium bar was pleasant and the $9 'all you can eat' buffet breakfast was excellent value when set against prices elsewhere. The hotel's free shuttle bus times were not ideal for us, and the local bus took too long, so we drove to the Strip where 'self-parking' was free and unlimited in all of the big name casino/hotels. The hotel's location on Boulder Highway meant that we could easliy get out of town and onto the freeways for trips to Lake Mead/Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon (West Rim & Skywalk) for which we chose to drive.

This year, just as in the previous four, I have only seriously looked at two hotel chains. Terribles Hotel and Sams Town. Terribles is literally about 8 blocks from the convention center. But unfortunately I waited a little bit late to make reservations and their prices had jumped up. Even with the increase, their prices were still way cheaper than the hotels on the strip. I made reservations at Sams Town, when I received an email showing a discount of about $35 a day for three days. However, a fourth night that I added will be at $89. Update: With priceline I found another hotel for that 4th night at half the price. Location: From the strip you can get to Sams Town just by driving up Flaming Rd for about 5 miles until you hit Boulder Hwy. There is a strip center across the street anchored by a Walmart. I have never paid much attention to the restaurants in the area though, because I will usually catch breakfast at one of the strip hotels before boarding the shuttle to the convention center. However on Flamingo Road on the way to the strip there are several good restaurants including Bahama Breeze, Buffet Asia and more. The Property & Building: The building for Sams Town is huge and with three parking garages I still get confused as to which one is closest to my room\u2019s side of the hotel. It can sometimes make for an uncomfortable walk at night from the garage to the building, because only certain doors to the building are open at night. Take the time to find out which garage is closest. The Room: The size of the bedroom is quite nice. You could put a couple in there and easily have space for a portable flip out type bed for a small child. The furniture is showing its age a little, with a nick here and a crack there. But it is still decent quality for a budget level hotel. The carpet looked well cared for and lighting was sufficient. I had a king size bed this time. No, it wasn't soft and plush with that mold itself to your body type bed. But it wasn't hard either. The only issue I had was the heater, which was a little noisy when I tried to sleep. Also earlier in the evening I heard the people next door, but not at the time of sleep. The hallway is well lit. Wear and tear in the room overall, well there wasn't much. The bathroom was fine and reasonably spacious I particularly look for things like rush or torn wallpaper and saw none of that. As in previous times, with other hotels on the strip running at $150 and above, and some in the outer areas running around $80 plus per night, this is a bargain and I would stay here again. Other Items: 1. They do not have free wireless. Yes, even luxury hotels don't charge you anymore. 2. I noticed for the first time that even though you get a good rate, they charge a little administrative fee of about $4.50 per day. I hadn't noticed it before, but I was a little perturbed that it wasn't mentioned. I was told when I made the reservations online that I agreed to it. Maybe! 3. Part of the agreement you sign at the time of registration, says something about them not being responsible for theft of electronics, etc. I thought that to be quite odd since the room did not have a safe. So if the staff decides to take something, I guess it won't be their fault.

It is one of my favorites for location (off strip, but a short enough drive to most everything) and amenities. The strip is not the only thing around, Hoover Dam, Lake Mead, Valley of Fire and Red Rock Canyon are easier to get to from this location than from the congested strip area if you do have a car and want to get out of town. The rooms here are spacious and clean, beds comfortable and linens attractive. Some of the rooms have been updated with flat screen TVs, as I noticed the last trip we were there. The convenience of a decent buffet breakfast at an attractive price right downstairs is a big plus, you will pay less here than going out to a restaurant, as the buffet includes various juices and coffee as well as most any breakfast item you might be thinking of. Join the Boyd gaming club, you get a reduction on room rates and buffet prices as well as notifications of promotions for things like free rooms (stay two nights, get one free, for example) and free breakfast on occasion, even if you don't gamble at all. Other interesting things here besides gambling are a swimming pool and hot tub, movie theater, Western clothing store and beautiful atrium with a waterfall and animated critters that will thrill a child and nightly light show that is interesting for all. As with any hotel in Las Vegas, always check up on added fees for your stay. Most casino hotels charge extra for internet, some charge resort fees that may or may not include internet. There is a 'services fee' of $4.50 at Sam's (which does include the shuttle to the strip) and also a charge for internet at Sam's but still the room rates are usually good enough that all things considered, it is one of the better bargains we find. Read the fine print at the bottom of the page when you make a reservation online, as cancellation times for full refund are often long, like 3 days in advance. Also, if you have extra people in your room, it is a $20 charge per person over 2 people UNLESS they are kids under 15 staying with parents, they are free.

Why drive 8 or 9 miles from McCarran after all that flying when we could drive 2 miles up the Strip? Because at Sammy's you can kick your shoes off and feel at home from minute one - it's as simple as that. We always promise ourselves we'll go bowling, go to the movie theatre, eat at Willy & Jos\u00e9's and swim in the pool. We always know we won't - but it doesn't matter. Most of the machines we like are there. There's a relaxed atmosphere. We like the buffet. Then of course, there's the lovely Mystic Falls which makes me moist of eye literally every time I see it. Check-in has always been easy and we have always got what we asked for. I asked for a desert view room at the start of the trip which left us overlooking the parking lot - not so great. The room we had at the end of the trip was an improvement and we could watch lunatics in the distance doing the SkyJump at the Stratosphere. You'll probably need to avoid more walking frames and electric buggies here than at other casinos and the handwash containers by the main elevators look like they belong in a hospital, but you soon get used to that.

Friday's since Sammy's got rid of the Fresh Harvest Caf\u00e9, but it's expensive and we still wish the funky ol' caf\u00e9 was there for that late-night treat, sweet or savoury.

Our room was spotlessly clean (NO BED BUGS THAT WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT). The beds are very comfortable. The rooms have \"black out\" drapes that truly kept the room dark. Actually one morning it was so dark that we did not wake up until 10:00 a.m. The only suggestion we can give regarding the room is they could up-grade their bath linens. This was our first stay at Sam's Town and we will definitely return on our next trip to Las Vegas. We have been to LV many times in the past but we are tired of the crowds on The Strip. Sam's Town is easy driving to the Strip if you have a desire to go there but Sam's Town has it all plus looser slot machines. The pool area is nice and quiet and there are not a lot of kids running around and splashing in the pool. They also have a bowling alley and a large theater. We thought the bowling alley would have about 6 lanes so we were very surprised to find it had 56 lanes!! The theater has first rate movies with comfortable, stadium seating. We watched The Maid and I Don't Know How She Does It. Tuesday's are senior rates of only $3.00. Wednesday's they have free popcorn. Both are available with you B-Connect card. Upon arrival we were pleasantly greeted by Vic. We arrived at about 11:00 a.m. and he found a room for us so we could check in early. Vic was very helpful and answered all of our questions. From that moment on we realized that ALL of the Hotel's staff was very accommodating. One other staff member that I must mention is Rebecca. She brought us cocktails as we needed them. Her station was around the slot machines The Lord of the Rings. After our first drinks she remembered what we liked night after night. The restaurants we ate at had superb food and the staff were all great . At Billy Bob's Steak House we had prime-rib that was cooked just the way we ordered it. We also ate at the Sports Bar Deli for a quick, delicious lunch on two occasions. TGIF has a great breakfast for only $3.99. You certainly can not get a breakfast like that on The Strip for the same price. We ate at TGIF on several occasions and always had a wonderful meal. We did not eat in the buffet. We went to their McDonald's (in the hotel) for coffee every morning before we ventured out to the pool. Also, on the premises is a Dunkin' Donuts which had fresh donuts for us when the urge for a donut became a necessity. We definitely will return to Sam's Town on our next visit.

The rooms are on the upper end of the basic scale. They are bright and clean and always well-maintained. Nothing fancy - comfortable beds, regular TV sets (no flat screens in the standard rooms,) and the normal amenities. They work at what they are - normal hotel rooms. What makes Sam's Town one of my Vegas favorites is what's outside the rooms. The centerpiece is Mystic Falls Park - a nine-story atrium running through the center of the hotel building. Standing at one end is Mystic Falls, the site of a nightly laser/light/water show. The park is a terrific oasis during any Vegas vacation. I slip out here for coffee in the morning taking refuge in one of the many chairs along the tree-lined paths. At night, I grab a table at the Ram's Head bar to watch the water show. (The show was recently updated with new lasers and lights and several new segments beyond the original Sunset Stampede and patriotic follow-up show.) Both Willie and Jose's Mexican Restaurant and Billy Bob's Steakhouse offer great food and views of the park. I highly recommend a patio seat at Willie and Jose's to give you a great view of the show. A bowling alley and movie theatre offer other entertainment options and their pool, while small by Vegas standards, is usually uncrowded and more than adequate. The service at Sam's Town seems to get better with each trip. While it is a \"locals\" casino, the staff recognizes the need to cater to tourists and they go out of their way to make guests feel welcome. Employees greet you as you walk by and are quick to offer help if you appear to need it. Unlike many things in Vegas, Sam's Town seems to keep getting better with age.

For decades, I traveled to LV at least once a year, first staying on the Strip and then later loving Downtown, but I had not been back in over a decade. I had visited ST in the past, and enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere in the casino and grounds, but I had never stayed there. The reason for this trip was a little somber -- a \"celebration of life\" for an elderly aunt that lived a good, long life and loved ST Bingo. Her family (my cousins) lived on that side of LV so they recommended ST as a good place to stay. I did not rent a car, but prebooked Showtime Tours LV for airport-to-hotel RT transportation for $38 total. The cars/vans were very clean, and the drivers were right on time and very friendly and informative. I will always use them if I go back to LV. I arrived at ST around 3:30 pm on Aug 17 and was a little surprised to see quite a few people in line ahead of me on a Wed afternoon. However, this area is so nice and refreshing - listening to the waterfall and people-watching - that my ten minute wait flew by. The front desk staff - that day and many visits afterward - were very friendly, helpful, and always upbeat and positive. On check-in, I received many B1G1-free coupons for many of the restaurants so that was an extra unexpected treat. I didn't have a Boyd VIP card so didn't expect any upgrades, but I was very pleased with the 9th floor room that I got. It didn't overlook the atrium, but it was very clean and upgraded (marble bathroom countertops, wide screen TV, great black out curtains, and very clean). The bed was as comfortable as my home bed and pillows were plentiful. The room was quite large and there were armchairs; the only thing that I could think of asking for is for at least one ottoman for the chairs. Petty complaint, right? :-) But my legs were really tired a couple of nights from walking this HUGE venue several times over the day. Ok, to get back on topic to my title - single women traveling SOLO - if you are are worried about coming to LV and standing out on your own - COME TO ST! From what I could tell, single, local women of all ages are the NORM at ST/LV and also the same for men. I only play Blackjack and Video Poker, but not one employee (dealer, pit boss, bartender, cocktail waitress) or even a fellow player EVER asked me if I was traveling alone. I also went to the Buffet twice (alone) and the seating host did not consider my request for a single odd and made me feel very comfortable. Both times the host or the waitress would use the time to chat with me while they were keeping an eye on their other tables. GREAT training, ST management! Understandably, I spent a lot of time away from ST while spending time with my Aunt's family, but I always was warmly welcomed back at ST. I was there for 1-1/2 days before a lot of the rest of the family got to town and shared my story with dealers and bartenders. I could not believe how many remembered that two days later when they stopped me and asked me how things had gone. Ok this is getting quite long so let me wrap this up: Restaurants: Steak House - (Zagat Awarded): Excellent, but only got a meal to go. If it was this good back at the room, I can't imagine what it was like served at the table. I am sodium-intolerant and this was one of the best steak dinners I have had. Mexican Restaurant - Interesting, and very good. Seems like an extended family runs this one, but they are very friendly. I wasn't too hungry so only ordered a taco salad takeout. The padre tried hard to talk me out of it, but I won. It was a good salad back at the room, but I'm sure their other entrees are better. Buffet - very friendly waitstaff; food choice equivalent to good cruise ships. Dunkin Donuts/Subway - So nice that they were both there! Visited them often early in the morning or late at night and staff was very friendly. Bars - only spent some time at the bar near the tables and outside next to the waterfall, but all bartenders were friendly, chatty, and interested in us. Great bartender (sorry, can't remember his name) makes his own special blend Bloody Mary's. They change with every round, but they are good. Last tips: Make sure to stop at the B Connected Player Club Desk for your free player card before you ever throw a penny into the machines. You'll get discounts all over the property and maybe some comps later. The salon at ST: OMG, how did I leave this to last?? I had a dermobrasion facial that included an hour of massage of shoulders, scalp, calves, feet and my face looked 5 years younger that night. Make sure you ask for the same person (Debbie, I think) that does THIS full dermo facial. It was the best <$100 treatment I have ever had in my life, and canceled my massage appointments. Friends and family commented on my skin once i was back home; usually a week in Vegas goes the other way with skin ;-) Boyd Bus to Downtown - took it RT. Very prompt, be there on time. Very comfortable, nice drivers. I took it to get a cheaper cab ride to the new Outlet Mall in downtown ($6 one way). The mall is great, but outdoors, so if you hit it on a record-breaking heatwave like I did (107F) it may not be the best choice for an afternoon trip. Back from shopping, hit the Fremont (casino looks exactly like it did 10 years ago), and the California. If you are not from Hawaii you may feel a little out of place at the CA, but the staff is ok. Don't eat at the restaurant there. McCarran Airport - I had a red-eye home to FL. Just note that there our lots or shops and restaurants, but on Sunday night, EVERYTHING closes at 10 PM. Not sure about the other nights. Whew - that's all I can think of right now, but if you have questions specific to anything I've covered, please post.

The atrium ( Mistic Falls), was very cool, with benches and seats all over the place, you can relax, read a book, talk with your significant other or just make new friends, the laser show is good. The room is good, smaller than the rooms at The Orleans, but it was clean, quiet, no frills, room. I have a B Conected card, so I get some promos when I play the tables and slots.

The staff was very friendly and the room rates were affordable. First impression when I walked in was it was not exactly the cleanest hotel and it had a pretty strong smell of cigarette smoke, which (to me) made it feel all the dirtier. Because of this I actually upgraded our suite to one of their biggest rooms thinking it was more expensive so it would be better kept. However, it didn\u2019t seem to help. The room was still not very clean, one of the phones didn\u2019t work at all and had something sticky (not that I want to know) on it. In all fairness the room was very big and you can tell this hotel was something else in its heyday. Our kids loved the room and loved being able to look out their window at the water/laser show. We all like swimming and this hotel is not laid out very well if you want to get to the pool, especially with little kids. It was a long walk, but through the casinos! So it was a little awkward to be traipsing through the hotel in your swimming close in the middle of the casino. We tried to eat a couple times in the hotel at their restaurants but evidently nobody cares to clean off any of the tables, so both times we ended up having to clean off our own tables despite the fact we seemed to be some of the only people in the restaurants. My wife\u2019s not-so-favorite part was the fact that later in the evening (around 7pm or so) it felt like we were in a retirement home with the type of people walking around. Overall, we won\u2019t be staying at Sam\u2019s Town again, even though our kids loved it and had fun watching out their window. The reasons I won\u2019t be staying there again is 1) it was not very clean, 2) the floor plan (if you are a swimming family) is not very well thought out, and 3) we have younger kids and didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate or a good idea to have to drag them through cigarette smoke and a bunch of strangers in the casinos just to do anything (i.e. swimming, bowling, eating, etc\u2026).

Our non smoking room was spacious, light and clean and I assume this was true for all other rooms as well since we had two queen beds-nothing fancy. Though there is a free shuttle to the strip, the drop off and pick up location is on the opposite end of where some of the more well known casinos are AND the last shuttle back to Sam's Town is at 8:00 pm. We took the shuttle twice before we figured out that it was easier to do what we wanted to do using our own car. But be aware that if you stay here it's a good 15 minute ride to get to the strip and park. We used the pool every day. It's nothing fancy but clean and well kept and they provide beach towels at the pool free of charge. There are plenty of fast food options at Sam's Town but even the McDonalds there was over priced. Save some money and drive just two blocks to Denny's or a little farther for a \"regular\" McDonalds. My one complaint would be that the laser light show or \"Sunset Stampede\" in the atrium of the hotel was not working due to maintenance and our son was really looking forward to it so he was very dissapointed.

It's location is about an 18 minute drive away from the Vegas Car rental center using some of the back streets instead of the highway. I've stayed at the Boyd's Sam's Town on more than one occasion in the past, and very much enjoyed my stay during the Christmas & New Years Holiday season. This hotel is a favorite among the locals in Vegas with a more homey feel to it. During Rodeo season, this place can fill up fast with those good ole' cowboys and cowgirls dressed to the nine's in boots, 10-gallon hats etc., The rooms are are quite similar to the Boyd's Main Street Hotel & Casino in decor, yet very cozy, comfortable, spacious and clean. Some rooms are situated surrounding an enclosed Mystic Garden area when looking out of the inside window and other rooms across the hallway will offer a view of the outside surrounding area of the Sam's Town property. You'll find very friendly and professional staff here who are willing to take the extra step to make your stay enjoyable and pleasant by all means. There are a variety of eating places scattered throughout the hotel ensuring that you won't have to walk from one end to the other end. You'll find an open area soup & sandwich deli overlooking the sports book area, a Mexican restaurant, a steak house, and on another end of the hotel, a little food court that offers some fast food take outs, besides a pretty good and tasty buffet which most people seem to settle for. Be sure to sign up for a Boyd's B-Connected card that can be used at all Boyd properties. A shuttle is offered to the Downtown Boyd properties such as the Main Street Station Hotel & Casino,, Fremont Hotel and California Hotel. Points can be used for meals at all these properties, although it is still very reasonable in price. There are a variety of table games, slots, Bingo on the 2nd floor etc., and areas which are smoking and non-smoking too. My favorite table game there is the Pai Gow table and the craps table where I always have a lot of fun playing due to meeting a lot of nice people who frequent this hotel. If you want to venture out just for a change but, not have to travel to far, the Cannery Hotel & Casino is about a 2 minute drive down the street. You do have a Walmart directly across the street from Sam's Town if you need to pick anything up last minute that you may have forgotten to pack. There is also a little convenience store within the hotel, and a beauty shop that offers last minute needs for the women that do hair and nails by appointment. There's nothing frilly about this place, and its as real as one can get to having a chance to meet some beautiful and real local people in the area, along with some very friendly and professional staff who will make your Sam's Town experience not only enjoyable, but just as memorable.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed it and well worth the price\u201d", "Author": "Ronniecesmom", "ReviewID": "UR115160011", "Content": "My partner and I go to Vegas every year.

I really liked the place. It only cost about $23 a night (getaroom.com). The room was a nice sized room (not too big or too small). Two comfy chairs, king sized bed (which was comfy, tho the pillows were fairly small), a desk and chair. Lighting was good. The bathroom was big with a counter large enough for any accessory (hair, makeup, toiletries). The shower had strong, hot water with a bowed shower curtain. They wanted to charge us $15 a night to overlook the waterfall/park area. We said no, so our view was the roof with a huge light shining in our room (the curtains did a sufficient job blocking it so we could sleep). What we really didn't like was that it had no mini fridge or coffee maker, but for the price...The TV was tiny (the remote control worked well). Also, we had an adjoining room and was woken up each morning by people next door getting ready to leave and meeting up with others right in front of the adjoining room and they were loud! Not fun. The crowd was a bit ghetto and older. However, some of the older couples were hand in hand or arm and arm...so cute. The Roxy lounge had a jazz esemble and people were dancing. I really do not like that type of music and would never engage, but the people who did looked like they were having so much fun. We ate at Panda Express and McDonalds (McDonalds charged .75 for a refill of pop, which I never heard of before). Panda Express was really good. The Shuttle service was awesome. We went to the strip, back to Sams and then out to downtown all in one day. It was great. There was a high amount of security, so many that we thought \"Is this place really NOT that safe??\" The Java Coffee Hut was VERY expensive, for no real reason. The Shuttle service (showtime) to the airport cost $22 per person just because it's 10 minutes (that's how long it took to get to the airport) from Sams Town. The price was 5 star! The room was comfortable, but no view, no extras, tiny TV. High security (does Sams Town need that much security?), lower class clientel, but cute older couples. Awesome shuttle.

Because of the reason we were there we did not use any of the casino machines or tables but I can review the rest of the hotel for families who may be visiting and give what I think would be cool for couples. First off, if it were just my husband and I this would be a really cute hotel to stay at. It is away from the strip so if you want to enjoy the strip and have any adult cocktails while you are on the strip dont stay here. It is about 20 minutes away and you dont want to drive there after a night out but if you are looking for a fun casino in Vegas away from the strip this is a really good one. The area is very shady though so stay in the casino. The patrons are not low quality. It does not appear that people who live in the area come into the casnio at all and I always forget the area it is in isnt the best when we stay here. They have a good amount of machines and tables and I suspect this place is a locals favorite. Now for things I can really review on based on my previous stays: The check in staff is very very nice and friendly. They are very helpful and always have a smile on thier face. The rooms are nice and comfortable and a very good size. Comfortable beds and a nice tv. Ask for a room over looking the atrium! The atrium is in the center of the hotel and has wild stuffed animals that actually put on a water show three times a night. You can watch the show from your room if you have an atrium view which is just wonderful! The hotel is very clean and bright. It makes you feel at home. They only have one gift shop but it has a good variety of gifts. There is a TGI Fridays (food is ok there), Dunkin Doughnuts, Movie Theatre, Aracade for the kids with redemption center, Ice Cream store, Subway and another finer dining reastaurant but I can't remember the name since we didnt eat there.

So I started looking for discount airfares back in September. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t feel the good deals that I did for 2010 and I kept procrastinating. While I was concentrating on the airfares, the hotel rates were creeping up too. Couldn\u2019t find anything reasonable near the strip, so I looked at two standby hotels I had used before. The hotels were Terribles Resort and Sam\u2019s Town. Although much further away from the strip, I picked Sam\u2019s Town because it was about $30 cheaper than the other one. A strip hotel would have been more than $200 for just ONE night. I picked the most basic room, but was given an upgrade when I got here to a premium room. With two nights at $90 plus tax, I was very pleased at what I saw. I took some photos before messing up the room. Location: Sam\u2019s Town as I indicated is a good seven miles from the strip. There is absolutely nothing to do, but gamble and bowl at Sams Town. But it is a straight shot from the Strip via Flamingo Rd. The area around the hotel is business and residential. It was very quiet and I felt quite safe getting out of my car after midnight. A security officer though was present when I walked in. Lobby: The interior of the lobby has that cowboy-gold mining kind of motif. But the materials are good and nothing looks shabby. They also have an atrium area that is a pleasant place to have a beverage. Room: King size bed and the furnishing were not upscale, but in no way did they look worn and deteriorated. In fact, they looked quite well maintained. The carpet is industrial type but a nice pattern and clean with no apparent wear. The room is also relatively large and it is very quiet with decent lighting by lamps. Large LCD tv on the wall, a mini refrigerator (which I\u2019ve learned never to touch). It has a reasonable amount of closet space and a nice bathroom. Surroundings: I arrived late by plane, so I didn\u2019t take much time to see what stores and services were in the area. There is a Wal-Mart across the street and several places to eat as you go down Flamingo towards the strip. Here are photos of the room just before I crashed. The place is a super value if you don't mind being away from the strip. The savings made it easy to afford a car rental for about $60 to get where I had to go.

I have 3 kids (12, 13 & 15) and Sam's has plenty for them to do. We go bowling, to the movies, watch the laser show and go to the pool all in one hotel. Of course, there is the casino for the big \"kids\". There are many restaurants to choose from, as well - McDonald's, TGI Fridays, Billy Bob's, Subway, Dunkin Donuts, Calamity Jane's Ice Cream, Firelight Buffet, and more. There is a huge Wal Mart Supercentre just across the street. It is only 10 minutes to the Strip and 15 minutes to the Premium Outlet Mall. We always get 2 adjoining rooms which gives us a little space. A few years ago we stayed at the MGM Grand which was very nice, but other than the massive bathroom the room was the same size. It was too hectic up on the strip. We prefer to be at Sam's where it is a little quieter and we don't have to walk a mile to the pool. There are no room safes (which would be nice), but they do have safe deposit boxes at the cashiers cage. Also, there is smoking at the pool which is not nice for non-smokers - especially kids. It would be nice to enjoy the fresh air without someone blowing smoke in your face. In the casino you can get up and move is someone smokes next to you, but there isn't any place at the pool that is non-smoking. One other thing that would be nice is automatic doors at the parkade. The doors are heavy and it is hard to manage when you have your hands full of luggage. Thankfully, we have kids to hold the doors open for us, but if you have a handicap it would be almost impossible to manage the door alone.", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ogden, Utah", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place for Everyone\u201d", "Author": "motherhood2", "ReviewID": "UR69756502", "Content": "I have stayed at Sam's Town many times over the years.

Chose Sam's Town based on reviews and price. First off the cab ride from the airport runs about the same as a cab ride downtown ($23) so not too bad. The check-in process was relatively smooth, no big line and 4 people working the desk. Pretty much no wait at all. When checking in we were offered an upgrade. We were told the room we booked was a \"standard\" room although the reservation said \"deluxe\". We were told that for $25/night extra we could move to a \"premium\" room. Since it was our anniversary we opted for the upgrade only to find the room to identical to the picture of the room we booked online for $25/night less. Not sure what we paid for with that \"upgrade\" although we were told were getting a premium room with a great view of their atrium show. (At checkout our final bill did not include the charge for the upgrade. We did not complain about the charge or request it be refunded so perhaps it was just an error on their part or since it was our anniversary the charge was dropped). We never saw a \"standard\" room but according to other reviews it is a basic \"motel\" type room. Our room was nice with a coffee maker, refrigerator and a plasma television. Overall quality of the room was excellent although it was very comparable to a room at The Orleans which can usually be reserved for half what we were supposed to pay at Sam's Town. The casino is huge quiet for the most part. No problem for the wife to find her favorite slot machines to play and rarely, if ever anybody on them. Tables were very quiet with only a couple of blackjack tables going, 1 craps table and maybe a Pai Gow table going depending on the time of day. At night the number would maybe move up by 1 table for each game but not a seriously active table game atmosphere. Poker room is quiet at all times of day and night. Most times 1 game of 2-4 limit but they try to get a stud game going later at night. Poker tournaments there attract a local crowd. I played 1 evening and only 7 players signed up for the tournament making it quite uneventful. Bottom line about he casino is this. There is not a ton of action going on there which is good for slot players but bad for table players. Food selection is decent although I was not impressed with the buffet. Tried it 1 time for breakfast. Neither me or the wife was impressed and we decided not to try the lunch or dinner based solely on the quality of the breakfast. There is a food court as well as a steak house and mexican restaurant. We actually ate off property other than grabbing something light at the food court but the other restaurants looked decent enough to try. Pool was nothing spectacular but was nice and would be suitable for use. Do not expect wave pools, shark tanks, island bars in the middle, blackjack tables or anything like that. It is a swimming pool and there were chairs to use around it. Not flashy but clean and there were plenty of people enjoying it so must be adequate. There is a theater and a bowling alley on property also which gives folks something other than feeding slot machines and dancing with drunk college students for entertainment options. Free shuttles tot he strip and downtown are a great selling point to stay here. If you are looking for a quiet experience, away from the strip in an atmosphere of locals then this is a relatively decent place. The atrium is very nice and the show they put on there is pretty cool to watch. I would consider staying there again but I would not be willing to pay the extra charge for a room that matches the picture of the cheaper rooms they advertise online. But, for the right price it is a very decent alternative to the strip or downtown if you are looking for some decent slot action and a little peace and quiet. No major complaints from me, the staff is friendly, the slot machines payoff and the free shuttles make getting around town fairly simple.", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hobbs, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201calways a great stay\u201d", "Author": "loretta97487", "ReviewID": "UR69071842", "Content": "we have been staying at samstown in henderson for years. our stay is always the best. the rooms are always nice, clean, and the beds very comfortable..the maids are always very helpful and friendly and seem to be very honest..but what amazes me is every time,, not most of the time but every time we pull up and announce that 'we are home' the bell desk is right there for our things. the valet is right there to move the car and we have no worrries, except to get inside and begin our gambling marathon. there is three bellman who are awesome and i can only think of ones name but that is adam, they do an awesome job every time. we get checked in and call them and in just short minutes they are there with our bags so we can get back to gambling..they are the best and if sams wanted to put this crew up against any in vegas i would put my money on them being the winner. the food is always good, the buffet is clean and well stocked with good eats, and billy bobs is an institution all its own..we love the food and the service, a very marketable place...the gambling is good, i can still lose there but i have such a great time doing it and we play bingo all day each day we are there so i gamble on the even hours and late in the evening and into the morning..like i said this not a one time event. this has been going on for years. last year we were there three times but this year looks like only this once but who knows, we can hope anyway...we love sams and tell everyone who says they are going to vegas that they should try sams. you know you want your friends and aquaintances to enjoy the best. anyway our stays are always memorable and only in the best of ways. so thank you and see you as soon as possible but for sure next june.....", "Date": "June 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buckeye, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cThe Park, the waterfall, the light show, bowling, the pool, and friendly staff make a wonderful family trip.\u201d", "Author": "Corlettjs", "ReviewID": "UR68597215", "Content": "Sam\u2019s Town is our favorite place to stay in the Las Vegas area, and this month, it became the favorite of our adult children, their friends, and our grandson.

Our 3-year-old grandson loved the indoor park, the waterfall, and the electronic wild animals, especially the mountain lion. He made up a story about the lone deer fawn standing near the mine shaft, and, while sitting on his daddy\u2019s shoulders, he saw the laser show exclaiming, \u201cWow!\u201d as he watched the water shoot up toward the ceiling.

In honor of his first spare, his dad took him to the Sheplar\u2019s Western Wear store inside Sam\u2019s Town where he purchased a small toy horse. None of us went hungry at Sam\u2019s Town.

I have vacationed in Las Vegas a dozen times and this was the nicest accomodations that I have ever had. Met up with a couple of my hosts and had a decent meal at TGI Fridays, and also had a vary nice steak dinner at Billy Bob's and I would highly recommend--the baked potatoes are massive. The Buffet, only so-so, for breakfast they close/rope off many of the food stations and won't let you have a salad. I noticed that the food was ready, packed in ice, had plastic wrap over the salads but was roped off for breakfast. Unlike the South Point where you can have everything for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!! The slots were extremely tight, very little play or bounce to them, and believe me I'm a slot player. The people are friendly and laid back, but security is all around as this neighborhood has a bit of a vagrant/homeless crowd often coming onto the property, Check in and out was quick and professional, 2 thumbs up.

The room was average, but had a hot-tub, and a view of the laser show. It was clean, but certainly not a luxury room. (the free upgrade put us on a smoking floor, which we did not appreciate... but the room did not smell of smoke) If you stay at Sam's Town, make sure you have a rental vehicle. Although they offer a free shuttle down to the strip, the shuttle ends at 11:00 - which was a problem for our night-owl friends, and a cab from the strip costs $35! The hotels on the strip do offer free valet parking, so it wasn't a big deal. (but tipping valets does add up quickly!)

The second night he played again, and the dealer was fantastic! It was entertaining just to play at the table! If you stay, be sure to sign up for a club card, it will get you a discount on the buffet. We ate at the buffet twice, once for dinner and once for breakfast. The dinner buffet was ok, but the breakfast buffet is well worth the price. Every breakfast item you could want is offered, and omelets are made to order.

You can also purchase beers here for $2, which is outstanding, compared to the $7 on the strip. Overall, the hotel stay was adequate for the price paid.

Walls are a bit thin - last two nights I could hear the woman in the next room and she wasn't being overly loud - just a medium pitched voice. Used my earplugs. Other than that it was a quiet stay on the 7th floor. Staff - oh my- talk about friendly and personable. Room toiletries - no conditioner or shower hats but they did have shampoo, body lotion and soap. Room was clean - vents and carpet-meets-the-wall areas could use a vacuuming but not that bad at all. Two queen bed room - plenty of room - better than your average Motel 6 and the like. Not a glitzy crowd at all. Mostly families and middle aged to senior folks. Nice easy pace feeling. Note - if you have scent issues, beware - there were areas on the main floor and also on the second floor (walk around area) that were just reeking of something strong and fragrant. I'm not sensitive to fragrance usually but it bothered me. Wasn't everywhere though. And what's with this Jon and Ric's Salon? The whole time I was there the place was closed with a note on the door with a cell number to call. Parking garages - more than one, and tons of free parking. Here's a tip that will save you unnecessary exercise! Garage 2 - the floor numbers don't match up with the hotels. The garage level 2 is on the hotel's level 3, which has a separate set of elevators and a pedway over the street. When you check out, if you are driving, bring all of your luggage to your car first, as without your pass card, you can't get to any of the hotel elevators to get back up to the garage pedway. (Not that I was told - might need to send a hex towards a particular security guard if that's not so.) I asked for and got two extra blankets to use. There is Internet connection available through some third party group - $10 for a 24 hour period. On the heavily scented second floor (or it may be the third floor now that I think about it), there are computers with printers. I used the internet connection with my laptop but due to tech difficulties couldn\u2019t log on the first time I tried. Issue was resolved by the time I got back to the room later that day, but I did get booted out a couple of times. Never saw a luggage rack or porter the whole stay. I found it cheaper to book through the hotel, and two days after I did, I got an email notice advertising lower rates and some comps (Ha! Casino talk!). I phoned the reservations folks and had no problem getting the lower rate and $25 food credit offered. Can\u2019t do that on Expedia. Food - Porterhouse steak at Billy Bob's was REALLY good. Baked potato was ...meh. Firelight buffet - ate there once - not bad but I should have passed on paying the $3 extra dollars to add the New York steak option. It wasn't much better than average, and they were serving beef anyway. Bathroom in the average room - if you are in to tub soaking and are more than a size 8, don't get your hopes up. The tub is oval and just seemed to squeeze me together. Only uncomfortable bath tub I've ever sat in. Shower was great. Completely sold me on getting one of those curved curtain rods! Location - it was what I wanted - off the strip, near the freeways so I could get to everything I wanted. About a 10-15 minute drive to the strip directly down Flamingo, and note that one of the garages exits out on Flamingo. About 20 minutes to the Premium outlet mall (see review on that). Bed wasn't the softest but I've been on much harder. Pillows were fine even though I still brought my own. They weren't hard pillows in the room I had. Seventh floor is non smoking but two guys I spoke with said their room must have been venting smoke in from somewhere as their stuff, and the pillows smelled smoky. I should have asked what room that was....for the smoke issue, of course... View - overlooked one of the parking garages if you looked down. If you looked up/straight ahead, the view was of the mountains. I chose to look up. Some areas on the main floor were smoky but the restaurants were fine.

There is no internet access. The pool is small and mostly shaded.

The good points -- there is a 24 hour grill that has great food at very reasonable prices. Also, the pay scales on the video poker machines are far better than those at any strip casino.

It has a beautifully maintaned bowling alley with $1.00 shoes and games after midnight, a 24-hour deli with great food and value (except the 50 cent charge for a to-go container is pretty ridiculous), a decent buffet for the price, a nice gaming floor, large & comfortable rooms, and more. The pool looked good but we did not swim as the weather was a bit windy and cool (Early April) as it always seems to be that time of year. The indoor \"park\" has waterfalls, rocks, and vegetation and really looks and feels like being in nature. The laser light show at 2, 6, 8 & 10 is wonderful and very patriotic. Funny thing is that since Vegas has so much to do, we only finally took in the laser show on our last night there. It is a must see! The hotel staff were excellent and accomodating. The dealers were very friendly. Overall we had a great time. I wish I could say that everyone we encountered in Vegas were as top-notch as the people at Sam's Town, but they were not. I will review other places we visited as well. The hotel set-up is a bit hard to navigate when going from the parking garage to your room but you might get the hang of it as we did. Basically floor #3 from the parking garage elevator is the same as floor #2 in the hotel elevator. You must have your room key to access the hotel in some areas but none is needed to use the ice machines. Although the weekday room prices were great, beware as they do add a $4.50 service fee for each day. Wi-fi is also $10.00 for a 24-hour period. And, of course, 50 cents to get a to-go container to take your deli food to your room (really crazy). But hey, it is Vegas where they are experts at getting your money. The location is on Boulder Highway away from downtown and the strip but it is an easy 10-15 minute drive to just about anywhere in town. There is a super Walmart across the street which was nice to get snacks and drinks at. Also, the local gas stations seem to have some of the lowest in Las Vegas. Basically Sams Town has some residential areas around it and a lot of the locals go there. I even gambled along side some dealers from other casinos who were in Sam's Town on their day off. Although I did not go to the bars, the music sounded great from the one. It was a western band. Overall I love Sam's Town and will always opt to stay here away from the crowds of the strip and in a safe-feeling, enclosed \"town.\" Since there was so much we could have done at Sam's Town, I was almost disappointed that we were gone so much doing stuff in the greater Las Vegas area. If you want a comfortable & home-town type, anti-glamourous Vegas experience, then go to Sam's Town.

At that time I had become somewhat disappointed with Sam's in General. I have stayed here many times since 1999 and up until the last few years had always considered it a great value. But with all the construction the value had diminished a lot. On this visit I was pleasently surprised. First, I reserved my room through Hotels.com at a rate that was well below what I could have gotten booking direct. So that helped. The room was clean and for once the bed was very comfortable instead of the rock of a mattress that I normally got. Since I was staying three nights this is a huge plus. The staff at check-in was wonderfully friendly too. Most of the construction seems to be completed. They now have a section of the casino which is non-smoking and is a good addition although I never felt Sam's was that smokey. The sports book is awesome and the rest of the gambling seemed fair. They have also seemed to increase the number of drink runners from last year which is always a good thing. However, the restaurant selection has taked a downward turn. Gone is the 24 hour Harvest Cafe and one of my favorite Italian restaurants, Felini's. Fortunately there is a Felini's still at the Stratosphere so we went there for dinner on Friday. New is a TGI Friday's. Now mind you, I like Friday's. But when I go to Vegas I don't want to eat in a corporate chain. Friday's also has a breakfast menu that, from what I was told, is horrible. Willy & Jose's is still there (very good Mexican food) as is Billy Bob's (steaks). The buffet is average but a little pricy on the weekends. The one great addition is the new snack bar at the sports book. Cheap, yet very good deli style meals, including a breakfast sandwich on a kaiser roll to die for. Overall as long as I can get decent rates, somewhere between $55 - $65 on weekends, I will continue to stay at Sam's. I would still consider it to be a good value, especially in these economic times.

We wanted a good night sleep after a long flight, so we booked off the strip. First, I'll start with the positive: We paid $26.95/night plus $4.50/night hotel fee...not bad. We decided to book 2 rooms for the four of us to spread out, because this great rate. The front desk staff were very polite and friendly. Check in was a breeze. The TGI Fridays and hotel breakfast buffet were great. If you sign up for the Club Coast card, they give you $1 off the buffet. We loved the atrium and water/laser show. The hotel rooms were fairly clean and attractive, but small. Now the bad: There were areas of the hotel that were showing its age, such as the carpets on the 7th floor. Also, some of the hotel patrons used the garden containers in the atrium as trash receptacles. I could ignore all of this and probably give the hotel a 4 star overall. However, my last and largest complaint is the paper thin walls. My family had connecting rooms. The ladies in the room to the right of our room came in at 1:30 am and laughed and cackled until 3:30 am when I think I finally just passed out from exhaustion. They were having a great time. I don't begrudge them...that is what Vegas is all about for most who come. My kids had the room on the left and told me in the morning that their neighboring room's alarm clock when off at 1 am and the patron didn't come in til 3 am to shut it off. Then, he turned on the TV for a couple hours. Again, don't begrudge the patron, but the walls are literally paper thin. Don't plan on getting any sleep if you have a neighboring room with patrons who don't share your sleeping habits. Last, this is also a positive. When checking out, the front desk staff asked how my stay was and I laughed and said exhausting. She asked what I meant and I explained about the noise coming from our neighboring rooms. The hotel credited me $15/per room plus the $4.50/night per room. So it cost me next to nothing to stay. Again, if you don't plan on sleeping, this may be the place for you. But, if you need a good night sleep, you will not get one at Sams Town, due to paper thin walls.", "Date": "August 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glen Head, New York", "Title": "\u201cI renamed it Sam's Hell\u201d", "Author": "Seektravel", "ReviewID": "UR36138699", "Content": "I only picked staying at this hotel because I was traveling with my senior parents and thier senior friends and they had free nights.

Do not believe the pics you see on the internet. Some of the cheaper rooms are extremely dirty and run down. Run down does not bother me as much as dirty. When I am afraid to actually sit on the chair or bed because is it dirty. There was someone's hair all over the chair. I immediately called the lobby (It was late at night about 10pm) and said \"I want a room that looks like the one you have on your internet site\" she told me that I could have another room at the same cost or I can pay 25.00 more for the room they show on the internet. So I just payed the 25.00 more though I did agrue that it seemed unfair that I have to pay more money for a room so I do not have a dirty disgusting room????

Desk clerk friendly and knowledgable, offered free room upgrade (overlook of Mystic Falls) at check in. Room much nicer than what you'd find at any lower-end chain for the same price: immaculate, nice-sized television, bed very comfortable. I already knew of most amenities from visiting Sam's website, but was pleasantly surprised by their quality. Bowling alley, movie theater, and sit-down restaurants. They also have a couple \"quick-grab\" type places (a Subway outlet was one). Didn't really gamble, so can't comment on that -- only dunked a few coins while I waited an hour for their Mexican restaurant to open for dinner (posted hours were wrong). Food was well-prepared, but didn't wow me. Wait staff just the right amount of attentive. Mystic Falls was awesome -- I'd say it's one of the better \"free\" shows in Vegas. (Maybe it just resonated, it being so DIFFERENT from what you might expect out of 'Vegas -- no glitz -- and me being outdoor girl that I am. Hey, I caught it 3 times & it didn't get old. But plenty of families and kids at the earlier shows -- locals, maybe??? -- would likely agree.) Do catch -- well worth your time.

I have to say what a pleasant surprise it was! Of all the hotels that we visited during our stay, it was only at the Encore (we stayed at Encore) and Sam's Town that doors were held open for us and received 5 star service from the personnel. Everyone that worked there were both friendly and helpful, and seemed genuinely happy to have us at their Casino. One Craps guy, I think his name was Sinisi? was from Checkloslovakia?, stood out because he was so friendly and helpful and kind to us, teaching us about craps and notifying me when it was time to do something at the Craps table (we won $300 that night, but lost on other nights there, but didn't matter because we just loved it there)! The employees seemed happy to be at work and all had a jovial attitude towards both each other and the patrons. One funny thing that happened was when I asked this one man gambling if he came there often, and the dealer replied for him, saying, \"Who, Barry, nah, he's never been here!\" (I found it funny anyway :P) There are a lot of locals who gamble there, I found signs prominently displaying that Sam's Town had won Best Gambling Hall for 6 straight years in a row! There is a reason for this: the employees and the craps odds are 20 to 1 :D Everything was extremely clean and the waitresses remembered my name when I had only visited there once before on our trip, (loved that). There is even a separate gambling area on the other side (separate from the main) that is non-smoking (great for people who abhor smoking). One thing that I found particularly wonderful about the place was the fountain show in the center of their main area. It is basically a smaller scaled version of the fountains show seen at Bellagio. Considering that Sam's Town is much older than the Bellagio, it makes me wonder if Bellagio borrowed the idea from Sam. :P There was a wide variety of people and families there, all watching in amazement at the show. Middle America at it's finest :) I saw quite a few retirees there also, (they are the smart ones that know where to gamble) :P In addition, Sam's Town has a Bowling Hall, a Movie theater, an Ice Cream shop, as well as a Dunkin' Donuts (great relief from those $6 coffees that you find on the strip)! I am including pictures in both this review and a following review because each review only allows 10 pictures. I think that I took more pictures here than any other casino that we visited during 5 days there, I liked it that much. If I were to ever go to Vegas again, the two standout choices of 'must-see' places to stay would be Sam's Town or Encore, and honestly, I think that I would choose Sam's Town because of the great gambling they have and that it is just so comfy and nice. (Encore is brilliant too though) :P We visited a lot of casinos in Vegas too, including Caesar's (great) and Bellagio (not-so-much, not because of the staff, but because it was just a conglomerate mess with the MASSIVE crowds and HEAVY smoking). It took me nearly half an hour to find a freaking bathroom at Bellagio, and it was far away from where I was gambling) Do yourself a favor and choose Sam's Town, I think that you will be glad that you did! --and your wallet will thank you! (better gambling odds, and if you check, I think their slots are slightly higher in percentage payouts, being off the strip) Please read my reviews of this place after this one, you will find a lot more photos, pictures are worth a thousand words! and for the mods, No, I do not work for Sam's Town, I just like to give credit where credit is due :P", "Date": "June 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cVer nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "JimmyKaratekid", "ReviewID": "UR32998271", "Content": "Excellent Service.

Wi-Fi is available in the rooms but the charge for it seems pretty steep. There is free ice on each floor so with our travel cooler we didn't miss a refrigerator. We always take a small electric kettle to heat water for coffee etc.. We requested two extra pillows which were brought to us promptly at no extra charge. There was a problem with the toilet which was quickly addressed by hotel engineering. Dinner at the Firelight Buffet is $10.99, or $9.99 if you get one of the Coast Club Cards which are free.

The Firelight Buffet has breakfast for about $6, but the line was too long by the time we got there. We grabbed a quick breakfast at the in-house McDonald's, which was much better than most \"free breakfasts\" for about $5 each. I have to mention, this McDonald's is the only fast food location we visited on our entire vacation that didn't mess up the order. The atrium in the center is kinda fun. It has a feature they call Mystic Falls with a waterfall scene and animatronic animals. If you are with anyone who has a problem with cigarette and cigar smoke, be aware it is hard to entirely avoid. The atrium is a non-smoking area and you can reach the McDonald's through there. The hotel corridor we were in was also non-smoking. Just the same, you'll be smelling some smoke walking from one place to another. This isn't the easiest place to get your luggage to your room in if your doing it yourself. We couldn't see an available bell hop when we arrived and just thought we'd do it ourselves. It took us about twenty minutes, involved four trips to the parking garage which isn't all that close to the rooms. It would have been easier to have waited for a bellhop.

I responded to a monthly offer I receive from their rewards club for three free nights any night of the week, along with vouchers for a free lunch and dinner at the Firelight Buffet. Upon arriving at the hotel around 1 am, there was no line at check-in and it went very smooth. I happened to notice that they have gone back to charging a required $50 room deposit per stay for their players club members via credit/debit card only, whereas this was always an option in the past versus being mandatory, along with having the ability to pay a cash deposit if desired. I arrived at room 931, which was an outside room vs. a park view room which was actually what I was looking for - although the inside rooms with views of the park are nice, the laser light show that runs several times a day in the park gets very loud and overbearing, so the outside facing rooms are much quieter. I had requested a king bed and got two queens, but I understand that preferences can't be guaranteed (even on a comp offer!) so I wasn't too big of a deal. Being on the top floor was nice, and this particular corner of the hotel had a really great view of the Strip, which was a nice touch. It had been about a year since my last stay and everything still appears to be in very good shape. All of the rooms now have 37\" flat panel televisions which were a nice addition. The armoires that held the old televisions are still intact and have been turned into dry bars. After being in the room for a couple of hours, I noticed a couple of problems. I noticed that there was a leak along with slow drainage problems in the shower, and it appeared that the air conditioner wouldn't go below 78 degrees, even being on the coldest setting. The second day of the trip was on the warm side, but I was barely in the room so it wasn't too big of a deal. I probably would have requested a room change in the event I was paying for it or if it would have been extremely hot outside. I had mentioned in a previous review that although the comps are good here, the slots have gotten alot tighter over the past couple of years, so I actually only played through about $25 here without any luck. I usually play traditional reel slots at the dollar level, and learned several trips ago that this isn't the best place to play anymore! I haven't seen too many new machines on my past few trips, it appears they just keep moving them around. All of the casino, restaurants and everything else appeared to be in great shape as usual. Sbarro, Panda Express and McDonald's in the food court are always cheap, surefire bets, and the two trips I had to the Firelight Buffet were excellent. Although even the comp line was a little long for the Sunday Champagne Brunch, it was well worth the wait. Although I was stuck in a room with a couple of mechanical issues, Sam's Town is still a great place and I'd still recommend it to everyone.

I read elsewhere that they might add a $4.50 nightly service fee on but it turned out to be only $1. Considering they provide a free shuttle service to several hotels on the strip and downtown I consider that more than fair. Originally got a great rate through the hotel website, then received a travelocity \"sale\" email that listed an even better price. Called the hotel directly and they matched the rate after verifying it was available on the web. Ended up paying ~$23.50 a night. I've never stayed in Vegas more cheaply and certainly have had less quality hotels for more than that price. Requested a king size non smoking which I received without a problem. The TV in the room was a maybe a 19 inch tube model which is a little dated but worked fine. Standard room was a good size. Only minor problem with the room was a small amount of peeling wall paper near the shower. The hotel has a \"show'\" that runs for only a few minutes every couple of hours in the afternoon that is quite loud. It might disturb your sleep or tv viewing but it stops at 10pm so shouldn't be a major problem. I was in an interior room. The exterior rooms probably wouldn't be effected by the noise. The check in and check out were quick. Lobby staff were helpful. I ate a late dinner (3am) at the steak house where the food and service were both excellent. Elevators were prompt. They have alcohol hand sanitizers near the main elevators and in the gaming areas which is a nice touch. The bowling alley was well lit and clean. Didn't go the the theaters. Nice variety of restaurants from ultra cheap mcdonalds to the steak house with a lot of selection between. The shuttle was a huge bus actually. Ran on time and was clean. The pickup location is not clearly marked however and I missed the first bus because I was looking in the wrong spot. The hotel is located near a number of major roads and has a number of city buses that service the area if you need to travel around on the ultra cheap. There is also a walmart just across the road. I only played roulette and poker in the casino so can't speak for the other areas, but the dealers were friendly. The poker room currently has two tournaments a night at 7 and 11pm I think. One night there weren't enough players for the second game so it was canceled. I believe there's a morning tournament also. Buy ins are very cheap. Had a lot of fun playing in the tournaments.

Got a great ($25) rate on-line (better than casino rate) for a Thursday night. Room (879) with king bed was perfectly adequate. Not as fancy as Caesars Palace but not as much of a let down as we might have expected. Very basic, clean room. Bathroom had tub/shower and sink/vanity in same room so mirror fogged up extremely bad after shower...an electric mirror defogger would have worked wonders. Bed was standard hotel type and a bit firm for our taste but when you don't go to bed until 3am it does not matter. View was south down Boulder Hwy so even number rooms face the atrium. LCD TV but the old style amoire TV cabinet was still in the room...they put the ice bucket and plastic cups where the TV used to be. The room was clean and the temp controls worked great. We've paid a lot more for far worse accomodations. One big contrast we noted at Sam's Town in general from places on the Strip is the lack of newbie first time Vegas visitors. The people at Sam's Town knew what they were doing and were obviously regulars. The slots were fare more friendly than on the Strip and we accumulated enough points to probably have had the room entirely comped had it not been booked (and paid for) on-line. We ate at Billy Bob's Steakhouse (really good) and at the buffet for breakfast (a classic bargain)...see seperate reviews. All around Sam's Town is a great value unlike the huge rip-offs on the Strip...example the $5.49 breakfast buffet was every bit as good as the $15,99 buffet at Caesars Palace. One downside....taxi to airport is more expensive than from Strip. If just staying at Sam's it might be worth renting a cheap car. Plenty of parking. Make sure taxi to airport takes Nellis to Tropicana to Paradise...much faster/shorter than Flamingo.

I've never been a fan Vegas - I don't get the whole too much drinking and too much smoking all the while throwing one's money away. Not my idea of fun, but I understand other's have a great time of it. Sam's Town is about 7 to 9 miles away from the strip/downtown. That suited us on such a quick weekend trip. Plus, the casino is less crowded. However, Sam's Town does offer free shuttles between its casino and several sites along the strip and dowtown, which is nice for those who either do not have cars or do not wish to drive. Our room was nothing terribly special, but it was clean and comfortable. It is almost time for the bed to be changed (it's a little old and soft), but we managed to have a couple of good night's sleep so it was serviceable. Plenty of clean towels, clean carpeting, and everything was dusted. We didn't have the 42\" plasma TV spoken of in another review, but the TV worked just fine and was standard hotel fare. There are several restaurants in the casino. We managed to eat at Billy Bob's Steak House, which had large portions but was rather expensive for what was received and the service given. Unless a very special event, I would skip this. We did eat at the buffet for breakfast and dinner, and thought it did quite well, although we were more impressed by breakfast with lots of choices. Dinner was okay, but when it came to dessert, some of them were leftover for quite some time and had gotten a littel \"crispy.\" Mystic Falls in the center atrium is a relaxing parklike place to walk through or sit and relax. It is covered and air-conditioned, yet it feels like one is outdoors. There is a light and water show that gets a little loud, but is pleasing to watch - once. If kids are in tow, they might enjoy this. The bowling alley (a place we spent quite a bit of time, actually) was quite nice. One of the better places we have bowled. The lanes are nicely set up and feel comfortable. Hey, I bowled a 189! But seriously, this offers a nice respite from the typical Vegas scene and allows one to get a little exercise as well! The casino is, well, a casino. I stayed away from the tables, as the table minimums appeared rather high to me. But then, the last time I was in Vegas was 1991 (hey, I don't \"do\" Vegas, what can I say??), and these might be normal. The minimums were $5, $10, and $25. More than my budget allows. I stuck with the machines, which bore me after about an hour, and lost more than I won. (which is typical for me) My boyfriend played the penny slots and did quite well, though. My major beef with the casino (and this true of any casino anywhere in Nevada) is the smoke. I am a non-smoker, and smoke gives me a headache after a while. Even sitting in the \"non-smoking\" areas (which are right in the middle of the smoking areas - makes sense?) doesn't help, plus there are limited machines. There is a second floor casino, and this was a little better, only because there were fewer people up there so less smoke. So, all in all, if you are looking for a less crowded, comfortable, clean Vegas experience with access to the Strip and downtown, Sam's Town might just fit the bill. It is huge (I kept getting lost), but there really is a lot to keep one occupied. However, if one has difficulty with cigarette/cigar smoke, then perhaps a casino vacation/getaway is not what you want to do.", "Date": "September 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "dayton, ohio", "Title": "\u201cSam's Town a great place to stay\u201d", "Author": "chefantwon", "ReviewID": "UR20039014", "Content": "I stayed at Sam's Town 7-12 September 2008 and had a wonderful time.

We decided to stay a few days on the strip then move to Sam's town for a change of pace. We booked through Expedia and had requested a smoking room and yes i know that this is not a guarantee-but this is Vegas-didn't think this would be problem here -anyways there was no smoking rooms available when we checked in which was 4 pm and the earliest we could have checked in was 3 pm so the front desk staff (Vic) was very nice and said to call down to the front desk in the morning and request to be moved to a smoking room. We thought no problem we are very easy going people. To go and have a smoke was quite the ordeal since we were on the seventh floor and had to go all the way to the casino whenever we wanted to smoke-no balconies or smoking in the halls allowed. When we called down in the morning we were told that they might be about to move us at around 2 pm to a smoking room if we stayed and waited around until then-if we weren't there at that time they couldn't hold the room for us-We were absolutely not waiting all day in the hotel to maybe get a smoking room!! I talked to the manager finally and was told we had to move all our luggage out of the room and could keep it at the front desk so the room could be held for us because we couldn't occupy two rooms even for a coulple of hours-we stayed here midweek and i'm sure there were vacant rooms but the manger was not willing to help us out with this at all.

We were part of a wedding party that was there, and since we'd had good stays at other Boyd's properties in Vegas, we didn't expect any problems. While the rooms were nicer than the average room at that price ($35 for the cheaper days and $115 at its peak for a nonsmoking, king bed), a number of \"little things\" were overlooked/ignored and really soured our stay. First, when we entered the room, the room itself was clean but there were a number of scuff marks on various points on the walls. These are easy to clean off, so I was disappointed to see them there. Next, there was a stack of linens in the bathroom. Two of the four that were displayed (the bath mat and a hand towel) had large, brown-red stains --I'm not sure if it would have been better or worse to hide them. Luckily, they were taken away the next day. The bathtub was oval-shaped and wretchedly uncomfortable. Looking to my right while soaking, I was able to see--all week--that the toilet cleaning wasn't particularly thorough. There was also no complimentary conditioner or shower cap, though I saw some on the housekeeping carts as they made their rounds. The room itself was fine, but the walls are thin. For half our stay our neighbor fought nightly with a significant other via cell phone, then rose at dawn accompanied by her boom box. It should also be noted that we had more television station variety at the Motel 6 we stayed in on our return journey. Sam's Town had about 15 channels, including 2 CNN feeds, Fox News, 3 internal channels, TNT, TBS, USA, and the local network affiliates. One can argue that there's no need for good cable while staying in a casino, but the slots are ridiculously tight, so I ran out of my admittedly meager gambling budget on day 2. We saw a movie at the theatre on our second night. The projector wasn't in focus. The buffet was affordable, but starch-heavy and bland. Due to our other commitments we didn't try any other restaurants in the hotel. As we were checking out, I looked above my head and noticed that the AC filter was disgusting. That probably explained why our allergies were acting up during our stay.

Check in at 4:30 pm was fast, friendly and uncrowded. It was inside the bright atrium and not in a gambling area. Our room was much quieter than any others we've had at other hotels in Vegas. Very clean throughout. They were washing all the carpets on a floor below us. The pillows were slightly better than at the Orleans but I brought my own just in case. The bed was the same. Too hard for me but everyone else liked them. We had a long counter by the window that was perfect for the microwave we always bring along. We had a very soft easy chair and the chair by the table was also padded nice and soft. Not the usual hard wooden motel chair. Make sure you count the towels and pillows before you leave because the sign says they will charge you for anything that is missing. Like $40 for the bath towel! I was going to use the quick checkout box by the exit but the sign said you have to fill out some unspecified \"form\". So I had to go to the front desk instead and checked out there and asked about this \"form\" but got no reply. This was not a problem since it was not busy and not that far out of my way. I was surprised to be charged only a dollar a day extra (\"local phone call charge\") as opposed to the usual $5 or $6 per day the others are charging. We didn't use the phone or anything else that would have been tacked on.. If you go to the buffet, get there early and expect to wait to get in. Lunch was always crowded right to the end. Food was OK but the service and food quality would drop off toward the end lunch hours as the workers were more interested in preparing for the dinner menu. This is probably true of other buffets. The wait to get in was always much longer than at the Orleans.

My only complaint would be the small TV, But then again our first night was at the South Point that had a 42' plasma. The restaurants were excellent that we tried and being from the huge Hispanic population of Central California the \"Jose & Willys\" was BY FAR the best Mexican Restaurant we have ever ate at!!!! Try the Garlic/Orange juice chicken dish OH MY GOSH!!! The buffet was an excellent deal as was the coffee shop. We bowled and saw a movie at the very nice movie Theatre at Sam's. Bowling was a great deal and cheaper then anything in my town by at least 50%... I thought the Ice Cream shop was just a tad overpriced and could have used extra staff (Just one person) in the evening. Also the hotel has a food court which was great and fast in the early morning on our way to baseball events for my nephew. We used the pool just once and the hot tub was great, Pool was not too crowded and we had lot's of fun. We were at Sam's for 5 nights and had a GREAT DEAL! We were so impressed that we came back to California and told everyone about the best kept secret in Las Vegas!! I had better mention that the hotel is about 6 miles from the strip and a car is pretty much needed (WE did not use the shuttle) But traffic at all times of the day and night was never bad and took maybe 15 minutes tops to get to the strip or UNLV.", "Date": "July 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Davenport,FL", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Cybear", "ReviewID": "UR7967302", "Content": "I stayed at Sam's Town with a friend for two nights in June.

We were first-timers to Las Vegas and wanted to get our feet wet by staying off strip for the first few days. What a great choice! We had rented a car, so getting there was no problem for us. You will need a car to get there or plan on a hefty taxi fare from the airport. I believe they have a shuttle that runs from the hotel to the airport, but we didn't check into that. Check in was a breeze and everyone at the front desk was very helpful with directions, supplying maps, and answering any questions we had about the area. I asked if there was a complimentary upgrade available. I was offered an atrium view room with two queens. We elected to keep our original room with the king bed and view of the mountains...which actually was a view of the parking ramp and a mountain in the distance, but we appreciated the offer and didn't spend that much time in the room anyway! We had a king bedroom which was very basic, very clean. It had two clubs chairs which reminded us of home. Comfy and inviting after a long day seeing the sights. Large bathroom. Lots of counter space and lots of hot water and good pressure in the shower.No coffee pot but plenty of coffee available in the many restaurants on-site. We took advantage of the shuttle system Sam's Town runs to the strip and the Fremont Experience. Both our drivers were the greatest, amusing us with stories or answering our many questions about the area. One was a retired firefighter (an occupation close to our hearts), so we enjoyed our conversations with him. Shuttles ran exactly as scheduled, contrary to the experiences some have reported here on TA. We ate at the Firelight Buffet for breakfast each day. It cost $4.99 per person with a player's card and was great. You can check out my pending review of that also on TA. We did eat dinner there one night. Great selection and we received a ticket for a glass of wine or beer which was included in the price of the meal. We don't play table games, so I can't comment on those. We don't gamble big at all, so my experience with the slots is limited. Having practiced my Jacks or Better for months, I was very disappointed to find only one low denom 8/5 machine, no low denom 9/6 machines at all. I found a couple in the $5 a pull range, but that was too rich for me! Casino was nicely laid out, somewhat smokey in areas, but in others I could hardly smell the smoke. No sickening piped-in perfume scent that some of strip casinos use (thank goodness). Pool area was much nicer than website makes it look. It was a nice-sized pool with whirlpool. It's enclosed to give a more secluded feel to it. They have new cabanas for use. We hardly ever had anyone in the pool with us - very quiet and relaxing space.

Because of the distance to the strip, about 7 miles, I would recommend renting a car. A free bus is provided by the hotel but a car is better. If you have already experienced the strip and want to relax in a quite atmosphere give Sam's town a try. They also have a very nice pool.

Also the price was really good. I love Sam's Town. It's Western themed. The lobby/atrium is a park/waterfall area sitting inside what looks like an old Western town facade. There are shows at night(music)and a laser show. Otherwise nature sounds are part of the ambience. Sam's Town's Firelight Buffet offers just about whatever you would want, and certain nights your meal includes a complimentary wine or beer. They have other retaurants, a Movie house and a Bowling Alley as well as of course swimming area. There is an RV resort next door which seemed very popular, but I can't speak to that area as I wasn't there. We parked our Penske truck in an outdoor parking area, and backed it up to the block wall for security. No problems at all. The room was very nice. We had a top floor. Sam's Town is a comfy sort of homey hotel(but nice) with lots of amenities. I would recommend it especially for anyone looking for some place more along those lines than the glamour and glitz (and expense)of the Strip area. The Strip isn't far away, and for the good price, it's a bargain in my opinion. Sam's Town has lots of awards for its gaming as well from the local reviews. My one caveat: get up and shower early; the demands on the hot water system kind of overwhelm during peak morning hour. The first morning, I waited until later and, although not cold, the water just wasn't as piping hot as I like it to be. Being from back East, rising early was easy for me to do anyway with the time difference. I'd just get up, shower, and get downstairs to the breakfast buffet at the Firelight. This morning I'm back home, and I truly miss my glass-elevator ride down to the Firelight Buffet for my yummy breakfast and hot coffee. And I really loved talking to the lady Chef who prepared my made-to-order omelet there; she was very personable as well as a good cook.

Nice selection of other restaurants, small arcade, nice ice cream parlor and decent food court. Slots didn't seem any looser than anywhere else. Could earn a free buffet with players club, but weren't there long enough to do so. The waterfall in the atrium is pretty. Would have liked to see the show at night with lights. Our kids felt like the wolf and bear were a bit corny, but they are pre-teens so the magic has worn off. Overall, I'd say that Sam's Town is a still a deal and if the glitz and luxury of the strip is not important to you...go for it! We'd likely go back and stay there again, but I'd avoid the weekend as it was just a mad house.", "Date": "August 18, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sam's Town Hotel and Gambling Hall", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d91675-Reviews-Sam_s_Town_Hotel_and_Gambling_Hall-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$39 - $102*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">5111 Boulder Highway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NV</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">89122</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "91675", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9f/16/9f16edd0cc97f591e32378f22f0c59571large.jpg"}}

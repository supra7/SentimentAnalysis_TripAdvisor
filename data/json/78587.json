In fact, it is a motel. Yes the rooms don't have a lot of furniture. Yes the beds are not the best.. Yes the hot tub was tiny. Yes you hear people moving above on the upper floor. Yes the tv had analog cable. However, the rooms are clean, the service was good and the location was centralized. Not to mention it is a budget hotel. ONE SUGGESTION the rooms allow too much light into the room making it difficult to sleep. Invest in curtains or better blinds. Stayed here through a Group On special which translated out to two nights for 140 bucks or so. So the 4 out of 5 rating has everything to do with price.

Any hotel review in Napa requires you keep your perspective. Napa is one of those places where $300+ a night rooms are common. My room was about $100 (Motel 6, next door, was about $20 less). The room was small, clean, with a mini fridge and microwave. Everything worked. Beds average for comfort. Dog friendly at $25 per dog per night; empty lot on side of hotel to walk them. One of the best dog parks in California, Alston Park, is a 5 minute car ride away. Starbucks just across the street. Hot tub not used but looked very clean. On the downside, you could hear creaking with every step of the person in the room above. Old non-flat panel tv with limited channels. Room heater a bit noisy. Convenient but busy location. Would stay here again. Booking note: While waiting to check in I overheard part of a conversation regarding some kind of problem with the room/reservation with another guest. The management was responding by telling the guest they couldn't do anything about the issue since they had booked thru a third party. The \"you didn't pay us, you paid them\" line. I see this more and more these days with hotels, airlines, etc. It seems to be a technique to encourage people to book directly with the business. I am not saying the Chablis Inn is a bad guy here; I don't know the specifcs. I am just pointing out the general issue of how one books travel and how it affects you if there is a problem.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Livingston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Accomendations!\u201d", "Author": "Lorrie L", "ReviewID": "UR123024607", "Content": "I recently spent several nights at the Chablis Inn.

My girlfriend and I decide on this place as this was part of a special for http://LivingSocial.com. She purchased me a package that included a 2-night stay for two complete with a complimentary bottle of red wine and a FREE tasting at Silenus Vineyards winery. For Napa, at $125, this is a great deal and we took full advantage of this amazing offer. As this review is focused mainly on the hotel, I will give you my full experience in the time I was here. We arrive on a Friday afternoon around 4:15pm as we checked into our room. We were both very impressed with the cleanliness of the room as well as how everything was laid out. As a nice added feature, there was a mini-refrigerator as well as wet bar, coffee maker (w/complimentary coffee & hot cocoa) an iron/ironing board, hairdryer, and TV armoire complete with about 20 channels on the TV. There was also a study area and the counter tops in the wet bar area and bathroom were of a nice granite which really made this little place look quite classy. In addition, the showers produced consistent hot water and the heater/air conditioner was up to par as well. I would have to say one of the only dislikes are that the beds are a little bit on the firm side. I guess I am spoiled considering I sleep on a queen size pillowtop at home but I almost had to always sleep on my back during my 2-night stay (even though I am mainly a side sleeper). One other minor complaint that my girlfriend had was that the wi-fi internet was a tad bit on the sluggish side (which was the primary reason for deducting a star on this place). Overall, this is a great location and what really sold us on this hotel was that it was in close proximity to everything; 1 block from Starbucks as well as the freeway & shopping; 3 blocks from Highway 29 and just a hop, skip, and a jump from Target & Whole Foods. We will definitely consider coming here again when we stay in Napa.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for pet-friendly hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Susan B", "ReviewID": "UR121647446", "Content": "Went for concert near by at Uptown theater.

I found this to be the best location for my needs, Starbucks across the street along with a grocery store and pizza joint. Target is a few blocks away for those items you may have forgotten. Easy on and off highway 29, and quick trips to the vineyards. Check in was easy and fast, we received a doggie treat bag, and saw two other families with dogs check in while we were in the office. Unlike other dog friendly places we've stayed (and paid more) the grounds showed no visible signs of 4 legged guests. Bath towels are probably the thickest I have used in a hotel, very nice.

The rooms were very clean, well-kept and pretty spacious, the bathroom water pressure/temperature/availability of towels was great, the staff was very nice and helpful. The pool was closed when we were there (due to the 6 weeks of rain the Bay Area was being flooded with at the time), but it looked very basic- concrete patio and privacy fence around it.

We sat in the hot tub outside and enjoyed some wine. Compared to the price of other lodgings in the area, I thought it was a good value.

It looks pleasant enough both inside and out. The redecoration works, the linens are nice, and it's clear more has been done to it than just throw a couple of cans of paint on the walls. The location is prime, and the surroundings are quiet. Two problems keep this motel from getting 5 stars. First, I have to knock off 1 star for noise from the surrounding rooms. The achilles' heel of this hotel is the motel-style door to the adjoining room. Even though you'll keep this closed and locked (unless you have kids in the next room), any noise in the next room blasts right through that door. People don't even have to be loud in order to be heard in the next room. This is quite annoying at 3 am. Second, I have to knock off one more star for the bizarre reservation system. You reserve a room like any other hotel - giving your credit card number to reserve the room, either by phone or via the web. Nevertheless, the motel will call you a couple of days before your visit and _require_ you to call back to confirm; if you don't, they'll sell your room out from under you. Be very careful if you're staying here as part of a long vacation and you're not going to be able to check (or you'll forget to check) your phone messages - you may find a nasty surprise waiting for you when you arrive.

Upon arrival, you notice the hot tub (big enough for 4 people) and the bean shaped pool in a private garden terrace next to the office. The staff was so friendly and made dinner suggestions within walking distance of the hotel. I went with the King and was so glad I did. The rooms come with a coffee pot, small kitchen area with a sink and cupboards, a full sized ironing board, a huge bathroom with big, fluffy towels, a desk with ample outlet space to charge up a laptop and cell phone. The room had a large screen TV with HBO and cable. The room was clean, comfortable and very nicely decorated. I would say the hotel was renovated within the last year or so.

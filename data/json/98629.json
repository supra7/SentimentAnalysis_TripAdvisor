Unfortunately we picked this hotel to stay in the night of our wedding. Big mistake. We were married on a Saturday and this hotel was a ghost town. Not to mention all the amenities we were promised, free breakfast, possible upgrade, were not granted. Even when we showed up in a wedding gown and tux they could have cared less. Our room was decorated in beige and brown and the TV was the size of a computer monitor. The bathroom was small and our view was of an office building about 100 ft away. Multiple times we tried to remind the staff we were newlyweds and that our reservation included breakfast, etc. and it fell on deaf ears. It was honestly so depressing to arrive at this hotel after the biggest night our life and quite frankly the biggest waste of our money. Upon learning our reservation was not honored (a few days later), they comp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d our bill $30 for the breakfast, and said they would look into the matter.

That morning actually started in Jacksonville, FL (another random destination) and, after a brief stop in Orlando, my colleague and I were re-routed to Dallas. Our employer booked us at the Crescent because it had been the site of a fundraiser held by a certain NY governor who, shall we say, was caught paying for female companionship. His resignation was delivered that day, in fact, and we were instructed to find folks who may have remembered details from his fateful night in Texas (we had moderate success). Anyhow, we arrived at the Crescent knowing nothing other than it was obviously a high-end property....a fact confirmed as soon as we entered the lobby and we saw the Indiana Pacers check in. It was hard not to stare. Thing got even more amusing the next morning when we saw the Charlotte Bobcats check out (both were in town to play the Mavericks that week). The hotel was spectacular and one of my favorites. The building is beautiful, the lobby opulent, the staff friendly. My room wasn't overwhelmingly big, nor was it the most modern I've been in. But it was certainly comfortable and well-appointed. My colleague and I ate that night at the Capital Grille next door and \"spectacular\" was an understatement. The hotel is also well-situated for exploring Dallas' nightlife, which we sampled, and the city's top sights (no time for that this trip). It's about a mile or so from downtown, and there's plenty of shops/restaurants/bars within a short drive or walk. The only negatives are the price: it's not cheap to stay there, period, plus you are charged more than you'd like for internet and valet parking. But those are minor complaints.

I'm just so tired of staying at places who rest their laurels on their very best properties (like the Rosewood Mayakoba, which is breathtaking and perfect in just about every way!) while letting others decline. I just feel like we pay too much for that. The one very impressive and redeeming quality about Rosewood Crescent is the valet staff.

Parking is a pain and self park is still 9$ a day. I would suggest going ahead and using the valet service. Its Dallas Tx and the pool is outside, and heated. So it wasn't so much refreshing as much as like old bath water. The pool texture cut the bottom of my toes to pieces. Kids loved it, guess I was just a stick in the mud but I didn't enjoy it.

Trolly is free and took us to more affordable dining and a grocery story :) yes I carried groceries into the swanky hotel because I wouldn't let my kids take the $4.50 kit kat bar out of the very full mini bar and snack draw provided in the room. overall I think I would have enjoyed my trip more if I hadn't been in sticker shock over the little things that over complicated what should have been the simple luxury of vacation.

Why can't the U.S. hotels offer some rooms with high quality firm beds? Is that a terribly difficult task, to have a few high quality firm beds for those who request them? When I made our reservations direct with Crescent Dallas hotel, the res. desk didn't know if beds were firm or soft, so she put me on hold and asked housekeeping for their opinion. Res. desk then told me beds were not pillow top and were firm new mattresses, so I booked the Metropolitan Suite. We requested a bed board and it was already in place when we arrived, but board did not make any difference, the bed was excruciatingly too soft. At 3 a.m., we were still unable to fall asleep due to this soft new mattress and our very sore backs. We phoned room service and asked for plain yogurt so that we could take some Advil to mask the back pain and allow us get some sleep. I sounded very tired on the phone, the room service gal felt sorry for us and had room service actually run up within 5 minutes with the yogurt. We fell asleep finally before our wake up call at 7:00. We were exhausted all day in our busy schedule and I hope we don't get sick from this stressful lack of sleep. Our Metropolitan Suite was lovely and came with free full breakfast ensuite.

The only thing we weren't keen on was the elevator bank, which only had 2 elevators that didn't work too quickly... but not a huge deal. The high caliber physical attributes of this hotel made us all the more surprised at the subpar customer service and general friendliness. Our first impression was not a good one. Although we arrived on schedule at about 2:30pm, we were told (rather bluntly, and in an unfriendly manner) that our room was not ready due to cleaning, and to check back in 25 minutes. To make up for it, the check-in guy phoned in a comp for some free Starbuck's coffee next door - which we appreciated. We were less comforted by the coffee, however, when two HOURS later, we still did not have our room. This was not amusing. If it had been an isolated incident I would let it go, but as this was a family wedding, we had the chance to hear the stories from numerous other guests. Shockingly, most of us had surprising wait times to get checked into our rooms (ranging from half an hour to more than 2 hours). The reason was always \"cleaning.\" Not acceptable for such a place. The valet service was quick, but the staff also generally unfriendly. No service with a smile there. We also had a lost item in the banquet hall where the reception had been held. We called to see if the staff could retrieve it, and they said it was gone... Of course, no one had actually looked, because we later found it just where she had left it. F for effort. Lastly, the maid service was overdone. It seemed like every time we got back to our room, someone had rearranged everything... including all of our clothes and personal belongings. This was unnecessary, and a burden, as we kept needing to sort through it all to our clothes. Unnecessary, and perhaps if they spent less time mettling with our stuff and instead focused on preparing rooms for guests, people could get checked in faster. Just a thought.

However, the poor restaurant staff, arctic air conditioning temperatures and hectic party scene detract from the hotel. In all, this reviewer mildly recommends staying at the Rosewood Crescent Court. First the problems: - the restaurant was beautiful, yet the staff seemed so distressed I actually was worried about one waiter's health. He was sweating all over the place (including in the food), clearly was on the verge of a nervous break down and was literally so ill that he poured coffee all over my mother-in-law and hardly could muster an apology. - for some reason, the hotel management decided high fifties is a reasonable temperature to set the A/C on. Bring a sweater, this place is freezing! - we had to contend with two booze powered reception/weddings with just hundreds of people wandering and stumbling around. All over the place, the hotel lost control of the party goers and it really detracted from the quality of the stay for the guests. The positives: - the staff was very cordial and nice throughout our stay. - the rooms were beautiful, well maintained and clean. - the location of the hotel was OK, but having seen Dallas now I know that a great location doesn't really exist.

He said something at the time that it was going to be on the outside instead of facing the interior courtyard and asked if that would be a problem. I understand now why this was a concern. It was a great corner suite, but the insulation is so bad and we had so many French doors, we heard every single car, truck, motorcycle and plane that went by! One set of doors banged every time the wind blew. Room 400 was quite noisy. Also, the bathrooms need bigger tubs and the beds could be more comfortable. The linens and duvets were nice, but the mattress was too hard for my taste. The management very kindly sent us a dessert for our anniversary which was very cool!

We also had a french door balcony that looked over the pool and courtyard. A few minutes later we recieved a cart with freshly chilled champagne, a mini wedding cake with white fondant icing and gooey chocolate inside, fresh flower, and a note from our GM that night.

When we arrived at the hotel, I asked the front desk if my special requests had been noted in the reservation and was told that nothing special had been noted. Told not to worry, that fresh flowers were placed in every room every day, and that the fruit basket and champagne would be on the way shortly. Needless to say, none of the above materialized. We never did get flowers, not even the ones that are supposedly placed in every room every day. After about two hours I called room service and asked where were the fruit basket and champagne.

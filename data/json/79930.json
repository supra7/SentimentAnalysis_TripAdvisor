I booked online and I \"Clicked\" on the Special Rate link. Much to my surprise when I checked out, I was charged the full price. The next day I received an e-mail from the manager adjusting my charges, and a promise that she would look into why they confirmation stated \"20% discount\" but the discount not applied. I was also compensated for the fact that the refrigerator was not on and my food spoiled..... I normally do not like indoor hotels (doors that open to closed corridors), but this hotel wasn't too bad. The room was nice and clean, the bed & pillow were comfortable, the noise wasn't too bad considering it is on a main drag and next to the airport. My suggestion is that if you want to sit on the balcony (as I do) you ask for a front facing room, for that is where the view is. I like that I was not charged a per day parking fee or a fake \"Resort Fee\". I was charged a \"Transient Tax\" by the City (?)... but I know I'm not a \"transient\", I am a vacationer! The staff was friendly and accommodating. There is excellent transit service. The buses run past markets, shops, drug stores, and restaurants and then stop at the transit terminal at Old Town where you can spend the day or catch the trolley to downtown, seaport village, or the border. The hotel is 3 miles from Sea World, the Padres' Stadium, Point Loma and right next door to Shelter Island.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Airlie Beach, Australia", "Title": "\u201cPost cruise stopover\u201d", "Author": "lynneozzy", "ReviewID": "UR126165502", "Content": "Great place to stay prior to cruise, great location with nice restaurants across the road and nice area to walk around Americas Cup Harbour.

Lots of nice restaurants within walking distance, Pizza Nova, Jimmy's Famous, Point Break, Red Sails, Mitch's Seafood, etc and also within walking distance to Liberty Station with Trader Joe's, Panera Bread, Five Guys and beautiful grounds (it was the Naval Training Station before being renovated). Great staff especially Jason who always seemed to be there with a smile and friendly attitude. Other staff worked very hard to keep the place clean.

We decided at the end of our trip to request a shuttle to the airport a day in advance to make sure they would have a driver available. The woman at the desk took down when we would need it, our room # and our names. She, and the other 2 women standing at the desk, confirmed it and said that it was all set up.

In our case on the sixth floor, the slats could not be closed properly, resulting in a chimney-like draft in the hallways. All rooms have a small balcony, and the seal on the door in our room was as as airtight as a burst balloon. While examining it, the upper third of the rubber seal fell down, the rest of it being very porous and just plain old (everything looked to be original from the day it was built). The amount of air passing through the door caused the curtains to move and would have sufficed to put out a candle. We had requested a non-smoking room, and when checking in I asked for a quiet room. This was on the sixth floor and I was puzzled that a non-smoking room would have an ash tray (another person in TripAdvisor commented this is the smoking floor, which then should not have been offered to us). We soon found out that smokers can use the balcony to smoke. The road in front of the hotel has expansion joints every twenty feet or so, and cars driving by give off a tuc-tuc-tuc sound all night (reminiscent of cobblestone roads in Germany). So we have a room that has a door that has effectively no seal, meaning we could hear each car going by all night long. The chimney effect in the hallways sucked air in through the balcony door, causing the heater to go on and off all night (we found no way of turning it off), plus the smoke from the room next door came in, turning our non-smoking room into a smoking room. We complained about the seal and maintenance was sent up. In keeping with everything else - they simply confirmed the door opened and closed properly. Nothing about the seal. We were offered a different room on the same floor, but standing in front of the balcony door we experienced the same draft as in our room, so we simply stayed put. I even considered buying some foam window seal at Wal-Mart to fix it, but decided the room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth the 5 bucks. As others have pointed out, breakfast is a disaster. Seating for 36 people. I counted 59 cars in the parking garage. You do the math, especially since many vehicles will have 2 or more passengers. Going into the breakfast room and hoping to find a seat requires a real optimist (or a fool). We drove around the corner to Dennys one day, and then grabbed some doughnuts at Winchell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (also just around the corner) the next day. The beds were OK and the room was clean, so no minus points there. The rooms have apparently been renovated in part (wallpaper, carpet), but the balcony doors look to be original equipment from when the hotel was built. The faucet handle on the vanity also looked to be original equipment (one of these handles you pull and pretty well limits you to all on or all off). The TV was an old Zenith picture-tube type. No telling how old it was. We checked out Saturday morning and Sunday morning we discovered my wife hat forgotten her keys. We called the hotel and somebody went up and retrieved the keys. Since we were planning to be in another BW hotel until Wednesday, I asked if they could be mailed using the post office guaranteed overnight service. I was given a number of reasons for not even trying something like that, rather than trying to find a constructive solution. Our confidence in the staff competence was somewhere down around the level of whale excrement in the ocean, and had no confidence whatsoever that the staff would be able to mail the keys to us anywhere, so we drove from Las Vegas to LAX via to San Diego to get the keys. Given that maybe only 2-3 people handled the key ring, it was pretty cheeky that one of them stole a small xenon flashlight from it. For a simple overnight, the hotel serves its purpose. We were not paying Hilton prices, so we did not expect Hilton service. On the other hand, I do expect a bit more than Motel 6. During our 10-day vacation we stayed in five BW hotels, and this was the absolute loser. We will never return - there are plenty of other hotels in the area for the same price that I would consider first.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cTerrible (non) sound proofed patio door!\u201d", "Author": "GabbaGabba", "ReviewID": "UR123781341", "Content": "Our family stayed here in January of 2012. We chose to stay here on the last night of our holiday so that we'd be close to the airport, car rental drop off and be able to use their laundry room facilities. Our check in went smoothly. We unloaded our suitcases and unfortunately on the way into the hotel from the parking area, there are about 8 stairs to climb before you enter the hotel lobby. Argh... We went to our room and got settled. It was clean, the bathroom was nice and bright and the sink area was separate and also well lit. The room was a fair size. Not big but not small either. The fridge and microwave were a good size and were spotless. One wall of our room was glass and had sliding doors out to the patio that looked out over some houses behind the hotel (run down dumps with garbage all over their property and one with a barking dog), it also looked out over the parking lot next door, Harbor Drive, the harbor and some restaurants across the street. Once we were settled in our room, I thought I'd get the laundry done and then we'd all head across the street to grab dinner before going to sleep. Problem 1:The laundry room was hard to find. It isn't shown on the hotel's map located in the \"welcome binder\" that you find in the room. All is said was that there was a laundry on the 2nd floor. I got off the elevator and sure enough I turned the wrong way. No biggie. When I finally did get to the room, I discovered, after putting coins in the washers, that the machine that sells soap was out. I went to the front desk and asked if they had some or if maintenance could refill the machine so I could get my laundry done. Nope. I was told that they had only one box (I needed two) and that the machines were not the hotel's. They belonged to some other company. The woman on the front desk then told me that I'd have to walk two blocks to buy laundry soap at a store if I wanted to do my laundry. Needless to say, I went back to my room, grabbed the car keys and headed off to find a grocery store. Not a very happy camper at this point. Once I got back and completed our laundry, I gave the jug of laundry soap to the woman at the front desk to offer to anyone else needing soap. She just looked at me and said \"oh\". It was at this point that my husband had a brain storm: why wouldn't the woman have offered you some of the hotel's soap? They have a laundry room where they wash the linens so they'd have soap to share since the laundry is supposed to be a hotel \"amenity\". Argh! Once the laundry was done, we got some food from a restaurant (Italian. Can't remember the name but it was awesome) and then settled in for sleep. Problem number 2: The restaurants across the street are handy so you don't have to drive to grab a meal but at night. Once you're parked you can just walk. But, here's the issue, there was all kinds of noise from patrons leaving them throughout the evening. I thought I had left the sliding glass doors open but had not. There was no sound proofing at all. It was terrible. We had an early morning flight and I was woken up at least once an hour, up until about 3 am. Not happy. Problem 3: The thermostat was out of order too. It was so hot in our room that the only way we could cool the room down was to turn on the air conditioner. We tried to turn off the unit but it wouldn't let us. Argh. Didn't stop for complimentary breakfast. It looked good but we wanted to get to the airport. I did use the computer to catch up on some emails. That was nice to have. Our check out was smooth. And our bill was what we were quoted. The location is great, the pool area looked nice (didn't use) If I didn't have to do laundry and the rooms were sound proofed from the outside noise (no inside hotel noise!), then we'd consider staying here again. But for what I needed, I was very disappointed in this hotel. Too bad it was our last experience in San Diego.

I do not remember receiving this information when I made our reservation(?). I have stayed in these rooms before. But this one was much more bare bones in the bathroom than others I have experienced.

It was central to what we wanted to do. My husband and I stayed here on the last leg of our vacation for 3 days and 3 nights. The price was okay, free parking was a BIG plus for us. The rooms were definitely clean, but our room was VERY small. We had a king bed in a non-smoking room and we could barely walk around the room. This wasn't a big deal for us, though, as we were rarely in our room except for at night. I also requested a room on the side of the hotel due to previous travelers comments about the road noise from North Harbor Drive. This statement I found to be very true. I consider myself a pretty heavy sleeper and the noise even woke me up! It is rather shocking how loud that road is being that we weren't even facing the street. That said, the hotel is very small and it apears that almost every room is within earshot of North Harbor so I don't think that can be helped. I also found that the walls in this hotel were extremely thin because we heard our neighbor's alarm clock, as well as their crying baby almost every morning. We could also hear people's conversations in the hallway, no matter what time of day it was. Overall, it wasn't the worst hotel we've ever stayed in, but I still think I might stray a little further away from some of the major thoroughfares in San Diego. The hotel was definitely clean, and the customer service members were friendly and helpful. The 24-hr business center was nice because I did not bring my laptop along and we needed to check in for our flight the night before we left.

Adriana, at the front desk was pleasant, helpful and happy to see us. She got us two rooms together even though it wasn't easy and she did it quickly. The rooms are small (a king bed dominates the room) but the clean and comfortable. The room has a desk, chair, fridge, microwave, tv - the usual things you'd expect. The bed had LOTS of pillows and the mattress was the most comfortable I have ever slept on in a hotel. The room looked out over a parking lot (as most do - your other view option is the street near the harbor) but I could care less. I had no intention of sitting on my deck in SAN DIEGO anyway - who stays in their room in SD!? The shower actually has heavy flow (unlike most hotels where you have to dance around in the shower to get wet) and a tub deep enough to soak in if you want to. My only drawback to the room would be somewhat small, no view, and need another outlet near the computer desk, but those are minor things. The pool is small but clean and a spa is available too. The workout room has a treadmill, bike, eliptical machine, towels, and inflated rubber ball and a weight machine. A bit warm in there, so if you like to sweat, you'll love it. And get there early - your card opens the door anytime and hotel staff do not enforce the hours. Breakfast is GREAT. Waffles, pastries, toast, fruit, yogurt, peanut butter, jam, hard boiled eggs, coffee, juices, tea...etc. You gotta love American style continental! Everything tastes good, but it gets crowded so go before 8 if you can. There are apples and sometimes even home baked chocolate chip cookies in the lobby during the day. Yes, there is traffic noise in the rooms since you are on a main street. If you need a \"sound soother\" (a small machine that emits \"white noise\") at night just ask. I called from my room for one and had it in less than 15 minutes. They're free and work great to drown out the traffic noise for those of you who find that a drawback to being at a centrally located hotel. Parking is free and this hotel is near EVERYTHING - literally less than 15 minutes away are the following - downtown SD, Old Town SD, the Zoo, Point Loma, all the military bases, the Midway Battleship, etc. Airport is 5 minutes away and there is a free shuttle. Carlsbad is 30 minutes away and Mission Bay is 20 minutes away and both are worth the drive. I had only one issue at the hotel - my shower knob fell off for some reason and it was replaced and fixed in less than 10 minutes. The maintenance guy apologized and was very pleasant. So, to sum it up - super friendly staff & great customer service, free parking, good breakfast, centrally located, clean & comfy.

The hotel balconies are tiny and have no furniture, therefore they are pretty much useless. The sliding door on our balcony didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shut properly. The hotel is old and extremely outdated and looks so much worse than it does in the online pictures. The breakfast was pretty much a fend for yourself type of brawl, i'm not sure how the hotel expects its guests to fit into that tiny room, maneuver theirselves around the hordes of people and then actually find a place to sit at one of their five tables. Between the street noise, and the noise from the rooms, it was difficult to sleep without the earplugs. The beds are cheap and uncomfortable. The toilet kept flushing and we had to call the service twice. We had to get our room key rekeyed 5 times during our 7 day stay. I wish we would have packed the first night and left. I have stayed in many hotels and I must say this was the worst experience I ever had. I was extremely dissapointed with the Best Western Chain. This is an overpriced hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deserve more than 1 star.", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ashland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cThe start of a Great Vacation :)\u201d", "Author": "OHTom&Cheryl", "ReviewID": "UR101881172", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel 2 nights prior to boarding a cruise ship to the Mexican Riviera.

The traffic noise at night was unbearable, and no, there was not even a fan in the bathroom to help drown out the sound. On the third night there was a knock on our door at 1:00 AM. yes, 1:00 AM and it was someone from the front desk who didnt speak english, he just said,\"keys for room #605\" my husband replied, \"this is room # 401\". but the guy just repeated it, and handed my husband the keys. So we called the front desk and the clerk just said,\"oh, i guess he had the wrong room.\" uhhhh...... ya think???? it was one in the morning and the guy had the wrong room and woke up our entire family and thats all you can say???? Also, every hour the air conditioner made a HUGE banging noise that kept us awake, it was pretty much a long miserable night.

You can't beat the location-about 5 minutes from the airport, 5 minutes from Ocean Beach and Sunset Cliffs and 2 minutes from the Harbor. No airplane noise, which was great! Plenty of conveniences nearby just a few streets over: Post office, grocery, starbucks, fast food of all sorts, shops, gas stations, great restaurants and cheap eats too! The beds felt brand new as did the bedding. Clean bathroom and carpeting, comfortable chairs and spacious. We liked that the toilet and shower were closed from the vanity area so we could both get ready and not have to stand in a sauna if one was showering. We'd stayed at the Sheraton on Harbor Island once before and the rooms were extremely small so this was nice to have room to move about in. We used the chairs as our suitcase stands and never bumped into anything. The room had a large closet nook with a good iron and ironing board as well as a very good sized fridge (even had a freezer drawer) and microwave. We visited the heated (but not too hot) pool which was nice with a good number of chaises and chairs, as well as umbrella tables for 4. The parking was also very convenient and the best part--free! There is a parking garage that hoops around the back of the hotel that you can get in/out of from either driveway. There is a small front driveway for check-in marked Fire Lane, but we saw people dropping off/picking up so it's ok to park there for a few minutes. The front was the only ramp accessible entrance to the lobby we saw. Though not an issue for us, but could be for some--from the parking garage there is about a 10 step staircase to get to the lobby. We paid about $10 extra per night to have the Harbor view and it was beautiful. There is one little problem with being on the harbor side--the street noise from Harbor Drive. I think because of the curvature of the building, the noise is captured from the street, so if you have a harbor view, you may awake to sounds of cars. It's not that there's a lot of traffic--the Point Loma area is great because it's not really traffick-y but even one car going about 45 is oddly loud. Could be the material used for the road, but just a warning. The negatives for our stay were minor. The towels were in good shape but weren't really thick like some other hotels, the vanity lighting was not as bright as I'd like but there was also lighting near the full length mirror as well. We would have liked suitcase stands (I'm not one for unpacking into the drawers) and an in-room safe, but we had no trouble with the staff, so I guess we didn't need it--we're just used to having them. The hotel breakfast room seemed about the size of a hotel room so it was Definitely not large enough for more than about 12 guests to sit. We had cereal and juice once, but decided to walk one block up on Harbor Drive to eat at Winchell's donuts most mornings (fabulous donuts by the way!).

We also chose this hotel because we are Best Western points collectors and don't like to spend tons of $$ on rooms that you mostly just sleep and shower in. We were not disappointed on any of our requirements. The hotel (not apartment) has been obviously recently updated, clean, fresh, new furniture. We had a harbor view room, great view but in our late forties we had no problem standing (due to lack of furniture) to enjoy the view. The road noise is mostly in the peak rush hour times but did no bother us. At check in we were given a rate that was different than we booked, easily rectified with my confirmation print out, at no time did I feel that I was being ripped off, I put it down to initially booking with the National call center and then adding a night and taking part in a more recent 20% off promo for Best Western Rewards members by calling the hotel directly. The front desk staff was always friendly, courteous and helpful. The hotel was very clean, our room as well, nice King with fridge and microwave, no water problems. The cleaning staff did use an air freshener in the rooms and hallways that I requested to not be used in our room and they honored this request with out a problem. The breakfast provided was up to Best Western standards, pastries, waffle makers, apples, oranges, toast, cereals, breakfast burritos, three kinds of juice, tea and coffee (Starbucks).

We used the computer in the lobby for local information and to check email from our kids, possibly a sign limiting use would be helpful, some people don't seem to like to share.

I like to check out hotels for my clients and I figured this one might be good because they shuttle to and from the airport and the cruise ship terminal in San Diego. After staying here for 2 nights, I don't think I would recommend it. First off... when we drove up to the hotel, there is no front drop off parking. It looks like there is an area for it, but there is a sign that says No parking / Fire lane. So we had to drive around to the side of the building and bring our luggage to the lobby. As you drive up you kinda look at the place and wonder why it looks like an apartment. We were apprehensive right from the start. Second... when we checked in the guys didn't seem very organized and couldn't handle more than 1 person checking in. Someone butt in front of me and nobody said anything. Then when we got our room, we took our luggage and wandered to our room. As we were walking there I mentioned to my husband about being on the first floor and that it would seem they are putting us in the bad room because we got such a good rate... boy was I right. Our room was just barely bigger than a Manhatten hotel room. We couldn't even fit the luggage cart into the room. They also gave us a room facing the construction. We figured that is where we had to stay because we got a good rate. Once I turned on my laptop and found out the internet wasn't working there, we went back to the desk and told them to get that fixed. At this point a lady was at the desk and she seemed much more effecient. She found us another room, that was way bigger and the internet worked. So we took it. Third issue... I think truly this is an old apartment because the sound travels everywhere. The patio door to the outside seems to be very thing and you can whisper outside at the street and you can hear it in the room. It was horrible. I don't think the door closed properly, but even so, the sound was horrible. We got woken up one morning at 1am and had to phone down to customer service to inform them that a bunch of guys where in the pool smoking pot and partying. Since the pool is just around the corner from the lobby, I don't understand why they didn't hear it. The ladies who were at the front desk where great and always helpful. The cleaning staff was good and the continental breakfast was better than I had expected (considering the hotel). I don't even think for the price (travel agent rate), I would stay there again. It was way to noisy and the fact that they gave us that horrible room in the first place, was a bad first impression. I won't be recommending it to my clients. If you are forewarned about this place, then it is ok. Everything was clean and it was so nice and close to everything. Maybe if they did some updates to the rooms and made it look a little more like a hotel and not an apartment, it would be ok.", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Rafael, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, fantastic value\u201d", "Author": "runbkswm", "ReviewID": "UR53492022", "Content": "I don't get some of the other reviews on this site.

We booked this hotel based on the price (as my retired grandmother and mother-in-law are on tight budgets) and it's proximity to all the attractions we wanted to see. I was amazed at just how close it was to the airport without feeling like we were on the runway as well as just how close it was to all amenities (10 minutes to Sea World, 5 minutes to the Zoo, many restaurants and a grocery store within minutes). The rooms are basic but clean, the bathrooms look like they've recently been renovated, and quite sound-proof (my parents were in the room beside us and couldn't hear the kids at all). The rooms do seem like they are a touch on the small side, we felt a little cramped with 3 suitcases in there but not to the point of being annoying. There was a mini-fridge and a microwave in the room which was fantastic for us with small children. My only minor complaints was that the \"continental breakfast\" was quite minimal and by our 5th day the breads/muffins/etc were stale and there was only a couple of bruised apples and under ripe oranges for fruit. The other was when we checked in there was a discrepency over the price - I had booked via the 1-800 number and was quoted an AAA rate of $89/night. However when I checked in they told me I was wrong and the rate they had was $99/night. Fortunately for me I had my printed e-mail confirmation and once I showed this to the front desk agent she immediately corrected it, but I wonder what would have happened had I not had that. Overall I would definately stay at this hotel again as would the rest of my extended family. You definately cannot beat the price and the great location to everything.", "Date": "November 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Hills", "Title": "\u201cI can't wait to come back\u201d", "Author": "LaurenWestHills", "ReviewID": "UR37563130", "Content": "What a great place.

The bed was super comfortable, and the room amenities (microwave, coffee, fridge, ironing board & iron) made our stay very comfortable. The pool and hot tub where a great place to relax after a day of sightseeing, and they have an exercise room also, if you are so inclined (not while on vacation, please). The location was excellent. We walked 2 blocks to a bus stop, for a direct bus to Old Town, then took off from there on our adventures. Also, can walk along the water to a great park.

The short taxi ride was $10.00, so if you weighing trip price into your hotel equation take this into consideration.

Maybe they will work out the kinks once they finish remodeling, but it was an irritating place to stay after a long flight.

They DID reimburse us, but we were still out the tip to the taxi driver. We booked two queen beds and got ONE king size. When we called down, it took a while for them to come with a new key. A maintenance guy brought it, and didn't ask for our old keys until I volunteered...It is scary to stay in a place that doesn't have good security on keys. My brother got a smoking room despite asking for non-smoking. The air conditioner unit in the ceiling dripped water on us every time we walked by--and since it was in the hallway, we got wet a lot. It had a coffeemaker, but not a coffee POT. When I called the front desk, they weren't sure they had another! But they found one--forty minutes later.

Well, I don't know if it has, but there are some positives that should be mentioned. We had 3 rooms in our party. Luckily, we were only staying for 1 night. We came in on a train from LA and we needed to stay a night before our cruise the next morning. I called the hotel just as our train got to the San Diego station. The lady on the phone was very friendly and she said they'd send a van over right away. By the time we got off the train and walked over to the taxi area with our bags, they were already there waiting for us. The hotel is about 4 miles from the Amtrak station, so it was very handy that they have a shuttle van. We got to the hotel and checked in without problems. The lobby is now renovated and looks very nice. Same with the elevators. Our rooms, however... The first room was kind of smelly and the tub faucet was running. I couldn't get it to stop. So I called down and they gave me a new room. This room was fine. It wasn't renovated that I could tell, but a bacis room with 2 queen beds. But hey, what do you expect from a Best Western. Our 2nd party had the same problem and they also got a new room. But around 10pm, their AC unit started dripping into the room and again had to change rooms. Our 3rd party had a decent enough room. So that's the only bad parts. But again, the front desk was friendly and resolved the issues. In the morning, we had their free breakfast. Nothing exciting. Cereal, breads, danishes, coffee, juice, some microwave egg sandwiches. Can't complain. Again they were friendly upon checkout and our 2nd room folks got a bit of a discount for having to change rooms so late in the evening. During check-in, we had reserved a time slot for our ride over to the cruise terminal and they were ready to take us when we went down to the lobby. Again, this was a nice service and saved us from paying for a taxi. In case it helps anyone, the cruise terminal is back in downtown about 3 blocks from the Amtrak station. So the morning after our cruise, we just hiked over to the Amtrak and caught our train back to LA. And also, if you need something to eat while at the hotel, there were several restaurants within walking distance. Also, just 2 blocks away was a bus stop. And that bus takes you straight into Old Town, or you can transfer there to just about anywhere in the city.", "Date": "August 10, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BEST WESTERN Yacht Harbor Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d79930-Reviews-BEST_WESTERN_Yacht_Harbor_Hotel-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$100 - $156*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">5005 N Harbor Dr</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92106</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "79930", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3d/36/3d3630aca0caf084cebbf70232fc9b895large.jpg"}}

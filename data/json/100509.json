We weren't disappointed! It's just like others have described it...a hostel for Adults. People were walking around in pyjamas at night/early morning and it just had a very cozy cool vibe. It's not your typical hotel so if you aren't flexible and open to new things you'll have a bad experience. Don't go! The continental breakfast was simple but fun. Fresh waffles, good Stumptown coffee, and clean. We were upgraded to room with its own washroom at no extra charge because I mentioned it was my wife's birthday. They also included a nice birthday greeting in our room. To everyone at Ace: keep on doing what you're doing!

Though it doesn't always succeed or grow on a smooth path, it is awesome to watch a concept transform and breed new iterations of the original. That's how I would frame the Ace Hotel phenomena that's swept from west to east. I'm very familiar with the New York offspring of this Seattle original. Very cool, celeb chef in their restaurant, lounge for a lobby and some serious partners names partnered up: Stumptown Coffee in the front, Opening Ceremony in the back and more I'm sure to come. All that swagger grew out of an original hotel in Seattle. One which still offers excellent pricing for both European-style rooms (ahem, bathroom outside of the room) and Deluxe suites ($199 and worth every penny). The staff is friendly and accommodating; though please remember that the front door locks at midnight so grab that key before hitting the town! The modern design and simple but ultra cool decor feels opulent in comparison to your run of the mill big box hotels. WiFi is free to use and besides your room, you can choose to work in the front shared area with the terrarium or event downstairs in the dining area. Oh yea, in addition to WiFi and super sweet rooms, they offer a continental breakfast that includes a waffle maker and Stumptown Coffee. And a copy of the New York Times. Location-wise, it's just outside of the touristy area so Pike Place Market is only a 15 minute stroll away and the streets are very walkable. In my opinion, there's no better place to stay in Seattle for that price!

The location in Belltown is excellent and in easy walking distance to restaurants, bars, shops and Pike Place Market. Staff were really friendly and helpful and seemed keen to chat and offer advice. The self-serve continental breakfast was good (I particularly liked the make-your-own waffles) and the lack-of ensuite bathroom wasn't an issue due to the sheer number of shared bathrooms. One downside for us was that our room was right above The Cyclops Bar and therefore pretty noisy. We'd been in the bar earlier (excellent burgers and cocktails - I recommend the Pink Eye) but the music seemed to go on pretty late and we didn't get an amazing nights sleep. But I imagine our room was the noisiest as we were right above it and we didn't ask to move, so can't complain too much.

The location was good to, about halfway between Pike Place and the Space Needle. We were initially unsure about sharing a bathroom with the other guests, but it was fine. I figured that people pay hundreds of pounds to stay at spa hotels and wander round in their robes, and this was no different! The bathrooms were all spotlessly clean, and there was always one free. The staff on reception were always friendly and helpful, making fab recommendations for eating/drinking. We would never have found Bathtub Gin without them! But I have to turn to the downsides. Our first night there was a Saturday, and it was pretty noisy from the bar downstairs until about 0230. We were also in the middle of a random heatwave, and with no air con in the room, just a desk fan, it was HOT! I am keen on a cold room, so others may not have had as much of an issue as me. It's true there was no wardrobe, but we were living out of out cases anyway, so we weren't worried about that. I guess the othernthing would be the size of the room, about the size of a double (not the master) bedroom in a modern house in the UK. We thought it was OK, but probably smaller than most would expect, especially in the US.

Once my boyfriend and I arrived in the city (around 10 AM), we simply parked by the Ace and asked them where their paid parking was. The receptionist was incredibly helpful and told us we could check in early and take advantage of the parking lot right then (which was a huge relief since I hate dealing with parking). With the room, it was a bit smaller than I thought it would be, which irritated my boyfriend a bit. I thought the room was cute and since we were simply there to sleep, I had no problem with it. The bed was comfy and I found the bathrooms to be incredibly clean. As for the breakfast, I loved that it went until noon (because that meant my boyfriend and I could eat a little something upon checking in). I have to give another shout out to the receptionists because they were extremely helpful with directions. The one thing that got a bit on my nerves was the noise, which kept me up that night.

The room was above a bar, with a loading/delivery zone on one corner and a bus stop on the other. The noise was staggering and continued all through the night and into the morning when we had to wake early to go feed the meter. Also the glowing light from the hall showing through the window above the door was annoying and I never saw it turned off. The next day we requested to move (and in fairness the rest of the staff we dealt with were very nice and accommodating) but we were unable to move until the following night because the hotel was full. On a plus side, the shared bathrooms were never an issue finding one free, and the breakfast did include coffee, tea, fresh waffles, toast, granola, juice, yogurt and apples. There are also piles of good magazines available for guests, and robes in the rooms to use. The second night I slept slightly better because I used earplugs (which I do not find an acceptable solution) and we did again have to wake early to deal with the car.

I guess the ascetic style, if style is the right word, might be sorta hip in this overly materialistic age (although the room rates at the Ace suggest that the facility's management is not itself overly concerned with excessive materialism). But the thing with the almost-all-white interiors is that they show every fingerprint on doorjambs, cabinets, and window blinds in startlingly black and grimy detail. As to the sparse furnishings, one wonders, Can cheapness be hip? If so, let me put the question more precisely. Is cheapness hip, when it finds expression as particle-board furniture with skin-thin plastic veneer peeling from every corner? Is cheapness hip when it takes the form of an ugly white vinyl window blind adorned with greasey black fingerprint stains all along its lower margin. The stark white vinyl roller blinds, failing badly as an element of interior decoration, at least have the virtue of being easy to clean. But perhaps too much hipness would be lost with the disappearance of a few black fingerprints. Surely hipness must be more easily distinguishable from flop-house-ness. Okay, the flophouse comparison is too harsh (but after another year or so of downhill slide, might not be too far off the mark). A fairer comparison is a typical college dorm room, which would probably be slightly filthier, but with furniture in better condition. So if you think a college dorm room would be a hip place for grownups to hang out, then you'll probably like the Ace. Really, that's it.--a dumpy college dorm room painted white--complete with crumbling particle board furniture--except I forgot to mention the bathroom in our \"deluxe room\" had a sink that looked a lot like the ones in train sleeper cars in Europe. Wow, how cool is that!?!? Not particularly convenient, as anyone who's ever used a sink in a train car can attest--but how totally cool! And not only did they put one of those sinks in the bathroom, they also put a second one in the bedroom area, too, right where you'd expect to find a nightstand. Since there was no nightstand, we used the sink as a nightstand. No closets, no drawers, no nightstand, but two cool sinks. How cool is that?!?! So when you are brushing your teeth in the morning at the Ace, standing there in front of one of those cool metal sinks almost just like the ones in a Wagon Lits Sleeper, it might make you feel almost like you might have some vague spiritual connection with some really hip place that some really hip train in Europe could take you to. I guess I'm too old to know for sure whether the Ace Hotel is hip or not hip, but I will say that the physical condition and look of the place--the dirty dumpy dorm room style--manifests nothing beyond an immature aesthetic sensibility and a poorly supervised housekeeping staff. My guess is that the Ace's claim to hipness, though perhaps true years ago, has devolved down to a hollow marketing theme--a marketing theme that also serves quite well to disguise and excuse an uninspiring cheapness, a disconcerting uncleanliness, and a run-of-the-mill laziness. Or maybe I'm just not hip. Aside from its deteriorating physical condition, the Ace has other deficiencies, of which the overly \"casual\" attitude of its staff of never-quite-grew-up-thirty-year-old teenagers is among the least serious. Much more disturbing: Almost two months before my stay at the Ace, I had reserved and paid in full, in advance, for a \"deluxe room with king bed.\" Upon my arrival, my wife and I were sent to the small, dingy room described above. The bed would be king-sized only for a pygmy monarch--barely six feet long and four feet wide, which does not qualify even as queen-sized and is actually a bit smaller than an ordinary double bed. The staff placed us in this depressing room with its tiny bed without giving an explanation or apology, and apparently would have kept silent about the switch if I had not spoken up. When I told the clerk at the desk that there must be some mistake and that we wished to be moved to a \"deluxe room with king bed\" as described on my reservation receipt, he replied that I could not be moved to another room because the hotel was full. He suggested that the problem was the fault of hotels.com, through whom we booked and paid for the room, but when I called hotels.com customer service, they did not accept responsibility. (The fact is, I don't care whose fault it was; I know it wasn't my fault!) The Ace clerk offered that, since the rack rate for the room I had been given was $20 less than the discount rate that I had negotiated in advance for a \"deluxe room with king bed,\" perhaps a small refund could be arranged. I explained that, even with a refund, I would not have freely chosen to stay in the room I had been given. I would not have freely chosen to have slept in that room at a rate of a half or a third of what they proposed to charge. Indeed, I would not have freely chosen to sleep in that room, much less to bathe in that bathroom, even for free. Eventually, I was promised a slightly larger refund, which I have since received from hotels.com. Yet even if they had let me have the room for free, I would have much preferred to pay more for a better room in different hotel. Unfortunately, with the \"Bite of Seattle\" in full swing only few blocks away, there was nothing readily available except at an airport hotel. My wife and I were on vacation celebrating a \"big\" wedding anniversary (I won't say which \"big\" anniversary because you might conclude that I'm too old to understand true hipness), so I did not want to upset things by wasting precious vacation time disputing with the hotel management or searching for other accommodations. So, under extreme protest, we took the refund, bought a bottle of mold and mildew remover to spray down the shower, and stayed our three nights at the Ace. But Never Again! I don't care how hip they want people to think they are. One last irony that might provide some contrast: It so happens that the weekend before our weekend at the Ace, my wife and I stayed at the Seattle Pan Pacific, which is just a few blocks east. The rates for the two hotels are essentially the same (the Pan Pacific was actually cheaper if you don't count the refund we eventually got at the Ace), but other than that, there is no comparison between the dumpy and worn-out Ace and the lovely and comfortable Pan Pacific, with its interestingly and artfully decorated rooms, done in a contemporary pan-asian style; with its true king or queen beds; with its sumptuous bathrooms with huge jacuzzi tubs and separate walk in showers; with its well-maintained furnishings; and with its professional, polite, solicitous, yet discreet staff. Instead of splitting our Seattle time between the two hotels, I do so wish that we had just stayed on at the Pan Pacific.", "Date": "July 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cAn ace hotel!\u201d", "Author": "bitsycat", "ReviewID": "UR18082462", "Content": "A very reasonably priced hotel in a great location in Seattle.

Our room wasnt ready when we got there (4 hours before check in) but our wait was only about 15 minutes. When we got into our room we were so excited..we had room 106. It was very chic/hip. Bright white walls and a stainless steel sink. A flat screen tv attached to the wall and a view to die for...perfect for people watching! The hotel is right across the street from the Belltown Market, a little convienience store, and Belltown Pizza. The Cyclops downstairs was great. My friend and I both suffer from insomnia, and while yes it was very noisy outside, it didnt phase us one bit. We joked that our bed must have had sleeping crack in it! We slept like babies! The people at the front desk were great...Ed actually told us the best ferry to ride and where to go(we went to Bainbridge Island on his recomendation and it was beautiful!) The bathrooms were clean..and having to leave the room to shower was not a problem, they offered shampoo,conditioner, and bodywash in the shower. Breakfast was great. Coffee was strong. You could generally never tell that anyone else was staying at the hotel unless you saw them in the hallway. The employees leave the hotel at midnight and your room key works as the front door key...not a problem what so ever. The mirror in our room had the phrase \"you are beautiful\" etched into it.

I may have children, but I still want to enjoy hip places and cool design etc...so, rather than stay at a boring run-of-the mill hotel - we opted for the Ace Hotel's digs. In order to ensure maximum uninterrupted sleep - we booked our own separate rooms. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were informed that the hotel was full and that there was a mix-up with our online reservation and that we only had one room with a small queen-sized bed (supposedly it was a deluxe room) in it. Normally I would \"suck it up\", and accept that this was just a simple mistake - but this time I was really annoyed. My irritation was partially attributed to the overall nonchalant attitude of the uber-cool reception person - who didn't really attempt to compensate us beyond a slightly lower rate for the room. In fact, as she checked for our reservation on her computer she printed a sheet off and refused to let us look at it when my friend asked if she could see it - wanting to cross-reference the information on the sheet against what we had written on our reservation. It was strange, so much so that it appeared as though the mistake had been made on their part - but they didn't want to admit to it, and were quick to blame the online booking system. There was almost an inference that somehow it was our fault for booking online. To add insult to injury, we were also told after shelling out a small fortune for parking at a lot across the street, that we could have had our parking at a reduced rate at another lot - not easily marked. Once in the room, we found it dingy and not as charming as the photos on their web-site would suggest. However, we did see a couple of other rooms when we were walking down the corridors, that looked a lot better than our room did. Anyway, aside from being a great location and decently priced - it was the overall experience that just wasn't impressive. A few days later I received an email from the hotel thanking me for staying with them etc...\"we hope you enjoyed your stay with us...etc...\" and I responded with an email outlining my frustrations with our accomodation. This is not like me - but this time around, I really needed to air my dissatisfaction. The hotel's manager replied with an apologetic email and offered a discount on a later night's stay - to be redeemed by May 1st, 2008. This seemed like a positive response to our negative experience and I planned to return to the hotel with my husband for a romantic get away. Well, the so-called compensatory offer was never acknowledged. In my multiple attempts to contact the manager with a specific date and weekend in my messages - NOTHING. He did not return my messages. So much for that! I don't know what happened, as there was no reply at all. I guess the hotel doesn't need my business! Anyway, perhaps my experience was an isolated case.

The early complaints about the windows not having any privacy have been resolved; they've added shades to the windows. The weather was mild so we didn't get a chance to try out the heating, but the air conditioning works well. As far as the noise goes, we stayed in a room 114 and slept fine--but even if noise is a concern, they provide ear plugs for your convenience. The room does come with a Kama Sutra book and condoms, laid ever so complacently by the bed. The room came equipped with a sink, a mirror above it that tells you you're beautiful, a hand soap dispenser, a vanity bar area with a tall mirror, a small desk with a small TV and an alarm clock, 5 hangers, 2 of which were occupied with bath robes, and towels. There's also a very modest snack bar (basically snacks inside a drawer) that you could grab for a price. The bathrooms were clean and come with a heater. Music plays softly through the speakers in the bathroom too. We stayed across the hall from the bathrooms so that was quite convenient for us. The kitchen/lounge area has an HD TV, serves Teaosophy tea and coffee, has a vending machine with very interesting items in there (i.e. Korean Pocky, popcorn, a deck of cards, caffine gum, hangover drink mix, and the standard potato chip fare, just to name a few), a drink machine next to it that has Aranciata (but we have NO idea how the vending itself works! There are no coin slots or buttons ...), and of course ice. Continental breakfast was great--includes milk, soy milk, OJ, granola, toast, and fruit. Light, healthy but quality selection. The staff was very friendly and helpful; we'd asked so much of them (i.e. storing the salmon we'd bought in their fridge, holding our luggage while we went sightseeing on the last day, calling us a cab late at night ... and more!) and they were very willing to accommodate accordingly. Overall, our stay was pleasant. The only complaint I could muster up was that the room was stuffy when the AC wasn't turned on, but that's quite minor. Yes, the mattress isn't memory foam or soft for that matter, and yes the blankets are coarse and Army surplus blankets, but quite honestly, for a place considered a 2 star hotel and for a 99 dollar a night stay, I wasn't expecting down comforters and memory foam mattresses (and am glad they don't have it as I am allergic to down), and I don't think anyone else should either. I'd choose this over the shabby, impersonal one star motels any day.

My husband and I were among the oldest guests of the hotel, by several years, but we never felt uncomfortable or unwelcome. Justin was so helpful when I called BEFORE our stay, recommending Dollar rental cars as they not only give discounts to Ace guests but also waive the fee for returning the car to the airport instead of the pickup site. (Both John and Jessica at Dollar were extremely nice too!).This arrangement allowed us to travel down to family in Gig Harbor and then use the car to return to the airport the next day. Justin also informed us that we would most likely have to change rooms on the last night of our 3 night stay, due to a snafu with our hotel.com reservation. Once at the Ace, we were warmly welcomed by Jibriil who showed us our room on the lower level. I was a bit surprised as Hotels.com had \"guaranteed\" a king size bed and we had a double. I asked Jabriil about the mixup (never having booked through hotels.com before) and he explained that there must have been an overlap in the booking. The room and bed were comfortable and a decent size with a large clean bathroom. I'm not that high maintenance, but do like to read at night, but there was no reading lamp in the room, just overhead recessed lighting. Jabriil came to my rescue with a small reading lamp and extra pillows. All were clean-pillows obviously sprayed with lysol between uses-but no biggie. The only thing missing in that room was a place to hang clothes and a couple more hangers. On the last night we did indeed have to move to a smaller room. Same size bed, smaller bathroom-a bit noisier as it was next to the stairwell. Still, we were quite comfortable and slept well. So the plusses: Justin and Jibriil-definitely they are the nicest guys, unpretentious , friendly, helpful. The location in Belltown is in the heart of all the under 30 hipness, but we over 30's , un-inked, non-smokers did not feel too out of place! The minuses: booking through hotels.com (I'm not sure the price of the rooms through them were the same as if we had booked directly through the hotel) and having to switch rooms. We would stay here again, but next time book directly through the hotel and request the rooms with larger beds. Still, it truly is the people who make the difference.

Here is why you should choose the Ace (according to us): Location. The Ace is in Belltown, we walked everywhere we went, and we found that belltown was the perfect spot. The best resturants, and close to the free bus zone if you can't stand the walk. We even took the bus back to the airport (it only cost $4.00!) *try the Macrina Bakery, and Marco's Supperclub which is located across the street from the Ace! Price: for what we paid $85.00, we didn't expect much of anything. But, we received first class treatment for almost nothing! Our room was one of the cheapest rooms they offer (shared bathroom, no view) and we liked that. It was very cozy, and the shared bathrooms were always clean! Believe me, I was scared of the idea of shared bathrooms, but at the Ace, I prefer it. The showers are huge, and they pump in soft music. Our room was clean, and the hotel itself was beautiful. Modern, and crisp. The breakfast in the morning was great too! Fresh juice, milk, toast, fruit; we were always happy to eat down in the cute kitchen area. Staff: I can honestly tell you that the staff at the Ace hotel is and was the best we had ever met. They always were willing to look things up for us online, give info, loan dvds, and a dvd player to the guests, give out free magazines---just all around helpfull.

But the rooms are funky modern, and if you get a room with 'shared bath', then they give you bath robes and it's just fun! You have to be OK with shared baths and a little noise (ask for a room facing the side street or back of the hotel). Otherwise, you are in the best neighborhood of seattle- accessible to seattle center, tons of great bars and restaurants (for casual try belltown pizza and cyclops- they'll surprise you with great food and very stiff drinks!, for a nicer meal out try Zoe, and for breakfast you MUST walk across the street to Macrina bakery for a morning glory or rocket muffin- all food places are within 5 blocks of the Ace Hotel), fish market/pike place, the waterfront, downtown shopping, etc. You are also only a couple blocks from the 'free ride zone' on the buses to get you anywhere you want to go downtown.

The hotel is decent, but more like a 2 star based on my experiences. Overall my experience has been just ok. The room is a \"deluxe\" room according to the hotel, which isn't very deluxe-it just means I get to avoid sharing a bathroom. So here's my summary: Pros: Location-Plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from. Convinience store across the street. And an easy walk to downtown about 10 minutes. For those who don't want to walk, there's a bus stop right outside the hotel with frequent service. If you walk a block or two further closer to downtown, you'll be within the \"free ride\" zone to save yourself a 1.25/1.50 at rush hour. Wireless Intenet included The hotel is clean. Small continental breakfast included featuring toast, granola cereal and juice included in price. Cons: No elevator at the entry, so you have to climb a decent flight of stairs to the reception area. Not a big deal for the young, but could be a hassle if you've got heavy luggage. Receptionists seem friendly enough, but you can tell this is part-time work for them, and they don't seem to be all that interested in the comings and goings of people. I've walked past them numerous times at all hours of the night without so much as a look up to see who is coming into the hotel, or to give a simple greeting. Rooms are small, just enough for a bed, and a tiny desk and chair. And I'm in the \"deluxe.\" Decor is trying to be boutique-y, but to me it just looks like a sanatorium. Walls in the hallways and rooms are all white. There is no closet or drawers to speak of, so your luggage and clothes are on the floor in an already small room. You do have metal hangars hanging from a coat hanger on the wall which you can hear clanking at night and in the morning from the adjacent room. Bathroom is ok size, but looks cheap, with only a stand-up shower and toilet with open u-faced seating like in an airport or store, which isn't a big deal except that the towel holder is placed right above it, and to get a folded, stacked, and jammed in there towel out, it's easy to pull out the rest of them which fall into the toilet--not real smart thinking Ace. Naked lightbulb serves as the lighting for the room, which adds to the hostel/sanitorium/potential flophouse hotel effect. And the clincher is tv on a wall arm extending from the ceiling. There's nothing like a tv attached to the wall/ceiling to give you that \"motel\" feeling. Also, you have to leave a \"service room\" tag on your door when you leave, or they will not do housekeeping. They try and sell it as \"leaving you alone,\" but I think it's more about saving money. Summation: For location, and due to the few options available in this price range, this hotel is a decent option. But to call it a \"boutique\" hotel experience and charge a discounted corporate rate of 160 a night for a plain room that measures 15X15 in Seattle?

My second and third visits proved to be frustrating, irritating and uncomfortable. The rooms have been small, dark, with hollow sheet rock walls seperating the rooms. You can hear everything .... EVERYTHING. The neighbors on one side left their tv on all night (it's probably still on), the ones on the other side came home around 2AM had loud sex and then spent the rest of the morning puking in the bathroom (another reason not to opt for a shared bath). There is no service except for there front desk where you'll find a terse urban hipster with multiple peircings reading a magazine and chatting on her cell phone who makes it known that you are a bother. The place has great possibities, unfortunately they are not realized.

It was clean, very accessible to nearby restaurants (some pricey ones though so be aware), and had a nice staff. They were helpful in suggestions on where to eat and one nice woman helped my boyfriend and I down the stairs with our luggage which wasn't necessary but very nice of her. I really liked the decor of the room too. It was simple but perfect if you're used to non-fussy places. The shared bathrooms were clean and the maids cleaned the room up nicely every day. I didn't encounter any noise problems but that is because when I booked the room, I specifically asked for a quieter side that did not face the noisey street. It was quiet and pleasant and I'm a light sleeper. The Cyclops downstairs had good food and a fun atmostsphere. One drawback I would say is that it's hard to find an inexpensive place to get something to eat in the neighborhood. Also, going alone to the bathroom at night seemed a bit sketchy because the halls were very dimly lit to look cooler, I guess but I was a little paranoid of going to the shared bathrooms without my boyfriend in the middle of the night. Other than that, I would definitely recommend the place to anyone who wants a fun, no-frills place to stay that's convenient to everything.", "Date": "March 31, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Wa.", "Title": "\u201cHello?

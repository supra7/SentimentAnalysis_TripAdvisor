What is that old saying... you get what you pay for! When I checked in I was running off to a meeting so I gave my bags to the bellman to deliver to my room. When I got back aroun 9:30 at night I finally saw the room. I had a Jr. Suite and the room was a good size, minimal electric outlets and no wireless connection. They told me that would work on that on Monday (which never happened). I have an iPad, a Smart Phone and a Kindle Fire, none of which could connect to the wireless network. The first thing I noticed was that there are no fire sprinklers in the room (the hotel was grandfathered in, they told me and so does not need to comply). Also there was no exhaust fan in the bathroom. There was however, an old and tired mattress. In the morning I went to the restaurant for breakfast which was okay eggs coffee and croissants. On the way out I noticed that the restaurant had received a B rating from the board of health, which means that they received a negative 14 to 27 points for sanitary violations. I did not eat there again! By the way, that rating is on a large 8x10 sign that most restaurants post proudly, theirs was conveniently hidden behind the door leading into the restaurant.

The area rug was stained (because it was a white carpet unlike most hotels that have dark carpets so you can't see stains). The bathroom was clean, but it had a half glass shower door because it was one of those longer showers. So a wet floor can become an issue.

I was then quickly assisted with my check-in by the on-duty security guard who was also polite and offered me a cordial greeting to your fine hotel. I was checked in and went to my room which I believe was #805. Upon entering my room I observed a rather small television in the room and thought for a 3 star hotel, they should have flat screen televisions by now and at this time I went down to the front desk and spoke with G.S. A. Randy Alan Ogoff. I asked him if there were any other rooms available with perhaps a larger television. I then offered him my reasons for being in New York City during the Christmas Holiday. In short, my parents and sister were killed last year in a motor vehicle accident and I had no immediate family anywhere in the New England area and that my partner of 5 years and myself were here in New York City to get away and kind of enjoy but yet forget about the holiday because it is such a tragic time for me in my life. It was around the holidays that my family was killed by an off duty truck driver who was also drunk behind the wheel of his large truck. G.S.A. Ogoff handed me a room key and told me to check out a room, I believe it was #1205 to see if there was a larger television in that room. I was saddened to find that that room also had a very small television with a vhs tape player installed as well. We are clearly in the DVD era and the hotel really needs to upgrade their televisions. I promptly returned to the front desk and upon my arrival G.S.A. Ogoff handed me an envelope and said based on my family circumstances and my request for a larger television as I would be spending a good deal of time in my room for the two days that I would be a guest in your hotel, he had upgraded me to a junior suite at no additional charge for the two day stay. I was just beyond words and quickly expressed my gratitude and thanked him kindly for being such a sweet, caring and concerned about his guests employee of the hotel. I went up to my junior suite, room # 1110 I believe and found it to be a beautiful room with a flat screen television and large enough for me and my partner to enjoy for the two day stay at the hotel. And throughout my entire stay I bumped into, said hello to and spoke with G.S.A. Randy Alan Ogoff on many occasions and always found him to be smiling, kind, caring, gentle, and willing to help me in any way possible. He went well above and beyond what one would expect from a guest services agent at any hotel, let alone The Roger Smith Hotel! He is indeed an asset to your fine hotel and I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say enough about this man and the wonderful way I was treated as a guest during my stay at the hotel. I truly wish all guest services agents and front desk personnel at all other hotels were as nice and caring about their guests as Randy Alan Ogoff was and is for and from what I observed all of the guests that came and went at the hotel. He was always smiling and seemed truly happy to be at work during the Christmas holiday weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6unlike many other employees that I observed in other stores and restaurants in the city during my stay. Many clearly did not like the fact they had to work during the holidays\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6G.S.A. Randy Alan Ogoff was indeed the exception to the rule and I believe he is truly an asset to be appreciated as an employee of The Roger Smith Hotel. Upon getting home from my little vacation, I could not wait to sit down and compose this letter and send it off to you at the hotel to tell you about my wonderful and pleasing experience and that I will surely be staying at your hotel in the future should I be returning to the fine city of New York in the future. If you would like to reach me for any reason as it relates to this letter and my personal opinions and observations of Guest Services Agent Randy Alan Ogoff, please do not hesitate to contact me at the address, phone number or email address listed above. I would be happy to provide you with any and all information that you may request as it relates to my letter. I truly enjoyed my stay at The Roger Smith Hotel because it is s very beautiful hotel, the junior suite I stayed in was gorgeous and because G.S.A.

Thank you in advance for your time, patience and cooperation as it relates to my letter of personal thanks and reference about the fine work ethics and skills that G.S.A.

In fact, I was drawn to this hotel because it was funky and artsy. But, I am a person that requires good service -- and unfortunately, the Roger Smith didn't provide that during this trip. I had really high hopes because there were so many reviews commending the excellent service and friendly staff. We arrived early and I knew we could not check in, but we went to the hotel anyway in order to drop off our luggage. I told the man at the front desk that we were early and he snidely replied \"Quite\". It really took me back. I explained that we were not asking to check in, just to drop off our luggage. He just sort of waved me to the bellhop and turned his back on me (although there was nobody else requiring assistance at that time). When we came back later that evening, the check in went smoothly. Our room was comfortable and clean. The water pressure in our room was terrible though and the hair dryer did not work. We also could not figure out how to turn on the heater, so when we left the next morning, we mentioned it. When we arrived back that evening, they had turned the radiator on, and it was easily 90 degrees in our room. We had to turn on the AC to cool it down. We went to the bar one night and were the only ones there. The bartender seemed annoyed that we had come in and made sure we knew that he was closing in 30 minutes. We just ordered our drinks and took them back upstairs. On the plus side, the location can't be beat for the price. The rooms were a good size by NYC standards and we had a high floor room, so we did not have much street noise. The beds were comfortable. They do not have room service but you can order from a handful of restaurants that they have an arrangement with -- they just add it to your final hotel bill. We ordered Chinese food and it was delivered at lightnening speed. However, we paid a delivery fee and an automatic gratuity on top of the gratuity we gave when the food was delivered to our door. We would have been better off ordering take out and getting it ourselves. This hotel does a great job with it's social media messaging, The social media vibe has a totally different feel than the actual vibe when you walk in the door, so I think that is a problem. And, maybe the attitude had a lot to do with the fact that it was Christmas-time and very busy, but when you are in the hospitality industry, I don't think you can use that as an excuse.

I've stayed many times at the Intercontinental (6 times in the last year) and despite the hefty price tag their rooms are not much better than the Roger Smith. Old bathrooms abound at the Intercontinental too, likewise the Radisson on Lex. In general, midtown New York hotels are not great when it comes to modernity. I've stayed in a fair few and they all - to a greater or lesser extent - could do with updating. Spending more doesn't guarantee anything better apart from a fancy reception and a guy to hold the door open. The Roger Smith is a pretty good place to lay your head and the price is reasonable.

Nine weeks later I still have scars from the bites. Their customer service in relation to this event was cold and totally unsatisfactory.

One of the best parts about the rooms is they all have mini fridges in them. There is a drug store and a liquor store right across the street, so we bought some stuff for a night cap.

That was the only frustrating part, especially as the gentleman at reception ( i won't mention his name) was quite rude and didn't seem to understand my disappointment, he never once apologised, luckily we dealt with the manager on duty later on, that was very nice, and kept an eye on our sleeping daughter for us, while we were away...

I usually stay at another hotel in the area, but was unhappy with the amenities. In my search, I found Roger Smith. This trip was split between bringing my family for a few days, and then a few days at the office. When we arrived, the staff was very friendly and we were checked in quickly. The lobby was nice, and the artwork interesting. When we got to the room (a double/double) we were very happy. As my wife put it, it was \"homey\". It felt more like a B&B than a hotel in midtown. Location-wise, it's a great place. It's an easy walk to Rockefeller Center, Times Square and there are plenty of choices to eat around the block. It was also easy to catch a cab outside, and Grand Central is around the corner. I had a great time with my family, and we all enjoyed the hotel. When my family checked out, and I was going to check back in (for my business portion), there was an issue with my reservation. The staff quickly made up for the situation by upgrading me to a one bedroom suite. It was more than I could have asked for, and the room was fantastic. It was very nice to spread out, and there is certainly enough room to entertain friends or associates. But, even being alone, it felt like a little home away from home and made my stay much more enjoyable. In all, both rooms were nice.. and I think it's neat that neither was exactly the same. Unlike many hotels where the rooms are cookie-cutter, the rooms were similar enough to have continuity, but different enough to be interesting. The coffee maker was nice, the mini-fridge was great, and the microwave in the suite was handy. The wifi was useful for both work, and having the family be able to check email and Facebook during some downtime. The staff was friendly, and very helpful. Negatives? The heater seemed to have a mind of its own. Or, at least I couldn't turn it off. I just opened the window, so it wasn't a big deal. Although they offer a large selection of DVDs, there were some TV channels that aren't available (a few news channels, and Nick). A positive stay, a great location and value, and I will be using them for now on when I come down to the city for work (and pleasure).", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cWorst Experience Ever\u201d", "Author": "sanders8336", "ReviewID": "UR100610151", "Content": "First, this hotel is the most run-down and amenity-free establishment I have ever stayed in, and mind you, I am not high maintenance.

There was no a/c in the first two rooms, and in one of the rooms I could not open a window to try to let the heat escape. In the final room, I was assured there was a/c, but the unit was so old and dirty that I was afraid to have air circulate through the unit. Disgusting. I slept with the window open the entire night and lucky had ear plugs with me so that I could drown out the NYC traffic noises. Without a doubt, this was the worst hotel experience of my life.

The small but intimate lobby with changing art installations. 2. The friendly and professional staff. 3. The size of the room. We had a junior suite for an excellent rate, and it was huge by modern hotel room standards. 4. The decor - Very warm and inviting. 5. The quiet! Yes...the quiet in NYC. We were on the 13th floor and we had our window open for the fresh air (don't laugh). Yes, we could hear horns and sirens, but everything quieted down after midnight.

I referred many people as well who have stayed here because I recommended the charm, the location and the lovely staff. Unfortunately, when we were here in August 2010, I was unimpressed by the disinterested staff but assumed that it was an anomoly. We arrived last night at 12 am after a 6 hour trip from the west coast. The man at the front desk waited 5 minutes to acknowledge us while he completed his paperwork. We had booked a double doubele on the website after we had competed the reservation \"non-refundable\" at which time we were offered an \"e-standby\" upgrade for $9 extra a night for a junior suite ( $27 total for our 3 night stay) if that type of room was available at check-in which we, of course, accepted (particularly since it indicated that this upgrade opportunity was a great savings!) However, when we check-in the man at the front desk told us it would be $30 per night for the upgrade even though that junior suites were available. We asked why they had offered it at $9 and he did not answer but when pressed said that \"its just busienss' (on checking later we saw that the website was offering the room at $30 over the room that we had already taken so it was just the regular rate). When we said that it was false advertising, he just said \"well welcome to New York\". His attitude was so rude and really disappointing after other experiences at this hotel. I'm not sure why they bother adding the e-standby ugrade to their website when they did not intend to honor it,but it was a waste of time considering it when it was just a ruse. Usually the somewhat shabby rooms, poor TV reception and lack of other amenities has been acceptable considering the positive attributes but this experience was beyond reproach. Once we got to our room, it was extra shabby, the bathroom was dirty with hair on the toilet and there were parties oin the next room and the room above. If, this was not a non-refundable room, I would leave. Oddly enough, the room that we were given after the ordeal with the front desk is one which was added by another Trip Advisor user as their shappy room which, I believe, was another dig by the front desk clerk.

I don't think I've ever had the same room twice and have had rooms that range from standard to junior suite. It is always a little thrill to see what room I'll have and what its special features will be - an especially comfortable chair for reading or watching TV, lovely wall paper and complimentary furnishings and linens on the bed, a great desk for getting some work done. I always appreciate having the iron in the closet, the mini fridge under the TV, windows that open, drapes that block out light and a big soft and comfortable bed with great pillows. The toiletries in the bathroom are good ones and several times the toothbrush has been there right when I needed it. One of the best features of the whole experience is the warm and friendly hotel staff and owners - they always have a friendly, warm greeting which makes it feel a bit like coming home upon arrival whether the first day of my stay or when I return in the evening or during the day. We regularly have work related events at the Roger Smith and all the different staff who attend to the details make things run smoothly are great. The food too has been varied, flavorful, delicious and nicely presented from snacks, to breakfast, lunch and dinner. On several occasions I've left my luggage after checking out and before leaving New York to go home - they are very accomodating and it makes the last day of a trip easy without needing to carry luggage all over. The only complaint I have would be that occasionally, but often enough to be noted, there are problems with the elevators. With recent renovations this has occured less often, but even on this last visit there was a period when only one elevator was working. To summarize: I love staying at the Roger Smith!!

The place could probably do a refurb if I'm honest, although it's clean and friendly which is the main thing. Before you rule out this hotel I'd say the positives still make this place a very solid option - albeit not a particularly luxurious one Firstly the location is fantastic! It's right in the heart of the action, just four blocks north of Grand Central Station on Lexington Avenue. If you're flying into Newark catch the airport express coach just outside the terminal building for $15, it stops just outside Grand Central Station, a 5 minute walk, not too taxing even with suitcases. We got stuck in traffic for an hour on the way to NYC so be careful if you choose a taxi because the meter doesn't stop just because you do, could prove very expensive. The rooftop bar is great during the week (not open at weekends for some reason) a good place for a chilled out drink to start the night off. All hotel staff were friendly and helpful, but beware! The front desk were erratic with info and sent us off in the wrong direction on more than one occasion. They also told us they had no contacts to get us Yankees tickets, I thought that was very strange. We were able to book them through Ticketmaster using the free Internet in reception. One thing we noticed was the corner rooms are much bigger than all the other rooms, so request one of those if you want a more spacious room. They are big, especially as I'd heard all NYC rooms are tiny. I would stay here again if I could get a decent room rate. A couple of our NYC favourites... The Meatball Shop - You can't book and it's fairly chaotic, if you go at a random time the wait isn't too long. The meatballs are amazing, cheap and filling.

To make matters worse, the carpet in the bedroom was stained, and the wallpaper was peeling off . The coffee table had footprints on, and the kitchenette was dirty, and the size of a small wardrobe.

The style of our room was \"vintage\" as my husband called it, and I thought the size of the \"standard\" room was pretty large. The room was clean and there was a nice spread of complimentary magazines, a collection of books, toiletries, and coffee available. Overall, our trip to New York was fantastic. We checked in late on Friday night, and the front desk employee was friendly and helpful. He recommended a nearby 24-hour pharmacy and delivered a pop-up crib and extra bed linens to our room within the first 5 minutes of our arrival. Each day, we asked the staff for directions and recommendations, and we were always pleased with the service. Now, on to the room -- Immediately upon entering the room, the first thing I noticed was the heat. The room looked nice and clean, probably exactly like in the picture featured on Trip Advisor, but there was no air flowing. So I found the thermostat and clicked it to \"on\". When it turned on, it was extremely LOUD. I worried about how that would affect our sleep, and I asked the employee if it was going to get any better or if not, if we could change rooms. He explained that it was an older unit, and that the hotel was in the process of changing them out, but it was taking time, and with the hotel fully booked we could not change on that particular night. ***However, I remembered reading a review on Trip Advisor that was several years old complaining of the same exact thing. I seriously, seriously doubt they are \"in the process\" of addressing this issue. If they are seriously working on this, then call ahead and ask if the work has been completed before you go.*** Anyway, the noisy A/C proved to not be too big of a problem. The noise actually was like \"white noise\" for us because there was a street market on Sunday which played loud music right outside the hotel and the A/C helped to drown it out. But the room never really cooled down. My son, who is hot-natured, woke up several times because he was too warm. Like I said, the hotel was nice and clean, but I still had one other complaint which was significant to me. The bed. I think the only way they can fix this is to replace the mattresses. The bed had a major sinkhole right in the middle. I woke up every morning with a back ache. I was going to flip the mattress myself, but it is not the kind that you can just flip over because of the style. I think it's done its job, but now it is time to go! Please replace the mattresses ASAP. ***I would also recommend asking if this problem has been addressed before committing to booking here.*** Additional comments: Great location, really great.

The heat could not be controlled in our room despite asking twice to have it turned off somehow....we kept our air conditioner on at all times and there was no vent in the bathroom which was like a furnace most of the time, especially when having showers. The small bathroom was directly off the side of our bed; so my daughter and niece had to come into our room to use the tiny washroom.

So we'd been very excited about staying at RSH as it looked like something more unique among NYC hotels; photos and reviews gave it an artistic air and class. Unfortunately, the building is not remotely suited for noise reduction and this is our biggest complaint. We stayed near the top of the hotel and heard car horns through the single-pane windows all night long. (This is not traditional of NYC hotels in midtown on the whole. We've stayed at several others, including one just 2 blocks away, where this was not a concern.) Also, the room doors are heavy and set in metal frames, so every time another hotel guest closes their door, its clang echoes through the walls. Too, the temperature control (2 \"wallbanger\" units) left something to be desired. (It was a high of 85 outside in the day, and I doubt the temperature dipped below 80 inside during the night.) The staff was kind enough. Visually, the room was fantastic - but upon use, the majority of lamps did not work, only one of the two TV's had cable (which was in the bedroom, and had a shoddy cable connection). My recommendations: Grab a few drinks in the bar on the ground floor (the drinks and bar staff were great), but don't stay over unless your goal is just having a place to take some cool facebook photos. It's pretty to look at, but it isn't practical. If you do stay over, and you intend to sleep, hit the Duane Reade across the street and pay $6 for some earplugs - but it's smarter to stay at one of the other comparable hotels in the area.", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cHome away from home in the big city\u201d", "Author": "LemonCake", "ReviewID": "UR34391793", "Content": "As a New Yorker, I needed to stay at a hotel for almost a week.

Be smart - find a boutique that really knows what their doing as well as what they want to be.

At the time, we found the service brusque, but the rooms were very large, and had a lot of character typical for an older pre-war New York building. We hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been back since, mostly because we spend most of our time downtown, and the Roger Smith is in midtown. Four in our family needed a large suite in February, and I remembered the Roger Smith. I asked specifically for one of the big suites, and it was available for a very reasonable rate, so I booked it. The rate continued increasing prior to our visit, but the Roger Smith correctly honored the original rate at the time of booking. We arrived on a snowy, traffic-jammed Friday afternoon. Their greeting was warm and welcoming. Our suite was ready immediately. I cringed at the room number (911), and the gentleman at the front desk said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a beautiful suite.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He was right ---- it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a beautiful suite. Very large living area with pull-out sofabed and fireplace and television, dining room with a large dining table to fit six comfortably, small kitchenette, small extra bedroom with television, plus gorgeous master bedroom with exceedingly comfortable bed, television, dresser, lamps galore, and huge walk-in closet. No smell of cigarette smoke anywhere, thank you very much! Also, many, many closets throughout the suite. The place was crazy clean, and the kitchenette was furnished with a small fridge, dishware, sink, microwave, paper towels, and coffeemaker. But the wartime character of the building has not changed, and I mean that in a good way. High ceilings, crown moldings, large windows, lots & lots of character. I usually don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep very well in hotels, but the king size bed was very comfortable, the temperature in the room was just right, and we heard absolutely no noise from other guests or the street. I guess being on the 9th floor helped. Just as a side note, the day before our check-in, a friend had dropped off a gift for us at the hotel. That gift was waiting on the dining room table when we first walked in the suite. Sure, it seems like a very simple thing, but I'm always amazed at how some hotels can't even get simple things right. The bellman Eric was helpful in getting us a cab while we checked out, and he was all smiles during our entire visit, but he was never overly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in-your-face\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as some bellmen can be. Have no fear of the Roger Smith. It is a warm, welcoming, clean, interesting hotel with very large rooms and a staff that clearly enjoys working there.", "Date": "March 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cFrighteningly dirty\u201d", "Author": "rtiTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR13066000", "Content": "Peeling paint, stained, torn carpeting, broken rusted and cracked bathroom fixtures.

I stumbled upon the RS and was surprised to find that they did indeed have rooms. We ended up with a mini-sweet, which has two double beds and a fold-out sofa - which was perfect for the five of us. The rooms were clean and neat. The rates were reasonable. The staff was courteous, efficient, professional and very accommodating. The beds were comfortable. And there is a quaintness to old hotels like this that adds as much to the stay as anything else -- if you've ever heard a steam radiator softly clanking as it stirs to life, you know what I mean. And when it was all said and done, we could walk outside and be just a few blocks away from Times Square. We were so pleased that we ended up staying three nights in all instead of taking the train back and forth to my brother's place in Connecticut each day. My other brother had a room at the Marriott in Times Square during the NYE festivities. I imagine he paid a lot more to be there, but I would much rather have stayed at the Roger Smith, where there was peace and quiet and at most, a handful of people in the lobby at any one time.

First of all, the location is excellent: within ten minutes walk you have Saks, Bloomingdales, Grand Central Terminal, the Chrysler building and Park, Madison and 5th Avenues. It's also an excellent base for exploring a bit further - it's only about 15 minutes to times square, central park and further afield. We stayed in a large-ish room on the fourth floor with two double beds and a nice bathroom. The beds were very comfortable, the shower was good and there was ample storage space. The complimentary continental breakfast was fair - a good selection of cereal, yoghurts, bagels, pastries etc. If you want to splash out a bit , you can go downstairs to Lily's where for about $8-10 dollars you can get a bigger breakfast / brunch. We sampled the eggs and pancakes and they were great. The guys on reception were helpful and they even had a bit of a sense of humour. To answer previous complaints - the only noise we experienced was the typical new york noise from the streets (sirens, horns etc) and the room was immaculately clean. If, as some previous posters suggest, you are paying $400-500 then I can understand you feeling a bit let down, but we called the hotel directly, got the room for $229/night and were very impressed.

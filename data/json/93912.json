We were given a handicap-accessible room on the ground floor next to the main hotel entrance (there were no other rooms available?... really?). There was no light switch by the door, meaning we had to feel our way to the bathroom switch. The dingy curtains could not fully close, allowing light from the parking lot and the gazes by anyone entering/leaving the hotel to enter our room.

Please read if you would like to know why. The hotel desk staff was very demeaning and unfriendly. The hotel is quite run down and much dirtier than was expected for a Comfort Inn. The airport shuttle that the hotel provides as a courtesy left us standing in the extreme heat at the BWI MARC station, not once but twice for well over an hour. We finally gave up on the second time and took another means of transportation. When I addressed this with the desk staff, the desk staff threatened to call the police on me even though I was calmly adressing my concerns. I thought it was my presentation but when we were awaiting our shuttle to the cruise port I noticed that every guest was having extreme difficulty with the hotel desk staff regarding transportation. Every time we attempted to enter our room with our key card the lock would not work. The front desk accused me of placing it next to other cards or perhaps a cell phone. Finally the maintenance personnel had to change the battery in the door. It work sporadically thereafter. They messed up our reservations and although we had requested a king room we went to our room to unpack it was a two double bed room and it looked like someone was staying in that room but just wasn't there, thankfully no one was there. We were assigned another room but it still was with two doubles. I'm 6 foot 5 inches, 270 lbs and there is no way I could sleep in a double bed with my wife so we spent three nights sleeping in separate beds. After adresseing our multitude of concerns with the on-duty manager I mentioned that Choice Hotels are my first choice of hotel stays and asked what he was willing to do to keep my business. After a 20 minute discussion he eventually credited me one night stay but in my opinion and after what we went through for 3 days I should have received more.

As soon as we entered the hotel I knew I had chosen the right place. It was nice and clean and new looking. I was expecting more of a bare bones motel type place, but for the price this place was really nice. You get a free breakfast with the room, and it's a real breakfast, not just some stale pastry. The only complaint I can even think of is that the shower drain was slow. The towels are white and nice and plush, the front desk and housekeeping staff and very efficient. You can walk about two blocks and pick up the light rail that takes you into the Inner Harbor area for $3.50 per person. Actually, since nobody checked our tickets we could have rode for free. Also, the Inner Harbor is fun to walk around, and the place was just LOADED with Yankee fans. We took over the area!! The game was a lot of fun too.

Ate at the Rose restaurant for the breakfast, I would skip this even though it is free, food wasn't great. No service, couldn't even get coffee from anyone. Pretty remote area if you don't have a car, not much around it, a Checkers and Circle K across the street.

We stayed at the Comfort Inn Airport and were very pleased! The price was about a hundred bucks for 3 of us including tax and while the name of the motel would lead you to believe its on the runway, its actually a few miles away and out of the \"airport hustle\". The staff were very pleasant and the room was clean and quiet, in fact, with a house full of Red Sox fans, you could hardly tell it from any other day.There is also a hotel shuttle to BWI which runs on the half hour and the driver very friendly. I could not find a pool, however, there is a Sleep Inn next door, which may be a sister motel and you could probably use theirs. There was a Complimentary full Country Breakfast in The Rose Restaurant part of the Comfort Inn Airport and all in all, the motel experience was great, all this considering we just wanted a clean room close to the Light Rail Station. The station is virtually across the street from the Hotel and by station I mean a handful of ticket machines, a few benches and some rail. The train slips in quietly and then slips away at the cost of 3.50 for a day pass, oddly enough, there was never anyone to take the ticket, look at it or scan it all day, could have travelled all day without. The Rail also connects to Bwi but we didnt use it because of the motel shuttle. We rode maybe 10 stops, 15 minutes and we were at Camden Yards, a beautiful park, a beautiful setting. With thousands of Red Sox fans invading the park, our Baltimore hosts could not have been more gracious. Baltimore should be very proud of this park and the conduct of the Oriole faithful, it is certainly recommended that a family would have a great time here!!! After the game we went to Hard Rock Cafe and ESPN zone, however there are other family activites close by as well. After our day in Baltimore we slipped back on the rail and were back at our Hotel. There was nothing less than excellent on this day trip ....no wait, thats right, the Red Sox lost. Still, hats of to Baltimore!!", "Date": "July 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gettysburg PA", "Title": "\u201clet's not say comfort\u201d", "Author": "imalocal", "ReviewID": "UR3625697", "Content": "Rude staff.

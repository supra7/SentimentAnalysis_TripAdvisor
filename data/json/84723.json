I arrived to the on my first night to be told I had no hotel room along with other people who purchased through expedia and hotwire. They told us we had to find other hotel rooms for the night because of a power outage on the one floor which was desginated for customers who purchased through them and were not able to accomadate us because they were completely full. The first night we were simply told to contact expedia or hotwire for alternatives. I spoke to the young lady who assured me it would be fixed the next morning when the piece came in. I told her I would find another hotel for the night or sleep in the car as long as we were assured that we had a room the next day. We could not find a hotel in that vicinity so we decided to spend the night in the car. That evening about 2am my husband and kids in the car I walk into the hotel to find them giving out rooms. I was so upset I told the clerk my situation and he appologized and I was able to get a room but only for that night. It was 4am before we were able to get into the room to finally sleep. we woke up at 8am I spoke to a supervisor explained everything to her. She assured me I would have a room when I got back from the park that evening. She also stated that the resort was supposed to find accomedations at another hotel and not just turn us away and she would investigate. She even gave me the room number that would be blocked for me. That evening I arrive at 10pm and ask for the room by number and give my name. The clerks had me instead a piece of paper notifying me that the whole wing is down without power and that they have made arrangements with a sister hotel to accomadate me. They stated that I would have to pay for that hotel and hotwire would refund me. They lend me their phone and then totally disregard you. As I am standing there on the phone they are checking in OTHER CUSTOMERS!! unbelievable!! I again spoke to another supervisor gave her my story. At first there was nothing she could do until I explained I had already spoken to a Supervisor that morning and then she goes to check with another supervisor in the back and I suddenly get an apology told that the hotel fees would be waived (the extra 10.00 a day) and i get the same room number that I had originally requested in which was in the wing that apparently had no power.

We had our doubts going in because of them, and let me tell you - I am a snotty brat when it comes to my hotels - I usually only stay in 3 star hotels and above when I travel to NYC and Beverly Hills. For the money and location and actual time we spent in the room - IT WAS WELL WORTH IT. Ask yourself this - would you rather spend $40 a night on a hotel (that is what we paid!) or $100 a night? I'd rather spend that extra $60 in the Disney park itself bringing home souvenirs. Check-in was smooth. There were 3 adults and 4 children in our room. My sister and her husband brought their QUEEN size air mattress with them for the kids (7 y/o, 5 y/o, 3 y/o 2 y/o) and my sister and her husband slept in one bed, the air mattress was on the ground in between the 2 beds, and then I slept in the other bed. Had enough room for the kids to run around in the hotel room. The bathroom was clean, the room appeared to be clean (the floors were filthy - we actually plan on staying here again and just throwing a swiffer in our car for the ride over and wiping the floors with some pinesol before we let the kids go wild) - The air conditioner did have a funky smell to it, but nothing our Scentsy room sprays couldn't handle. The room came with a mini-fridge which was great! Our room was in the North tower facing the Animal Kingdom, and we actually were able to enjoy the 10pm fireworks on our check-in night! The kids were in awe! We had pizza delivered to our room, as well as had a stroller to deliver to our room. We never made it INTO the pool, but my sister and I did browse by it and stick our toes in and it felt wonderful! All in all - there was an enormous amount of FREE parking at the hotel RIGHT by the room. Never had to wait more than 30 seconds when you called for an elevator. We asked for additional towels and received them within 15 minutes of request. All in all - this hotel will be used again by us!

Were given the room with appropriate beds. Now the room had a dingy moist smell to start with. Well, the shower spills water all the way to the lounge so you must have towels on the floor to prevent this while you shower. There is no vent in the bathroom, the blankets and pillows stink. The finish of these new rooms were so poorly done like by an inexperienced handy man. The door locks appearr as if someone used a bread knife to smoothen them.We had a box of clinex with old or crumbled paper inside of it .I have pictures to prove it.

We'd read mixed reviews on Trip Advisor ... but usually maintain that you should make your own mind up about places as different people have different expectations ... & we have to say that on the whole we were pleasantly surprised. The Worldgate Resort is located on the I-192 in Kissimmee, only about 10 mins away from all the main Disney locations, & within half an hour of International Drive, Universal, Sea World, etc ... There is also a good variety of eateries & gift shops within walking distance, plus a Target about 5 mins drive away. We really liked the layout of the hotel itself ... it has a central kind of quad-type area, with the foyer at the front, which includes a handy shop, car rental desk, & tourist info desk where you can buy all your attraction tickets. There is also a bar, which serves food & a diner/pizzeria, & all of this is accessible from the pool area which is located in the middle of the quad. Guest rooms are located in two towers, one on either edge of the quad, & due to the layout, all seem to have a reasonable view. When we checked in we asked for a King room on the 6th or 7th floor as we'd read that you could see the fireworks at Disney from these rooms, but as there wasn't one available, we were offered a Double room, however when we went to the allocated room, we were quite disappointed ... the room was extremely dark, with no ceiling or wall lights & only one table lamp. We also noticed that the bathroom was very compact, & that it would be necessary to stand to one side of the toilet to close the door in order to be able to access the shower/bath. We expressed our concerns about the lighting to the reception staff & they said that all of the Double rooms had been renovated in the same way & that they had received other similar comments ... so we asked to switch to a King room on a lower floor, & we were very pleased with the room we were allocated ... a much larger bathroom with no space issues & 2 bedside lamps, altho still no ceiling or wall lights. We also had a nice sized fridge too, which was very useful & coffee making facilities. The only thing we were a little unsure about was the fact that there are no carpets anywhere ... the floors are all marble-type tiles ... which in some ways is nice as it looks classy, & clean ... but it is cold to walk on & it does mean that the corridors can be very noisy at times, as there is nothing to dampen the sound. This was particularly noticeable on the 2 weekends when we had school parties staying on the same floor! The first weekend was a bit of a nightmare as the kids didn't appear to be being supervised to any great extent, & having rung down to reception twice to ask the hotel staff to have a word, we eventually went out into the corridor after 10pm one evening to find a group of students sitting on the floor outside our door chatting, & other groups congregating around the elevators to socialise. The following morning we tried to have a word with a couple of the adults accompanying the group, but to be honest, they were as noisy as the kids, when they were running up & down the corridor around 7am rounding the kids up to go on a trip ... in fact one of them told us that we shouldn't have been there as they'd booked the whole floor out ..! Having said this ... the hotel is very nice, the staff on the whole were very pleasant & helpful, the bed was, without doubt, the most comfortable we have ever slept in, & the location could hardly be better ... so we would definitely stay there again ... but we'd maybe check if they'd got any school groups in first ...! ;o)", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tamarac, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNot what I expected.\u201d", "Author": "Florida_Traveler1966", "ReviewID": "UR126587798", "Content": "This hotel has potential, but it isn't there yet.

Our bed was comfortable however I think they put the King mattress on a double bed frame because it seemed like the top was too big for the bottom to support properly. The pool area is a basic pool and was clean but they were always running out of towels and could use a few more lounge chairs. The location is great if you just plan on being gone all day at the parks. I don't think I would call this a resort more like a hotel. If you can get past the noise that having tile everywhere causes and you get a good rate than I'd stay here again but I'd check out other locations as well.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tarpon Springs, FL", "Title": "\u201cA cluster you-know-what\u201d", "Author": "0906ret", "ReviewID": "UR126109926", "Content": "Knew things could go wrong while I was at the check-in desk.

We returned to the front desk and were immediately given another room key. The beds were sleep number and needed extensive adjustment to be semi-comfortable. I did appreciate a deep and spacious bathtub although the water smelled like rotten eggs. This was an extremely busy time for this resort. We used their shuttle to Disney, however it runs very sporadically (one trip back to the hotel at 10 PM from Epcot or else you find your own way back) and it was packed to the gills, all the way from back to front and aisles were filled.

There was a shop which sold anything you made need downstairs and also a pizza hut which was great if you just want to grab a quick dinner if you are late in. The only small problem I had with the hotel was that when we first arrived the man behind reception could not find out booking (not really what you need after a 10 hour flight).

Since purchasing the Disney passes we\u2019ve traveled to Orlando roughly once or twice a month for the past three or four years. During that time we\u2019ve stay at many Hotels and Resorts in and around the Walt Disney World property. Of all the resorts we\u2019ve stayed at, The Worldgate is one of our personal favorites. It amazes us that for the price of booking a standard hotel we can book the Worldgate and get access to all the amenities they have to offer. We normally spend between $35 and $45 on the Worldgate and with that we get a wonderful pool area, hot tub, extremely awesome children\u2019s area with Movie Theater, Food Court, Free WiFi, In room fridge, Sleep Number Beds, Disney Views from our window, recently remodeled rooms with tiles floors and above all else, very quick access to both 192 and Disney World. This hotel is literally every penny pinchers dream. While it is not the Four Seasons, you get a resort atmosphere for the price of a standard motel. The service at the Worldgate is amazing. We\u2019ve stayed there so much we\u2019re on a first name basis with the wonderful women who work the front desk. They are some of the most patient and considerate hospitality staff I have ever encountered in the Central Florida area. Once during a stay on my Birthday they placed us in a corner room on the top floor facing Disney. The view was amazing. You can see Animal Kingdom, Epcot, The Swan and Dolphin hotels and even the water tower at Hollywood Studios. Most resorts around the Disney World area cost three digits easily for a room with that kind of view. The Worldgate just makes you feel like you are in a fancy resort. Many times we feel like we\u2019ve cheated the Worldgate for only booking it for $45 or less. It\u2019s got a wonderful bar area where I\u2019ve watched college and Pro sports many times. The pool area is actually a beautifully landscaped large pool with a hot tub, Ping Pong table and more located in the center of the property. Any other hotel in their price range would allow you access to nothing more than a standard square hole filled with water. The exercise room, while small, has plenty of modern equipment like a stepper and several treadmills. Personally I wish it had an elliptical, but that is only because I use one at home. There is a TV and towels located in the gym. One of the best features of the gym is that as many times as my wife and I have used it, it is never crowded nor has children playing on the equipment. The lobby has a large information desk and an above normal sized gift shop. My wife and I still giggle when we see the tea bag holders. While the gift shop has almost anything you need, the hotel is located right off 192 West. 192 West has all the shopping and restaurants you would need to save money. Located just a few miles from the hotel are Publix and Target. We wish there was a Dollar Tree closer (closest one is on Apopka-Vineland Rd) but besides Publix and Target there are plenty of other stores which shopping at could save you money compared to hotel and attraction prices. Perhaps the best thing about the Worldgate Resort is its location. As I previously mentioned, it sit just off 192 West which can save any traveler money with its unlimited supply of restaurants and shops. While the wife and I love to eat at Disney World, it tends to get costly. It\u2019s nice having eateries close to the hotel which won\u2019t put a hurting on your wallet. Another road wonderfully close to the Worldgate Resort is Sherberth Road. Sherberth Road connects 192 West with Disney World. This lightly traveled road can save the traveler a lot of time by quickly and easily transporting you to the Animal Kingdom area of Walt Disney World. It is less than a two minute drive from the Worldgate to Animal Kingdom Lodge. Sherberth Road never has much traffic on it and is a great way to access the Walt Disney World Resort area. No resort is perfect, and the Worldgate does have its flaws. Recently it remodeled most of their towers, adding tile floors. While the tile floors add a wonderful touch of class to an already somewhat posh interior, they tend to echo. This can make for some noisy evenings if families with small children are on your floor. In conclusion, the Worldgate resort provides a lot of amenities for one very low price. Its wonderful location just off Sherberth Road and 192 West provide quick access to both Walt Disney World and many great restaurants and shopping opportunities. If you are looking to save money on your Orlando vacation but still want all the qualities most major resorts offer then the Worldgate is the place for you!", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delmar, New York", "Title": "\u201cFresh and clean rooms, great service, excellent value!\u201d", "Author": "Mark G", "ReviewID": "UR125412796", "Content": "Wow!

We planned it last minute so we didn't have a lot of time to compare places so we rolled the dice on Hotwire for a 3 star hotel and wound up here. This was during President's Week so room rates in the area were inflated a bit. On the good side - we weren't looking for or expecting anything fancy, just something clean and comfortable to hang our hat at night. Overall, the hotel wasn't bad for what we were looking for. The room appeared to be clean, the beds were made and the toilet worked. We stayed in the North tower, which from what others have said, has been renovated. Overall, we would CONSIDER staying here again if we were doing another quick trip to the area and weren't planning to spend a lot of time at the hotel or in the room and if the price was right. On the flip side, I'm not a hotel guru but in its current state I would not consider this a 3-star hotel. Nor would I consider staying here if I had to pay regular room rates and I probably would not stay here again at the same rate I just paid thru Hotwire. Sure the Hotwire price was affordable (considering the time of year) but after the taxes and (let's make up some names for things that we can charge additional for like the airlines do) resort fees it added another 50% to the Hotwire rate. I will say that it appears that the hotel is trying to improve itself. From what I read, the renovations are fairly recent and we did see a handful of staff working on things but its an older building and pretty large so it will take some time. It would help if they would spend some time focusing and fixing some of the small stuff. There's just so many small things that add up that really take away from all the work their doing. It's a shame. Stupid things like redoing (OK, really repainting) the bathrooms and then reusing all the old fixtures. The mismatched colored wall plates over the electrical outlets. The cheap hangers used on the shower curtain. The bits of blue painters tape that weren't removed. The broken room door security lock. The old tube TV's in the newly renovated rooms. The air beds that barely work anymore. Put some pictures or art on the room walls so it doesn't feel like a dorm room. Empty the trash cans in the parking lots. Send someone out to pick up the trash left around the pool. Do some landscaping. I could probably go on for days if I thought about it more. I know some of the things like replacing the TV's and beds aren't cheap so start with the smaller things. Really, how much would it cost to replace the old corroded bathroom fixtures, have matching colored wall plates or even matching drinking glasses.

It appeared to have all the amenities that you would need and the resort staff were very friendly. Upon entering my room I noted that the card slide was backward. The room was clean and we were told that we were being roomed in the rennovated wing of the resort. No carpeting on the floor as I had been used to in many other hotel/resorts I have stayed in, but that was okay. The tile was a little cold to the feet. I was excited that I would be able to try out the sleep number bed that was in the room. I tried in the worst way to get the hand unit to respond to set the number that would assure me of a good night's rest. After jumping out of bed to check the electrical connection, I found that it and other appliances were plugged into a surge strip, which were working, but not the bed. Three nights of lousy sleeping even though I brought it to the friendly front desk staff the next day who said that they would have someone check it out. At the same time, I also mentioned to the front desk personnel that the folks that painted the room did not remove the masking tape from the sprinkler head in the bathroom. When I returned later in the day to my room, the bed was made up and the sprinkler head now was devoid of the masking tape. Could not wait to try the bed. Imagine my surprise when it still did not work and even after mentioning it again to someone else on the front desk the next day along with a receptacle that was not correctly fastened (pushed in when trying to plug my laptop cord in) and a toilet that did not shut off unless you jiggled the handle. Unfortunately, when things like that happen, you tend to get more critical of your surroundings. The bathroom door was splintered in the bottom corner. The shower curtain appears to be too short as water was everywhere when showering. Tiles around the wall in the bathroom were cracked and their appeared to be overspray of paint on the outside of the resort. Signage was crooked in the display cases that were not shined or cleaned and lettering was missing from the display case. All in all, the room was quaint and definitely clean. The bed was bad.

This is the first time I don't stay on a Disney property in a long time while in Orlando and I have one thing to say about that-- there is a reason, and it is a very GOOD REASON, that you shell out hundreds of dollars a night to stay in a Disney resort. Let's discuss the property here first: World gate resort is very conveniently located. You are about 10 minutes from the Disney parks and Disney attractions. You are also close to International Drive and Universal attractions as well as the Outlets. Location is great. The building itself is nice, very big, newly remodeled. The grounds are ugly. All you see is parking lots. If nice views are something that makes your vacation better, don't stay here. There is also a hideous giant Mermaid attached to one of those tourist trap gift stores right at the entrance to this property. They sell fake Belle and fake Ariel generic Disney crap to tourists. The rooms are large, very spacious. But they are also bare bones. You basically get two beds (in the double room) and an old tv from 1991. The floors in the rooms are ceramic tile. THAT'S RIGHT, CERAMIC TILE. So get ready to hear everything that is going on upstairs while you sleep. There are no ground floor rooms so you will have an upstairs concert to deal with. I don't know what the people on top of us were doing but they seemed to be rearranging furniture at some point. I guess that is all there is to do when you have a tv from 1991. There are also supposed 'sleep number' beds in some of these rooms. Well the trick to that is that they don't work. So I don't know if they are just the mattresses and these people got em off Craig's list to fill their rooms or what but the ones in our room didn't work. And there was no sleep number beds in the second room we were changed to-- more on this event later. The bathrooms were clean and the hotel itself is pretty immaculate which is definitely an advantage to this hotel. It's so clean and so sterile looking that you're reminded of an assisted living facility. It doesn't really feel like a hotel or a \"resort\". It feels like you've checked in for rehab. They can't even slap a picture of a wine glass and some grapes or some other kitchy crap anywhere. There are no pictures hanging on the walls in the rooms. It's kind of sad and depressing. But at least it's clean! Only it isn't cleaned up once you check in and stay in the rooms. After 2 days, the maid service had not come by. That's a stark contrast to at Disney when you come in and you have flippin' towel animals awaiting your return. You know, you think, \"well towel animals, that's lame\". But when you come back to unmaid beds, no new towels and four walls with not so much as a flower vase anywhere, you long for towel animals. Even though we indicated that our room needed housekeeping by flipping the door sign, nobody came by. We had our room changed and in this second room, there were no sleep number beds and a smaller tv. The cooler was also right next to my bed so I had to hear a humming sound along with the people jumping about upstairs. The mattresses were like sleeping on packing peanuts. SO HERE IS THE WORST PART ABOUT THIS HOTEL: THE ARBITRARY AND RANDOM FEES THAT NEVER STOP COMING OUT OF YOUR DEBIT CARD!!!!! When you check in, they grab you for a $25.00 resort fee. Which is of course, B.S. They should add that into the nightly rate you pay up front but they tell you this quaint little story about how Expedia doesn't allow them to collect resort fees. This is a bold faced lie. There are many hotels which include resort fees in their nightly rates. They simply want to charge your card for 'incidentals' and leave a hold authorization they can keep open so they can charge you for anything you bust while you're up there. Unless you are traveling with Charlie Sheen, I don't know that you're going to trash your hotel room. So $25.00 should be all you're shelling out when you check in right? WRONG. They also charge you additional \"self parking fees\" and \"wifi fees\" and \"pool fees\" and it doesn't matter if you use the wifi or if you even had a car to park or if you use the pool or not. You still have to pay them. I had to shell out a total of $50 in fees in addition to my nightly rate. This money got taken out of my account on the first night and on the second night it came out AGAIN. I marched myself to the front desk, only to be greeted by a surly woman who hated her life, and she told me there was nothing she could do about the hotel double charging me and that I had to wait up to 5 business days to get a credit back. When we changed hotel rooms, they charged me ANOTHER $25.00 authorization fee. All in all, I was charged $100 extra in arbitrary fees, not withstanding the $44 in resort fees that I had to pay. The $100 was just from their system goofing up. And this was new years weekend mind you, so my bank was closed. I'm still waiting on whether or not these fees will be returned. Luckily, one of the employees there was very helpful when I checked out and she gave me her card and said she'd personally take care of it. I do appreciate that much. But it should have never happened. WORD TO THE WISE: If you are on a LIMITED BUDGET and you are using your DEBIT CARD with earmarked funds for your vacation, DO NOT stay in World Gate or any other so called \"resort\" that doesn't bear the brand of a reputable hotel such as Marriott, Hilton, etc. You will find these private owner places are basically ripping you off. I hate to say it about this hotel because the location was good and it was very clean, but they are charging you for services that should be free and or worked into the nightly rate already. They don't even offer complimentary breakfast. That is pretty lousy. DON'T STAY HERE WITH KIDS. It is definitely a business/conference style hotel. No signs that that you are in Disney except for the kitchy Mickey stuff in the gift shop. The kids won't enjoy staying here and honestly, neither will guests enjoy hearing kids screaming and running in cavernous hallways and rooms with ceramic tile. Also, get ready to pay $1 for a soda can in the vending machines, have poor to no housekeeping and experience bad attitudes from some of the employees. The employees in the coffee shop were very nice people and so was the lady who took care of me at check out. Bottom line? I recommend this for people who aren't watching their pennies while on vacation and c an afford a screw up from a hotel with fees and has no kids and just wants a place to sleep-- uncomfortably.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cVery disappointed!\u201d", "Author": "Lamota", "ReviewID": "UR122343654", "Content": "Nothing good to write about this hotel.

I can say that I was surprised. They have done a lot of work on the North Tower and have completely redone the hallways and rooms. They removed all carpeting completely from everywhere and replaced with tile. The bathrooms are clean, walls repainted and doors redone. They also took the old furniture and either replaced it or re-painted, this include the bed frames. The pool area is clean, plenty of towels. The lobby is redone, gift shop/store, bar and arcade. Rooms are quiet and dark if desired. Many of the problems other travelers have reported are now not applicable to the North Tower. Cons: What do you come to a hotel for? to sleep ... right?! The sleep number bed are horrible. They are two doubles; there is plenty of room for queens. The TV's have not been replaced and there is no decoration. Windows cannot be opened, no balconies at all. We had friends in the South Tower in the TimeShare units. These hallways are still old and musty; the rooms have not been redone, old furniture. However the electronics have been updated with nice large screen TV in each room. The kitchen was small but clean, and nice large table and all the kitchen appliances and dishes etc. So it was small and comfortable. Overall the place was much improved over previous reports, the staff was friendly and on Xmax weekend 2011 had plenty of staff. Sure there are more improvements possible but this is a step in the right direction and this place is not closing its doors with the new ownership investing in the upgrades.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jackson", "Title": "\u201cThis place was the worst!\u201d", "Author": "John H", "ReviewID": "UR121862253", "Content": "The hotel was dirty, the rooms and hallways are tile so if you plan on sleeping don't stay here.

They are stripping the rooms down to the pipes and boards and building each one back up into a modern beautifully furnished room. You can't ask for anything more than to have owners who care and are clearly putting a ton of money into renovations. On top of which the management on site are dedicated and really do care to help make this a gorgeous resort. Rob Lewis and Michele Parker are the icing on the cake, they want to make a difference and it shows in many ways. The chef truly knows what he is doing in the kitchen, our buffet dinners were excellent. We were made to feel very at home and welcomed and the sincereity fo the management to do the right thing is very evident.

I spoke to a few employees that have been there anywhere from 5-20 years and when the new owner come in, he knocked everyone down to $8 an hour, no matter how long they had been there. The new owner has also taken microwaves and refrigerators out of all of the rooms and charges $15 a day if you want them in your room. We were checking in and first thing I see running across the floor in the lobby was a huge spider ( I am very afraid of spiders). They have to change my room 3 times because I kept getting a non smoking one and we wanted smoking (what is on the doors and what is in the computer do not match up). We finally get into our room and the room was nice and clean. The beds they have are the sleep number beds which the first nigh was like sleeping on a brick because the controller was messed up, I finally got it to work by holding the button down for a couple of minutes. The other issue was, on my reservation and confirmation we were suppose to get a buffet breakfast for 2 everyday. When I checked in they only gave me 2 and said the new owners said to only give 2 no matter what the reservation said. We happened to check our credit card statement online only to find that the resort had charged us over $300 (the room was paid for a month in advance through bookit.com). The next day there was a charge for $127 from the resort. Needless to say that this totally messed up our honeymoon. I spent a lot of time on the phone with bookit and a lot of time trying to talk to the hotel to get it straightened out. We finally got the charges reversed back onto the credit card and got the other 2 days of breakfast, but the manager did not care one bit that we were on our honeymoon and missed going to Universal Studios because of all the mess going on. We ended up having to leave with unused Universal tickets. The manager would not even comp us another night, he said that he had the charges reversed and that was enough. Oh I almost forgot the 2nd day we were there, we had a lizard in our room. I do have to say that the staff was awesome (all but the manager). They are very knowledgeable, nice, and try to help you anyway they can. The manager and the owner needs to take lessons from the employees on how to treat customers.

We stayed for only one night (thank God), and still shudder. When we initially made the reservation it was under the Radisson name. Then we were told of the name change. We were still under the impresstion that it would still be a Radisson class hotel. Boy were we wrong. We arrived just before dark, and our misgivings started as we noticed the unkempt and rundown appearance of the approach road and grounds. Lights in the parking lot by the south tower were out, so the whole area was dark. How unsafe is that?? The lobby looked downright sad, with a neglected and worn air. Desk staff were peremptory and not particularly friendly. I had serious reservations about the elevators. The air conditioning did not appear to work in them, and one displayed a safety certificate that had expired in 2009!!!!!! We had a Handicapped Accessible room on the 5th floor of the south tower. The laminate flooring near the door had buckled. The carpet in the remainder of the room was dirty. So were the windows. Water stains on the curtains and ceiling. Mould and mildew in the bathroom and the fan did not work. The whole place smelled musty. The thermostat in the room did not work, and we had to call maintenance. He told us that the only way to adjust the temperature was for them to do it from the maintenance room. What???? There was no fridge in the room. Since I need one to store medication, they sent one up to the room after telling us that there would be an additional charge for it. The security deadbolt on the door would not close. Cable TV was a joke: we only had 3-4 channels. They provide a breakfast (extra charge) which we did not attempt. Frankly we couldn't get out of there fast enough in the morning. And they have the nerve to charge an additional resort fee??? We were told that the resort is undergoing a major renovation. Well good. It's either that or it should be condemned.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS HOTEL! OR CHANGE IF YOUR BOOKED TO GO HERE! Where to begin with this monstrosity of a hotel. We booked our holiday through COSMOS who labelled this down as a 4 star hotel. On arrival we was expecting the \"raddison\" to find that the name has been ripped off the hotel sign or when actually in the hotel, it looks as if a child has scratched or scribbled the name out on phones with a black pen. We arrived late evening on the day we arrived to welcoming reception staff who were more than happy to fob off the room keys to their latest bunch of well traveled mugs. To cut a long story short, we didnt change our room just once, we ended up changing a further 4 times. All rooms there are a joke, they are damp, moldy, hairs within the bed sheets, carpets were torn, windows dont look as if they have been washed or wiped since the building was put up. One room we walked in and it was as if the floor was flooded and smelt of urine. Make sure when given a room you open and check all your drawers as inside they are damp and smell of mold. We complained numerous times to which the staff looked embarrassed, seems to be a key feature in this hotel, they didnt seem surprised. All this took place within the south tower of the worldgate hotel. We did ask however to be transfered into the north tower to which we was turned down bluntly as the north tower was apparently being renovated and was due to take months. The joke was on us though as during the end of our stay (end of september) we noticed more and more lights in the north tower were turned on at night whilst returning home from our dinner. Pretty much the top 3 floors had someone in, it just shows how they lie and happy to fob people off in order to get some calmness. If you find any problem with your room (believe me which you will) straight away with no regrets march to the front desk and demand a room in the north tower or at the top. However we was finally in the end put in a time share suite in the south tower on the fifth floor which was actually nice. Didnt smell, had a queen size bed, fridge and microwave, both free of charge. Other rooms you are charged daily for use of items. Rooms are meant to be cleaned everyday I think or every other day, this is a lie, after 5 days of being at the hotel and the room not being cleaned, we finally complained to which the lady at the desk would put us down on the hotels list for the room to be cleaned the following day, this however was another lie and it took another 3 days for the room to be cleaned. Bins are not cleared in room, towels are not replaced, we had to complain again in order for some bloke to come up in the night an deliver fresh ones. Be warey of the shuttle bus times, numerous occasions, if your a minute late you will find that the bus has already left. And if you are off to sea world or universal, be prepared to wait for 2 hours after the park has shut to be picked up which is tedious, spesh if raining. I would suggest to get a car if you are able to, in order to get to the universal and sea world parks, getting to disney parks is easy and once inside the disney park they have their own shuttle buses which are in motion every 20 minutes which take you everywhere. There is no shuttle bus to busch gardens, but if you go NEXT DOOR TO THE RAMADA! theres a shuttle bus that goes everyday there from 09:30am which is free, this was useful, just need to show them your park/flexi ticket. At reception we noticed a sign mentioning a resort fee was to be paid of $10 a day plus tax, to which on checkout the lady behind the front desk made aware that there was no charge for our stay there, however we are still to look at our credit card balance to see if the truth was told, --- probably not. All in all the holiday was really good but the hotel was a let down, If youve got the money, go to a disney hotel as you will be looked after and treated much better, this hotel is not the four star stated, everything has been downgraded and is falling apart, on arrival it was like a ghost town, we thought we was the only ones there. Dont waste your leisure time and money to go to this hotel, change with travel agency if already booked to get moved elsewhere, or if youve got the money, always always go disney!

We had read the reviews on here and were a little concerned how bad the reviews were (however know some people moan over the slightest thing). Well all I can say is I wish we had listened to the reviews and acted on it before we arrived. We were told our room was on the 1st floor when we entered the corridor it had a VERY strong smell of damp/dirt. We then entered the room to find a heavily stained carpet, dirty bathroom and genital hairs on the bed. The sleep number bed did not work and when we looked to see if it was plugged in there were bare wires coming out of the plug covered in electrical tape! The smell in the room was unbearable. We went back to the check in desk and asked to be put in a different room, after a few minutes of the lady looking on the computer she stated they had only one other king room, we also added that the first room did not have a fridge in it (we were told all rooms had fridges) the lady stated that the new management company instructed them to be removed from all rooms a week back and that if guests wanted a fridge back in their rooms they were to pay an extra $10 per night! On top of the $10 resort fee!!! The second room was located in the same tower however on a different floor. When we entered the new room as well as the smell of damp there was also a urine smell to the room along with hairs on the bed and a dirty bathroom! We sat on the bed and just wanted to cry! The beds May I add were very flat and don\u2019t know how people could ever get to sleep in them! With this we called our holiday company and asked to be relocated to a different hotel. They did this for us straight away and when we went back down the check out the lady at the desk looked very embarrassed and informed us we were not the first to refuse to stay! What has upset us is we were informed we would be staying in a 4 star hotel and to be honest it was not even a 1 star! Another small thing is that the Pizza Hut Express no longer carries the name \u201cPizza Hut\u201d and it is no longer listed as a Disney Good Neighbour hotel!

I just got home from my vacation to Orlando/Disney and was pleasantly surprised about this hotel. I have stayed in budget hotels before when coming to Disney and none have had so much for an affordable price. When we (me,wife, and two sons) checked in we where offered and upgrade to a suite type room. Normally I stay in a budget hotel to save a little money so I declined. The girl at the front told us that if we changed our minds to come back. After two days at the parks running around I decided that we did need a little more space and it would be nice for the next few days to take it easy and spend time at the pool. So I checked out the upgraded room and wow! almost twice the size with a sofa and a kitchen. The price wasn't bad either so i got it. I should have gotten it when we checked in because the next few days felt like we where relaxing at home. The rest of our stay went off without a hitch. The wife got to go shopping while me and the boys stayed at the pool and watched a Disney movie in the theater area. I also saw they had an arcade and some video game systems for kids but we never used them because we where always running around the area to the parks or enjoying the pools. All in all a great stay.

The resort is made up of a south and north tower with a mix of timeshare customers and your typical paying guest like we were. The hotel is large in size with roughly 7 floors per tower with a shared lobby and pool. The lobby area is clean and welcoming with a well stocked shop, pizza hut express, brews Starbucks coffee and a restaurant also. The rooms were very clean, tidy and accessible via one of three lifts. Our room consisted of a bath/shower, two queens size beds, a table chair area, no balcony, CRT TV with 30 channels, air con and fridge. The beds are 'sleep number beds' which allow you to pick a comfort level for the mattress which was a nice touch. The rooms, while very clean, do show age in the bathroom. For example the plug hole on the shower was rusted but only a minor down point. All rooms have free WiFi access which worked well during the day however refused to work at all late at night (busy time of year so hotel was very busy). Location wise the hotel is perfectly placed for Disney. AK is right off the next traffic lights, follow the road, right and then left again... easy! The rest of Disney is also near by with very easy access to all Disney locations. There are also plenty of places to eat near by with a Publix & Target just down the road, Walmart is a 10min trip. The outside of the hotel does show its ages badly and is in a need of a re-paint but this seems to apply for many of the hotels on both iDrive and the 192. The outside of the hotel should not put you off as inside is rather nice. The resort fee is around $8 per day which we felt was very expensive so watch out for this!

The location is fab lots of places to eat and things to do ie mini golf in the surrounding area, if yu got a room on the top floor in the north tower of th hotel you got fab views of the top of Expedition everest ride at Animal Kingdom and you could also see the top of the Tower of terror at Disneys Hollywood Studios and every night we saw the fireworks from Hollywood Stuidos and also the amazing fireworks from the magic kingdom. The hotel has a nice bar and the food from there i lovely, the staff are all very friendly and always say morning, evening etc when you walked past reception. The rooms do need modernisation especially the bathrooms which were pretty awful the bath was peeling and dirty we showered in it because all we were doing was standing, if i had had a child with me i would not have bathed them in there!! Our travel operator told us we we booked that the otel had a shuttle service to and from the Disney Parks, Universal Studios and Sea World........yes they had a shuttle service but the times were awful! The shuttle to Universal and Seaworld left the hotel at 7.20am - it went to another couple of hotels before making the 30 min journey to th parks, the ONLY return shuttle from these parks picks up at 7:30pm from universal and then 7:45 from sea world.....how can a shuttle company expect people to spend approx 10 hours in one place. The bus to Disney was at 8:55am which took you to animal kingdom you then had to get one of the disney shuttle busses (which were excellent) to what park you wished to be at. The return shuttle was at 5:20 pm from animal kingdom, 10:00pm from epcot and then the LAST shuttle of the day is 10:45pm from the magic kingdom (ticket and transportation centre) this is a boat rideor monorail ride away rom the magic kingdom which at that time of night ar both ful as th fireworks show/parade doesnt finish till 10:30 so if you want to make the bus you have to leav the fireworks early. From observation many other hotels had shuttles that ran throughout the day at different times. I realise many families, couples etc will hire a car when in Florida i can drive but would not have been confident to drive over there, also if there is a couple going and neither of them drive they would rely on this shuttle bus service.

Firstly it is excellent value for money, considering what you get in the uk for way more it gets my vote on the value for money section. On arrival feeling tired and drained we were made to feel very welcome by the front desk and answered all our questions and gave us some very good advise. Throughout our stay we had NO problems with anything. The room was clean on arrival. New towels and bed linnen. Fresh smell very comfortable beds. We had a twin double room on the north tower 7th floor. The room was kept clean daily, for those complaining about maids not visiting we vacated the room by 11am most days and always came back to a clean room. Fresh towels daily and beds made, bins emptied. Our room came with a/c, fridge and a safe. I thought the rooms were very well equiped considering i was paying roughly $70 per night. If you are expecting world class accomadation then look elsewhere and pay the difference! But for a simple room which evrything you will need is there then you cant go wrong. The pool was great 24 hour opening times and a spa pool which was hot! Always kept clean and tested twice daily from what i could see. This is perfect after a long day walking around the parks. Pool does get busy 9-11pm though day times it was like a ghost town which is great for a relaxing day off. Towels were always available on the poolside and it was always kept clean. We paid for bed and breakfast, and found the buffet (all you can eat) to be very good value and good quality food. The restraunt staff were always on hand for drinks and very freindly. Food ranged from hot to cereal and cakes along with coffee juice etc. We also ate at the pizza hut and the grill. No problems with service in the food court and the grill meals were very good and generously sized! There is a small shop that sells snacks, drinks, toiletries and alcohol etc which is open till midnight. We did the disney parks and universal with the provided transport (no car) and found it to be excellent. Although in disney you do need to sometimes catch the internal transport to other parks for parks such as hollywood studios, animal kingdom and the water parks. You get more than enough time in the parks with the provided transport times. For the price you cant really go wrong, we stopped in a villa the week before which was twice the price and found this hotel to be much better. Yes the rooms may seem dated to some (wood decour around tv and draws) but its not somthing that put us off at all. Taxis are slightly expensive we paid $30 to universal and around $20 to magic kingdom on the days we didnt use the hotel transport but car hire is available inside the hotel.

The property is very much maintained in the front of resort but the back is left very unsightly. The two pools were not cared for due to the fact that they were both outdoor pools. When standing near the pool I never could ever smell the chlorine and the pool looked like the \"PH\" was no where in sight. There was dirt in the pools and leaves from the trees all on the floor of pools. The pool near the lobby is definitely taken more care of then the one in the back. The employees did not look happy at all to be working there either. It's like they all had to force a smile whenever they saw us walk by. The first night we put our sign on the door to have housekeeping clean room. Later in afternoon, I noticed that it was convienently turned the other way saying that we did not need service. This seemed really strange. The second day, housekeeping cleaned our room and when I pulled sheets back, hair all over sheets. I brought this to attention to housekeeping attendant and she blamed the women downstairs whom actually washed the sheets. And woudn't you think that it would be appropriate to spray some type of room freshner each time they cleaned the room? The rooms have wear and tear in them. Soiled carpets. Soiled tubs with stains that will not come out. Their sleep number beds, I'm sure were wonderful back in the 90's but they were so hard and worn. They do not have flatscreen. They have the old model televisions. They do not have central regulated air, they have the old wall units near the windows. They do not have microwaves in their rooms. This is a strategic tactic to force you to use their restaurants. I asked an employee where I could go to heat up some food and I was told to go to the Pizza Hut downstairs and have them heat up my food. The 5th floor smells completely full of mold. The resort has so much potential to be a great hote despite where it lacks at. They could make up for with great customer service and running a cleaner resort. The water pressure in the hotel is amazing. I swear I felt like I had a $100.00 massage. The pressure points were wonderful. The view was very nice if you get a room facing the front entrance. The bedspreads were nice and white along with the feather down pillows. The towels they provide are actually white. The toiletries they provide in the room are very nice as well. Nice large soaps, etc....... Closet space was plentiful.. I loved the lighting over each door as you put the key into your door to get into the room. The business center is a walk though. It is in the same area as the banquet rooms. I dont understand why the guest are charged a resort fee each day. What is that for? Parking is free.They have a nice castle Disney area for the kids that was a great idea. All in all, if you are looking for a sub standard hotel, this is it.

We booked the hotel through OrlandoVacations.com and paid $49 for night 1 and $55 for nights 2 thru 4. We prepaid for the entire hotel stay and printed out a confirmation letter to bring with us. I have to admit that I was a little wary when driving up to the hotel. It doesn't have much curb appeal. It needs a lot of landscaping and one of the fountains was drained and the other was dirty. Looking at the outside, you can tell that this is an older property that could definitely use some updating. But, once I stepped into the lobby, I started feeling better. The floors were clean and shiny - looked freshly waxed. Everything was very clean and I was immediately greeted by both of the women behind the counter. It only took about 15 minutes to check in (I had to check the WDW tickets that I ordered to make sure they were correct). I asked about a resort fee because I saw quite a few reviews that said that they were charged a resort fee without being told about it. I was assured that there wouldn't be any additional fees and then, it was off to the room. The elevator was a little slow and there was only one operating the entire time we stayed there. But, this wasn't a problem because the hotel wasn't crowded. Walking down the halls towards the room, I noticed that the hallway and floors were very clean. When I got to the room, I did my usual inspection tour. The room was pretty clean. I didn't find any dust bunnies, hairs, bugs, nothing. I pulled back the spread to check out the sheets and the mattresses for cleanliness and bed bugs. Again, it was very clean. We had Sleep Number beds. I think mine was broken - I was able to adjust it to a number that I liked, but unable to change it throughout the stay. We had 2 double beds and my friend's bed squeaked a lot. We didn't complain about it, so I don't know how that would have been handled if we had. The only dust I saw was in the bathroom vent and around the edges of the small fridge. The furnishings in the room are very dated, but for the bargain price that we got, I have no complaints. Oh, and the room was huge. There was so much floor space that we would have blown up a full to queen sized air mattresses and put it down and still had walking room. That was a pleasant surprise. The bathroom itself was very clean too. There was some scratching/stains in the bathtub on the bottom. Not pleasant to look at, but no big deal. The water pressure was divine. I didn't want to get out when I showered! The only complaint that I have about the room is that the fridge wasn\u2019t very cold. It was old and needed to be replaced. The pool was clean from what I could see. I didn't use it while I was there because by the time we came back, it was closed (close at 10 p.m.). Didn't eat at the hotel and didn't use the exercise facilities either so can't comment on either of those. This hotel at the price that we paid was just what we needed: clean, safe, quiet and close to all WDW parks. It was also close to the highway as well as many restaurants. We left our hotel everyday by 8 a.m. and didn't return until 8 or 9 p.m. so it worked for us. We slept soundly each night and were able to relax when we were in the room. Like the title says it was an excellent stay for the price. Yes, the hotel needs updating and the furniture is old. But, this was not presented to us as a luxury hotel so we weren't expecting that. The pictures that I saw of the hotel were pretty accurate. I know it has the word \u201cresort\u201d in the title and that is misleading. It was definitely not a resort. I read some of these reviews and think that some people just need something to complain about! Anyway, you can stay in a 5 star hotel and still be disappointed - the only difference is that you will have spent more money! If you expect filet mignon but you paid for hamburger steak, you'll be disappointed here. Otherwise, it's a great place to stay if all you need is a clean, safe, pleasant and cheap hotel to sleep and change clothes in as a base for your WDW vacation.

We made our reservations from Brazil 5 months before to avoid problems. We where four, me, my wife and two daughters, ages 8 and 10. There were two more families in the group, but I'll write only my family impressions. We arrived from NY at 4 pm, after that scaring blizzard, and the rooms where not ready. We all had to wait for about one hour. The manager was a very polite lady, but she didn't help and we had to keep waiting. The room was regular sized, with two beds, one table, tv, refrigerator, coffee machine (with coffee and sugar every day), cold and heat air conditioning, free internet access. The room wasn\u00b4t dirty, but it had a strange smell. The beds where small for a couple and they didn't have queen or king beds. So, there was no use in changing rooms. The mattresses where old and the bedspread had cigarette holes in it. The carpet near the beds had a red stain Old furniture. Few power outlets with two on the table (good) and two near the door (very difficult to use). The door lock wasn't very good, because my 8 year old daughter could pry it open with a bump of her sholder (we find it out accidentally). The bathroom was clean, but the bathtub had a lot of hair in the drain and was scratched, giving a dirty impression. The towel hangers were rusty. The shower was ok, but the water pressure could be stronger. The air conditioning was a little noisy and the coffee machine was dirty. Our room was in the end of the south wing. It was near the stairs (also dirty, with cigarette butts), that we used a lot to get to the car, but the internet signal was very weak there. The rooms closer to the middle of the building had a better signal, so we needed to go to the hall everytime we needed to access the web. It was very good to have a Pizza Hut in the hotel, but it wasn't serving breakfast (even though there was a sign that stated it did) and it started to close early when the hotel got fewer gests. The breakfast in the restaurant was good, but expensive. They stopped serving continental breakfast when the hotel got fewer gests. The location is excelent if you want to go to Disney parks. Only 5 minutes (really!) from animal kingdom. There are some good places to have breakfast or have a sandwich at walking distance, but because Maingate Lane is a little deserted, I thought it was safer to go by car. In the 11th day of stay, there was a problem in the room right above ours and a lot of water fell from the ceiling of the bathroom. The handyman who went there was very considerate and polite and got us another room, but we didn't get even an apology from the front desk. I rated 2 on service only because of the handyman.

They had free wi fi which was amazing and meant that we could check our emails and things daily which considering Disney charge $10 for 24 hours was amazing, they had a kids club and other activities. A resort fee was never mentioned to us not on check in or checks out and we were only 1 mile away from Disney, it never took us more than 10 mins to get to a Disney park.

We needn't have been. This was our 8th visit to Orlando (3rd with children) and we've stayed in 5 different hotels. This was one of the best if not the best. The room (629) was much bigger than any room we've had previously in Orlando. It came complete with 2 sleep number beds (which were fab), a big tub (not just a shower tray) which meant our young son could have a bath, a fantastic air conditioning unit (much needed after days spent at theme park in record high temperatures), a fairly decent sized fridge, safety deposit box (which I tried to lift out but this one was secured properly), hair dryer and an iron and ironing board. Fair enough the room looked out over the conference centre and a fair few air conditioning units which meant there was a bit of noise at night but you got used to it and after spending up to 8 hours wandering around theme parks we were tired enough to sleep anyway. As for stains on the carpet, show me a hotel (over a year old) anywhere in the world that doesnt have stains on the carpet. You've got to assume that most rooms accomodate over 100 different people over the course of a year, some of which will be kids, can anyone honestly expect hotel staff to keep the carpets stain free? I certainly dont. The staff at the front desk were helpful enough, the lady in the gift shop could have been cheerier. The arcade amusements were rubbish, much worse than those at the old Rodeway Inn on I-drive. But how long on a 2 week trip would you want to spend in them though? Not long enough for it to be a major complaint for us. Also, as someone else said in a previous review, a firm \"No\" works when it comes to the timeshare people. The cleaning staff were fantastic and I really want to single out Pam Munson for special praise. She was awesome. My son always looked forward to returning to the room to see how Pam had arranged his toys. I just hope someone from the hotel management (maybe Mark Johns if you're still there) reads this review and makes sure that Pam knows how appreciated she was by us. As for the distances from the hotel to the attraction it actually is only a mile until the exit off 192 for Disney World. It's a few miles more to get to the actual parks right enough. We left the car park in Animal Kingdom one afternoon and were back in our hotel room within 10 minutes. There were also plenty amenities in the area surrounding the hotel. We were a bit worried that the hotel was situated a bit out of the way if you like. Ponderosa, a supermarket and a liquor store were just across the road. Bob Evans, Perkins and Golden Corral and a few McDonalds and Burger Kings etc were pretty close by too. We weren't charged a resort fee either. One complaint I did have (but not about the hotel) was the cost of parking at the theme parks. $15 a day is ridiculous, especially at Universal where you still have a good 10 or 15 minute walk to the actual entrance to Islands Of Adventure or the Studios. At least Disney take you to the park entrance! Over a fun-packed 14 days this amounts to over \u00a3100 for parking your car, but I suppose you could use the shuttle service provided by the hotel but we prefer to be independant and hire a car. The hotel had 2 heated pools and a hot-tub which were surrounded by plenty of seating and a bar. We only used one pool but it was a perfect temperature at 9am in the morning.

The hotel is located right downtown so when it comes to eating that will not be a problem...you can walk to any restaurant! The hotel also states free shuttle to the parks. Beware!! It does have shuttle buses but in some park like Orlando Studios and Islands of Adventure you actually have to stay there for like 12 hours before you can go back to the hotel...it doesn't have shuttles coming in and out. It's one in the morning going to the parks and another one coming back at night... For Disney is the same thing...it only has shuttles for Magic Kingdom and EPCOT...however from magic kingdom returning it has 3 diff times to return and you can play around with this since Disney offers free shuttles from their parks so if you go to Animal Kingdom you would have to take the monorail to Magic Kingdom to catch your shuttle... Always be aware of the times!! Because if you miss those buses you will have to grab a cab.... Public transportation is non existent in Orlando soooo if your hotel doesn't offer shuttles you better be renting a car to get around!! Taxis are super expensive!! From the airport to this hotel it costs $60 US dollars!! The hotel is 15 away by car from Disney which would cost you about 25 - 30 dollars...and for Orlando Studios double that amount.... Also another thing about this hotel is that the a/c were old so the room kinda smelled...I had to spray perfume around to make it go away... The people at the parks, hotels and locals are super nice and friendly! I had many great experiences with everyone... oh and one more thing...they sell Timeshare at this hotel...if you have 1 hour free you might want to consider doing it since you get a free breakfast and $80 cash to spend...Just make sure you're saying no at the end of the presentation since it is a scam..;", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cayce, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel and Staff, would and will stay again!!!!

My son is 11 years old and i am a female and we had no problems what so ever. They have pools to swim in, a ping pong table, and other things to do outside. Inside they have a pizza hut and a dinning area that was nice to have close by. We played in the video room they had and it was nice plus they show a movie for the kids to sit and watch and its on everyday and they also have video games there for the children to play (even though i seen more adults playing the video games and these are free to play). The hotel was clean and the staff there were great. When i got there I asked to change rooms since i was a smoker and needed a room for that the girl at the front desk took her 5 min and she changed our room over with no problems at all. My son loved the sleep bed and loved how u could set it to soft and the pillows were soft too, just a great bed (wished i could have brought it home). Our room was clean and huge and the housekeeping staff kept it that way for us. My son loved the fact that he could leave his dinosuar he made at down town disney there and the maid made the bed and placed his dinosuar in the middle of the bed, he thought that was so cool of her. We had nothing touched in our room or nothing missing, the housekeeping staff was great. We even had the front desk call and ask us if everything was alright and if we needed anything, what more could we ask for. The outside of the hotel was clean and beautiful with the water fountains out front. This is a nice hotel and don't see why so many people say bad things about it. Sure there might be a broken piece of wood here or a stain in the carpet here or there but u need to realize that many people stay here and that is a lot of wear and tear on a place. We paid $47.00 a night here and that was a great price for a hotel this nice. We stayed in Jacksonville for one night and paid 78.00 for a small room and that place was the dump, it was smelly, had bugs, and nothing in the room except a small bed and a old tv and u had to pay for channels to watch, so sometimes price is not a better hotel. If u want a great place to stay and that is close to all the parks, food and lots of other places then this is the place to stay. We hope to come back next year and if we do we will be staying here again.

I was very nervous that we were in for a miserable week, but the price was too good to pass up! With a military discount, we were able to get the room for less than $250 for the week. I figured we were going to spend most of our time at Disney, so it was worth the risk. Luckily, it worked out in our favor as the Radisson was amazing! The accommodations were very luxurious. The bedding and decor was very modern, and every thing was very clean. The bed was crazy comfortable, and felt amazing to sink into after a long day at the theme parks. The pools on site were always quiet and very clean. The tiki bar area had a nice relaxing atmosphere. One annoying thing was that house keeping did not come during our stay. Since this is set up as a time-share resort, they assume people will clean up after themselves. It does kind of suck, however, if you are staying in the hotel rooms. We just asked for towel service every day, and kept the place as tidy as we could. The only other complaint I had about out stay was that there was an alarm went off in the room next to ours every morning at 5 a.m.. We had to call down to the front desk every morning to ask them to come up and turn it off, so we could sleep. The shuttle service they offered was great! It was easy to use, and saved a lot of time and money. There are 3 or 4 scheduled pick ups a day that take you to Disney, and then 3 or 4 return times. These are scheduled times, and not suggestions. This isn\u2019t a taxi service, so you need to make sure that you arrive at least 10 or 15 minutes before the shuttle leaves so that you aren\u2019t left behind. Don\u2019t get mad at the driver if you are late and he doesn\u2019t wait for you. It is actually rude of you to expect him to considering you are then keeping every one else from getting on with their day.

Please note the EXPRESS at the end of the name. Yes, prices are higher, but you get your pizza faster. We were not in a hurry, so we ordered delivery from a Pizza Hut and got it at the regular rates.

Pros: Whoever cleaned our room was fantastic. Despite the huge mess we'd often leave whenever we got back to our room at the end of the day it always looked perfect and orderly. Free shuttle service to Universal Studios, Seaworld, and Disney world. Daily breakfast buffet. Sleep number beds. Helpful staff. had a pool and hot tub. Cons: Some maintenance issues. Some pieces of tiling on the counter in our room were loose and would fall off. The floor of the tub looked wretched -- as though they had sanded it down to paint it after having rust issues and just.. forgotten to paint it. The lock on the bathroom door was broken. Seating in the hot tub seemed like it was falling apart (very gritty and sandy feeling). The last two days we were there apparently their debit and credit machines were down in the food court and restaurant which was extremely inconvenient since we'd used up all of our American cash by then. So no on-site food for us unless we wanted to take out more American cash. No complimentary breakfast, the buffet was about 10 bucks per person. The shuttle service seemed a bit confused. There were specific pick up points but often times buses in the pick up points to either side would take you to your hotel too (except then sometimes they wouldn't). Once our bus went from a hotel literally a block from our own, to two miles out of town to a different hotel before taking us back to ours, which was quite odd and inconvenient. Only one usable computer in the business center. About the Area: Some cheap gift shops nearby if that's your thing and a small supermarket a few blocks away. There's an Ihop and McDonalds just up the road, but overall dining in this area is pretty impoverished. There are a ton of steak houses in the area, but really nothing else (I believe there was one very rundown looking Indian restaurant). If you have diverse food tastes you'll be out of luck without a rental car and map. Quite far from most shopping and nightlife.

I had to go to a nearby grocery store by taxi and for whatever reason they had to change drivers along the way, which took 10 minutes in itself.

The very nice lady at the front desk understood my frustration, and after I called Priceline to inform them of this unsatisfactory stay, I was able to move to another hotel and get a refund for the remainder of my stay, and at that point I booked alternate accomodations at the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress (an EXCELLENT hotel that makes this place look like the filthiest rat hole ever!) I called a Mears cab, and got away from this place as fast as I could! Management would not return calls or emails of complaint, and I only got somewhere after using a complaint website that sent an email to them every time someone looked at the complaint, at which point they begged me to stop the emails.

The staff was helpful with requests, the breakfast buffet was excellent, on my last night they had a HUGE screen tv and were showing movies to watch while you sat by the pool or swam! Wow!

I have a very dotty back at the moment and the dots did bleed. Great location for Disney if you don't mind a few bugs sharing your room and less manic than I Drive. About 15-20 mins from Universal. We actually preferred the location to I Drive, which seems to have got really tacky these days. The bar area was great, as it was open and so if you fancied a couple of drinks, the kids could sit with you, so long as they were at a table away from the bar. The bar tender (Ray) was from Liverpool and had a great American accent. He liked to talk, but was very nice and kept us entertained. Ray was actually the best part about the hotel. I'm not a fussy traveller. I'm happier in a beach hut in Thailand than a 5* luxury.

Also this isn't a 5 star hotel it is a 2-3 star and you aren't paying 5 star prices. They are in the process of remodeling and our room was redone and it was fine. I wasn't crazy about the sleep number beds because when you have 2 people on a full size bed there is only 1 control and when one person moves at night the air in the mattress makes you move and it feels really weird. If no one moves its comfy. One thing to it is so close to the Disney parks its unbeliveable. Just drive to the parks the shuttle is very crowded and the times aren't aways handy. It is $12.00 per day to park at Disney and it is worth it. There is a $7.95 a day resort for unlimited local calls and unlimited WiFi and several other things there is also local and state taxes 13 percent to be exact so that figures about $13.00 a day in addition to the $7.95.

If anyone has taken this type of a trip with a large group of teenagers, you know it's not easy, and you wouldn't trust them with a 4 star hotel... but a 3 star would have been nice, or maybe even a 2 star! The hotel has all the basic amenities, but beyond that... To start, the location is not great. There are some rundown $1.99 t-shirt shops in the area, an abandoned motel, and a nearly empty pond nearby. The landscaping looked a little rundown too. When we arrived the first morning we had breakfast in a large conference room. Everything was fine - nothing to write home about, but we were all fed well. That night, once inside, we realized the elevators couldn't handle this many people at once. Therefore, several of us took the stairs, only to notice that the exit door was propped open. Some security! It happened every day, so we had to be on the lookout to keep closing it. Once we got to our room, we found that four of us had been put in a room wth a king size bed and a twin pull out couch. A call got us another bed, and even though they told us there would be a $15/night charge, we must have complained loudly enough and haven't been charged yet. Once we tried to get that bed ready, though, we found out that the sheets were wet and filthy black, so that involved another call to the front desk to get a change of bedding. Once we started taking showers we found that we only had two towels - yet another call to the front desk. As for the condition of the room, we were lucky enough to get a Sleep Number bed, so we were okay for one bed. Neither the pull out or the rollaway bed were comfortable, though, and all our friends complained about their lumpy beds with springs poking them. The ceiling and walls needed painting, the bathtub plug would not hold the water in for a bath, the air conditioner was either too cold or ineffective, there were not enough outlets, and one of the outlets that was there didn't work. While looking for outlets we found trash behind a nightstand. There was a coffee pot with the fixins, but no outlet to plug it into! The carpet appeared to have been changed within the last couple of years, though. The maid service was mediocre at best. The second night we came home to find the bed made, but neither the pull out bed nor the rollaway bed had been made. While we did have 4 new towels in the bathroom, there was no new bar of soap - luckily I carry one with me, so we didn't have to call to the front desk again. We had a child get sick at a park one day, so that night we stayed in and ordered room service. While the food was generally fine, they did not give us any napkins or silverware. Also, after we looked at the tray we realized that one dinner was served with two plates stuck together, the bottom one still dirty with a lot of ketchup! The kids in our group did seem to like the Pizza Hut, but teenagers aren't known for their culinary tastes, though, so I don't really know how it was. I went down one evening to get some medicine at the gift shop for the same sick child and was treated to some wonderfully rude service. They seemed to have a fair selection of food for the families to save money to eat in their room, tho. When we first arrived at the hotel there was a large group of Gold Wing riders, and there was another high school marching band there too, so this must be the hotel's business model - discounts for large groups. We commented that for the kids, this was probably an adequate hotel, and they likely didn't notice all these things since they were having fun with their friends. To people who stay at hotels regularly, though, this place was really a mess, and I couldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "March 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westminster, CA", "Title": "\u201cGood for the Value Minded, but better places out there\u201d", "Author": "Zyloman", "ReviewID": "UR26423996", "Content": "We normally are very kind and lenient in rating hotels, and rarely do we even write but but we feel compelled to pass on that we would not recommend this hotel. Very bad first impression as we walked in to a somewhat chaotic environment. We arrived into the lobby around 11am after a long overnight flight and had to wait several minutes to get helped (hotel seemed very short staffed which could have something to do with the times). Once helped at the counter, we were told rooms would not be available until after 4pm (advertised check-in was 3pm). Although not being able to check-in at 11am is a convenience as opposed to a rule or must, this was about only the 3rd time in all our years of travelling, and first time at a Radisson or higher level property that we have NOT been able to check in at that time. The term \"resort\" really is misused here. While there is a nice pool, a Pizza Hut, convenience store, and Grill along with a nice play area for the kids (to watch movies and play free computer video type games), I would not classify this property as anywhere near the four-star property they pass themselves off as (or compared to other four star properties) and I what I would come to expect from the Radisson brand. Maybe it was just us, but we had that 2-2 1/2 star feeling here. Our room was average with only two full size beds (all properties of this name or caliber have been queen or larger size beds in the past for us). Room was reasonably sized with a frig, safe and desk, but no microwave which I think is kind of handy with small children. We continuously kept getting shorted towels and wash clothes and finally started hording them! We informed them over and again that we were with our two small children and needed 4 of everything but they kept bringing us 2-3 of everything the first four nights (and we are still here and counting!). The hotel advertises as providing shuttle service to the 4 major Disney theme parks. They provide shuttle service to SeaWorld and Universal, but to only two the Disney theme parks, EPCOT and Magic Kingdom. We were able to make due and get around once we got to EPCOT or Magic Kingdom as Disney shuttles can then take you to the other parks from there (ie Animal Kingdowm and Hollywood Studios). The advertising of the shuttle service to the four Disney theme parks was, however, one of the selling points and this is something I definitely let them know about as being false. The shuttle service itself was complete chaos with overfull buses and scrambling to get on them (these \"shuttles\" are in actuality city buses that make pick ups at several hotels in the vicinity of the Radisson and give the impression of making you feel like cattle given the overfilling of them). Shuttle pick up and return times did not coincide with park hours and were very limited so you had to plan a bit (only 2-3 to Magic Kingdom going and coming and only 1 to/fro to EPCOT). Maybe our expectations were simply to high about the shuttle service, but being so close in proximity to the Disney Resort area (only 2-5 miles to all Disney attractions) and advertising themselves as being THE closest non-Disney resort to the the Disney area would lead one to believe there would have been a nice, frequent, convenient shuttle schedule. There is an AVIS rental car desk on-site as well as an Adriatic Transportation service but I would not recommend either. AVIS rates were outrageous at $84 a day for a car (you can get one at Downtown Disney or the airport for WAY cheaper) and Adriatic kept quoting me different prices for transportation to the same locations and then lying and denying they ever quoted anything else (something I will be reporting). Overall friendliness of the staff was o.k. The hotel provides you good cleanliness and decent value if you are on a budget. You just have to temper your expectations a bit.

I started playing my face and told him that i was not happy that we now had to pack everything up and that our clothes were damp. He then after i pressured him a bit said that he would clean our clothes of which he did and whilst we went out have our stuff moved if we packed it up, so we packed up came back later that day to find that he had moved us to a better room with sleep number beds such an improvement. Although you shouldnt have cause to complain about anything when we did straight away something was done about it. When we arrived there we also had to have a rollaway bed of which we did not end up paying for as did we not pay for the resort fee either as we complained to Travel City Direct and a rep came out to make a report. The pool area was okay although lots of little lizards running about day and night and the pool at times was not cleaned and taken care of as it should be.Also a tip for you when you do have breakfast there do not pay for it as the food is not very good and they will expect a large tip and if you do not leave one they will call the managers and start playing there face.

Located off Highway 192, it is accessible from I-4 and other main roads. A drive to Disney World is about 5-10 minutes depending on which resort you are visiting. Parking is free, but included in a \"resort fee\" you will be charged of $4.95 per day. There were generous parking spaces over the weekend I visited, and it was not a problem to find a space reasonably close to a hotel entrance. The area around the hotel is surrounded by other hotels, a few restaurants, gas stations, and souvenir shops. DINING: The Radisson hosts several dining options in-house. The Savannah Grille is a sit-down restaurant with American and Caribbean cuisine. I did not eat there, so I cannot comment on the quality. There is also the Pralines Food Court with Pizza Hut Express, Starbucks coffee, and lots of other \"grab-n-go\" options like Vitamin Water, sodas, fruit, chips, and other snacks. A Vitamin Water and a bottle of Dasani water put me back over $6, so be prepared if you plan to eat here. Outside the hotel, there are a few restaurant choices including Red Lobster, Angel's Seafood, and Perkins, but there isn't a ton in the area in general. ATMOSPHERE: Pretty basic hotel, nothing fancy, very casual feel. I think this resort is intended for families who want to save a few bucks by not staying on Disney properties. There are two pools to enjoy, basketball and tennis courts, a fitness center, free wireless internet in your room, laundry facilities, and business center. There is a small game room on the lobby level as well as a children's \"theater\" showing Disney movies for children throughout the day. There is also a sundries shop in case you forgot something. The decor is unremarkable, very simple and no features that really stand out. THE ROOMS: We stayed in a 2nd floor room of the South tower, which is apparently an older section of the hotel. The hallway was clean and vacuumed. When we entered the room, there was a strong scent of cleaner and the room felt a little damp. My boyfriend said the carpet was wet, and he thought maybe they'd just cleaned them. Still, there were very noticeable stains all over the carpet, like juice, soda, and not sure what else. I booked the room for $45 on Priceline so I wasn't expecting their best room. The hotel advertises Sleep Number beds, but they were not in our room. In their guidebook, it says a small percentage of rooms do not have Sleep Number beds. Guess we were in that small percentage. The mattresses were fine, but very springy and you could tell they were slightly older. I'm always paranoid about sheets and bedspreads. The sheets were clean, but the velour blanket had many black hairs all over it. I didn't inspect the bedspread but pushed it back so that it only covered my legs. The bathroom was quite small, and to maneuver around to the shower you had to shut the door. The shower itself had seen better days. It was an oversized garden tub with white cloth shower curtain. There were a ton of chips on the bottom surface and also where the soap goes. The handle where you adjust water temperature needed some caulk as there was a gap between it and the wall. Included in the room was a TV (DirecTV was advertised as a hotel feature, but we did not have it in our room- in fact, some of the channels had moderate interference and weren't really watchable), small refrigerator, wall unit air conditioner, coffee pot with coffee and tea selections, desk with executive chair, alarm clock, hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, shower cap, and bath mitt. Overall, I wasn't really impressed with the room. It was worn around the edges, the hairs on the blanket freaked me out a little and I've seen much better rooms for the same price in Orlando. SERVICE: Checking in was a breeze and the person behind the counter was very courteous and friendly. I can't comment on maid service because we had the Do Not Disturb sign up all weekend. We didn't use many of the hotel's services so it's difficult to say how you will be treated. OVERALL: Location is good if you want to be close to Disney but not pay $300 a night at their resorts. Good for families with lots of activities and features. Might be worth it to pay full price for a Sleep Number room, as they are probably renovated.", "Date": "December 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "roanoke, virginia", "Title": "\u201cI was terrified by your review however was fooled\u201d", "Author": "dhelmintoller", "ReviewID": "UR11169654", "Content": "I was terrified after reading the reveiws written about this hotel however you shouldnt always beleive everything you hear as i was fooled.

We arrived late (9pm) to check-in. Upon checking in we were directed to pull around and park near the north tower to access our room. We were never offered any help with our baggage. Taking my own baggage to my room is never a problem but on this night there was a constant heavy rain and the walk from the parking lot to the north tower entrance was about 120 feet with no canopy. I pulled back around to the main entrance to unload my baggage. I requested help at the front desk but was told there was no bellperson available at the moment so we were on our own. When we got to our (first) room we started to get comfortable and realized our room was already occupied by ANTS!!!! My wife called the front desk to tell them about this problem and they offered to come and SPRAY the room. My nine year old son has asthma so this was not an option for us. After putting my wife on hold for about five minutes the front desk reluctantly offered us another room. They said they would send a \"Bellman\" up with the keys to our new room. Fifthteen minutes earlier there was no \"Bellman\" available. We waited in a ANT infested room for about ten minutes before the \"Bellman\" knocked on the door with our new room keys. We gathered our baggage and lugged it up to the 4th floor with no help from the \"Bellman\" that just gave us a new set of keys. We opened the door to the new room and it had a very strong mildew smell. Once I sat on the bed I then realized everything in this room was WET!!! Comforters, beds, carpet, everything DAMP!!!! It was if it had rained in the room!!! I went down to the front desk to have this problem corrected. With no apology, I was given the keys to another room with no offer to help move my baggage. As I was walking back to the (second) room to gather our things to move to \"another\" room, the front deck manager approached me and said \"the keys that he had just given me was to a room that was already occupied\". He asked me to please be patience and he would have the \"Bellman\" bring me up \"another\" set of keys. The \"Bellman\" rushed right up with our new set of keys but never offered to help move our baggage. Lucky for us the new (third) room was only four doors down the hall. The new (third) room had no ants and was not damp so we were OK until we showered and got in bed. Very worn and very uncomfortable beds!!!! We were so tired and beaten that we made the best it.

I was impressed by all of the hotel staff (although none of the front desk staff were willing to cut me a break on the absurd extra \"resort fee\" charge that they added to my priceline reservation.) The beds were always immaculately remade every day and everyone was friendly and helpful. Our first room was on the seventh floor- we quickly asked to move as the popcorn-type ceiling had water damage bubbling. Our next room on the sixth floor was fine, though almost everything in the room felt worn or water-damaged (with the exception of the sleep-number beds and nice bedding.) The AC worked fine, the beds were comfortable, and the TV had a nice selection of channels. The central pool was fun- they had tiki-torch lights at night and there was constantly nice island-style music playing throughout the day. The South Tower pool, however, looked to be in need of a good cleaning- we skipped it entirely. I have to say that the lack of bright outdoor lighting in the surrounding neighborhood and the \"open door\" feel of the side entrances to the hotel didn't exactly inspire me with a safe and secure feeling late in the evenings. We didn't test the shuttles buses, but I would recommend that anyone who doesn't plan on renting a car while at Disney stay on-Disney-property if only for the superior bus services. One nice thing we found was that there is a \"back entrance\" road to the Animal Kingdom theme park just one block over from the hotel. Getting back and forth to the parks for afternoon breaks was a snap, and provided a nice opportunity for our young ones to get a second wind during the day. All in all I wouldn't rush my friends or family to go and stay at the Radisson Resort Worldgate, but I wouldn't tell them to worry too much if they got stuck with a Priceline reservation for this hotel (I just hope they didn't pay much more than 50 bucks a night!)", "Date": "October 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "FL", "Title": "\u201cHorrible!

This was, by far, one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed at. Although you can tell that this hotel was once very nice, it hasn't been well-maintained, and it is undergoing a conversion to a timeshare property. For this reason, there is very little customer service offered. It takes 15 min. to get your car valet parked or to get a bellman to assist you with bags. Each time I had to call the front desk (for questions or to ask for extra towels), I had to call at least twice just to get someone to answer the phone. The rooms were equally bad. Fortunately, I was in an upgraded room attached to the hospitality room. The other rooms, from my observation when I visited my family members, had warped mattresses; worn carpet, musty smells, and the bathrooms had rusted fixtures, constantly-running toilets, and stained upholstery on the furniture. My own room was in better condition, but I did note that the curtains were dusty, there were some stains on the carpet, and some of the bathroom fixtures were beginning to rust. The tub in my room also had patches, from being previously repaired. There is not enough room for all guests to eat breakfast. For that reason, I felt a bit rushed by the wait. It was a common practice, as almost every room-purchasing adult in my family received one, for the hotel to give out food tickets and free night stays when there was a problem. and there was a plethora of problems. Many of my family members' rooms were not ready when they arrived. I saw many people sitting for hours waiting on their rooms to get ready. I arrived at the hotel at 3:00, and my room was not available until after 8:00. I received a free night and a food voucher. I could go on and on with the problems encountered here: an extensive power outage, long waits for the elevator, bland restaurant food, ripped sheets, etc., but I simply don't have enough time.

It's location off of SR-192 tucked in between rip-off dollar stores and gift shops was ultimately unappealing. Trying to get out of the resort and/or trying to turn into the resort is also an obstacle of its own. As I arrived at the \"resort\" I was instantly turned-off by it. I hadn't even gone inside yet. Our room was on the 3rd floor of the North Tower. (I would advise you to avoid the North Tower). The place was unbelievablely dirty. Everywhere I looked was dirt and utter filth. The rooms were so outdated. The carpets were dirty and stained, the furniture was worn and dilapidated looking. The beds were like sleeping on the ground. (I did pay for a hotel room, not a camp site). Didn't I? And the bathroom was dirty. There was mold on the shower and overall, it was just dirty. The outside of the resort, like the inside of the resort, was nothing to look at either. The pool looked dirty as did the people inside. I was not interested in going in. I did not try the hotel restaurant, but I did try the Pizza Hut, which was not as bad as I expected it to be. Another issue would be the lack of safety. The door on the outside stairs leading to the parking lot could easily be opened by just reaching at the top (where there was a large gap) and pulling it open. And the few lights in the parking lot was not too appealing either. One other safety issue would be the flyers constantly being thrown under the doors. Why do they continue to allow this? A hotel employee hasn't noticed a man or women with a large stack of flyers in their hands throwing them under each door? One would think that the hotel is in business with these scam-artists. With these \"unknown\" people walking through the hotel (at all hours of the night), I did not feel safe walking through the hotel alone. But this isn't even the point of my review. On the last day I decided to stay in the room. I was watching television and I happened to hear an odd noise in the room. I glanced over towards the closet and saw a lizard, yes a lizard, running in and out of the closet.

We travel every few weeks and have stayed at countless hotels, and I can say with total confidence that this was THE WORST stay that we have ever had. This will be lengthy, but you guys should definitely read through it. Our friends booked a standard King room and we got an executive suite. Day #1: After checking in, we went to settle in. My husband and I realized right away that we had been given a standard king room, NOT the suite we had booked. I called our friends' room to let them know that we'd be switching rooms, and was disgusted to hear that the front desk had messed up their room as well (They were given two TWIN beds.) We went down to the front desk to complain, and were told that our friends could just take our room, but that the only available suite was still being cleaned. We decided to wait in our friends' room, and the front desk people said they'd call us there when our suite was ready. Key thing here: WE WEREN'T APOLOGIZED TO - EVEN ONCE, BY ANY OF THE FRONT DESK STAFF. We waited for nearly an hour before calling down to inquire about our suite. We were transferred from person to person to person, because no one knew what I was talking about. Finally, I went down to inquire in person - and it's a long walk from the elevator to the front desk. I got there, and the women I had spoken to earlier were gone. Apparently, they'd left to eat, without telling anyone that we were waiting. Again, I got no apology, but we were told that our room was ready. Here's where it gets even WORSE. We were pretty satisfied with the suite... until we went to bed that night. The suite is RIGHT in front of the elevators. All night, we heard the elevator dinging and teens running through the halls, and around 6 AM, we heard people wheeling their luggage around, housekeepers vacuuming, etc. We got NO sleep. In the morning, we were told that the only other available room (not even a suite) was also right in front of the elevator. Our friends didn't sleep either, and their room was a little further from the elevators. Other complaints: We gave the housekeeper a big tip, yet he didn't do anything but make the bed. He left the trash right where it was... MORE DISGUSTING, THERE WERE HAIRS AND BUGS ON THE BEDS IN BOTH OUR ROOM, AND OUR FRIENDS' ROOM. The A/C is ridiculous. The elevators have no A/C, and are very worn down. They jump occasionally, and take forever. (It's faster to walk down, but the stairs are smelly). THe SUITE HAS NO TEMPERATURE CONTROL. You can't change the temperature. Don't eat breakfast in the hotel. The a la carte choices are almost the same price as the buffet, so we all opted for the buffet, but there was no food left. We waited 20 minutes for them to bring new food out, but there still wasn't much to eat. Bottom line: Stay somewhere else. People go to Orlando to experience youthful magic... don't ruin your trip. If you don't mind horrible conditions, there are plenty of motels for under $50.

We had to pay $5.00 per day to park our rental car. There is no parking lot security... there should be if your paying a fee to park. The elevators are scary and hot.

Linens looked new and nice, pillows were new and nice. AC worked great. Refridgerator worked, safe.. fine, coffee pot was a 2cup style... but they did also have Starbucks booth downstairs. The bathroom is very small.. big mirror and round garden tub. The tub/shower faucet needed caulking and it only turned 1/4 way. The water wasnt very hot but pressure was okay. It did have slight draining problem..It also needed a good scrubbing... the tub had a ring around it and the grout was begining to mold. The bathroom floor was tiled and needed moping. It has a hair dryer and a retractable string for hanging wet clothes. The maid service was great about setting our stuff up on the counter neatly. They also set up our childs stuffed animals on the bed nicely. They promptly changed our sheets and gave us fresh towels and such. I dont believed that they touched any of our things and when we saw them in the halls they were friendly. We left a thank you note and tip everyday and she responded back... which made it personal and nice. The carpets definetly need replacing in the room, had stains. Heres our biggest ISSUE..... There was a spider the size of a 50cent piece on the ceiling one night!!!! Scared the heck out of me. My husband took a picture and then he killed it. I keep waking up the next two nights looking for more. The windows are large and we had a view of the 192 highway. There were spider webs behind the curtains also. The toilet did run all the time but we shut the bathroom door and didnt hear it. It was overall quiet there. There was a WARNING on the TV about the pizza scammers in the area. Everyday we got flyers under our door about pizza deliveries from different companies. But we ignored them. The carpet in the hallway was new. Pizza Hut Express was downstairs, game room.. okay. They have a gift/store well stocked, but I did catch the clerk cat napping in her chair at 11pm one night. They have a main pool area with hot tub and music... seemed okay. Pool Was open pass the posted 10pm closing time. We used the other pool in the back of hotel. Water was too warm and it needed a good scrubbing and some of the concrete copeing was broken. But it got us wet and our child liked it. Pool towels provided. Lots of chairs... but they needed a good scrubbing to. It is super easy to get to Disney parks from here... we had a rental car.

Our room had very dated furniture, a very small bathroom, old beds, flat pillows, and lesser quality linens.

We booked this hotel through Priceline. Be careful about Priceline. The idea behind Priceline is that you need to trust that a a class of a hotel you are bidding on is truly one that you will receive and it can be misleading to say the least. In this case, we bid on a 3-star hotel (it wasn't a very low bid) and we ended up with the Radisson Worldgate as an alleged 3-star hotel. No Way! We were extremely disappointed. I would never consider this a 3-star hotel. The hotel was old and run down, dark and gloomy and very depressing. The staff that we encountered was rude, not a smile among them. One of the two pools was filled with dirt and leaves from the trees and was out of commission. The other was passable but the lounge chairs were filthy. The room we were in was smelly and dark and the beds were hard as a rock. The carpeting was stained and there were waterspots on the walls. We immediately tried an \"upgrade\" at an extra cost ($10.00 per night) to the Sleep Number beds and the beds still were uncomfortable and the mechanics of the bed didn't work correctly and made a high-pitched noise whenever we tried to adjust them. Even with the \"upgrade\" the beds weren't near the quality of, say, a Hampton Inn or Embassy Suites or Marriot. Both of my kids woke up the next day with what appeared to be a rash on their legs. I don't want to even consider what that was! Needless to say, after one night, we left the hotel and found a wonderful place (see my review on Magical Vacation Villas) right down the street. This move saved our week-long vacation. The Radisson was pre-paid through Priceline and we had to assume the loss, but we had no other option. After we moved to the new hotel, we discovered that we left some clothing behind in the closet. We called immediately and asked the staff to check the room and they insisted our stuff wasn't there. It wasn't until we spoke with many staff members and told them we would come down ourselves to search for our things, did our stuff magically appear! It had been in that closet all along, they were just too lazy to check the room. I don't understand how others gave this hotel even a mediocre rating. It really isn't worth the savings in Orlando.

The main complaints we had were that the bathroom was too small and the shower wouldn't drain properly. We realized we couldn't sleep well on a double bed, so we very politely asked to be moved at about 11:00 the next morning to a king if possible. We went to one of the many breakfast buffets around on US 192, then came back to a much nicer, larger room in the North tower with a huge, glorious Sleep Number bed. The bathroom was huge and the shower was a lot larger (and drained properly). So, you just have to luck out sometimes. That seems to be the case with this hotel. We found the activities desk to be very helpful in helping us decide what to do and buy tickets to attractions. We had to go to a timeshare presentation, but since we already owned timeshare they were pretty easy on us. Just stick to your guns and you'll be fine.

There were a number of problems encountered by myself and my group. First, the Hotel refused to honor the room selection we made at the time that the guaranteed reservations were made. BE ADVISED, THE HOTELS POSITION IS THAT THEY ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO HONOR THE RESERVATION. This includes the choice of a smoking or non-smokin rum, the type of bed and whether your room has a sleep number bed. The hotel staff was completely unsympathetic toward this issue. Second, the view from our room was a wall about eight feet away (the convention center). Be aware that a number of firsy floor rooms have NO VIEW. Third, there were maintenence issues, including a refrigerator that froze everthing in the refrigerator, causing one canned beverage to explode. Fourth, the hotel shuttle failed to pick us up at EPCOT for the 9:50 pickup. When I called at 10:05 I was told the shuttle was on its way. When I called at 10:20, the hotel staff changed the story and said the shuttle had been there at 9:50, but no one was there to ride. I told them that was not true, we were there, along with another couple. Finally, after arguing with the staff for 5 minutes, thehotel agreed to send another shuttle. We were not picked up until 10:40. In general, the hotel has much deferred maintenence. In our room, wallpaper was peeling away. Also one cabinet had water damge. The water temperature in the shower would get very hot and then very cold, then hot, then cold, etc. The staffs attitude was worse than any hotel I have ever stayed in, including budget motels.

The lobby area is in great repair, a great contrast to the quite worn room we were assigned. All the furnishings were in need of replacement, the matresses were too soft and lumpy, and the pillows uncomfortable. The carpet was spotty and torn, and the bed spreads showed tears and wear. The bathroom showed numerous areas that needed caulking/tile repair, and the A/C unit was loud and inefficient. We did not use the food service or recreational facilities as this was a \"buffer night\" stay prior to staying at a Disney resort. To put things in perspective, I am not one of those who dons the \"white gloves\" and expects a cleanliness/repair level better than my own home. However, much of this 3-star property is in desperate need of refurbishment, and a chat with the morning desk manager indicates that all they plan to do is replace matresses and carpet.

At that time, it was arranged for the first time in my 8-year history of Priceline to have a stay refunded. I was told at the time that TripAdvisor reviews (quite a few of which I have written myself over the years) were not accurate and that \"many of your competitors make fake posts.\" It turns out that my fears were well-founded. First, I did online check-in through Radisson when I started out. At that point, I requested a King Room. Next, I had a friend express a desire to join me, so I called the hotel's reservations department to say that I was needing to change to a double/double configuration. This was at 8am on Tuesday. Upon getting a recording that the office was closed and did not open until 8am, I called back at 8:05, 8:10, 8:15, and finally got someone at 8:20. She was rude. She very curtly told me that since I had a Priceline reservation, my request would have been ignored anyway. Let me interject here that at true 3- and 4-star hotels, I am used to having simple requests honored and being treated like any other guest even when booking through Priceline. When we arrived at the hotel on Saturday night, there was no one manning the Radisson Express Yourself desk at the front desk anyway. And, there were no keys waiting for us. We had to do normal check-in. Your desk clerk was very quick to foist the check-in slip under my nose and tell me to initial where it said I owed nothing, then have me sign the bottom. He quite deliberately avoided drawing any attention to the small print. More on that later. When we got to our room, room 559, I was almost sick. The beds were like rocks, the linens were the same ones that they had been when I wrote an actual positive review of the then Doubletree Kissimmee Worldgate Resort for Rita Aero's Walt Disney World guidebook SEVEN years ago, the bottom of the cabinet holding up the refrigerator was quite literally almost rotted away, the bathroom had peeling fixtures, and the carpet was a mess. The next morning, I went to the desk and asked to be moved. To be fair, this was the one positive experience. I was moved to one of your Sleep Number bed rooms (which should now be in ALL of your rooms...comptetor hotels such as Sheraton and Hampton Inns now have all of their beds changed over to ones that don't leave the guest in pain). The rest of the room, however, is in the same state of disrepair as the rest of the other room. The carpet is shameful, the furniture is the same as it was when I wrote the above-mentioned review, and the bathroom is a mess. I noticed this morning that the dust in the bathroom duct, by the way, was at least a half an inch thick. Yuck. When I checked out this morning, the desk clerk cheerfully told me that I owed nothing BUT THE RESORT FEE. HUH!?!?!?!?! The small print that had been so carefully glossed over when I checked in was very rudely waved in my face. I was firm and kept repeating, \"No.\" She removed it, and then proceeded to give me a lecture about Orlando hotels and resort fees. Sir, I have stayed in every single 3- and 4-star property in the Orlando area, many multiples of times. This is the first time that anybody actually tried to sneak the resort fee past me...and these are tantamount to highway robbery, anyway. I will of course not be bidding 3-star for the area again, and I will definitely urge others to avoid doing so. My favorite property, which is in a much better location and actually belongs in the 3-star class, the Sheraton Safari, is one I'm quite willing to pay the actual price for. Yours stinks. Literally.

I was not happy when I received this hotel as it is in Kissimmee, off of 192. 192 is not my favorite area; it is overcrowded with people, restaurants and hotels, etc. At least this hotel is far enough off the main road that you are not disturbed by traffic. We received a Priceline room, Room 310, (also known as a non-renovated, run down room without sleep number beds in the North Tower). Our bathroom faucet leaked the entire week and our tub was worn and chipped. The housekeeping staff was good, they kept the room as clean as possible, but had little to work with. We used the pool on our second evening, and it was filled with bugs and twigs and flowers. The next morning the pool was better as it had been cleaned, however, we noticed that there were hair clips, garbage and even someone's hair extension left laying around the pool area. I informed the front desk about the debris but no one ever came to clean up the area and the hair extension was STILL THERE the next day. Gross! I guess this is a decent hotel for those on a budget, but overall it is nothing special. We did not use the hotel shuttle as we rented a car. The hotel is convenient to Animal Kingdom and the rest of the Disney property (you can catch Sherbeth Road through the Radisson parking lot), but it's a long drive to Universal and Sea World as you are essentially at the end of 192 (West). .

This is the second time that I\u2019ve booked this hotel blind on Hotwire.com, and each time I have been more than pleased with the property. Let\u2019s get the weak points right out of the way. Like many hotels in the area, the Radisson Worldgate Resort has thin walls, so one can hear kids crying, or an exceptionally large person thumping on the ceiling above you. It\u2019s not worse than most Disney-area hotels (and many Disney World property hotels), but really guys, a little investment in thick insulation would go a long way towards customer satisfaction. Like most off-property Disney-area hotels, the Radisson offers free bus transport to the Disney parks, but most guest I knew weren\u2019t happy with the erratic nature of the buses. Cab it or drive it yourself is the mantra. And while most of the property is top notch, there are a few \u2018loose ends\u2019 that mar the experience: a worn tub floor, a rusty, scary looking stair access door, some loose fitting hall light fixtures; again, a little time and investment would work wonders and eliminate these minor critiques. Here\u2019s the good-to-great stuff. The rooms are exceptionally large for \u2018standard\u2019 rooms, with very comfortable beds and clean bedding. The design is quite clever, with the A/C unit being contained in a shelving/entertainment center/fridge/safe unit along one wall. This frees up a great deal of space (and yes, every standard room has a TV, mini-fridge, safe, desk and tons of storage. By far some of the largest, best space-planned standard rooms in all of Orlando. The facilities are also very complete. There are two pools (non-themed, unless \u2018pool in Florida\u2019 counts as a theme) and spas, a fitness center, a full-service restaurant, a quick-service food court, convention center, business center, and gift shop. If you just want to spend a day at the hotel, eating and drinking the hours away, this is an ideal and affordable locale to set up shop. They even had a live (if horrible) cover band out by the main pool during the evening. In addition, the management has done a great job renovating and maintaining the hotel. The carpets are new and plush, the lobby is airy and beautiful, and the walls are clearly freshly painted (or scrubbed clean, in any case.) As I said, some \u2018loose ends\u2019 spoil the overall effect, but in general, this is a very clean, very well-kept property (especially considering the other places off 192.) Ah, the great location. This Radisson has a great plot of land. The access street to the hotel is right off 192, so you\u2019re within walking distance of a wide variety of tacky tourist traps and substandard buffets\u2026but you\u2019re not right off of 192\u2026the Radisson is behind a small strip mall and its own parking lot. The grounds are covered with manicured trees and bushes, so it feels much more removed than it really is\u2026and you don\u2019t have to deal with the noise from the zillions of cars on 192. Also, it\u2019s right at the entrance to Disney World, so the parks are a short cab/bus/car ride away. But it\u2019s the staff that makes this hotel stellar. Every request we had, every question, every little thing we were looking for (such as the location of a \u2018MAC Cosmetics\u2019) was handled quickly and happily by the staff at the Radisson Worldgate Resort. Kudos to them for their stellar service and work ethic. The property itself is quite nice, kind of like an un-themed Moderate Disney World Resort (for about \u00bd the cost), but the staff here makes all the difference. There is another Radisson on the other side of the 192/I-4 interchange (Radisson Resort Parkway or Orlando-Celebration, depending on what they are calling themselves this week) that is arguably the nicer property, with more stylish rooms featuring duvet bedding and a massive, tropical pool with waterfalls facility, but the staff there is not anywhere near as attentive and friendly as the casual professionals at the Radisson Resort Worldgate. Rack room rates list for around $100-$120 a night during May, but you can get them for around $80 (and if you book it blind on Hotwire, around $65!) At $120, it\u2019s not too bad. At $100, it\u2019s a nice place to stay. When it drops below that, by all means, book a room here. You won\u2019t be sorry.

Any questions were answered by the knowledgable staff. The room was average but clean. The windows were foggy and we had a view of the parking lot. The location of this hotel is about 10 to 15 minutes drive from all theme parks. Shuttle service is provided on a schedule. If you remain longer at the parks (Shuttle service picks you up around 7pm) just take a cab back to the hotel. For those who do not rent a car, the average cab ride back from the theme parks was around $12 to $15 dollars. There is always a cab available and they are convenient for your own personal schdule. Avis Car Rentals is located right in the lobby of this hotel. There is a tourist booth right in the hotel lobby as well. They sell theme all kinds park tickets to you right there so you don't have to wait in the long entrance lines at the park. A huge convenience and time saver. The evenning entertainment by the pool was a nice touch. The pool was open to the air and the hours were 6 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. So the kids and ourselves were able to take in a swim and stare at the stars before bed.

Mostly the cleanliness and the friendly staff made our stay a nice one. One inconvenience was the lack of an ATM machine.

Business travellers? Look elsewhere. Express check-in? Didn't happen for me. Wireless Internet? Only in hotspots. Outlets to plug in chargers for laptops, cell phones and Blackberries? Only one in open view. Business center for copies, faxing, and printing? Not really. Secured entrances? No. I was booked here at the last minute by my travel agent to attend a conference held on the Disney properties. The most appealing part of the property was free wireless internet. I arrived early at the property at noon, hoping to check in, but was told I had to wait until their normal check-in time of 4 p.m. The front desk then offered to pre-register me, which meant all I had to do was show up later at the Express counter and they would assign me a room. Realizing the lines may be long at 4 p.m., I did so. When I returned to check in, they couldn't find my pre-registration information (the girl who had taken it had already gone). It was frustrating, because I had already gone through the process once and I was very concerned that my credit card would be charged twice. Once that was over, I was given a room on the first floor of the North Tower. Since I was lugging things back and forth for the conference, the first floor didn't bother me. The view, however, was the back of a building. What concerned me was that the access door to the North Tower from the parking lot didn't close all the way. So much for needing your key card to gain access to the Tower. The room was a decent size, with a couch, desk and a floor cabinet that kept the fridge and microwave from plain sight. However, every time I opened the cabinet for the fridge, there was a musty smell and I had to lift the fridge door to get it to clear the bottom of the cabinet. The fridge never got completely cold even when set on Hi. The A/C unit was in full view, and it was loud when used. The entire room had an odd smell to it and sometimes I could smell stale cigarettes although it was supposed to be nonsmoking. There was only one additional outlet at the desk; a plug at the base of the lap. I had to search for the other outlets and I had to move the couch to get to it. I was stuck with rotating my equipment for charging. The Wireless Internet, which I had been looking forward to, was a joke. I didn't get a signal in my room. I had to go to the business center or the lobby areas to get one. When I asked to be moved to another room for the WiFi, I was told they were completely sold out and couldn't change my rooms. Which was odd, since it was only 7 p.m. on a Wednesday. Another guest later revealed that she didn't have WiFi on the fourth floor, close to the elevator. So I was stuck in a room without WiFi and I had to go to the bar, business center, or lobby to get a signal. It wouldn't have been an issue if they offered a LAN connection. I don't have a modem in my laptop. As far as the business center, it consisted of three PCs (one with screen burn so bad that the screen itself was always green) and a fax/scan/copy machine. It looked like the converted registration area from their convention area. Again, you were supposed to swipe your keycard to gain access, but the door was never locked. While there was no charge for printing, copies, scans, or using the workstations, there were none of the usual business center amenitites such as pads of paper, fax cover sheets, office supplies and pens. And when I tried to fax three things long-distance, none when through. Without any signage stating rules of use -- except that you were limited to 15 minutes on the PC -- it was frustrating. The Hummingbirds bar was a little run down but the bartender very nice. I had lunch there twice and the food was decent and at the normal, bloated hotel prices. The pool area was clean. As I said, there was great access to the Disney properties -- just one exit down and about 10 minutes with traffic from Downtown Disney. There were gift shops, grocery stores, and restaurants around the property, which would be perfect for vacationers looking to save some cash by not staying at Disney properties.

The hotel is easy to find if you know what to look for. From pretty much anywhere (except if your coming in from the Gulf Coast) you need to head West on the 192 and you will find the hotel located on the right between Markers 5 and 6. The neon sign on the main road says 'RADISSON CONFERENCE SUITES' and not Radisson Worlgate. We arrived late on a Saturday, the lobby was pleasant and check-in was swift. We were given a map to our room and sent on our way. We were in room 739 on the seventh floor. As we were only paying \u00a316 each per night for the room we were not expecting much. But we were pleasantly surprised by the nice airy room with big TV, mirrored wardrobe, two firmness adjustable beds, air-con and plenty of drawer space. The bathroom was a nice size, clean and with a big corner bath/shower. As we were unpacking we noticed a couple of things that needed fixing and quick! There were some strange looking little bugs (possibly termites) crawling about in the top drawer on the right under the window. I kept most of my non-creasing clothes in my case after that! The safe was also locked when we arrived so we were unable to set it afresh. We reported both of these issues to reception the next day but they were not fixed during our 10-day stay! But there were a lot of good points about the hotel. The pool stays open until 1am so we were able to go for a midnight swim and hot-tub which was really nice. The maid always left our room really nice and even placed all of our toiletries on little towels. There is an alarm clock, fridge, ironing board and iron in the room which was really helpful. We wanted to eat breakfast at the hotel but they were only serving the breakfast buffet (which was $10) and we didn't fancy that. So we bought some cereal, milk, plastic bowls and spoons from the supermarket down the road, which was healthier, quicker and cheaper. If you fancy it though, there are plently of diners and fast food places within a couple of minutes either way. The hotel is really close to Disney and only 5 mins from MGM, 15 from Magic Kingdom. But it is a bit of a way from Universal so we din't bother with City Walk as taxis were quite expensive. Taxis to Plaesure Island were about $20 - $25. There isn't any security at the back doors and anyone could walk into the boiding but all rooms have a door chain and peep hole so you'll be ok!! Some useful tips: Girls - my GHD's wouldn't work properly over here (they use half the voltage we do so they weren't as hot) and the hairdryer provided isn't very good so be prepared, I just went with the frizz! No-one cares what you look like over there so it was pretty liberating! Check out the Dsney boardwalk near Epcot and Downtown Disney. It's beautiful and has a cool bar where all the Disney workers go, it's called Jellyrolls. There's loads of coathangers so I wouldn't bother taking any! Anyway all, enjoy your stay here, it is great value and despite not being perfect, it is better and cheaper, than your average Premier Travel Inn in England and and it has a pool!!!!

The rooms are spacious and clean and have a small bar fridge which is convenient. The location is also terrific. However, there is room for improvement. The room felt older and slightly worn. The carpet had some small stains, the walls needed a coat of paint, the bathtub was worn with enamel peeling off it in places, and the bathroom itself sometimes had an odd odour.

During this stay, we were delighted to find the room featured an impressive upgrate ~~ the new \"Sleep Number\" bed.

Okay, yes, one of the three elevators makes a noise when you reach the very top floors (or maybe when it stops, I don't know) but I promise it is nothing anyone could not handle. Other than that, (which did not bother me), the hotel was beautifully decorated, with a neverending lobby and all the amenities you could ever ask for. They have in-room movies that are still in the theater for less money than two people would pay at a real theater. I visited two of the pools and they were both awesome, the big one has a bar. The location was great, it was very close to disney, which made afternoon breaks a breeze. We never used the shuttle service, we drove our car to the theme parks and parked everyday for about eight or nine bucks. It was worth it to be able to come and go as you please! Anyway, the rooms were my favorite part. They were big and the AC made the whole room comfortable in about five minutes (which is heaven after a day in the parks in July). I read in other reviews that the furniture seemed outdated and dingy, ours seemed above any hotel average I've ever seen (and we travel a lot). Upon checkin, I randomly decided to see if I could get a king size bedroom, and it was no problem at all. My room had a huge bed with a sleep number mattress, a fluffy white comforter, all the amenities people mentioned below, and a small linen love seat that turns into a bed. The artwork was actually decent (not just a picture of plastic flowers) and I found the rooms to be tasteful and very clean. We stayed for a week, did not request room service but once, and never saw a bug. The bathtub is huge, and it fills up nice and deep, and after a long day of walking in the elements, you will be very grateful. The staff was very friendly, there is definately a reason this place was picked as a 'disney good neighbor' hotel. We only ate once at the breakfast bar, and it was good, but there are too many golden corralls and ponderosa's that are practically across the street to justify eating there everyday. I never smelled any gross smells anywhere, or saw anything dirty (they clean the place pretty much around the clock).

Since we were really only going to be in Orlando for the weekend, we didn\u2019t really need the super-ultra-deluxe resort experience. But we DID want a clean room, decent food, and some quiet. In the late 1970\u2019s/early 1980\u2019s, the Radisson must have been quite the great hotel/resort. All of the facilities are there: big pool with spa, dining options, a great lobby, and large, well-planned and appointed rooms. But the Radisson doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s seen an update to its overall look, d\u00e9cor or technology (like elevators and the like) since the mid-1980\u2019s. It\u2019s a good hotel, and a clean hotel, with LOTS of wear and tear around the edges (and plastic flowers on a trellis out in front by the porte cochere\u2026what is up with THAT?) Our only major problem with the Radisson was the air conditioning in our room. It just never got cold enough for us, and it was too late in the day (and we were too drunk from Epcot) to request a new room or a room upgrade. Other than that, the room was spacious, had a mini-fridge included at no extra cost, and our room overlooked the fireworks over the Magic Kingdom at Disney World, so we got two shows for the price of one that evening\u2026from the comfort of the seventh floor! The bathroom is especially nice, with an oblong, oval-shaped tub/shower combo (that never had the \"how do I adjust the temperature issue\" that ALWAYS is a problem with hotels.) What takes away from all of this praise is the wear and tear. The bathroom was nice, but had some scuff marks on the walls. The view from the room was nice, but the furniture looked well-worn and a little beaten up. The lobby was very nice, but also dated and worn. It\u2019s sad that a little bit of money could make this Radisson a real, bona-fide upscale value property\u2026it\u2019s right up the road from Disney, it\u2019s very secluded off the main drag so it\u2019s quiet\u2026and the hotel itself is very roomy and light.

Seriously\u2026the floks at 4-star Disney resorts could learn a thing or two about personalized service, attention and overall hospitality from the staff here. Very knowledgable, very prompt, and just a great group of people. A great group of people who deserve a hotel better than this one. So, management\u2026what do you say?

Well lit, very clean though starting to show a bit of age. Good A/C & TV, nice beds. Free wireless internet worked flawlessly. 2 large pools, tiny hot tub. Front desk was efficient & friendly, didn't eat there, too many lower priced places nearby. Short drive to any Disney site. Not sure I'd pay full rack rate but with a discount I'd surely go back.", "Date": "February 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value!

The hotel is nice and clean, although a bit dated. Pro: Wireless Internet connection, couldn't live without it. Clean room, lots of towels. Frendly staff. Quiet location-we were on the top floor and had an excellent view. Close to Disney, lots of shops nearby. Con: Passed its prime, needed paint job in the elevator, room. Entry door to the south tower wasn't secured. For the price of $49 we paid through eleisurelink, we would definitely come back!", "Date": "February 2, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Worldgate Resort", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34352-d84723-Reviews-Worldgate_Resort-Kissimmee_Florida.html", "Price": "$68 - $141*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3011 Maingate Lane</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Kissimmee</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34747</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "84723", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/41/20/21/restaurant.jpg"}}

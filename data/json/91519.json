I am used to hotels that cater to business travel to typically provide a complimentary light breakfast, coffee, and a paper. I paid over six dollars for toast and coffee. Perhaps this is typical of very big cities, as I usually am in somewhat smaller cities. But the price is the same as a smaller city so I expected the same. The lobby computer was painfully slow and I gave up. The hotel and rooms are clean and comfortable. The staff is capaple and friendly. They need to put TV channel line up cards in the rooms.

Just minutes from Indianapolis. Carmel, IN is a VERY safe city near many parks, restaurants, and very nice mall (Keystone Crossing.) This Marriott is in a business district. The hotel: very quiet, clean, comfortable, elegant, and kid friendly. Indoor pool / hot tub are fabulous and clean. Pool is heated. The hotel was VERY quiet, and Final 4 weekend was a great test of that. Definitely kid friendly. Completely non-smoking, no pets allowed, which are my first pre-requisites for ANY hotel when traveling with kids. Free internet and has a business center. Also has a rental car company inside!! Wow! Room: stayed in a 1 bedroom King suite, with a door separating the bedroom from the living area. Parents traveling with kids: this room is awesome for kids!!! The kids sleep in their own bedroom and you can talk/watch TV or whatever, without disrupting their sleep, keeping the peace for everyone, including neighbors. I do not know about other parents traveling with kids, but I dislike tiptoeing around worried about waking my kids up. In this room, you just close the door to their room and they feel like they are at home! The living room came with a comfortable pull-out sofa bed. The room had a refrigerator, microwave, new granite counters, and new cherry furniture. There was a nice desk with pull-out table for dining, and a beautiful leather office chair. There were 2 additional cushioned chairs and a full size sofa sleeper. Two televisions were safely anchored to the dressers/cabinets. The bedroom had an updated radio with iPod dock and a lounging couch. Carpet in the entire room was new and clean. There was a nice balcony with sliding glass door to fresh air. The bedroom and living room each had their own thermostat control. Your kids can have the room temperature they way they want it, and people in the living area can have their own temperature preference. Housekeeping: very thorough and detailed. They cater to your every whim. Bathroom: small, basic, with a full bath/shower, VERY clean, nice tile. The vanity area was VERY clean, carpeted, and was beautiful granite. The staff: very friendly, knowledgeable, and courteous. Parking was ample. The manager and other staff are easy to deal with, should you have special requests, and will do everything they can to appease you.", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cNot bad for a Marriott\u201d", "Author": "toomanymiles", "ReviewID": "UR59869346", "Content": "Free WiFi.

Bed was just OK but not especially luxurious. Bathroom is adequate, though the sink is in a separate area. Location is convenient off the interstate. Average sized TV with a decent selection of channels and a decent, if not great, fitness area. WiFi is good, though there is also wired connections supposedly available (which I couldn't get to work.

I would highly recommend staying here. The rooms are huge and clean. Theres room service with great desserts. We left early during the friday practice sessions because we forgot to buy earplugs with the car's revving at 19,000rpm it wasnt very healthy to stick around, the front desk guys gave us a complimentary pair for no charge, how thoughtful! Also theres a restaurant next door which is a plus because there none around in the area. To get to Indinapolis Motor Speedway, is about $30 each way, on race day this goes up to $40 plus which is normal. Be sure to get a cabs number, youll need it handy coming back from the track to the hotel. Its very hard to get a cab after the race, be sure to have a map handy if you decide to walk. Its also a short 5 min walk from the shopping area downtown so enjoy!

I would recommend that you try two of the other hotels prior to booking at this Marriott. I recommend the Doubletree Inn in Carmel, which is within one mile of this Marriott. The other is the Hilton Garden Inn, and is slightly better than this Marriott. POSITIVES: - The front-desk staff was courteous and fulfilled the few minor requests I had. - Clean room on arrival. - The air conditioner, bathroom and lighting fixtures, wireless access, and TV worked well - The black-out curtains worked very well at blocking the light - I was in an end room that was very quiet - Outlets were conveniently located for battery chargers NEGATIVES: - I left water in the plastic bag ice bucket liner when I left in the morning. When I returned later that evening, the ice bucket had been placed back in its spot, but the plastic bag had not been replaced, and still contained the water from the previous night. - The drinking containers provided are glass. I don't trust the cleanliness of glasses in hotels. - The TV was placed right next to the armoire in such a manner that the entire screen cannot be seen while laying in the bed. If you move to the far edge of the bed, you can see most of the screen, but are still unable to see about two inches of the edge of the screen. The TV cannot be moved. The full screen can be seen from the couch. - As you walk down the long hallways, you have no visual cues to let you know you are walking in the correct direction to get to the front desk. You just have to set off in the direction you think is correct, and if you are right you will come to a connecting hallway. The hotel would benefit from a few extra visual cues that are more visible from down the hall. - There are no refrigerators provided in the rooms. I *think* you can rent one at the front desk based on a little sign in the refrigerated section of the hotel's convenience store (where they sell snacks, ice cream, toiletries, etc) This option was not mentioned when I checked in, and like I said, it may not even be an option. - Two of the other area hotels - the Hilton Garden Inn and Doubletree Inn have alarm clocks that have an aux input that allows you to hook up your iPod or MP3 player to allow for music through the clock's speakers, and wake up to your own tunes. No such perq here at the Marriott. - The pillows were all feather and all pretty thin on my king-size bed", "Date": "August 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Wayne, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cNice place, nothing fancy\u201d", "Author": "kcrampton", "ReviewID": "UR16349958", "Content": "I stayed for 1 night on a business trip.

The television could do with a better variety of channels, but may that always be the worst thing anyone can say about their trip. It was also quiet. We never heard the people in the room next door. The people at the front desk were friendly, informative and helpful. The breakfast buffet was good with a good variety of food (eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, cereal, muffins, oatmeal, etc.).

They did clear it up and we were supposed to have received breakfast vouchers when we checked in. The staff was very helpful in getting this taken care of. The other issue was the parking, we came in late and the parking lot was full, we were told to park in the Thompson's parking lot, but felt uneasy about doing that.

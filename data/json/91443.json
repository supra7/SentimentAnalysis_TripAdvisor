This place is absolutely disgusting! Not sure how they remain in business. Website advises wifi and shuttle service. No wifi signal in my room. Shuttle service is a scam. They are not allowed to go where they rest of the hotel shuttles go (IND Airport banned them I heard) the front desk advises to go to pax pickup / taxi area and they will pick you up there. After waiting for the shuttle, I was advised by the hotel it wasn't available currently and I'd have to take a cab (at my own expense by the way) no wifi, no shuttle, annoying... BUT ...

Surprisingly the room was \"inhabitable.\" Though my problem with this property was the horrible customer service.

I called the property to inform them of my situation and was informed that if I did not retrieve my belongings from the room before check out time I would be charged a fee for \"late check out.\" I never even took a shower in this room nor pulled the blankets back; with this type of customer service it is no wonder people prefer to sleep in their cars as opposed to dealing with management/customer service such as this.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cPoop does happen\u201d", "Author": "robin a", "ReviewID": "UR118735938", "Content": "While my family were staying there the toilet stopped up. try as we may to plunge it, nothing worked. this went on for a week. they would send someone to plunge it. finially they moved us to a different room. plus the prostitutes from the truck stop knock on your door at all times of the night.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mogadore, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cWas expecting a dump was it was a suprise\u201d", "Author": "DBMaxwell", "ReviewID": "UR118342011", "Content": "Need a room in the immediate area and this was the only place I could get.

They are from months back. The office was filthy and had a bad odor which should have been a clue to run but i needed a place to stay close to the company. I went to the room which was supposed to be non smoking but smelled of stale cigarettes. The tub was cracked as was the tile in the bathroom. I then pulled the comforter down and found stained pillow cases and sheets which look like they had blood on them. I also found 3 small bugs on the sheets. The air/ heat unit was loaded with dirt and what looked like dog hair that when it turned on just added to the stench. Behind the sofa looked like it had no been cleaned in a year. There was what appeared to be a hooker in the parking lot asking if i was staying long. I was in the room about 5 minutes and RAN out.They have a sign that says no refunds which is their way of keeping your money after they give you a nightmare room.

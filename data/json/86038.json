This by far was our most favorite place. Are kids are 17, 10,and 8 , (grandma too) and they all enjoyed the amenities at this resort. Check in was quick, our room was in the 206 building which was a 2bd rm condo. Although it was not one of the updated rooms in the pictures on the website we found it to be clean, comfortable (beds were great) and best of all quiet. It was located near the main pool which the kids prefered but just a short walk to the waterpark. We enjoyed the surrey bikes, paddle boats, and golfing which were all included in our room price. The resort grounds were well kept and very clean. All three pools were crystal clear and heated. Hot tub was great way to relax in evening. We went to the waterpark in the afternoon and had no trouble finding chairs. They do not allow chair hoarding which is great. I have been many places where people put their towels out then leave for the day just so they have a chair when they return. The food at the poolside cafe hot, tastey and plentyful. We found the staff to be very engaging and helpful. As we have done Disney many times we wanted to try some other activites around the area. Diane was very helpful in recommending great alternatives to the parks that we enjoyed very much. We were asked several times about the timeshare and to be honest we may have listened to the presentation if it was offered in the evening during our down time not during the morning/afternoons. I expect to be asked when we stay at a timeshare resorts but they were not pushy at all like other places. The location of Liki Tiki was great. It was minutes to dining, shopping, and the parks yet set off of the main road. Security gate at the entrance was always manned and checked every car that went in. After reading some other responses I would like to say that our condo was in perfect working order, very clean, and bug free. Enjoyed having coffee and breakfast in the morning on the screened in porch! We prefer to stay in a condo resort to have a full kitchen which is a great $ saver. I thought it was a bonus to have a washer and dryer to throw our towels in and we washed all our clothes before coming home which is a treat. It was stocked with everything you need and a family of 6 for 5 nights we did not run out of anything. If you are looking for a 5 star hotel with daily maid service this is not it. If you want a clean, friendly place for your family and don't mind picking up after yourself then this is the place to be. We will denfinately be staying here again on our next trip!!!", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cAwesome place for families\u201d", "Author": "DanCLE", "ReviewID": "UR128277748", "Content": "We stayed here for 4 nights and I can't think of anything bad to say.

The wireless internet signal was great in our room, and there is a huge grocery store 2 minutes away to stock your fridge. By far and away the best thing about this place was the waterpark! Not only was it great, but there were lifeguards stationed all around it which was nice to see. One thing I would say is that the waterpark is probably best suited for kids ages 10 & under. I didn't see much that would keep older kids occupied for very long. For the younger kids though, there's definitely enough at the waterpark to keep them occupied for an entire day. We did not get to use the paddleboats because the lake was flooded from a huge rainstorm while we were there. No big deal though, this place has plenty of other things to do.

Liki Tiki Village was way more reasonably priced ($109 plus resort fee for a 2 BR condo) than the other \"super-pool\" properties I researched (like Hilton Bonnet Creek or Disney Beach Club) and offered full bedrooms, a kitchen and w/d amenities, not just a hotel room. I was pleasantly surprised by the nicely finished interior and furnished screen porch. We had such a hard time prying the kids out of the main pool that we missed our dinner reservations, the 5 year old went nuts on the 5 waterslides. There is a separate gated baby pool but the 3 year old insisted on playing in the \"big kid pool.\" They have surrey bikes, shuffleboard, pedal boats, basketball, tennis, a sandy playground, hot tubs and a fitness center. Nice aquarium in the lobby. The only downside is that Shipwreck Sally's is just a lunch and early dinner poolside bar and cafe so you have to go off site for breakfast or bring supplies. There is a Publix grocery 1/4 mile west and a ton of restaurants along Route 192. The resort is about 8 miles from Disney. If they offer a time share presentation while you are picking up maps, tickets etc at the service desk, just politely decline. I did not feel pressured at all.

Upon arrival we checked into a lovely two bedroom villa (all the three bedroom villas were already booked) with a sizable living/dining area and a full kitchen. The decor was updated and the room was very clean. You can't beat the amenities available on property. The water park was small, but the kids (ranging from 6-12) had a blast. We went paddle boating once and didn't get a chance to play mini-golf or ride on of the available surrey bicycles. The staff was courteous and helpful.

I did ALOT of research prior to staying at this resort and my family and I consisting of a 17 year old daughter a 12 year old daughter myself and my husband really enjoyed ourselves at this resort. It was clean, people were so friendly, had no problem enjoying the pools always found loungers, enjoyed the food and overall the experience was GREAT. There was no pressure to sit in on the 90 minute meeting, but if you were interested in purchasing a time share in Orlando sit in on the meeting and take advantage of their cheaper rates for the attractions. The Super Wlamat is only 5-7 minute drive which was so handy when purchasing groceries. It is also a GREAT place to buy the Disney souviners. Kissimmee was GREAT, this was our first time in Orlando and will go back many more times. We have vacationed in California, Las Vegas, Utah, Mexico and Cuba but Orlando and the Liki Tiki will be our love for the next few years. We also enjoyed the fact they had the two pools our family sat in the sun at the larger pool during the day and in the evenings we went to the smaller pool. In closing this was a great place to stay, I am telling all my friends who are planning a family vacation wanting to see Flordia and not wanting to break the bank account.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bognor regis uk", "Title": "\u201cHoneymooners\u201d", "Author": "katie b", "ReviewID": "UR128041958", "Content": "me and my husband visited liki tiki village for our honeymoon for a 2 week break from the uk back in nov 2011, i was pleasently suprised when we arrived at the resort, check in was smooth and flawless, the staff were very helpful upon our arrival. we arrived to our room which was a bit dated but not overly disapointed as we planned to be out enjoying the sights rather than sitting in watching tv complaining about the decor. i have to say it wasnt the the best start for me as whilst unpacking we discovered our safety deposit box was broken !! we called reception and had several guys look at our box with no success ( 2 hrs later) i was starting to get annoyed as i was excited to go out and explore and eat after a long flight this wasnt the best start, finally it was sorted and i could explore florida !! later that evening ( after a few drinks) we arrived home, to my horror as i walked into the toilet i saw the most hideous cockroach i have ever seen ! i was devastated as our honeymoon wasnt having the best start to what should have been the best holiday of our lives, my husband tried to tackle the beast but it ran under the bath, i then spent the next 2 weeks petrified it would return ( i have a huge phobia of bugs ) i called reception a couple of times to report this i was told someone would be up to our room to sort out the issue but noody ever arrived!! highly disapointed. i also found that it took forever to bring clean towels and toilet tissue, apart from my moans i found the accomadation ok nothing special, but just what we needed, perfect location !! we had an amazing honeymoon i just wish we had stayed elsewhere. x", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middleburg, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat for Kids!\u201d", "Author": "susans1007", "ReviewID": "UR128020303", "Content": "Took my nephew to Liki Tiki Village last week and was pleasantly surprised.

Well upon arrival after trying to find this place in the dark, which by the way, the directions on their website are not good to follow. If you do decide to stay there, turn right onto Avalon Rd, off 192 West, then immediate left onto Bali Blvd. So we finally get there and are greeted by someone with no name tag, no introduction, no welcome, just \"You need something?\" Seriously, this is how I was greeted. Not to mention, I then feel bad because her attitude was that I was interrupting her evening or something. She shows me a park map of where our building and room is and I asked twice if there was anything closer to the lagoon. All I got was a look and the response, \"this is where your room is...\" Great customer service there!! I was then told about the resort fee and additional fee for a pack-n-play. Which was fine, I knew that ahead of time and was ok with it. Then I was told that if I lost a key card for the room, or it needed to be reprogrammed, it was a $10 fee, after I got 4 keys for the family. Upon getting to the room, only 2 worked, the other 2 never did but for fear of being out an additional $20 we just made do with the 2 keys. Then I'm told there would be additional fees if the pool towels in the room were not returned. What kind of \"resort\" doesn't have pool towels at the pool? Then I'm told to go see this guy at the guest services desk. He then hands me a packet of restaurant options, tries to sell me park tickets and all that and then I was free to go. Of course, looking back, he was the nicest person I interacted with the whole time there. So then we get to the room, what a joke. When sitting on the couch, you may as well just have sat on the floor. The bathrooms were disgusting with dirt and hair on the floors. The tub in the master bath looked as though it hadn't been cleaned or much less even wiped down in about a good year or two. The shower head had not had a good cleaning in about 10 years with mold and lime build up all over it. The sprinkler head in the kitchen area had so much gunk and dust on it, that it was literally hanging down from it!! God forbid there was a fire, I don't think the water could spray from it! The refrigerator door had a big dent in it, which really, no it doesn't affect anything, but it shows that if you don't care what your rooms look like, you obviously don't care about your guests. The kitchen floor was full of dust and dirt and good Lord, don't look to the right of the fridge on the floor between the cabinets!! Nasty!! And then there were little gnats or some type of bugs constantly on the counters. No matter what, we could never get them to go away! So I decided to call the front desk and ask to be moved. First call, let it ring for several minutes, no answer. Tried again a few minutes later, no answer. Kids were hungry and cranky, we'd been traveling all day so we decided to just get them fed and to bed and I went to Wal-Mart and purchased our own cleaning supplies and my wife and I decided to clean the room up ourselves to be accceptable. Although, you're better off picking up the carpet with your hands as the vacuum left in the room was worthless. I think it was actually a toy/pretend one. I figured housekeeping would be in the next day and I would tell them about it. Nope!! Little did I know that if I wanted even the slightest bit of housekeeping, it was $29.99 per day. Full housekeeping was $39.99 per day!! Seriously?? You're a \"resort\" yet you don't have simple house keeping? I've stayed in $35/night rooms and had full housekeeping!! Oh but there's a note that says that's why they have in room washer and dryer so you can do your own. Gee now that's what I think of when I think vacation...cleaning my own towels and pool towels, etc. So on the second day, we had gone through the 3 garbage bags they give you for the kitchen trash. So I called housekeeping at 1:45pm and asked if I could get garbage bags or if I would be charged. The lady on the phone chuckled and said, \"no charge, I will send some right over.\" By 6pm when we left for dinner, no bags had shown up. We returned at 10:30pm and still no bags. I called the front desk and again, so sorry to have bothered them but I got the \"(sigh..) I don't know why they didn't get there, but I will send some over\". 25 minutes later they finally dropped off a whopping 3 more bags. Good thing I saved the Wal-Mart bags!! But no matter, you have to take out your own trash to the trash shoot which had oh just the most so pleasant odor!! I really love wretching from the smell every time I have to take out my trash on vacation!! Now I will say the kids had fun playing 'who can kill the most bugs' and they especially liked the giant spider in the living room that we affectionately decided to name him Herb. They think he went to the neighbors, but he went to spider heaven while they were sleeping. We especially liked the free waterfall in the master bathroom toilet everytime the room above flushed their toilet. Yep right from the vent in the ceiling down on to the toilet. Not so much fun when my wife was sitting there, now that was a scream for a horror movie!! OH and if you do stay here, be prepared for the constant calls every day wanting you to take time out of your vacation to try and have them sell you your own condo there! Now if you all really want to try and pull that on guests, improve the condos first!! And do something about the nasty well water....the water literally smelled coming out of the showers and sinks. Now let's talk about the lagoon and pools. First the pool outside our building, was open till Midnight, which I wouldn't mind so much if it was just open. But the blaring music and the constant water splashing from the mushroom thing at the kiddie pool was enough to make you insane!! And that mushroom for the kiddie pool area, yeah, real nice if you want hypothermia!! I have never in my life seen water that cold for a kiddie pool area. Not that the main pool was much better and I'm all about cooling off in the heat, but no joke, someone could die from water that cold!! The main pool, well let's just say, obviously you all don't hire people to clean your pool. Nasty, nasty, gross!! So we tried the lagoon, because after all, that's the big attraction here right? NOT!! You have 600 some rentals and about 35 to 50 chairs at the lagoon!! We got there shortly after it opened at 10am and there was no where to sit at all!! Oh wait, that was part of the resort fee was to use the lagoon. So where was my family of 5 witih an infant supposed to sit for the day?? I asked the lifeguard and his response was, \" oh well, not sure what to say, most people get here right at opening and stay for the day.\" Hey thanks buddy, great help there! So we then loaded everyone back in the car, yeah that's right, had to drive over to the lagoon and back to the room. Needless to say, the kids were disappointed but we did get back there a few days later by getting there really early. Now I would have thought that with the resort fee for use of the lagoon, the amenities there would be included...oh no!! You pay for everything you want to do there, activities, temp tatoos,etc. So i'm still having a hard time figuring out what the additional resort fee was for? Why not just make it part of the per night room charge?? So by the 4th call from the guest services folks trying to sell me a condo, I told them never in my right mind would I ever invest in that place much less ever stay there again!! His response was pretty much an I don't care attitude and told me to have a good night. Honestly folks, do your homework, this place is a rip off and a joke. The photos on their website are photo shopped and I can assure you, the reviews on here that praise this place, were written by the management or ownership staff. Every person I talked to at the pools or in passing had the same complaints and not one person I came across said anything good about it. If you do go there, stay away from room 641E. Unless you already live in a box on the streets of Chicago or something like that, this place is worthless. Once we get the pix off the camera I'll upload the pix of the nasty room, the bugs and everything that was supposed to be so wonderful according to their website. One thing I forgot to take pictures of was how black our socks and feet would get after walking on the carpets every day. The shame of it is, the resort, if I can call it that, really has a lot of potential. But do you really need to charge $1 per page if you need to print something out from the business center? Anyway, the place really does have very good potential. There are a lot of other things that happened and I can sum it all up from saying, your entire staff need lessons on basic customer service. It would be really great if someone that knew what they were doing could buy this place and manage it appropriately. Otherwise, it was extremely disappointing and I will be sure to let everyone I ever talk to know about it. I'll be sending this review to every travel site I can find. No I really don't have that kind of time but trust me folks, if this place was to go out of business, it would be a blessing for other folks to not waste their time or money to stay here.... Oh and I would be more than happy to discuss this with anyone from Liki Tiki management that cares to hear it. Even though when I checked out yesterday and asked for a manager, I was told there wasn't anyone around.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wokingham", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for Disney...\u201d", "Author": "Fandangos", "ReviewID": "UR127947614", "Content": "I did a lot of research before coming out to Disney and the Liki lived up to expectations. I was there from the 25/03 - 06/04 with my wife and two girls and we got a 1 bedroom apartment for around \u00a3620 (Jan sales) for 12 nights which was an absolute bargain. Driving to all the Disney parks was extremely simple and took around 15 to 20 mins although getting to Universal Studios took around an hour although we may not have taken the quickest route but thats what the SatNav said! There are loads of places to eat on the 192 road but they are mainly junk food type places or cram as much into your mouth for $10 but there were some nice restaurants nearby and I can recommend Houlihans for a nice steak or ribs. The main 192 road which runs past the Liki is quite tacky with lots of 'bargain' gift shops and \"we buy your Disney ticket\" shops but it's not too bad and there are interesting places to visit and a Walmart and Publix nearby. I was really impressed with the resort itself, check in was a breeze and the apartment was how I expected it to be in terms of decor but actually bigger. As long as you get it into your head that your accommodation is not 5* you will not be disappointed, think of it more as a home from home with everything you need to function normally as a family such as oven,iron, bath, shower, washing machine, dining table and chairs, living area, dining area etc etc. I would probably go for a 2 bedroom place if you have two children but if you are on a bit of a budget the one bedroom with pullout sofa bed in the living area is definitely doable and my girls did not moan once about being uncomfortable. The pool areas are quite nice and if you have small children the will love the swimming pool around Shipwreck Sally's, there is a quieter pool if you want it although this can get pretty noisy if you get a bunch of school kids having a bombing session. We stayed in block 400 which overlooked the 'quiet' pool. At first we got a little annoyed that you had people shouting and swimming in the pool until 12 at night but after a while we got used to it and once you had a tiring day at one of the parks and closed the patio doors you did not really hear it. In the end I liked over looking the pool because my girls could go and have a swim after the parks whilst my wife and I had a wine on the balcony keeping an eye on them or joining them. Apart from that we didn't really use any of the ammenities apart from the gym which was a bit small but had just about enough to get rid of the calories including free weights and bench, running, cycling and cross trainer. Would I recommend this place to anyone else, most definitely. Would I go back myself, probably not, personally I think once you have done the Disney parks you do not need to do them again and the Liki Tiki is great for the Disney parks. Universal Studio's is a different matter and I would like to go back in 2 years time and do that again plus Busch gardens but I will probably stay somewhere closer next time. My tips: if you want to save a fortune on direct flights to Orlando fly to Miami and hire a car and drive 3.5 hours to Orlando, it's easy. To be honest I could have done the flight and drive in one day but we stayed in Miami for one night before setting off to the Liki. Take a pack lunch or snacks to the parks and eat somewhere nice after you come out. The parks are full of over priced, fast food rubbish which just isn't worth it. I'm not a health freak but I actually lost weight after nearly 3 weeks in and around Disney, the food is serious heart attack material and I couldn't stomach it after a few days. If driving and staying a length of time take your own UK SatNav and download us maps before you go, car companies charge around $10 a day.

The carpet, like people have mentioned was looking a bit dirty, but I didn't mind to much for the price. Everything else was pretty clean including the beds which had nice clean sheets and were very comfortable. The air conditioning worked wonderfully, especially for a week that was hitting 90 degrees! The kitchen was equipped with the basics and we were able to do all we wanted with what was there -Full refrigerator, freezer with ice maker, microwave, dishwasher, a few pots and sauce pans, a block knife set on the counter -with steak knives and other knives. A coffee maker with 1 coffee packet -if you are a coffee drinker you will need to bring coffee and filters. A blender, a 4 slot toaster, a cutting board and a few basic serving and cooking utensils -the basics, but all we needed. Included in our room was a couple rolls of toilet paper (one set for each bath), hand bar soap, body soap, shampoo and conditioner, towels, wash clothes, hand towels, POOL towels (if you loose these you have to pay for a replacement), liquid dish soap and new scrub sponge, 1 (or 2) dishwasher detergent packs, 2 laundry soap packs. I would recommend taking a small amount of dishwasher detergent (or tabs) if you plan to eat in some, it's nice to run the dishwasher and not worry about running out. I also bought laundry detergent and some fabric softener sheets. They also had a few trash bags so you could empty the trash every couple days. Yes the pool hours are limited from 10am to dusk, but there are plenty of other things to do like mini golf, shuffleboard, ride the 2 or 4 person bikes, tennis, basketball, and they have a small playground for the kids. The reason for the \"lagoon\" or waterpark to close at dusk is for safety of the kids swimming. We ate a Shipwreck Sally's after hearing about the all you can eat fish fry on Friday nights. It was a great meal to have for our last night. The food was good. Although we were right near the basketball and tennis courts, I never had trouble sleeping. Things always seemed to quiet down around 10pm every night and even though we were right next to a family we could only hear them during the day (through the adjoining rooms). We did have a large grasshopper-type bug that we caught and put outside along with a little lizzard that got in! :) But, we just made sure not to leave the doors open and keep the lights off when you are entering at night. It's Florida, there ARE bugs people! They have a small vacuum and broom with dustpan. That was nice to have to help clean up after eating (kids). We had a couple small problems (one, our vacuum wasn't working properly) and we simply called the number listed near the phone and almost immediately someone was knocking at our door to help us out (replacement vacuum). So, if you have any problems, just call. They want to make sure you are happy. The only complaint is that the internet was extremely slow -but luckily, my husband was there on vacation and really didn't need to do business. :)", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philly, PA", "Title": "\u201cGreat accommodations and activities\u201d", "Author": "ald3114", "ReviewID": "UR127600148", "Content": "We traveled 17 hours by car from up north and arrived at 830am.

We related our concern upon check-in and the person at the front desk named Jesaida listened and took action to mitigate our consternation. The supervisor of security (Angel Nieces)) met us and assured us this was a much different place today than we experienced in 2001. By the end of the third day we were convinced that was the case. We felt very comfortable and at ease. We were in one of the older town homes. The entire unit had been refurbished recently, all newer appliances, carpet, fresh paint and the most comfortable bed we have ever slept on. We found absolutely no bugs or insects in or even around our unit. Soundproofing must have been added as a family with toddlers was next to us and we never heard them through the walls. Now these older units can never come up to the luxury of the high rise buildings, but we enjoy the town home units more for the more relaxed atmosphere. All of the gas grills were very clean each time we used them. With at least 6 gas grills and even more charcoal grills available, we never had to wait for one. The on site restaurant, Ship Wreck Sally's, offered very good sandwiches at a price that would not break the bank, albeit more expensive than off site but nevertheless a reasonable price for the size of their offerings. A down side was the mandatory fee ($59.00?) or so for the use of amenities. This was a charge per unit. It did include all usage of resort amenities, including the on site water park, bikes, paddle boats, local phone calls and a somewhat high speed Internet. All in all, not a bad deal since it would include everyone in your party. Liki Tiki is best suited when you have younger kids. The water park is great for pre- teens but I would suppose the older teens would get bored very fast. The game room is very nominal. Adults can immerse them selves in the other two pool ares. They have signs up that the hot tubs not for the kids, but that was not enforced. Many times they were filled with pre-teens. Our biggest disappointment that we could not even get close to the hot tubs on many days. Overall, we were made to feel very welcomed and the staff was eager to please. Jesaaida and Angel both went over the top to alleviate our concerns, and it is not often that you can point out any one individual that has really made your trip enjoyable.

The location is just a little out of the way, about 15-20 minutes away from Disney but has a good selection of restaurants and shopping close by. The resort is gated with security working the front and with no neighboring hotels or homes, so I would say it is a very safe location. We were in the 800 Building in a 2 bedroom condo on the 4th floor over looking the water park. The condo was a good size with a nice master bedroom with a king bed private bathroom with a shower and separate jacuzzi tub. the living room had a pull out couch and the other bedroom had a two beds. The unit had a full kitchen and washer and dryer.. The styling could use some work but over all no major complaints and for the price we paid a very good value. We enjoyed the view of the water park and grounds but this could be loud for some so ask for a different location if you want peace and quite. The unit was clean and we did not see a single bug. Their is a resort fee that includes WiFi, Water park, Bikes, Paddle boats, Mini Golf, Fishing equipment, tennis rackets, basket balls. The main water park is nice geared more for kids under 12 and I was very impressed with the life guards and how attentive they were. This is not a huge water park like Great wolf lodge or wet and wild but still nice. They have a bar and restaurant if you want food or some drinks. They have sign saying no outside coolers but they didn't seem to enforce it. The park closes at 6:30. They have two other pools that are open to 12 one of which has some gas barbeques. other amenities were nice tennis courts and a smaller basket ball court which was always busy. The Mini golf was okay and only had nine holes but fun for the kids. Internet was slow and a times even slower. Bikes were fun and paddle boats a workout. The Exercise room was too small but we opted to walk and exercise out side As long as you have realistic expectations of how much your paying or not paying this is a great family resort.

This was a second floor one bedroom unit in the 800 block, which backs on to views of the pond, park, and main kid pool area. The resort was perfect for us as we have a 3 year old and 6 month old, and your kids can have as much fun on the resort as they will at expensive Disney sites. We rented a pack and play fold up playpen from the resort which our 6 month old slept in and our 3 year old slept on the pull out couch. We spent about $200 at Walmart on groceries and we cooked all but two meals in the well equipped kitchen in our unit. The in room laundry was also very convenient. The pools are great for young kids as there is a zero entry area, numerous water slides of different speeds, and a kid pool which was very warm and shallow. Our 3 year old had a blast with the mini putt and paddle boat rides. You can see turtles and alligators in the pond. We never had any issues with bugs in our room. I had read some negative reviews about this prior to going, so we just made sure we kept all of our food in the fridge or boxed/bagged in drawers. We never left a drop of food or juice laying around, and never left our patio door open, why take the chance if you know it will attract bugs? The rooms all have a vaccuum and brooms so take advantage of them. We avoided the time share presentation, which they try to draw you to by offering discounted attraction tickets. We bought two tickets to SeaWorld/Aquatica for $100 from a discount ticket seller located across the 192 road (if we had purchased through the resort it would have been $180). The resort is about 20-30 mins from Orlando and we also went to Cocoa Beach on the East Coast which was approx 1 hour drive. We also used Babys Away and rented a jogging stroller, exersaucer, infant car seat, large beach umbrella, and a high chair (the resort only had wooden ones) and they drop off and pick up to the front desk at the resort.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Syracuse, New York, United States", "Title": "\u201cThis property is a Hit or Miss....Very close to Disney.\u201d", "Author": "Voncia A", "ReviewID": "UR125558629", "Content": "We arrived on February 20, 2012 and stayed until February 26, 2012 in room 820F.

We had a lovely big kitchen with microwave, toaster, coffee maker, oven etc the lounge was huge with a nice big TV and dvd player and boom box (not that we used those). upstairs was a big king size room with generous sized ensuite shower and toilet. The second bedroom had single twin beds and the bathroom and shower was downstairs. Air con was great and so was the heating - odd temperatures being quite cold most nights and warm in the day.

It was also really nice to have heated pools we could swim in even when it was only in the 70s most days. And the pools are open till midnight so I could go for a late swim after dinner and drinks. The staff was helpful and friendly and checking in and out was fast, they also let us have an extra hour to check out wich put it at 11 (10 am is already reasonable I think). If I had to say there was any issues it would be that room service didn\u2019t visit at all. If we needed towels(they encourage you to launder them in your in-condo washer/dryer) or pillows or a tidy up or even more paper products we had to request them. It wasn\u2019t difficult, but hotels seem to do that on their own for the most part so that might be the only down side. This was a great time and worth every penny of the reasonable price.

I also had my family stay in 2 separate 1 bedroom villas. We were in the 1200 buliding from Dec 30-Jan 6, 2012. There are 3 pools. One is the Liki Tiki Waterpark. All 3 are HEATED!!CLEAN!! and simply gorgeous! We did not eat at Shipreck Sallys because there are plenty of restaurants in driving range. You absolutely need a car to get around. There is a 7-11 very close but creepy to walk to. Super Target and Walmart all within a 5 minute range. NOT ONE BUG/INSECT to be seen in or around our villas . Since I had 3 units to judge by-they were all remodeled and newer. Do not expect Granite or high end fixtures-but do expect nice flat screen TVs in the 2 bedroom. A nice VCR/DVD combo as well in all units. The 2 bedroom has the hugest Jacuzzi tub I have ever seen at a timeshare-wonderful! The showers in all units had THE BEST WATER PRESSURE!!!! The hairdryers were brand new but kind of weak. I have long hair & it took 15 minutes longer than my home dryer but I managed. NO MAID SERVICE-We have exchanged 10 times in the last 7 years and have never encountered NO MID WEEK MAID SERVICE???.-just weird-but we managed. Tennis courts and mini golf are great. shuffleboard was a blast. They had paddle boats but we didnt use them. The surrey bike rental was so much fun. The weight room had weights,natilus, EFX and 2 treadmills-very clean but very small. Weight room closes at midnight. The pool by the weight room had the nicest BBQ set up. It was far from 1200 bldg but if we needed to BBQ- we would have driven the food over and cooked it with no complaints. Villas have cookie sheets for baking. You can request non stick frying pans for cooking. Bring or buy coffee filters. We were 6 VERY serious coffee drinkers and couldnt believe there was no starter filter for your first day??????????? Do not hesitate to book LIKI TIKI. If you have kids-the waterpark is worth its weight in gold. The 11 and 4 year old in my group were in heaven! Email me with questions. We had ages 4-74 with us and EVERYONE was really happy at this location despite the small inconveniences. You will be so close to Disney Park entrance.

The receptionist was very helpful and welcoming. She overdid it with the amount of paperwork and information, \"this is for your car, this is for the internet wifi, this is for etc etc\". We were quite surprised to be told that they were pleased to provide us with a card for \"free\" access to the facilities at the resort such as the waterpark, like we were lucky and should appreciate it. I would have thought all guests would be allowed to use ALL facilities it comes with the booking. The receptionist advised us that our apartment was located in the 1300 block which was the newly \"remodelled block\". We arrived at the block which seemed like the farthest away from the other blocks. The apartment seemed nice but the decor was a little old fashioned and the closet just had 3 hangers which was not very helpful and the balcony looked out on to the bush. I made a call to reception and asked if we could be moved as we were there for week and would prefer to look at the pool area or something with a better view and closer to everything. Unfortunately we were advised they had nothing to offer us so we had to put up with it and he advised us the other blocks were not remodelled and as nice so we should stay where we are. He also told us we would have a fantastic view of the Disney fireworks from the balcony which was a bonus. On reading a review below the writer stated that they were told block 1300 was not the remodelled block so perhaps the receptionist did not tell us the truth to begin with (the apartment did not seem refurbished) and we also heard the fireworks but could not see them so we were misinformed about that too. The waterpark is great for children and our son loved it. The only disadvantage was that it opened late at 10am so we had to use the other pool which was a walk away and the waterpark pool closed around 5pm. As this resort is very close to Disney perhaps they should consider accommodating to peoples needs as children would like to play in the pool after returning from parks or early in the morning. The crazy golf and pedalo boats also closed at 5pm which was also a shame. Our son was disappointed that he could not play crazy golf after an early dinner. The facilities close very early! We stayed at a different resort the first week of our vacation and everything closed at 11pm. I took a walk to reception about 8pm one evening and the area surrounding the pool, bridge and children's playground was very dark and quite scary at night especially for a female walking alone perhaps some security/safety lighting on the bridge could be added for safety.

The first night the jets on the jacuzzi tub went off every 20 minutes so we had to call maintenance and they came up right away. I do not understand why they charge each room $55 for the use of the resort facilities- especially when everything shuts down at 5pm. The wifi was slow and we couldn't get logged on some days. Then there was a charge for the magic show where they served pop and popcorn. The very well done pizza was an extra charge. It was geared toward the little kids and they each ended up with a sculptured balloon. We are timeshare owners elsewhere and were not bothered by staff about their timeshare offers. We loved the 24 hour security. The grounds are nice. My daughter did have a cockroach fall on her head in the bathroom but it gave us all a good laugh. After all it is Florida and we expect critters.

I'll keep this review shorter than our last, but here are some of the highlights. Property is well designed with 24 hour security and is located about 15 minutes west of Disney. Publix and Super Target very close for groceries and many quality restaurants within 10 minutes. Another shout out to our favorite Indian joint, \"The Clay Oven\", look for the big purple wizard, it's right next door. Check in for us was a breeze. We booked thru Travelocity and had no problems. My Mom and Sister had a separate reservation for the same week. They arrived first and basically choose our two units upon arrival. Liki Tiki accomidated us and gave us side by side units and let us choose where. Keep in mind that early December is a slow season, so this kind of attention may not be available all the time, but we sure appreciated it. We were in unit 209C and it was a much better set up for us compared to the condo buldings. It's a two-story unit with two bedrooms. Great location overlooking the pond and playground, for our kids, that was perfect. Furniture was decent, beds were great, decor was typical rental standard. Well stocked with all needs, towels, tp, sheets, pillows, dishes etc. Overall, quite pleased with this particular unit. Now the minor problems: slow draining tub upstairs and dryer lint exhaust completely clogged. Both problems were handled immediately, within 15 minutes, and they were completely professional in their service. I would suggest to the resort that dryer lint is a huge fire hazard and should be checked more regularly in the future. No dryer exhaust should ever look like ours looked. Yes, it is a timeshare resort, but the only \"timeshare invitation\" we had to decline for both of our stays this year was at check in. They do call your room from time to time, but we never answered our condo phone and hence, never heard from timeshare salespersons all week. Every staff member from top to bottom was polite, informative and friendly. Shipwreck Sally's pool bar/restaurant has good food at decent prices.

Third - although our room was ready when expected our friends' room wasn't ready until early evening, and we arrived there at 10 a.m. It took many heated arguments for them to finally get a room assigned to them. They were not the only ones who were waiting in the lobby, it was packed with many unhappy guests who were also waiting for their rooms. The staff at the lobby was very rude and couldnt gaurantee anyone a time of when the rooms would be ready. Fourth - The package described cleaning service would be done but not once did anyone come and change our sheets, or clean the room - and we stayed for about 5 nights. Cleaning service I found out is a service that we would have to pay an additional fee - and we would need to schedule that separately. Fifth - safe box and AC unit wasn't working in our friend's room so we had to deal with that as well. I was soo disappointed and want to warn anyone who is considering going to Liki Tiki - go somewhere else, it is not worth it.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windsor, Canada", "Title": "\u201cJust Visiting\u201d", "Author": "K8hope11", "ReviewID": "UR120461480", "Content": "Went to this place for the day to visit our friends we were travelling with.

The only part that bummed us out was it stormed the entire weekend so the kids did not get to do any of the activities such as the pool & waterslides, paddle boats, fishing, etc which is why we chose to stay at Liki Tiki Village to start with. I wanted somewhere that had space for 2 parents and 3 kids to move around and fun activities for the kids. I am so glad we chose well as I would have gone insane cooped up with boys 6, 10, & 17. They also offer daily kids activities such as crafts, competitions, and Xbox. We stayed in the 1200 building in 12444E a 2bed/2bath. It was being renovated on the outside so there was a crane in the parking lot but we heard no noise so it didn\u2019t bother us a bit and was glad to be staying in a newly painted area. I paid $213.14 total with tax for our 3 day 2 night stay Oct 7th -9th. We also had to pay a resort fee of 15.00 to the hotel when we got there separate from our total bill, & they charge $50 to your credit card to be refunded if you didn\u2019t break anything or charge anything to your room but I knew that going in and the $50 charge came off the next day after we got home. Everything was included such as towels, dishes, detergent for clothes and dishes etc. I loved washing all of our clothes before we left so I did not have to do it when we got home. The dryer was very handy as we came back from Downtown Disney soaked from the torrential downpour. We had a massive amount of towels. Dish towels, bath towels, hand towels, pool towels. I was very excited not to have to call to get more towels like I always do when we stay at our regular one room hotels. Our beds were super comfy and we had a ton of pillows. I loved it as I am a pillow hog. The kids all got their own bed when we put the 6 yr old on the sleeper sofa so no one had to fight over who had to double up in a bed. There are 3 tvs so the kids didnt have to argue over what to watch. The staff was extra friendly and went out of their way showing us things to do nearby, where to eat, etc. I read some reviews about the hotel trying to talk you into a time share there but when I checked in they asked me if I was interested in a 30 mins spiel to sell me one and I would receive a $60 gift certificate to use in their restaurant.

I just came back from a 5 night \"staycation\" from 10/5 to 10/10 in this hotel since i live 2 hrs. away from Orlando. i was a little bit afraid when i read some of the reviews about this hotel but let me tell you, DONT BE AFRAID!!!!. i am 35 y.o. and went with my wife and 2 kids, 4 years old and a 2 month old. The first thing that i was afraid about was the reviews about bugs in the room, well i did not see any bugs in my room, not a single one, no bed bugs or roaches at all, i was on a 4th floor room, maybe that has something to do but NO BUGS!!. Some other bad reviews was about the condition of the rooms, well the room was clean which for me is the most important thing and yes maybe there is a cracked tile in the bathroom floor but is it really tha relevant? i dont think so. there is wall paper on the walls but i really dont care about the looks. Other reviews mentioned that the staff would insist in joining the time share, well i was never asked about time share al all, and neve received a call in my room asking me to attend anything so dont worry about it. Also let me comment about the place, it is a kids friendly place so if you want a quiet place maybe this is not a good idea, there will be kids playing and running in the pool and waterpark which is fine with me since i have kids. The pool is really nice for kids and adults, has many slides for small kids, also the best part is that they have a restaurant and bar at the pool and the prices are very reasonable, (burgers around 8 bucks) and the drinks and cocktails are good also, i recommend the liki tiki punch. They also have daily activities for kids and you can use the paddle boats, mini golf, fishing poles and bikes that are included in the resort fee. the place is only 20 min awayfrom disney parks.The place was not crowded at all and i never had any problems finding good seats at the pool, in summary i dont find any reason why i would not go back to liki tiki village, actually i am already planning our next trip, after all i'm only 2 hrs away, dont be afraid of the bad reviews, i admit that i was but believe me, there is nothing to be afraid of. if you are tha kind of person that is extremely picky this hotel is a very good choice for you, and i dont want to sound considered but i have been to many hotels, not ony in the orlando area but around the world. so liki tiki village is the place to go.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "essex", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Holiday\u201d", "Author": "agent-steve", "ReviewID": "UR118922847", "Content": "This is my 10th Visit to Orlando,but my 1st visit to the Liki Tiki and im glad to report everything was excellent,well equipped apartments with plenty of on sight facilities made our family holiday a memorable experience.I work as a travel agent and have made recommendations to future clients to stay at this property.We stayed in block 400 over looking the pool with the fitness room which we often used as it had a real good atmosphere with the music being played in the background.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canton, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Vacation Stay at Liki Tiki\u201d", "Author": "Jennydowd", "ReviewID": "UR118894601", "Content": "What a wonderful place to stay when visiting the Orlando area! The value for the price can't be beat. We were there off-season, so it was quiet and not crowded at all. You can tell by looking at the photos of the pool I posted how empty it was as those were taken around 4pm. We love having a condo when traveling with kids. The extra space and full kitchen make for a much more pleasant and comfortable experience. We stayed in unit 1351E - a 2 bedroom unit - and were very pleased with our accommodations. The master suite was roomy with a king-sized bed and the other bedroom had 2 full-sized beds and it's own bathroom in the hall. There was a nice, screened porch/balcony and this building backs up to open space, so it was quiet with a view of lush, tropical green space. The unit was very clean and reasonably well-kept, albeit with a few minor imperfections: a cracked door on the microwave, an exposed electrical outlet, and dirty carpets. The dirty carpets were a bit of a turn off, but you would never know they were dirty by looking at them, so I can understand how the management wouldn't know unless it was brought to their attention. My children's black feet after walking around barefoot for a while were my only indication something was amiss. To their credit, when I informed the desk clerk of this upon checkout, she apologized profusely and made note of it, explaining that the carpets are cleaned on a routine maintenance schedule and sometimes a unit will need a cleaning in-between. Made sense to me. The maids would never be able to tell as they cleaned a unit because they are not cleaning barefoot. ;) Walls are pretty thin. We were lucky enough to have no one in the unit next to us for most of the week, but the last 2 days we had the pleasure of hearing our neighbors through our connecting door. I'm sure they enjoyed hearing us correcting our unruly preschoolers too. Haha. Liki Tiki has lots of activities planned throughout the week to keep you entertained on property and the lagoon pool is lots of fun with all the slides and squirting fountains. My 2 and 4 year olds had a blast on the smaller slides! The food at Shipwreck Sally's was your basic poolside grill, but very convenient! Great playground too. Can't say enough good things about the amenities here. The property is lush and tropical and well-maintained. It is on a quiet access road right off 192, just outside of the tourist-y, gift-shop filled part. It was only a 10 minute drive (7 miles) each day to the entrance ramp to World Drive and all the Disney parks.

My husband and I took turns throughout the week getting hit with the freezing cold water. The resort needs to address its other attractions. The mini-golf had loose borders, carpet that was rolled over, and overall unattractive areas. I also question how a \"Green Lodge\" does not have recycling anywhere. That seems to be the most obvious way to help the enviroment! Internet is free for owners but it was barely working. The waterpark area is great for the kids. We have two boys (2 & 4) who have hours of fun there and the lifeguards are very attentive. Wal-mart is only a few miles away and has everything you need to stock your unit for the week.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newark, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cI'm only giving one star because I have to in order to post my review\u201d", "Author": "Kiki P", "ReviewID": "UR117773481", "Content": "First impression was unexpected because the staff at the front desk is very unprofessional and not courteous at all. At the time of check in I felt like I was bothering the lady at the front desk. The room looked clean and fully equipped...that was until bed time and we opened the sofa bed to find a humongous roach in it and when we unfolded the mattress there was a huge smelly stain in the mattress. It was too late around 3am and the kids were already asleep so we decided to sleep all four of us in the same bed. When we called in the morning to complain, they sent a building supervisor who said and I quote \"I'm not too worried about the bug issue that is normal in this area because of the lakes, but I can have the room fumigated and the mattress changed for you\" NO!!!!!! All I wanted was a new room free of bugs but she made it sound as if it was almost impossible for them to find an available room for us. About an hour later they gave us a new room and of course the first thing we did was check the sofa bed which seemed clean (although in the morning I had to call them to have them replace the fire alarm batteries that wouldn't stop beeping all night long and to fix the clogged bathtub). The next day when the weekend arrived the place was super crowded so if you want a place to relax by the pool, this is not the right place for you. We brought our little girls 5 and 4 and most of the time we stayed in the kiddie pool which will get the f you are planning on visiting any of the disney parks and use Liki Tiki's shuttle bus be prepared to deal with the unprofessional shuttle bus drivers who will pick you up at the hotel early in the morning and drop you off at another hotel for a second shuttle bus (we waited about 25 minutes or the next bus) and she did not explain to us this process until we pulled over to the hotel to wait for the second shuttle bus. Also their last shuttle bus leaves Epcot's parking lot at 9:35pm so we were not even able to watch the firework show at magic kingdom which is at the park's closing time 9:00pm :-( Their fast food in their restaurant is ok and price is cheap. Their amenities like the 6 boats for the boat rides in the lake, 1 tennis court, 1 basketball court, 4 bikes and mini golf court were too few for the amount of guests they have, there was always a long waiting list to use any of those amenities. We went to the lobby to get some money out of their ATM and heard a lady complaining about some very rude people running in the pool and playing very rough among themselves, all happening right next to her kids and she was afraid they could hurt her kids. I heard when the supervisor told her that there were other pools that she could move to and that the other guests were allowed to do whatever they wanted!!! are you serious? Then the supervisor had the nerve to call security on her to take her out of the lobby because she was yelling at him when he gave her that response. In our last night we asked front desk to call a cab for us to drive us to the Orlando airport early next day. They told us that the taxi company they worked with would charge $76 but because they had to come so early to pick us up (5:00am) they had to charge a total of $86. When we got to the room we went through the yellow pages and found a cab company that charged us $56 for the airport ride! I'm pretty sure the people at the front desk work for a commission with the cab company. Overall, my one week experience in this hotel was HORRIBLE!

Our vacuum didn't work and our washer/dryer needed to be replaced, but we were otherwise satisfied. Check-in wasn't an issue for us, but other guests were having problems while we were in the lobby a few times. Customer service seemed fair at best (one of the guests trying to check in and the manager were in a heated discussion b/c they admittedly gave the reserved room away.). We were staying through a timeshare, but we had to pay and additional $6.99 a day for unlimited access to wireless (which was very unreliable), surrey bikes (which the kids LOVED), paddleboats, golf, and other rentals. It was worth it, but you had to keep track of a little paper card which was tattered by the end of the week and an inconvenience to keep track of and dry. The waterpark and 2 other pools were very nice. The kids never got sick of it, and they enjoyed the variety of slides. There were at least 2 lifegaurds on duty. Shipwreck Sally's was convenient, had decent food, and was fairly reasonably priced. The only negative that I have about the waterpark (and rental shack) was that it didn't open until 10. My kids are early risers, and were anxious to get the day rolling, but we had to wait. The other pools did open at 7:30. Overall, we liked the Liki Tiki and we would consider going back.

She loved going down all the slides. It was perfect for 3-5 year olds. Parents would send their kids up to the slides and all take turns at the bottom catching their child as they came down. The playground was perfect too. We only spent naps and night time sleeping in the room, and when we weren't at Disney or other theme park we were in the pool. The resort seemed packed, but the amount of people at the pool didn't seem too crowded. It could have been good timing on our part. The temperature of the water was perfect.

We arrived early and our room was not ready until exactly 4p. This is our 6th stay and is the first time we have not got into our room before check in. The check in staff were very friendly as well as were the ladies at the information/gift desk. Room: We have personally toured the higher numbered rooms and they are in better condition than some, but if you want a room with the most beautiful view ask for either the 700, 800 or 900 buildings. They are older, but for the most part in pretty good shape. We are not extremely picky. They are the closest to the water park. We stayed in the 800 building on the 4th floor and had a view of the lake, beach area, bball/tennis courts, miniature golf and the water park. When on the patio you can hear the pool sounds - the music, people laughing and having fun, and the local wildlife. It is the most relaxing feeling in the world! I spent a lot of time on the patio watching the ducks, birds, fish and turtles. The 700 and 800 buildings have the best view. The newer buildings in the back behind these have views of woods only. There are other larger building units on the other side of the lake, closer to the other 2 pools that we have never stayed in. Not sure of the condition or views. Ammenities: My family loves the water park - Kids ages 15 and 12. Bring a cheap blow up ball for fun playing volleyball in the pool. There is one larger slide that all ages enjoy. There are 4 smaller slides that my older does not like anymore. But, my 12 year old still likes them. They are geared more for the younger ages. The atmosphere is fantastic. Families having fun and enjoying the music that is always playing. This year my kids did not join any of the kids activities as they are geared to the younger kids. It would be nice if they had a program for older kids. There are plenty of tables and chairs, but on weekends it is busier and they are harder to get. My 15 year old's only complaint about the water park area is that it closes too early. This time of the year it closes at 7:30p-8p. It closes in sections. The bar and grill at the pool closes around 9p. There are 2 other pools. A larger pool near the main building that has a tiki bar now - new since we were here before. There is a smaller pool near the workout room that has gas grills. We did not grill there, but the atmosphere was nice and relaxing with families having fun and the fun of food cooking. The workout room has several pieces of broken equiptment. The management really needs to fix this. The all in one machine had a loose piece that when my daughter bumped it it, fell and could have hit someone. It was pretty heavy. Shows: The only show we paid for was the Magic show. It was just ok. It really is geared for kids under the age of 10. It costs $10 for adults and I cannot remember the cost of kids as mine were both adults. ?5. it is an hour show. Don't go if you have older kids. We did not go to the Luau Dinner show this year, but in the past it was pretty good for all ages. The cost is $27.5 adults and $17.5 children 3-11 yrs. Disney is very close - we drove there in 15 minutes. Shopping: When you go out of the complex, turn rt on Bali and take another rt onto 17-92. There is a Publix Supermarket for groceries. The prices are reasonable. If you go a little further down and turn rt onto hwy 27 there is a Super Walmart and it is about a mile and a half down -on your right. In that general area is a Taco Bell, KFC. If you turn left on 27 and drive for approx. 15 miles. Just past where it goes over I-4 there is a shopping area on the RT. Dollar Tree, JC Penny, Ross, Super Target, Staples and much more. On 192 if you go left - there is a Super Target, Walgreens and many restaurants. There are really no restaurants or shopping within quick walking distance. There is a 7-11 to the rt out of the complex that you can walk to. Don't be surprised when you check in if you have been here before - they now charge a $50 (fifty something) complex fee when you check in. Instead of paying for the activities such as: fishing, boats, bball, min golf, bikes and Internet - you are just billed up front for them and get to do as much as you want. If you have kids this is an excellent deal. These were pricey in the past. My only large complaint this trip was the internet. It was contantly disconnecting. You have to log out of everything and disconnect the service and reconnect and open up your explorer again. If you are on a work trip. You will not get anything done if it involves the internet. My computer worked best on the patio. The most trouble was at night. Maybe high usage time. This facility is excellent for families with kids.

We came back again this summer because we enjoyed our stay the previous summer. We stayed in a 1 bedroom unit in the 900 building. Our friends were traveling with us and management was kind enough to accommodate both of our families in rooms within close proximity to each other. The room was immaculately clean with the exception of some crumbs on the pull-out mattress that I cleaned up before putting sheets on it for my younger daughter to sleep on. The pull-out mattress was perfect for a skinny 6 year old, but would probably not be comfortable for a full grown adult. The room had a stacking washer & dryer which we used regularly. Our room was stocked with all kinds of soaps & detergents that made the stay easy. The rugs were either new or recently cleaned. The pool area with the slides were enjoyable for both my 6 year old and my 1 year old; the lifeguards are fantastic and watch all of the children closely! The only issue that we had this time were some of the guests of the resort which is obviously not the fault of the resort. I would suggest that the hotel monitor how many people are staying in a room (although I can see how that would be difficult). We found that on the weekends, the pool was extremely overcrowded and many of the people in the pool were not really a family crowd (use your imagination). Unfortunately, we did not get a chance to use any of the activities that the resort provides such as bikes, fishing, boats, etc. The resort also hosts different theme nights and shows; there is something for everyone! The hotel also gives you a free photo, but we did not have time to do that either. I suggested this resort to my friend who stayed on the property this past June and she had a fantastic experience in the 1200 building. Some other tips: Use toll road 429 to get Disney World super fast, the Publix and Walmart are right outside the hotel on the main road. Overall, we would definitely stay here again.

Both families had a one bedroom unit. The unit was clean, though it definitely needs updating. Our showerhead was one of those which detached, but apparently the original mount had broken off and the hotel put a plastic clip there instead. This clip was obviously not universal, as it did not hold up the showerhead at all, and it would fall down constantly. Our balcony door lock was broken, and the hotel again rigged another way to close it - not sure how secure the makeshift lock would be compared to the broken one. I didn't like the pillows in the master (too big and firm) so I took a pillow down from the living room closet to see if I'd like it better. After putting my face against it to see if it felt softer, I noticed a THREE inch cockroach moving around underneath the pillowcase. Now, I know this is Florida and they're known as Palmetto bugs here, but a cockroach is a cockroach, especially when it takes up residence in my pillow. The walls between the units are very thin, and there is a connecting door between the one bedroom and two bedroom units. Our neighbors were apparently celebrating a birthday and invited every family member alive to come along, because there were about 15 people going in and out of their unit all weekend long. We could hear their music, conversation, celebration - and apparently they could hear me talking on the phone, because they started banging on our wall when i had the nerve to have a telephone conversation with a friend later in the evening. Our first morning at the resort, a Guest Services representative found it prudent to call us at 8:40 AM to try and sell us a timeshare. Since we had driven half the prior day and stayed up later than normal settling in, my husband (who had worked 36 of the previous 48 hours prior to driving) and my 3 year old were still asleep. The call obviously woke them up, and when I asked the representative what he was thinking calling people on vacation prior to 9 AM, his answer was \"It is the resort's policy to call guests before they might head out to the parks\". So, it is more important for this place to sell timeshares than to ensure their guests have a relaxing vacation. I called asking to speak to a manager and left about 3-4 messages. Nobody ever got back to me. Now, the worst part - their waterpark. Oh my goodness. I didn't go to the other pools so I can't attest to their condition, but this was nightmarish. Imagine a cesspool of the worst every culture has to offer crammed into a pool which is clearly not big enough for all the people, children screaming and splashing with no adult supervision, and loose pieces of hair extensions floating up against you as you try to avoid being hit by the kids cannonballing from the slides. Yeah, that bad. To summarize - would not return, and you shouldn't go.

The suite we were in was a 2BR 2BA with a kitchen. It was very clean, safe, and comfortable. We stayed in the ground floor of the 700 building. We have stayed at IslandOne properties before and been impressed. I really like the condo-hotels for family trips.. the kitchens, extra space, and separate bedrooms make it a much more relaxing trip. The biggest problem was the internet connection. This was a \"work-cation\" for me and I needed to be connected into my office every night for several hours. In short, I could never get a decent connection from inside the building (or another building I went to test). If you need your internet connection like I do, this is NOT the place for you. (details below). For work or for attraction surfing and emailing, not having viable internet access in a hotel is like not having hot water... You can stay there, but it's unreasonable. That's why I have to say \"poor\" on the overall rating. I'd specifically confirmed that they have connectivity when I called to book them. The lack of it overshadowed an otherwise decent place. The \"water park\" is more of an advanced water playground and the \"wave pool\" was a small side of the pool. It wasn't working while we were there, but it would be more of a novelty than anything else. Water-park-wise, I think it'd be great for wowing the 0-10yr old kids. Mine (11 and 13) enjoyed the swim and beachball volleyball playing, but it wasn't what they thought when they heard waterpark (long slides, lazy rivers, wave pools etc.. ). The Mini-golf was small, in poor repair, and never gets vacuumed, so you're golfing over leaves and twigs. The Paddleboats were fun and my 11yr old enjoyed our outing. Internet.. the long-version: The in-room wifi was never more than 2 dots and even when I *could* get connected, it would take >5 minutes to bring up the google search page (the most lightweight page I know of). I spent over an hour on the phone with their IT (in Iowa) to no avail. The rebooted all the access points and did everything they could remotely. The solution I was offered was to walk to the main office building where their \"business center\" was (4 pcs in a closet) and jack into the wall for several hours a night. I found that if I sat outside on the patio, I could get a reasonable connection.. I did one night of that, in Florida.. in summer...and my legs still look like a polka-dot farm of bug bites. The next day I called the front desk, talked to IT some more, and started lobbying for a new room. That evening, I got a visit from the operations manager. A very nice man who was trying to do everything he could to help me out. He took me to the only other available room, in a different building. Standing outside, 3-4 bars and decent speed... step into the unit (bldg 1300, 5th floor) and it's 1-2 bars and a 5 minute wait for Google. It was all he had, so there wasn't anything he could do. He was as nice as he could be, but if it doesn't work, it doesn't work. Back in the room, I pull out my tech-bag (I'm a professional nerd) and dug out 20ft of cat5 and my wireless travel router (doesn't everyone carry one with them everywhere they go?). The router can be switch into router mode, access-point mode, or client mode. For the remainder of the trip, i plugged the router into the wall outside, switched it to client mode, and ran the cat5 cable from it, under the door, and into my PC. I had to sit within the reach of the cable, but I was usually able to get a marginally reliable connection with the outside antennae. there was still one night and day where it was just plain down and had to be fixed (apparently, my calls to the desk had led them to call the local ISP for more bandwith, though that wasn't the problem I was having, and they horked it up for a day).", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "blytheville ar", "Title": "\u201cbest place my family has ever stayed\u201d", "Author": "bfdfirefighter", "ReviewID": "UR114938361", "Content": "first time i have ever done a review but i felt like i needed to, the place was very clean and our two room condo was very very nice. kids had there own room and my wife and i had our priviate room with a nice master bath just like the pics.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "usa", "Title": "\u201cKids loved the waterslide pool!\u201d", "Author": "pednurse", "ReviewID": "UR114848099", "Content": "Our stay was mid-June in the 400 building, 3 bedroom/2 bath.

The Room(s) Because there were 7 of us on vacation together (my wife, two kids, in-laws and sister-in-law), we rented two adjoining suites which were linked by an interior door that could be opened between the two suites. Both suites were equipped with a full kitchen, living/family area, bedrooms, bathroom(s) and a screened in porch area. The larger of the two suites contained two bedrooms and two bathrooms while the smaller suite contained only one bedroom and bathroom. Both kitchens came equipped with some dishware and flatware, a dishwasher, microwave, a coffee maker and a stove/oven. The larger of the two suites had a washing machine and dryer. On arrival, the rooms were very clean and in good order. The bathrooms were very clean and the shower in the bathroom my wife and I used worked very well. Be aware that the resort did NOT provide new towels on a daily basis, but we were aware of this fact from the beginning and the washer/dryer can be utilized for people who need a clean towel every morning. The only \"maintenance\" problem that we ran into with the suites was that several of the key-cards stopped working halfway through the week. The staff at was very helpful with this and got us new key cards immediately upon request. NOTE: The worst part of the resort were the elevators. They are UNBELIEVABLY slow and the one in our building broke down at least twice during our stay. Unless you have luggage, use the stairs. Location For those who do not wish to stay at the Walt Disney Resort or the Universal Studios Resort, this was a great location. The resort is located west of Orlando just off of Route 192 and is approximately 10-15 minutes from Walt Disney World and approximately 20-25 minutes from Sea World and Universal Studios. We had virtually no trouble getting to the parks and back again in the evenings although I will admit that we went during an \"off-peak\" time of the year and I suppose traffic could be heavier during other times of the year. We found the trip to and from the park to be quite reasonable. The resort has the feel of being \"off the beaten path\" but is still very closely situated to several shopping centers where you can buy groceries or clothing as needed. Amenities Truthfully, we spend almost all of our time at the Parks and only came back to the resorts to sleep. I will note that the resort had a very nice playground for children as well as some athletic areas (tennis court, basketball court). The nicest part of the resort is the small waterpark which is generally situated in the middle of the resort area. We went to the park in November and although the weather was beautiful, it wasn't really great swimming weather. We took the kids to the waterpark the first evening we arrived and they had a really great time. There was also a bar area for the grownups to get a drink while the kids played in the pool area. I know that there was a restaurant attached to the main building at the resort, however, we did not eat there and opted to either cook food in our kitchen or eat fast food. Overall I thought that the resort was a great place to stay and really worked to our advantage. We saved a lot of money by eating breakfast (and many of our dinners) at the resort instead of inside of the Disney Parks. As stated above, there are a number of shopping centers which are located in close proximity to the resort so that we could easily pick up groceries, ect... There are also a large number of stores which line Route 192 on your way into the parks where you can get Disney and Harry Potter souvenirs which are cheaper than those you will find in the parks.

I loved this place!. We had a 2 bedroom townhouse building 102D & after 3 busy days onsite at Disney, this was a great way to unwind & enjoy the Florida sun. We loved the Liki Tiki waterpark, the play park & all the amenities they offered. I was a little worried after reading some reviews, but honestly, this resort was amazing!. The kids loved the waterpark & the salt water pool near the central building was open until midnight.We rode the surry bikes. played mini golf & used the water pedal boats. They even have a little gator who like to hang out under the bridge by the play park. My kids thought he was awesome - but not so big that he was scary. The resort was so clean & well maintained. We chatted with a staff memeber who gave us lots of info on gators & the area. Everyone was very friendly & helpful. I noticed the resort was mostly families with smaller children. If you get a chance, eat lunch at shipwreck Sally's - awesome food & not too expensive. Although I highly recommend clients that are doing Disney, to stay at Disney, if you are looking for a great, clean & friendly resort that is only about a10 min drive to many attractions, this place is worth it. We found a Publix grocery store nearby & stocked up on breakfast & dinner stuff. We ate lunch at the waterpark because the food was so good. I would definatly stay here again, & trust me - I have seen many hotel & resorts in my +20yrs as a travel agent, this resort was really clean & well worth the money. Way to go Liki Tiki resort!

Out of all the resorts in Orlando, we chose this one. A vacation is just that, a vacation away from the day in and day out stresses at home. Repairs, isssues, dealing with people issues. Our first night was great and then we woke up for our first full day.....storm came through in a.m. and cleared out by 2pm. Tried to rent a bike (we paid fees in advance) and all rentals were closed. Water slides did not work and lots of repairs were taking place on property. These are things that stand out the second you have one bad experience. Same day, later in the afternoon we go down to grill (grills that we were told to use) and 2 of 4 would not light, egnitor broken. The other 2 were being used by 1 family....so, up I go to call again about my frustration (starting to feel like I am not on vaca). They send maintenance to light the grill. After drinking a couple glasses of wine I was able to relax. Day 2....we go out for the day and come back to make dinner and end the day with American Idol, NOT SO FAST! The hot water in the kitchen sink would not turn off...continuous flow. We shut it down from the main valve, and again!! called for maintenance. After 2 hours they replaced the faucet. I had enough at this point. My husband and I agreed that we wanted to check out the next day and go where we could enjoy what was left of our vacation! Talked to the Ops Mgr and after being told that it would be our choice to leave so no refund, I argued as any person would and finally after a long debate, he agreed to give the credit. As I stated in my \"Title\"....2 weeks and still NO REFUND on those two nights. When I called last Thursday (week after we left) the credit had not even been initiated! Now after being \"promised\" again for a credit (expedited) still NOTHING! I have left him another message! I have been a store manager for 15 years and honestly could not imagine what customer base I would have with this type of service! Beyond frustrated and definitely the worst experience I have EVER had and I paid for it!!!! They are doing nothing \"extra\" just simply (at some point) refunding for the 2 nights we DID NOT stay!

Check in was a quick but only because we told the girl at the parking permit/ timeshare hoopla we needed to go check in because I wasn't feeling well which was the truth. She was very reluctant to let us go and never showed any sympathy for my ill state, but that's ok no harm. If we had stayed to listen to her talk, it would have been much longer judging form the others in front of us. We had a 1 br 1 bath in the 700 building. Everything was renovated and the condo was clean. No signs of bug problems, but remember this was April not July. :) We had a very nice view of the lake and the balcony was peaceful and good sized. The bed was comfortable and the bedding was fine. The pull out sofa bed was new, in fact, I would say probably never slept on. Nice flat screen tvs in the living room and bedroom. They provided us with enough supplies (tp,soap, etc) to last us our whole stay of 6 nights. The only real negative of the condo was the adjoining door to the next condo. Yes, they have adjoining condos like some hotels do. I was quite surprised when we were sitting in the living room and could hear everything the people next door were saying! I mean they might as well have been in the same room as us. Which leads me to my observation... we got a great deal on this condo and so do most others that rent here so you may want to think about that as far as who you are renting with. I mean the clientele was not the most savory I must admit. Some families, but also some people who enjoyed drinking it up at the tiki bar and being very loud and obnoxious, Just an observation I made :) Anyway, the location is good because you have plenty of shopping close by yet you are not in the heart of the crazy traffic. The Sherberth Rd shortcut is a lifesaver for Disney. The amenities were a joke. The swimming pool with the slides was closed most of our stay and at least one or two slides closed the whole time. Things were faded and you could tell in need of some work. They do have lifeguards present which is a nice touch. The mini golf was just terrible and I think it must have flooded recently because it was wet and sand was washed up all over the green areas. One of the docks was sunk as well which was quite an eyesore. Since the water park pool wasn't working properly, we spent most of our time at the pool at the front office. It was nice and they had a small tiki bar and music playing. This is where we experienced the loud patrons that were seemingly quite inebriated. The pool was not terribly clean, but not terrible and the hot tub was being replaced while we were there so construction was going on which kind of squelched most relaxation. I know this is long, but I wanted to explain what we experienced because these are things I would want to know. We are not terribly picky people and I knew this would not be a 5 star resort when we got there, but some things don't have to be this way. Over all we had a good stay, but I do feel this \"resort\" is far from a resort and while they seem to be trying to upgrade some things they still have a long way to go before it meets the standards they are claiming. Maybe in a couple of years if they get everything upgraded. If you are wanting to stay here just for a place to lay your head between Disney parks, this place would be fine.

We were told this was the newer of the blocks. We stayed in 1411E, if you can request that room you won't be sorry. I just want to start by saying how wonderful this place was, after reading the negative reviews that may I say I stressed over so thank you for all of those nay sayers out there who obviously are extremely picky. Our condo was spotless, I couldn't even find a spec of dust anywhere like some people reported. It was nicely tiled with neutral colors, there were LCD tv's in each of the bedrooms and one in the living room. The master bedroom had an awesome shower, that had three shower heads one being a rain drop style. The second bedroom had two full size beds with a full bathroom next to it. The bathroom had a jacuzzi style bathtub with shower. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed from pots and pans to silverware. They also included dishsoap and garbage bags for your trash. Washer and dryer were behind two paneled doors with detergent. There was a little enclosed porch with a table so you could sit out. The view was nothing to write home about but we didn't care. We didn't use it at all actually. The staff was wonderful, from the gate security guards to the front desk to the actual maids you encountered from time to time. We did not encounter miserable workers like some had stated. Noone acted like we were bothering them at all. We felt safe because it was a gated resort, that they seemed to be very strict with who came in. The waterpark area, was wonderful!! It was on the smaller side, but it was perfect for my daughter (8) and my son (4). It didn't seem overly crowded and we were always able to get a lounger right up front. You didn't need to get up early and put your towels down, which by the way if you are not down there and you try doing that they will take your towels away and put them off to the side. We found that out, guess that's a no no. Which I can understand it isn't really fair. Like I said you really don't even need to do that. Sunday afternoon seemed to be the busiest there, they have a Dj that gets people movin and dancing. That was the only time you might have an issue getting a chair. Shipwreck Sally's was nice. Food was your typical, burger and fries. Full bar as well, with nice frozen drinks to sip on by the pool. Close to Disney, about a 10-15 min drive. I consider that close I guess, staying on the actual Disney property would have doubled our cost and for just a simple hotel room. Maybe we just lucked out, but we did not see one bug in our condo. The grounds were well maintained. We had no issue with our internet service it was not slow at all. Our room keys never failed us. Ohhhh and not ONE and I mean not ONE person talked to us about a time share. We had three messages the whole time we were there on our phone and they were inviting us to a Karoake night, fish fry, and to get a complimentary photo of our family. I have to say that we didn't pick up the welcome package at the front desk so maybe we would have encountered someone asking about a time share but some people said they had constant phone calls asking them to come to a seminar. Didn't happen to us. A couple we spoke to at the pool said they were asked once and when they politely declined that was the last time they were asked. We also were not charged any \"resort fee\" Unless it was bundled into our price, we were not charged any. All and all we had a wonderful time and plan on staying there again.

They have 2 pools, one is just a pool and the other is a mini water park. The water park was great! the black slide (which i rode about 50 times myself) was super fast! The water was warm and my 5 year old who was usually afraid of the water actually learned to swim at liki tiki! The 2 bedroom villa was huge! and CLEAN! No bugs,no dirty sheets nothing! It is NOT in the middle of nowhere either, it's just off route192 which is a major road loaded with places to eat, shop, and have a blast! I don't understand what people are talking about. Security was friendly, helpful and took their job's seriously. One in fact greeted me with \"welcome back\" every time i returned to ltv. The only real problem we had was at check in. After you check in they tell you to go to the desk behind you for your parking permit for the week. It's actually a time share thing and the rude girl behind the desk tried to get her to buy something and after my wife informed her that we were a low income family and could not afford a time share, the rude girl replied,\"well then you will be treated badly if you don't buy something here\" They will treat you bad if you don't buy a time share. Who say's that? The only other issue was the hot tub being closed for allmost our entire stay, but with a lot of teens there we only had one shot at the hot tub anyway. They tend to \"hog\" it. Ha ha...but anyway. Our villa was super clean and the a.c. was amazing as it was hot during our stay. Washer and dryer were great, the master bedroom was big and the bed was huge! we loved our stay in liki tiki and would go back tomorrow if we could. After reading some bad reviews before we left we were a little worried, but my wife called down there before we went and asked the girl if they had a bed bug problem and she was honest with my wife and did say they had a outbreak about 2 years ago but so did all of the resorts in florida. She assured my wife the rooms are inspected regularly and we believe they do. Overall our stay was amazing and liki tiki was an amazing place to stay! I highly recomend it to anybody. We paid $330 a person for air,and 7 day's in liki tiki and sea world and discovery cove( discovery cove was awesome, sea world was a rip off though) For the price we paid we got way more then we thought we would get.

Later on we asked the guard where we can get a good steak and some supplies. He was able to direct us to both and his directions were spot on. After this great time it then fell apart.

They made a big deal about a wave pool and We were told it was not working. The food was overpriced and tasted nasty. We got up in the morning to find a broken sprinkler drenching our car with water that smelled as if it came from a sewer. When We asked we were told it was reclaimed water.

Last year we stayed at the Marriott Harbour Lake (see my profile for review) near Seaworld, so I will use last years experience as a fair comparison. I stayed here by exchanging my owner week in Aruba. Location - A little off the beaten path, but pleasantly so. You could scoot \"around the corner\" on Route 27 North for Wal-Mart, Fast Food places, and a couple of sit down dinner joints without the heavy traffic of the Irlo Bronson between World Drive and Route 429. Convenient to Disney, not too bad to Seaworld as long as you realize time of day for traffic considerations on the I-4. Although you could probably travel \"surface\" streets to bypass the I-4 to get there (International Drive). Check-in - Way too long, just about a half hour, and on top of it all our room wasn't \"ready\". Amazing, another reviewer said they were rushing people to check out, but they certainly weren't rushing to check them in. After waiting a half hour (it wasn't busy at the desk either) to \"pre\" check-in, and being told a \"resort fee\" of $55 was mandatory (more on that later), they send you over to the \"concierge\" desk for your \"parking pass\", submitting you to a timeshare selling agent whom was quite persistent even when I said I had no interest in buying a timeshare at this property as I own a week in Aruba. I pretty much had to demand my parking permit. Do you really think that I am interested in buying into your resort when you treat your first timers / exchange customers like this? Not a good first impression, and there are no second chances. Finally got a room at 3:30pm, having to be reminded once that they had until 4pm to get us a room. Really? You have until 4pm? Not ONCE have I ever been denied a room in all my travels at 1pm and I certainly have NEVER been denied a room until a half hour before actual check-in. Every resort and hotel I have ever been to have always allowed a courtesy early check in, especially those that are \"fly-in\" locations. The Room - Decent size for a 1 bedroom, somewhat freshly painted, but with old TV's. Don't get me wrong, I don't care about TV's when in Orlando, but LCD's are pretty cheap these days, especially when buying in bulk. The bed in the bedroom was comfortable, although the furniture in the room could have used some updating (drawers didn't line up well). The bathroom was large and had a jacuzzi tub, a nice feature. The pull out sofabed in the living room was in poor shape. The mattress was very thin and one corner of the frame was no longer supporting it. It was good enough for my 4 yr. old to sleep on, but barely good enough. I almost called to get it replaced, but she only needed half of it to sleep on. There were adequate utensils and appliances, nothing spectacular. Everything passed muster with my wife as far as cleanliness, so that's something to be said for the housekeeping crew. We were on the 5th floor and had a view of the Florida scrub brush and swamp, which I thought was great. I felt as though I was overlooking the Amazon rain forest. Better view than some parking lot, street, or another building. The balcony was large, although it wasn't screened. Which could be a good or bad thing, depending on the person. Personally, we didn't use it much so we didn't care. The Restaurant - Shipwreck Sally's, we had our last meal from this restaurant. The food was very good and the price was reasonable. Didn't have any interactions with the staff (take out), so I have no other comments. The Pool(s) - The \"waterpark\" is a great idea. But there is one caveat. You better have child(ren) who can hold their own against against other children. When I say \"hold their own\", I mean they better be able to fend for themselves against the CHAOS that entails this complex. And please, I'm no prude by any stretch of the imagination, just honest observations. There were several life guards around the \"lagoons\", but NOT ONE at the top of any slide to stop children from piling up on each other (as kids would do). I stood right next to one slide and watched my 4 yr. old get run over by another child on her FIRST slide!! I had to jump in and \"rescue\" her, and she is a GREAT swimmer, until she gets \"wiped out\" and disoriented by a careless kid (as kids would be). I give credit to a life guard who saw this unfold, as I did, and was just a fraction of a second off of dad's reaction time of jumping in. This is a management problem, not a kid problem. Kids will be kids, but they need to be \"reeled in\" by some kind of authoritative figure, be it life guard or parent and it seemed neither were doing their job. The life guards were hesitant to apply most rules, save running on the pool deck (they ignored the kids running feverishly across the \"bridge\" or up the waterslide tower, go figure). Needless to say we immediately packed up our stuff and found the main pool (by check-in) to be MUCH quieter and conducive to a small child. There is one more pool on site that looked to be quieter also, although we rarely went over there. All were nicely heated and the main pool had good music on in the background. On the weekend late afternoons, as I walked through to get to our unit, I noticed that the waterpark get's INSANELY busy, raucous even. The problem with this resort, in my opinion, is that they rent to the general public and this resort gets \"top heavy\" on weekend nights with \"weekenders\". Nothing wrong with that concept if you don't mind, as a timeshare owner, your weekend nights being inundated with tons of people. Marriott Harbour Lake does not rent to anyone but timeshare owners and their family members (using guest certificates). There's no \"Summer Getaway\" or \"Central Florida Family Getaway\" available at Marriott as opposed to what is listed on the Liki Tiki website's main page. The Activities - An ABSOLUTE rip off. I, as I hope others did, got slammed into a \"mandatory\" resort fee. If the fee was \"mandatory\", as I was told, twice, then why is there pricing listed for all the activities? (Bicycles $12 - half hour, ect.) If EVERYBODY is paying the \"mandatory\" resort fee, then who is paying $12 to ride bikes? I was told that the fee was even included on those people who were booking rooms through Expedia, Travelocity, etc. The fee is for wireless internet (no desire or need for), basketball, tennis, paddle boats, bicycle surrey's, and mini-golf. But the activities \"shack\" was only open from 11am - 6pm !!! Who wants to do \"active\" activities or play mini-golf in the middle of 85 degree \"Sunshine\" Florida days? Don't show up 10 mins. early (wasn't paying attention to time) to the activities \"shack\", because some male employee sharply reminded the small crowd that, \"The activities shack doesn't open until 11am.\" That was the only time we tried to do any of the \"activities\". So they got $55 and I got squat for it. Although they had poolside activities like tattoos, painting shirts, ect., \"those\" activities cost extra of course. Go figure. Marriott Harbour Lake did NOT have this fee, at least not last year. Most activities were free, and the ones that were not were reasonably priced ($2 to paint a rubber ducky, ect.). Sad, because after dinner, and as the day was cooling, you would always think about doing an activity and yet the \"shack\" was closed up solid and promptly at 6pm Conclusion - Liki Tiki may very well respond to my review with a \"canned\" response as I have seen on other reviews, but don't let them fool you. Complaints about check-in have been numerous, and I still lived it. There have been complaints, longstanding, about the rooms needing updating, a fresh coat of paint worked nice, but the TV's are still badly outdated, as well as the sofabed and dressers. And instead of treating an \"owner\", albeit, an exchange owner, as an owner, I felt as though I was just another \"motel room guest\". Hell, an exchange owner is an excellent opportunity to steal business from another property. If I want to buy into your property, check me in quickly, don't slam me with \"fees\", and treat me like I own at your property. Then maybe I will seek out information to buy into your resort. At that point you would know you would have someone who is actually interested in the property, and not $70 worth of food vouchers to Shipwreck Sally's!! (That's what some guy by the pool bragged about getting for attending a sales pitch to which he knew he was absolutely not interested in beforehand).

There was ripped blankets on our bed. They had put one of the rags used to clean in place of a washcloth..GROSSS!!! Room was soo dirty. There was a nail sticking out of the siding right at eye level of my 1 year old. The sink had an awful smell in it the water was brown and smelled. The piping from the toilet to the wall was falling out! We rented a one bedroom unit and it had a full sized bed in it...the most awful bed I have ever slept in. The pillows were stained and flat.Dresser draws would not open or close without major work. Dishwasher smelled. We checked in on fri and realized on tuesday that there was heat coming out of our oven YUP it was on and NO we never cooked once in the whole time we were there!!!!! The walls are paper thin. Our neighbors TV kept us up at night...along with the generator. Could here the neighbors cough and sneeze even during the day. Dried urine and pubic hairs around the toilet. I wanted to throw up. The balcony door didnt lock so my 1 year old kept opening it and getting out on the patio on the 4th floor. Even after being told no by my husband on check in they still continued to call and ask us to do the timeshare tour...at 8 AM. we had to pay a 55$ resort fee at check in for the use of the pool and other activities and the wifi that i couldnt get to work for more than a few minutes here and there. On check out day it says 10 am check out. There was someone knocking at 845 am and she knocked really fast 3 times then let herself in I didnt have time to get from the bedroom to the door and there is maybe 7 steps in between. She said Oh its day you leave..I said WHAT? as I didnt know what she meant and she said you leave today yes? i said yes..AT 10 am I leave. she said they tell me come now you can leave now? I said NO 10 am I will leave and I closed the door in her face. We used a pack and play that looked older than me (29) and we called to have it picked up when we left and within 5 mins they were there to get it ( took 5 hours to get it!) guy came in and said I will break it down for you and I said well could you let me take the sleeping baby out of it first please. He was in such a rush to get out he knocked over all our luggage on the luggage cart said sorry 10 times and ran out. we were already to leave the unit at 925 and when we opened the door there were 2 men sitting there waiting to get into our room. They said Oh good they are leaving early we can get outa here early!! we left the resort and realized a few minutes down 192 we forgot our babies sippy cup in the fridge. so we turned around to get it. we found it in a trash bag outside the room my husband looked in and the room already had a made bed and towels and was ready to go for the next people.....IN A MATTER OF MINUTES...I dont think so! OK I am done now I need a vacation from this nightmare..ONLY one plus I got lunch by the pool one day and the girl working at ship wreck sallys was amazing. So sweet to talk with and very friendly and efficient. she helped everyone quickly and kept a big smile on her face while she cleaned and chatted with all the guests. wish I remembered her name. took the baby in the pool once but it wasnt made for a one year old. the kiddy pool was cold and empty all the time.

The couch was hard as a park bench and the pull out bed in it had a bare old thin as paper matteress on it. The old fashion t.v. was in the kitchen dining room so you have to look over the table to see it! Strange set up. Full size kitchen was nice but stocked very scarce. We also had a ton of dead bugs in the kitchen light. If they were trying to impress us with this so called 5 star resort, they failed big time! Maybe a .5 star resort! We had to change our room key 4 times because they kept becoming demagnitized! While we were down in lobby getting another new key, there was another person down there with the same problem. Couldnt use paddle boats because the seat top kept comming off! We got a quad bike and they said to stay off the sidewalks because they get in the way of people......so ride in the parking lot with the cars they said! We just laughed and went for a half hour ride with the cars. The miniture golf is so dated and non exciting the kids wanted to quit after 15 minutes. The game room consisted of a closet on the side of the building that was stocked with about 7 very outdated vidio games and a air hockey game. The whole time we were there, they were cutting down trees all day. Im not sure why but we had a big ol stub right by our entrance. The place just seems like it was nice years ago, but now it looks like they ran out of money or something and just did not keep up with the times. It also is kind of sucluded so you cant really walk anywhere. The pool was ok, nothing fancy. A couple simple slides but good size for all ages. Seemed like more of a drinking pool for adults than anything. But everyone was very nice here. And we got some nice pictures with the kids and the wooden tiki's they have scattered by the front. The beds were comfortable and they have a safe in the room which is nice. We didnt keep the sliding glass door open because there was no screen and the door sounded like it was going to fall off the rail!

We weren't owners or on a \"timeshare\" trip. We booked a 2 bedroom unit for $89 a night for 6 nights. The first comment would be a huge positive as we traveled down a day early to avoid a coming weather system. We called ahead and they said they were completely booked. We felt like we were talking to a call center, so we just showed up and asked and they were very accomodating. They set us up with the extra night and we checked in right at 4pm on a friday. A very minor sales pitch about discounted park and show tickets at check-in, but all I said was we were ok and that was all that was mentioned the entire stay. We got to our room in building 1200 in the north village and found it to be clean and comfortable. The furnishings were a dated style, but plenty comfortable for our stay. Beds and jet tub were great! The location within the resort was perfect for us and exactly what we requested when booking our reservation. Close to the main lagoon pool, but far enough away to avoid the night time noise of the bar and karoke. We ended up with not much view from the screened in balcony(even on the top floor), but we were more concerned about the night time noise. Buildings 700, 800 and 900 in the north village would have the lagoon pool view but would be extremely noisy most of the day from your balconies. We never used maid service as we did laundry in the included washer/dryer within the unit. Liki Tiki lagoon pool was much more than expected. Very large pool area and very well heated. Weather was warm during our stay, but I can imagine being comfortable hanging out in that warm water when it was much colder. Separate kids pool and many slides and activities for all to enjoy. This pool complex was more than expected, and has a bar with reasonably priced lunches and dinners and night time karoke. The staff from top to bottom was the best we've seen in the Orlando area. Everyone greeted you and wanted to know how your stay was, even owners at the resort approached us to make sure everything was to our liking. Other activities in the pool/lagoon area were mini golf, paddle boats, basketball, tennis, bike rentals, shuffleboard and fishing. These activities were free to us with our \"harbor fun card\" but I did see some guests pay cash for them. Not sure what the circumstances are with the activities being included or not, but we enjoyed all these extra benefits. There are also planned kids activities, reptile zoo night, movie nights and nightly scheduled activities in and around the outdoor bar. Internet was a potential issue, but I have a verizon wifi card and we used that all week for our internet needs. Service was a little slow in this location, but no real problem. Sprint phones worked fine too. We never tried or asked about the resort's internet service. Connections were available in the unit, but it didn't appear to be free(not sure). The resort location was farther west from the Disney area on 192 than we've ever really explored. I rather enjoyed this location, even with the 15 minute drive to Disney property. Plenty of restaurants, Publix and super Target within 5 minutes. Great Indian restaurant called \"Clay Oven\" is close by and is highly recommended! Minor issues were as follows: extremely slow elevator in building 1200, main lagoon pool closed way too early and opened way too late for a resort area(other resort pools had longer hours), dated furniture and decor. Bugs had been mentioned in previous reviews as a concern, but we didn't see any issues, although it was March not summer time. Please don't let any of these issues discourage you from staying, but I had to mention these in fairness to the review. Overall a wonderful stay with a wonderful resort.

We had a 2 bedroom in the 1300 building. I would like to point out that this building is the furthest from everything execpt the waterpark area.

It was on par with other higher end/new time shares we have been to. -People did not bug you to go to timeshare meetings--this was also nice. -Waterpark--this was actaully fun--we are all adults in our group but we all went to the waterpark and used the slide at least once. If you brought kids I am sure they would LOVE this feature (and one of the few features that was actually free). Negatives: -Too far from everything--it was a 10 minute walk to the gym, 6 minute walk to the lobby etc. I know it does sound like much but if you walk somewhere in the rain then realize you forgot something it gets annoying. -The gym was too small--there was always a wait to get on a machine. -I like to recycle and I found that people who do not want to put the effort in would never do it at this property. You have to walk to the main areas (waterpark, lobby, or other pool area) to recycle--It would be so easy to put some recycling bins in our building but it is not done. Furthermore the closest one to us got locked up after dusk--we found this out the hard way after lugging our recycling all the way there. -As we are not owners, (but already paid a fee becuase of this) many things were not included for us. There was a charge for the internet (I mean really the $20 a night hotel includes this), a charge for paddleboat, charge for the bikes, charge for minigolf etc etc. There was even a charge to use a BASKETBALL!

Note: Best food in the area was at Perkins Restaurant and Bakery (all around the area) - the closest one was on Highway 192 on the way to Disney World Drive. For us healthy eaters, Perkins has fresh asparagas, buttered brocolli, & fresh spinach as veggi choices on the menu. Another note: If you want cheap theme park tickets, Liki Tiki offers a great bargain - listen to their condo time-share promo (90 minutes) and you can buy tickets through them at really reduced prices.

I have a lot of postive comments about this place, one negative and a few advice comments. We stayed in a two bedroom/two bath unit. We had a decent sized master bedroom with a king bed, our own tv and a huge bathroom that had a large spa tub, a gorgeous glass shower and a closet in it. There was a small safe in the closet, a few extra pillows and an ironing board. I thought the pillows were very small in the master bedroom but there was a few more in the closet. Plenty of space. Our girls had their own bedroom with twin beds in it, their own tv, a decent size closet and a quick access to their own bathroom that had a strange shower in it, probably meant for wheel chair access, located in the hallway.. The bathroom was fine and large, but had no counter space at all. We just had to teach the girls not to soak the floor since there wasn't any walls in the shower. It did have a shower curtain. We thought the place was spacious for a family of four, a really nice dining area near the living area where they could turn the large tv around fi they wanted to. There was a tiny porch out back facing woods but nice enough for us, we liked having our own washer and dryer in the unit and the kitchen was stocked ok for you to bring in your own food and cook. We can't comment on grilling outside as we didn't try that and didn't want to get to the main level with food, etc. and have to travel back and forth from a grill. I will say there was only 1 tiny frying pan and no plastic glasses for children in the kitchen. Just large glass ware. There wasn't enough pot holders to get hot stuff out of the oven or microwave. We loved our building location as it was quiet, peaceful and an easy walk to the pool area. We stayed in building 1330E. IF, like us you don't want to hear loud music or the loud karoki at night by the pools, please check which building and where it's located at before checking in. A few buildings around the pools area would not be where we would want to stay. The pool - lagoons are a lot of fun for children, they were awesome and it wasn't crowded for us early in the day. It does get crowded quickly and then would be hard just to find lounge chairs but the pool - lagoons are so big they didn't seem to get too crowded with kids. There were life guards there and you do have to watch children near some of the slides. Plus you can order lunch right there by the pool and eat outside. Keep track of your towels that you take to the pool area and return them to your condo so your not charged for them. The only negative was that we saw a few roaches in our condo. So keep your suitcases closed. That is not too unusual for many places in humid, hot & sunny Florida. We know they clean the place well because we could see that it was clean and unfortunately smell bleach in the hallway when we went outside one day. There is a publix grocery store near by and using the toll road 429 will get you to Disney easily enough. Although the toll road can be confusing getting off and on.

Very nice room, large kitchen, nice bedroom with flat screen tv, huge bathroom with very small washer and dryer (but useful). I saw two bugs while I was there. Our whirlpool tub was clean my kid loved taking a bath. The living room was nice also with a screened in balcony. The pull out couch was great for my 5 year old but I would NOT want to sleep on it. The bed was nice but the pillows were pancakes so if you want a fluffy pillow run down the street to Target or walmart and buy a $5 pillow. The grounds were nicely kept and clean. One morning while waiting for mini golf to open I watched them wipe down all the paddle boats and sweep the golf course. The water park was great for my 5 year old but would see how a 10 year old might get bored. The life guards at the pool are truly guards they pace around the pool and look for kids in distress. Great job to the life guards!! As for the people that say the place is run down...I did see some of the villas in the center were older but the 3 villas across from us were getting an upgrade, we watched as they emptied them and started to rip out the carpet, etc. We had lunch at Shipwreck Sally's twice...it was good but only bar food. Great for a quick snack while at the pools. All the pools were heated, even the waterpark which was a nice touch. November was a great time of year to visit as the parks (were to both Universal and Disney) neither had long lines....the longest thing we waited for was the new Harry Potter ride (20 minute wait). The Disney Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party was tops...the fireworks were the best I ever seen. The Village is far enough away from the parks (about a 12 minute drive to Disney) and about a 25 minute from Universal.

There is a lot of pressure to sign up but as long as you are strong willed you can get in and out and not let the pressure get to you.

We received a harbour pass when we checked in that gave us free access to many activities including paddle boats, shuffle board, mini golf, tennis, basketball, etc. The only thing it didnt include was bike rentals. Which was only $12. The water park is great for children of all ages. My kids were 8 and 13 and enjoyed it. I saw many younger kids enjoying it as well.

Room: The room was a bit dated (kids loved the mirrored walls) but it was incredibly clean and well stocked. It was nice to have a washer and dryer you didn't have to pay for. The pull out couch bed was not comfortable but our three and five year old didn't complain. The master bed was great. My major complaint was it was really noisy, but I think that had to do with the fact we were on the ground floor and right by the elevators so all the noise was from people coming back late at night and waiting for the elevator. My other complaint was they changed for wifi, seriously? Pool: The kids loved it, it is geared for pre-teens and younger. It was chilly the week we were there but its heated so the kids could still swim. For the comments of having to pay for the pool, there was not charge for the water park or the pool or hot tube. They did charge for boats, mini golf (the course is tiny but there are some great mini golf places down the street starting at $3.99/ with coupon) and bikes. Staff: Wonderful! Breakfast: Nothing special, but enough to get you started for the morning. Final thoughts, we'll stay there again.

That night we noticed several small bugs in the room including roaches. When we woke up Sun morning my wife noticed several blood spots on the sheets in our room,we noticed even more blood spots on the kids sheets when we woke them up. What is even worse is that those blood spots hadn't come from us and, as confirmed by the head of housekeeping, appeared to be relatively fresh and had not been through the wash. It was very upsetting to watch the staff remove all the bedding that we just slept on wearing protective gloves. We complained and were moved to the 1200 building, fourth floor. This room appeared much cleaner and newer. That night however, every time we woke up to use the bathroom we found at least one, inch sized, cockroach somewhere in the master bathroom. I was able to kill several but some escaped through a tiny gap in the wall at the base of the shower door. When we woke up the next morning, my older daughter had well over one hundred bites all over her body and she was itching like mad, my wife and I had several bites also, these turned out to be bed bug bites. After complaining again, they attempted to move us to the 1300 building, but we had friends staying in the owner suites who hadn't had any problems yet so we convinced them to move us there. After we were there we didn't have any further problems, but unfortunately the damage was already done. We spent the first two nights there looking for and worrying about what else we were going to find, and every morning my daughter seemed to have more and more bites on her.

That was what we got, in the 900 Block, very close to the water park. The Apartment was a great size and equipped with what we needed. Everything was clean and presentable. The Boys shared one bedroom, we had the Master which came with a Spa Bath, which the Boys used more than us... The waterpark was great for the youngest and our eldest enjoyed it too. The other pools were cooler and less crowded. We had fun in them all. As the resort is right along US 192, near the junction to US 27, you will need a car. We picked the place because we knew where it was and wanted to be away from all the crowds, but still only 10 minutes by car from Disney's World Drive.

We were accommodated in building 500 which was clean, tidy and well maintained. There is a communal swimming pool located in front of the block which also serves block 400 and 600. This wasn\u2019t a major issue to start however as our holiday progressed the noise from the pool became ever more irritating as it is open until midnight.

Although safe, I was not happy that she can access the balcony and front door without our knowledge in the early hours.

My biggest gripe was that the water park pool bar advertised that it was open until 10pm, unfortunately it closed at 8.30pm. admittedly, we were about the only people in the bar using our vouchers but the facilities were great \u2013 baby area, baby slides (although a little fast for a three year old) and somewhere to eat and drink which was a nice break from the parks.

The continental breakfast is not really worth the trip, we went once and not ever again during our stay, but free is better than nothing I guess. My only complaint is that the rooms are not very sound proof.

I traveled with my boyfriend and two teenage girls. I booked this resort, WITHOUT reading the reviews and I really wished I had read them all before I booked. I chose this resort because of the \"waterpark\". If you have children 10 and under, then I would recommend this waterpark, but if you have children over 10, then they will be bored out of their minds. It is definately made for smaller children. The water didn't go past my waist. A few small water slides and other water attractions will keep the little ones happy for a long time. There were life guards which was a nice addition. I can't comment on how crowded it was because we were there only once. The other \"pool\" was small (for a resort that size) and the water was soooo warm. If you wanted to cool off, you were better off getting into the outdoor hot tub, I'm not kidding. Left me wondering if they ever put fresh water into the pool. I also booked this resort based on the PICTURES shown on their web site of what the rooms look like. But, beware, you will have to FIGHT to get those rooms. I booked a 2 bedroom 2 bath, paid in full through their web site. (***important to note that, because they will ask you who you booked it through***) When I arrived, I was told that those rooms were all booked and I had been given a \"newly remolded room\" in the older section. I asked if it was the same as I booked and was told it was. So, all of us carried our luggage into building 103. This place was NOTHING like what you see in the pictures. It was two levels, with the living room, small kitchen with a table in it and a full bath downstairs and two bedrooms and one bathroom upstairs. The master bathroom did NOT have a hot tub, nor did it have a flat screen tv (as advertised). The 2nd bedroom had two twin beds and thats it. No second TV as adverstised. The living room had one small flat screen up in the corner. I was furious, so I went back to the check in area and voiced my complaints. Again I was told there were no other rooms available. I stood firm and after speaking with THREE different people and telling them I wanted my money back if I could not get the room as pictured, they *poof* found a room. Funny how that works, isn't it? I kept asking them, why did they only have pictures of the NEW rooms, and not the old ones, but no one could answer that. I really felt like it is false advertising on their part. If they know in advance when you are BOOKING and PAYING for your room that the newer ones are all full, why don't they have some sort of disclaimer on their web site stating you may not get the room pictured and actually have pictures of the older ones? At least you would know what you might get, and if you didn't like it, you could cancel BEFORE they took your money! After the long flight, getting lost on the way to the resort, and fighting for our rooms, it was so nice to finally be able to go and unpack. Once we got the the rooms, it was very much as pictured, except there are NOT flat screen tv's in every room. You have two little tv's in each of the bedrooms. The stools for the breakfast bar were torn and although the living room furniture looks nice, it is the most UNCOMFORTABLE furniture to sit on. It was really disheartening to know that after a long day, we were coming back to the most uncomfortable furniture. We did not get any maid service, nor clean towels during our week. They do provide laundry and dishwasher soap, so we were able to wash clothes while we were there. The dryer did take forever to dry the clothes. We also got daily calls with the list of \"activities\" pool side every day, even after I told them I had two teenage girls who would not be interested in them. We also were called every day to sit in for their 90 minute breakfast and we would receive $80 for the \"restaurant.\", by the waterpark that we weren't going to. I kept telling them no, but they kept calling every day anyway. Would I recommend this to a friend? Only if they had small children and if they are prepared to the fight to get the room that is pictured. P.S. If you are driving to the resort from the airport, their mailing address is 1777 Bali BLVD Kissimmee, FL. Their ACTUAL address is Winter Garden, FL.

My husband and I traveled from PA with our 2 young children and my parents. Based on reviews, I was nervous to open the door!! My first impression was \"ok, this isn't soooo bad.\" It appeared to be clean and somewhat updated (we were in a townhouse style in the 100 block). It was spacious enough and had a nice screened in porch. To simplify, I will list Pros and Cons: Pros: The water park! My kids loved it! It was sometimes crowded but I found the lifeguards to be on top of everyone and it helped squash any rowdy behavior (unlike at the other pools in the resort). The staff was helpful with whatever we asked for. We were only a short drive from the Disney theme parks - maybe about 15 minutes. It was inexpensive - we utilized my sister-in-laws timeshare exchange so we got the room for a steal! Cons: The room was not as clean as I would have liked. After settling in, we realized there were some small bugs crawling around in the kitchen. I tried to keep in mind that this is typical for FL in August, but it started to creep me out after awhile. I would suggest buying some Clorox wipes and doing a once over on the counters, toilets, tubs, etc when you get there. This helped me feel a little better, I guess! Don't expect daily maid service. I read after I left that we could have exchanged towels on Wednesday by coordinating with the desk, but when I asked the lady who came in for our Wednesday \"cleaning\", she barely spoke english. I feel this should be automatic, but we washed our own mid-week. The \"cleaning\" consisted of emptying bathroom trash and making beds... kind of pointless in my opinion, but oh well. Aside from the pools, water park and play ground, none of the other amenities are free. You'll pay for mini golf, bikes, and paddle boats. I found the grounds around the water park to be littered with trash - that should be addressed by the resort. It looks horrible. And the water park pools looked pretty dirty by the end of the week. Oh, and one other thing... keep in mind that this is a timeshare resort. They WILL try to sign you up for a presentation when you get there by telling you it's a free buffet style breakfast with the option to buy discounted theme park tickets at the end. I was exhausted and agreed when checking in at 10pm (I also had to hand over a $20 deposit for my \"ticket\" purchase). The next morning we asked to cancel the breakfast reservation and get our money back. We had to go down the street to get our deposit back. My husband is a no BS kind of guy and made it VERY clear we weren't interested and got our money back. However, if you want to avoid a run around, tell them you've already purchased your tickets (even if you haven't) and stand your ground! That is, unless you don't mind spending a whole morning listening to one of their presentations. My husband and I agreed that while the resort could have been much worse, it definitely could have been better! But again, you get what you pay for and we paid very little! After previously staying at the Marriott, we realized that this resort was not our best option. By the time we rented a van, paid for tickets and parking, gas, food, etc, etc... we probably could have stayed on Disney property for just a little more.

The waterpark was really cool- but very overcrowded for the amount of guests staying there. I figured since the place was renovated earlier this year, that everything would be great! Wrong! It began with the resort knowing that my reservation had not been payed for (1-800-HOTELS went bankrupt- but that's another story) and not telling me until Thursday so that of course I had to pay again without the courtesy of making that decision at check-in. I went to relax in the jacuzzi and found myself in a pool of dirt! Even after the hotel staff did a cleaning, the jets were still putting out dirt. Oh well- so no jaccuzzi. Don't count on the continental breakfast. One other reviewer was right when they said tiny bagels and large fig newton. Wow, that's worse than many lower star hotels. They should save the change and use it towards more important things. The fitness center has 2 machines in it. The only one on site restaurant was more expensive than a dinner at Disney for four.

My 3 year old daughter began showing tiny bups on her arms 5 days into our stay. They progressed to inflammed red soars all over her arms, face, and legs.

Yes, the straight line 3 bites in a row was what she was showing. Then my son, husband, and I also began showing bites. Doctor confirmed that's indeed what it was. She has over 200 bites on her.

When we arrived, we originally were given a handicap accessible room in the 1200 building. The handicap showerhead was broken and the carpets were badly stained in this room. I called down to the front desk and was switched to the 800 building. Everything in the 800 room was brand new and the carpets were clean. Our room had a full kitchen and included a dishwasher. It was stocked with soap for the dishwasher and for the sink. The washer & dryer also came with soap to use. We were on the 2nd floor facing the pool and we had a balcony (without screens so the bugs would eat you alive if you stayed out there for long). I went over the counters and drawers with a lysol wipe and it came up clean with no dirt. The waterpark pool was awesome. My five year old really enjoyed herself. The entire waterpark pool was not more than four feet (and less feet in other areas of it) so it was very easy for a small child to navigate. Most of the slides were moderate and there was one bigger slide that my little one loved. Close by, was an even smaller baby pool that had a sprinkler type of octopus. I have never seen more vigilant lifeguards on duty in my life. They really did a great job at supervising the pool area. Each room is given 6 beach towels for use at the pool, but you must wash the towels yourself and be responsible for it during your stay. The pool area also has scheduled activities each day of the week for the kids and the adults. We ate and had drinks at the restaurant by the pool. The specialty dinners were reasonably priced and tasted good. The frozen drinks were awesome. I thought for Florida, the price of the drinks were a bit high ($8). The hotel is located within close proximity to the Disney parks. One of the hotel reps in guest services told us a shortcut to get to the parks using toll road 429. That was a definite time saver. When we checked in, we were asked if we were interested in attending the timeshare presentation and we declined. There was no pressure at all after we said no and we never received any follow-up calls to attend (thankfully). We also received a Harbour pass to do activities at the resort, but we ran out of time. The hotel has boats and bikes to rent, minature golf, a playground for kids, etc. If you have any problems or need supplies, you just dial zero and they will take care of you. I requested fresh towels on a day that they do not do towel exchanges and I was accommodated. We needed more toilet paper and garbage bags; it arrived within five minutes of the request and they even did a follow-up call to make sure it got there & that we were satisfied. All of the wakeup calls that I requested came on time. I was surprised that the resort charged to use the internet. It cost $7.99 a day or $29.99 for the week to use the internet. I used the business center once while I was there and Jesaida at the front desk was very helpful. The Publix, Walgreens, Denny's, and 7-11 with a gas station were all close by. The hotel also offers free continental breakfast on weekdays; the food was basic, but for free you cannot complain about it. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again.

The rooms were extremely spacious and at a very good price. It was nice to have three flat screen tvs to enjoy. Service was great. When we called for extra coffee and trashbags, they were delivered within ten minutes both times. The lifeguards were awesome at the pool. They kept a constant eye on all the kids and even jumped in twice to help little ones who were struggling after using the slides. The front desk personnel were very helpful and we too received a free harbor pass, which we never got around to using. Kevin at the front desk was helpful in getting my boarding passes printed off before we flew home, as the business center printer was not working. Security on site was a plus too. My kids loved the lagoon (kids' pool). They wanted to swim more than they wanted to go to the parks. The downside is that the lagoon area closes at 8:00pm. The Cons- Our condo was a little dirty. There was (a small amount of) mold in both showers and both toilets. There were dirt smudges on several of the walls. I thought I had read the 1300 rooms had the nice marble countertops in the kitchen but ours were basic (maybe it was the 1400 rooms?). We could easily hear the neighbors on either side of us...who were extremely loud during the day. Because they quieted down at bedtime we didn't call to complain. One night they cooked something that smelled awful and the smell came into our condo and reeked up the whole place. The worst part was the mosquitoes. I'm used to a few mosquitoes in the room, it is Florida after all. But we had dozens and dozens of mosquitoes. We called the front desk who sent an off-site company to spray the next day. When we got back from the parks there were dozens of dead mosquitoes all over the counters (gross). Later that night, there were dozens more in our room. We finally figured out to plug the drains in the tubs and that seemed to help. The pool at the clubhouse had a lot of bugs in the water, like it hadn't been skimmed for a few days. My kids, who are not picky, refused to swim in that pool a second night. Overall it was a lot of space for a low price. We did get asked to attend a time share presentation but I politely said no thank you. We received calls daily from the front desk asking us to attend their presentations, but we just deleted the messages. If/when we return to Orlando, probably in 2012, I'll consider the Liki Tiki, but I can't 100% say for sure that's where we'll end up.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cOwner - Interval Int'l\u201d", "Author": "buminthesun66", "ReviewID": "UR63833965", "Content": "Very nice.

The building and the property in general was very quiet. The check-in process was very quick. Their security at the front gate is very pleasant and always say \"welcome back\" to the resort with a smile.

Other nice feature is the internet service is free for owners and has pretty good wireless signal. My complaints about Liki Tiki would be the following: They now hit you up for a 20 buck deposit for your appointment for a \"tour\". I suppose you could just say NO! but we were tired and for 20 bucks it was worth it to shut them up. You get it back if you show up for you appointment. We never did show up for the tour appointment and they did call to reschedule but when we didn't show up the 2nd time they never called again. 2nd complaint would be that they don't keep the pool bar \"Ship Wreck Sally's\" open late enough. 9PM is tooooo early in my opinion and 11PM would be more reasonable. They weather was chilly at night but owner pay a fair buck for maintenance and taxes for this resort so they could be open later. JMHO. 3rd complaint is they need better pillows they are just horrible! Bring your own. Last complaint have more than one movie night. They have it one night \"Monday\"..seems rather silly. Not really a complaint for me but some day that giant step to make it into the tub could be troublesome some day. Too high from the floor.

The prices were $27.50 an adult and around $17.50 for children.

They had mini golf, a playground, paddle boats and bike rentals, tennis and basketball and a small game room. There were 3 pool areas which were all great of course the pool with the waterslides was more packed but never felt too busy and there was a bar and restaurant there as well. The only thing is if I go back I would want to stay in a room closer to the waterslide pool because the unit we were in which was in the 500 building was a little far away from that pool and all the other activities. There were lots of restaurants, grocery stores, and a Super Target close by but it was a little drive to anywhere else. There was one thing I did not like about the room itself was the rooms did not have high locks on the doors so my little 3 year old was just big enough to be able to open any door and unlock the deadbolts. It made me nervous to be cooking and think maybe he would get out on the patio from the master bedroom and climb on a chair and fall over because there is no screen for protection or to think he could of done the same thing at the front door and head down the hallway.

The pools, hot tub and all of the daily activities that are called to your voice mail a day in advance were nice advantages to the resort.

It is located in a gated resort. I'd recommend it for a a place to stay in the Orlando/Kissimmee are as it is a great place to stay for families. It is appx. 15-25 mins. from Disney depending on the traffic. Which, at certain times of the day is very busy. There are several apartment style buildings and some cottage style units. The newer units are the apartment style buildings. Most, if not all units have kitchens. There are two pools. One with a waterpark and one without, but the one without does have a hot tub in the pool area and is also located right beside the fitness center. The one with the water park has a bar/grill. The other does not. It is best if you can get a room near the pool with the waterpark or possibly in between it and the main building. They do sell timeshares for the units here and you will be asked if you want to sit through a timeshare presentation for a discount on your room or some other perk. They are not pushy and a simple \"no thanks\" and you are left alone from that point forward. The only complaint I have about the Liki Tiki is that the main pool closes around dinner time, and there is ABSOLUTELY no nightlife. (Although on one of our stays they held a Hawaiian Luau. But even that ended around 8:00. Btw, I would highly recommend buying tickets to this if they have it while you're there.)", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cComfortable with family. Things I wish I knew before arrival.\u201d", "Author": "graciediane", "ReviewID": "UR53677092", "Content": "Overall, we enjoyed the Liki Tiki Resort. Our 2bd/2bth unit was very spacious. 1 king bed, 2nd bedroom had 2 full sized beds, & living room had sofa/bed we never opened. Laundry in the unit & a full kitchen. The outdated decor is not that bad. It's Florida \"Golden Girls\" style. The counters are peach-colored laminate which I can imagine people dislike. The unit was clean overall, but had signs of wear. We got a great package price so we didn't mind little scuffs on walls or chipped paint on the occasional corner, etc. We visited during Orlando's longest \"cold snap\" and it took over 24 hours for our heater to start working, but we lived. What I wish I had known before arrival: 1) Paper Towels, Toilet Paper, Shampoo, Bath Soap, toothpaste, Dish soap & laundry soap is provided in your unit. I spent money mailing these items ahead of time so I wouldn't have to shop our first night. 2) The sneaky Time Share sales pitch is presented to you upon arrival. The check-in attendant sends you across the desk to pick up your \"parking pass\" -which is really their opportunity to \"invite\" you to the time share tour. They mask it as a complimentary \"warm breakfast\" tomorrow morning. Don't fall for it, please. Unless you actually WANT a time share. After traveling all day with an exhausted family and a wet baby waiting in the car, I told the woman to \"STOP, STOP, STOP\", \"Please don't waste another second, I am completely NOT interested in anyway.\" (yes, I was a little rude, but it got me out of there quickly) Plus, there's a million people selling off their time shares. If you really want one, buy it resale and save a fortune. 3) Crib, Pack & Play is an extra cost. $7 per day, or $30 a week + tax. If I had known this ahead of time, I probably would not have picked this location. 4) The Resort has TONS of Activities they don't advertise on their website. Upon arrival, I learned about Movie Night, Kids Kamp, Daily Bingo, Family games. Unfortunately we did not get a chance to enjoy these because all the activities were scheduled when I had planned for something else. I'm a MOM, and MOMS plan vacations. PLANNING in advance is what moms do. If I had known about MOVIE night in advance, we would have done that. If I had known about the KIDS KAMP on Tuesdays and other activities. We wouldn't have spent $350 on a theme park for that day. IMO, they should list that on their website so visitors can plan to enjoy those things. 5) Smoking is allowed on your private balcony / porch. You may not be a smoker, but my husband is still a smoker. Obviously nobody smokes indoors anymore, but vacationers want a place to smoke outside that is comfortable. This resort doesn't force you to exit the building and walk 30 feet away where people gawk or give you a disgusting look. You can comfortably smoke on your private balcony without bothering anyone. That was nice. 6) Paddle boats, mini golf, fishing are extra cost. $25 per day with a family harbor pass or $50 for a full week. We got a 1 day pass and enjoyed the resort. The next day while visiting the playground, the person at the mini golf gave us a free game so we left a nice tip in the tip jar. 7) There's an internet charge per day or per week + tax. We didn't bring our laptop on this visit so it wasn't an issue. But, if you do bring a laptop the Wi-Fi is about $8 a day. Other things to know before you go: You'll need to make your own bed here, but you won't be bothered by a daily maid which was great and very relaxing. The jacuzzi splashes a lot. It was too cold to enjoy the pools, so the kids appreciated their own little water park tub. The full kitchen has everything you need for making meals. The nearby Publix & Super Target are overpriced, but I wasn't going to waste a day looking for cheaper markets. This resort is the farthest away from the Universal area or International drive. Only about 10 minutes from Disney entrance. This resort is located on the farthest side of Westbound 192 in a different county. Expect to drive a lot. If you don't have a rental car you don't want to stay here. The employees give you lots of privacy & are very helpful. Just stay away from the guest relations desk to avoid the time share sales pitch. We enjoyed our weekly stay here and hope you'll enjoy your stay too.

We have two boys aged 10 and 13 and they really enjoyed all the activities on offer which are free with a Resort Pass card which you are given when you check in. The water park pool kept them busy for a morning but it was a little cold the second time they tried it. They preferred the main pool with the hot tub as it was warmer and the older kids tended to hang out there. There are so many activities for sporty children to get involved in, e.g. paddle boats, mini golf, bikes, tennis, basketball. They really enjoyed the basketball and often got involved in games with other children. The 2 bedroom apartment was ideal. It was spacious, clean and well equipped. The main bedroom had a kingsize bed and a wonderful spa bath. The boys room had plenty of space and they had their own TV. The kitchen had a large fridge, microwave, hob and an oven big enough to cook the christmas turkey. There was a slight lack of kitchen equipement but enough to get by with a bit of improvisation! The washing machine and tumble dryer were really useful too. We got a good rate from Travel Republic, but watch out because if you contact the resort direct you get a much higher rate. The resort is in Kissimmee and there are supermarkets, restaurants, golf courses nearby but you do need a car as everything is driving distance away. It is about a 10 min drive to Disney and 20 to universal. The staff were generally helpful, but there was a bit of a hard sell on check in to attend a 'free' breakfast to hear about timeshare. After a long flight we were not really wanting to hear about this, we just wanted the room keys.

The resort itself would be perfect for a family with toddlers. The \"waterpark\" is quite entertaining and ideally designed for the little ones. I must say I was very impressed with the lifeguards who kept a close watch on everyone. The only drawback is that this pool is right near the restaurant so you would continually hear the loudspeaker blaring out that someone's order was ready. We were pleased to find 2 other pools which were much less populated. The one had piped in music and the other was a small pool near the workout room. The workout facility was quite disappointing but had no problem getting in as very few people seemed to take advantage of it. The breakfast is somewhat embarrassing and I do not know why they waste their time with it. I would suggest an ice cream social or some other such activity and skip the mini bagels and granola bars. The elderly folk seemed to appreciate the instant oatmeal! We stayed in the 1400 building which had been refurbished. It had the granite countertops which everyone seems to sing about. The beds were comfortable and the screened porch overlooked the neighboring resort which was fine by us. No complaints with regard to the unit itself.

In addition, we concluded that we could have spent the entire week just at the facility using the pool and other amenities and would have experienced a great vacation. The facility succeeds at giving the impression that one is indeed at a leisure resort. Upon entrance to the check-in area, I looked around and the atmosphere had an air of professionalism and also a sense of leisure. The desk attendant assisting us was in training but managed well to get us checked in. He performed as if following a checklist that made me felt as if management wanted guest to get all the necessary information required to have a great stay. Upon check-in completion, we met with a Concierge. The concierge provided valuable information about the facility, surrounding restaurants, saving coupons for dining, and suggestions for making the best of our time in the Orlando area. It is amazing how helpful this can be since one can never be over informed when visiting an area for the first time. We stayed in a townhouse or condo like building that was the initial building since the facility began operation. The building was a four townhouse complex building. Although the building was old, it was fully furnished, very clean, spacious, and adequate. We had a king size bed in the master suite and two full size beds in the other bedroom. The kitchen was a full sized kitchen and we prepared many meals with ease providing good meals and avoiding additional cost for dining out. The townhouse included cable television with many channels to include about three premium channels. The townhouse had a flat screen television and one other television that was an older type model television. We were next to the lagoon and the major water park area.

I should have known at check-in when we were greeted by a very unpleasant front desk \"staff\" that had a very bad demeanor. They were wearing dirty uniforms and innapropriate language for a childrens resort. The front desk counter was extrememly high and unwelcoming as the staff could barely see over it to check us in....It was filthy and dreadful...It reminded us the movie \"The shining\". There were even holes in the wall. We looked at 3 rooms before giving in to just staying there as it was 10pm and the kids were exhausted. Each unit was so dreadful that they had given us that I almost cried because it was unconsonscionable to think that kids would have to sleep in that place. The cleanliness was severe and horrendous!!!!! The bathrooms were so FILTHY...not because I am so particuliar but there was dust and hair stuck to the floor and there was clearly dried urine on one of the toilet seats. The master bathroom had mold growing from the shower and when I asked to get house cleaning to come and take care of this dreadful situation I came to find that as soon as we turned the shower on we were standing in pieces of mold....I was going to vomit! The doors were so dusty that the air conditioner was moving the dust back and forth and that has to be a hazard to anyone with any sort of health condition...GROSS! Each and every unit that we saw had so much soiled and staining on the dining room chairs and couches that my children were not allowed to sit on them....#1 we had a fear of what the staining was and #2 we had a fear of ruining our clothes. The couches were so dirty that in one unit when we opened it up there was still food left in it from the previous guest. The coffee table was moved so we can open the bed and we found money and food and wrappers....clearly it was not vacuumed because the money would have been gone!!! My kids were required to wear shoes during our visit. Moving on to the bedrooms...the dust was so incredibly disgusting and the hair that was on my sheet (wavey and black) I have long and blonde hair really skeeved me out!!!!!!! My son slept on the couch bed and up until the last day I did not realize he was literally sleeping on a spring...poor baby! HORRIFYING ROOM!!! I almost forgot to mention that when we called for additional (white) towels they came with random hairs folded into it neatly in a plastic bag!!!! We should have ran but didn't! Moving on to the pool area....are you ready....STAY AWAY!!!! The tiki's are all missing the heads they have corroded off the tiki's and they are so neglected. The pool has sprinklers and they are all rusted....The concrete going into the pool was black.... two words...DIRTY & HEINOUS! There is only one place to get food during the day which is at the pool/bar area...soooo dirty and undesirable. The pool staff was so loud and obnoxious and the activities area for the kids was so filthy. My daughter got a cut at the pool area and we asked the lifeguard for a bandaid...guess what....YEP NO BANDAIDS!!! The management was so unhelpful but AGREED that it was a disgrace...big help that did for me while I am on vacation at their resort!!! The room was old and poorly maintained!!!! I thought it would be a nice experience to change resorts but NO THANK YOU....I am staying at the beautiful clean and welcoming VISTANA SHERATON RESORT FROM NOW ON. Oh I almost forgot the fitness center was a complete disaster...very old and dangerous machines...from the look of the resort I would not trust the ancient looking eliptical machine!!!!! We stayed away and out as much as we could due to the nature of the circumstances we did not have much of a choice. feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

In fact it is on the Western end of the 192, only 5 miles from Disney, close to the end of the 192 that is rapidly replacing the Kissimmee end of the 192 as the main tourist drag, so you are well located for family restaurants and tourist stuff. It is set back off the highway which makes it ideal in many ways. The hotel itself is an older apartment/resort hotel complex, probably dating from the early '90s, which has been taken over and renamed. Rooms are being modernized (they need it) so make sure you get a refurbished unit. We stayed in a 2 story apartment in block of 4 apartments. The rooms were large and the apartment well appointed, including the kitchen. You don't get daily maid service but it suits self catering vacationers. Each of these apartments has an outdoor screened patio. Unfortunately, many of the guests sit out on their patio way into the night, drinking and getting rowdy. It can be a bit intimidating with screen doors slamming and music into the early hours. The complimentary breakfast is a joke. You queue up in a line to receive a small donut or mini bagel doled out onto paper plates and help yourself to coffee and creamer. That's it. One or two steps up from a soup kitchen and the serving staff behave the same way. Avoid at all costs. The pool is nothing like it appears in the photos - it is crowded, noisy and a bit tired. Think Butlins, beer and chips (if you are British) - that's the pool, but then a good proportion of the guests are obviously happy with that kind of facility. The check-in staff were very courteous although you quickly get handed over to \"Guest Services\" who immediately try to sell you time share (the resort is now owned by a time share vacation company). The \"welcome pack\" consists of a few photocopy sheets of paper. Internet access costs you $30 for a week. Our advice: Use the Liki Tiki as an apartment hotel for its good location and forget the facilities. It's still good value. The new owners are slowly doing it up and it would be no surprise if the clientele gradually moves up market. In the meantime, if you don't mind a packed and noisy pool and mini bagels then you'll probably enjoy the Liki Tiki very much.", "Date": "August 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Augusta SC", "Title": "\u201cCould not pay me to go back\u201d", "Author": "yankees0308", "ReviewID": "UR38486529", "Content": "The beds are small, they say they are queen but they really are full, i took the measurments and measured my queen bed and didnt come close.

The waterpark is staffed with several lifeguards and that is comforting with small children. The slides are geared more towards young children but it was fun for even the adults. I would highly recommend a villa on the second floor or higher. We had a 8\" snake in our first floor villa and ended up getting moved to a 4th floor villa. The units vary from early 90's decor to brand new updated furnishings. The restuarant Shipwreck Sally's was fairly decent and not too overpriced. There were activities beginning at 10am each morning and they called your unit with a recording of the day's activities, which was very convenient.

It was just as good if not better than last year. The room was immaculate and had a lovely clean smell. Towels and even the kitchen rolls were arranged in fan shapes! Good facilities with full kitchen, washer, dryer. They even provide wash cloth, tea towel, a couple of sachets of coffee, 2/3 dishwasher sachets and washing soap. There were 8 bath towels, 4 hand towels and face cloths. Four of the bath towels are to be used for the pool (peach striped) and there is a charge if these are lost. Last year they provided towels at the pool but this works ok as there is a washing machine in each apartment. Staff are friendly. It is a resort which sells timeshares but we booked through alpha rooms (for about \u00a3300 for the week) and did not have to do the tour. It is offered but not under pressure. We chose not to both years with no problem. If you do it you can get free theme park tickets. Pool is great- slides for kids and lots of life guards. Very handy to Disney. We had also stayed at Disney and were able to get to the front gates of the park in the same time as leaving the Disney resort as we had a hire car at Liki Tiki rather than using the Disney bus (about 20 mins journey). There is a 7-11 just outside and a SuperWalmart on the 27 N about 5 mins drive away. There is a security gate and each guest is given a parking pass (free) so it feels safe.

It was a zoo. No problems with our shower...we always had enough hot water. The pool with the waterslides is definitely worn and showing age. My only complaint was that the pool was dirty. There was algae growing on the bottom and no one could be bothered to skim the junk floating on top of the water. My husband almost asked if he could skim the pool! After our stay at Liki Tiki, we checked into a Disney resort hotel and the pool was immaculate. The day we checked in there, one of the lifeguards was cleaning the pool tile with a toothbrush! Also, if you work out, don't expect to find a good fitness center. They have one, but it is the size of a closet and the equipment was broken. Literally 5 people could fit into the space.

It was spacious and appeared to be clean. The front desk provided refills on laundry soap, dish soap and garbage bags throughout the week. There were plenty of dishes and cookware for us to use daily. My only complaints about the room (which was very clean and smelled good) is that the tile floor kept turning my feet/socks black (even after I mopped it twice) and there was no mid-week maid service. I would suggest using a steamer for the floor or possibly a stronger cleaner and make sure it is rinsed properly-sometimes residue from cleaners can cause this too. There is a complimentary continental breakfast M-F consisting of mini bagels and donuts, coffee, juice or soft drinks. The pools are nice although they could be skimmed more-there are a lot of beetles and love bugs in Florida that end up drowning in the pool (my son caught over 30 in the pool). There are fun activities pool side at the lagoon pool. The hot tub was a little too hot and honestly needs to be emptied daily-people don't remove sunscreens and lotions prior to going in which makes the water cloudy. I was never bothered about a timeshare purchase and was pleased with the excellent customer service and hospitality from the front desk. My friends also stayed with us in a room down the hall. Their room had a strong odor of curry (from previous guests). They came in and sprayed their room and removed the extra bedding form the closet and replaced it with fresh pillows, sheets and blankets. They even called to follow up and make sure that everything was fine. When they asked for the room to be sprayed again, a team came up to address the problem. The gentleman at the guest services desk was so helpful when I needed to find a local pharmacy to get a prescription filled.

The facility is a family oriented resort/water park. Although, it was only me and my husband we enjoyed the water park while we were there. We played water volleyball with almost daily. We had a beautiful spacious colorful one bedroom unit in bldg 400 which included a king size bed and 2 seater jacuzzi tub. My only complaint was that it didn't have the flat screen TV's. But I soon got over that small problem and focused on the privacy of the location after spending a day at the lagoon (water park). Our bldg had a beautiful view of the pool and we would go and sit and talk with the older adults in the hot tub, go swimming again and relax on the chaise lounges until closing (12 midnight). The area made you feel like you were in the tropics. We are II owners/exchangers and normally you would have to attend a 90 minute presentation exchanging into other resorts, although you already own at another resort. Not at this resort. We were told about their presentation but were not force to attend. There were no gimmicks to get you in to sell their resort. Either you loved the place and wanted to buy into or you would be a frequent guest or exchanger. I loved that part. I won't name the other resorts we stayed in while visiting Orlando, but they are very plush resorts with good amenities but the pressure of the sales drives you away. But they were booked. At first I was a little nervous but after visiting Liki Tiki Resort, those properties will have to do a lot more to get our business after visiting Liki Tiki Resort. The staff were very friendly and accommodating to all our needs. The staff at Skally's restaurant were awesome too. Kudos to Sarah, who made you feel like family, she would remember your room number, who was in your party and your name. This woman was great. The food was awesome and they gave you plenty of it. There was a staff woman who was solely in charge the life guards and looking at the weather reports for the safety of the guests while being in the lagoon, I have to give her kudos as well, she was on top of her game. The life guards were on top of their game and made sure that everyone was safe while enjoying themselves. We have visited and cruised a lot of places and when we returned home, we feel a need to take another vacation for the vacation. I can honestly tell you that I feel so relaxed and ready to get back into reality now. I feel great!!!!!

Soon as we left the registration desk we were ushered over to the welcome desk, or should I say Timeshare presales desk. We explained that we already own a unit somewhere else and were using an exchange to visit. They said if we came to a short presentation, we could get our Universal and IOA tickets at a great discount. We indicated we would be willing to go for the tickets, but we would not be buying, and they said they just wanted to show us other properties we could stay at. Well all they did was try and sell us another unit, and when we said we were not interested, the meeting went on for 2 and half hours. They keep trying to sell you packages at different rates, no matter how hard you tell them that your are not buying. I understand sales, and I know why people go, but when you tell them you are not interested and they keep at you, it gets a little annoying. The final comment from the sales person when we left was, \" you guys look like you have money\", was the most insulting thing I had ever heard while I was on vacation. Would never go back there again beacause of the comment. As far as the resort, we stayed in new section, the unit was nice, but under equipped with regards to dishes. We stay at many condos for skiing and they are much better equipped than Liki Tiki. The internet is terrible, when it works, and for $25 a week, it should be much better. I travel lots for buisness and free quality interenet is the norm. You can hear the people in other condos, and when we go skiing maid service in the middle of a 7 day stay is included. They come and change your towels and sheets, and do some light cleaning. The water park is ok, but the lifeguards need to focus on thier job, not chatting it up with the pretty girls. There are lots of small children in the pool, and I have been involved first hand with a child at the bottom of a pool when the lifeguards were too busy with each other than the pool. The female lifeguards were very attentive to there job, so its not all. The place was clean, but if you go, ask for newer section. All in all, you can find as good or better with more include than Liki Tiki, and stay away from welcome desk and free gift, unless you really want a timeshare.

The grounds were absolutely beautiful, and there were high and low points of the vacation. We traveled with 3 adults, 2 teens, and 1 kid. The Bad: Check-in was a disaster. We asked for adjoining rooms, they placed us on opposite sides of the property. We had two rooms because one member of the party was a time share owner so we ended up being put on the other side of the resort. Eventually they put is in the same building, right down the hall from each other. So after the long check-in, we went over to the welcome desk/resort service to ask a question. I asked if they knew of anything to do on a rainy day (it was pouring the day we arrived and we wanted to kill time with something.) Their answer: \"No.\" On Disney property they would bend over backwards for you if you asked this. Here, not so much. Another issue was with the phone in one of our rooms. It could make calls, but not receive. So we went down and they said it was a computerized error and that they would have someone fix it. We went down numerous times and when we left, the phone was never fixed. The Good: The grounds were beautiful. We stayed in Room 700, not far from the main building and our balcony had a PERFECT view of the lake/beachfront, and the pool/lagoon! It was awesome! On the balcony was a table and chairs. We had a one bedroom. The one bedroom had a bedroom, kitchenette complete with dishwasher and large fridge, kitchen table in living room, pullout couch to sleep on, two chairs in living room, and flatscreen tv. Also a washer and dryer in room. The pool was also very nice. The lagoon was fun with some slides and water spewing fountains, and the main pool was also nice. The outdoor restaurant/poolside bar was good. We ate for dinner one night, very good food. They print your airline boarding passes up to 24 hours upon request. We were very happy they did this. Place to eat: On the main road we ate at a Denny's, which was good, Shoney's Buffety, EXCELLENT FOOD HERE, Cracker Barrel, and Cici's Pizza. (These are the places we ate offsite.)

While checking in I saw the first of several cats scamper across the doorway of the reservation center. I laughed to myself as I thought of the reviews that I read before traveling. There were several locations where plates of food were put out for the cats. No one seemed bothered by them at all. They keep to themselves. There was an interesting picture in our condo entitled Heminway House which pictured several cats near the key west style villas much like those at the resort. Perhaps the cats were intentionally brought onto the grounds? Our unit was perfect except for the dirty carpet. It was vacuumed but needed to be steam cleaned. We had to wear and change socks frequently. The balcony patio was cleaner than our floor. My husband suggested I vacuum and mop when we arrived. Yea right, anyways... We were here 4 years ago and had the same issue so I came prepared. Next we tried to utilize the fitness center. We were told where it was located and how to get in. We tried and couldn't. We called down to verify the location. Talked to someone different they told us where it was located and how to get in. We tried again and no luck. We called again told them we couldn't get in. They asked soemone and they said that it was closed and would not reopen for the entire day and they were not sure when it would open. We utilized the pool and hot tub. It was nice, the bathroom was clean and the temperature was perfect. They have grills available for guest use in this area which is awesome. While coming back from the pool our key was somehow demagnetized. Myself and my kids treked back to the reservation center in our swimgear to get a new key. While there we were caught in terrential rain. It was not going to let up. The customer service rep who helped us with our key offered to take us in a golf cart back to our room but warned it was going to be wet. We had our suits on, no matter to us. But he got soaked. Both guys at the counter were so great. The other prrovided us with enough towels to keep dry from head to toe during our ride, I felt bad for our driver, he had to go back to work, soaked. If it weren't for him I'm sure my kids would have gotten sick. The golf cart ride through the huge puddles of rain were the highlight of my kids rainy day. On Thursday we tried to use the water park for the first time. When we arrived there was a note that said it closed at 5:30 for an event (a \"for pay\" event). My kids were disappointed but had fun on the awesome play structure and swings instead. The next day we used the water park, which is open from 10 am - dusk. I was disappointed when I found there were no slides for younger kids (a 5 year old and 3 year old). The slides they have there you must be 48 inches. The kids also better be able to swim because it lets them out in every bit of 3 1/2 foot deep water. This is not a wimpy water park. The twisty tube slide was used predominantly by teenagers and adults, and they were quite enjoying it. The water volcano was neat, but again in the deep water wear my kids would not venture. My kids did not like the mushroom waterfall or sprayer, which were the only features in the shallow water, because the water was too hard. The bumper boats were not working while we were there. Perhaps they only work during the warmer season? The associate did seem hesitant enough to ask another person when she told me they were not running, She suggested the paddle boats instead. There were no bugs except for the flying variety that came in because of the lights right outside the door and oen came off the luggage cart into our unit.

After I booked, I read the \"cockroach\" reviews and decided, although I couldn't get my money back, there was no way I could expect my 3 children, 8,10,and 16 months to stay there. I booked less than 15 days prior to vacation, so the money was not refundable. I made a request to be in one of the newer condos, not because of roaches, but because I have a baby and COULD NOT have a two-story villa. We don't have stairs in our house, so the baby isn't used to them, and if we did, we would certainly use baby gates. Although we booked another hotel room, we figured we would check in at Liki Tiki and use the pedal boats and water park. So, here is what happened. First of all, we were supposed to check in on the 13 and didn't until the 14. We were told our room wasn't ready. I said, \"Our room better be ready, we were supposed to check in yesterday!\" The room ended up being ready. I would have bet my life on the fact that \"We are very busy this week and are completely filled up, so all we have to offer is one of our two story townhouse villas. No, we don't have baby gates.\" I just rolled my eyes and thought, \"It figures.\" So, we checked in and went to see our room. The townhouse was old, but it was nice and clean. The kitchen was very well stocked, even having infant plates and bowls. I paid extra to have a high chair, which wasn't in the room. I called the front desk to ask for the highchair, which was brought to us in about 30 minutes. The straps of the highchair were COVERED with food. It was so gross. I did my best to clean it, but food in fabric is hard to get rid of. I made my husband check the whole place for signs of bugs, which he didn't find. We got ready to go to use the waterpark and pedalbikes. We were not allowed to use the pedalbikes because we had sandals on. It was 80 degrees, what did they expect? But whatever, not really a big deal. We went to the waterpark instead, which was very crowded, but nice for the kids. I would definetely recommend that you stay away from the kiddie pool with the octopus. I stepped into it with the baby, and the water was SLIMY! There were about 50 toddlers in it, probably all peeing! It was disgusting. We just took him in the big pool with his float. On the way back from the pool, as we went through the gate, a little girl, no more than 6 or 7 at the most, exited the pool by herself. We stopped and looked around for her parents, who were nowhere to be seen. We stood there talking amongst ourselves, saying \"Where is she going, is anyone looking for her?\" She turned around and saw us looking at her and kept going. We watched her to see where she was going, and she walked a REALLY long way and went into one of the condos. We couldn't believe that someone would actually let this little girl wander by herself. Liki Tiki is a nice property, but not safe enough to let your little girl roam around by herself! We ended up staying at Liki Tiki for one night, which was fine. We didn't see any sign of bugs. After we checked out, who did we see? The little girl again wandering around by herself. I looked at my husband and shook my head. I just think people are stupid! So, that's it for my Liki Tiki review. Nothing good and nothing horrible. Just a hotel with a cool pool for the kids. But, if you want a great resort, try Lake Buena Vista Resort Village and Spa.

The resorte was clean and nice. We sat around the kids pool most of the time since it was near our room and had the bar. We played volleyball and cooled off in that pool. It was never crowded. The drinks were priced OK for a resort and the food was good. Especially the pizza. We shopped at the grocerie store about 1/2 mile down hwy. 192 and ate most of our meals in the condo. One night we took a bus from the resort to a gambling cruise at Port Canavrial. The shuttle was supposed to launch and we were told this was a great way to see it.

Our choices for the weak signal my Power book could find on the property were $9.95 for 24hours, or Dial up that they said would be 86 cents a minute.

The pools and the waterpark although a little worn, were spotless except for a few leaves. The pools were extremely warm and the hottub was almost too hot, most relaxing. The staff were very friendly and made us feel very welcome. There was no hard sell , unlike a previous trip to another location down the road. In my opinion , the grounds crew worked extra hard to keep the location clean, and I was always greeted with a friendly wave and smile. There were on site gas barbeques that were kept absolutely spotless, and we made well use of. I guess my only complaint would be the one bedroom unit next to us had a connecting door. I felt obligated with a party of five to get a two bedroom unit, but the unit next to us at one point , I believe had 9 people staying in it (I am not a nosey person) . They were a little noisy at times. After 11pm the only noise that was heard was the security golf carts going by. Although there are some older buildings on site , while we were there, they were busy installing new furniture and it is quite obvious that their commitment to upgrade those buildings is of the utmost importance to them. I would highly recommend this location to anyone with small children , we loved it .

We didn't have a nice view from our balcony just of woods and a really huge spider hanging on the outside of the screen, and i mean really huge spider so we didn't go out there that much.

I have a ten year old, a three year old and a teenage brother that was with us and none of them found the \"water park\" interesting. We spend most it the time in the adult pool. It was alot less crowded a warmer but it was a pretty long walk to get there and it wasn't that clean either. We didn't use any of the things they had like, bumper boat, tennis, baseket ball, bikes or fishing cause if your not an owner there then you have to pay for eveything. There is lots of restaurants and a publix really close by just a few minutes drive from the resort, and a supper walmart less than a five minute drive, and a 7-11 you can walk to just around the corner.

My first trip was great. I did not have any of the problems like I experienced on my second trip. Let me first say that the service of the employees was good. My problem was with the security and the cleanness of the room. My second night was Halloween night. At around 2:00 am, I was woken by a soft knock on the door followed by a harder knock. My girlfriend gets up thinking it was some one in our room who might of went out side and locked them selves out. As my girlfriend goes walking to the door, the door suddenly begins to open by a security guard from the out side. The security guard claims that he was following up on a report that some was screaming and slamming door. At this point we confirmed that every one was asleep and that the noise was not from our room. The security then just left. The next day, after parking the car, while walking to the room, my girlfriend see\u2019s the security guard as he stairs at us as we walk back to our room. I Think the actions that the security guard did was inappropriate. He should have called the room first to see if everything was ok and then asked if some one could come by the room to verify. He also could of come by the room and just listened from the outside and see that the noise was not from my room. Not for nothing, but it was Halloween and they should of figured that kids would do jokes. I was very bothered by this because my girlfriend was not appropriately dressed when the security guard opened the door unannounced. My room had three children in the second bed room and this situation made it uneasy to sleep worrying that some one could just open the door at any time. When I was checking out, I told the manager in charged that morning what happened. He took my contact info down and said he will follow up on it and some one should get back to me. When I got back, I wrote a letter to the resort management about the situation. I get a response from the security manager thru an e-mail which states that he looked into the situation and finds in the records that some one requested a lock out. He states that\u2019s when some gets locked out of there room. Nothing was mentioned about some one screaming or slamming doors. I called a number that he leaves, and he apologies about what happened and says he talked to all his security guards about there security policies. But seamed not to believe that the security did anything wrong since nothing was reported about screams or slamming doors. He also tells me that the person that I saw the next day could not be the same security guard because he was not working that day according to scheduling records. He feels that my girlfriend mistaken the security guard for some one else. I feel at this point that he is just covering up for his security guards. I feel it was the same person and maybe the name on the records was actually of another employee to cover up. My other problem was while in bed, I fund a roach on the beds back board followed by a second one on the night stand. Another was found in the bathroom my last night.

I must admit that I would never stay there again because it appears to be a crap shoot. Here's how I got to stay in a beautiful condo. When I booked a year ago, I did so without reading the trip advisor ratings. I freaked when I saw the ratings, so I called the resort and asked to be guaranteed a stay in the new 1200 or 1300 towers. They told me to contact again closer to my arrival. I did so 6 months later. They still said it was too early to make any guantantees. Then I tried again three months, but I got the same answer. Then, two days before arrival, very worried that I would get a crappy old condo, I wrote and requested a newly renovated place. This time, I received a phone message saying that my request would be accomodated. I SAVED THE PHONE MESSAGE! When my fam and I arrived, they of course initially said that they could not honor the request, especially given that it was an Orbitz sale price. I kept saying, \"Here, do you want to listen to the voice message I saved? Do you want to see my call log? YOu promised.\" Well, they not only booked me in a newly renovated condo, they also upgraded (I don't think they had any one bedrooms left). The condo was wonderful. Clean, huge, with a two person jacuzzi and walk in glass shower, a nice and new kitchen well stocked, a gorgeous open dining room. This was a place I would expect to pay 300-400 dollars for. My kids loved coming back from the parks and going to the little water park. Then we would have late night swims in the pool open until midnight. I really can';t say enough how much we enjoyed Liki Tiki. The thing is, I would never want to go through that process of fighting to stay in the newly renovated condos. What a bummer to have such extreme differences in the condos. And the management realizes this. As soon as I said, \"Hey, look at my requests. I have been making them for a year because trip advisor comments show you guys to be so uneven,\" they knew I was onto their situation. Anyway, I would rent from them again in a heartbeat if I could ensure staying in a nice condo.

They resemble flies but don't bite-they just fly around mating like crazy-hence the name \"love bugs\". They were the only thing that put a damper to our stay.

I explained that we had already wasted enough of our 3 kids time there I wasn't spending the day moving. Well, they were suppose to do it for us and that didn't happen either. Then the unit we were being moved to stood in 6 inches of water on the porch and they had just moved someone out of that one the day before! This place is ridiculous!

They ran out of some of the food so the kids would night eat the fish & the ran out of deserts. The staff at the pool side bar let just say were not famiy friendly! It was our vactaion its there job. The paddle boats need repair bad we about fell over back words. The pool was nice a little crowded at times. the grounds were for the most clean. The staff that ride golf carts were rude to my children they siad they did not give kids ride only adults and drove off. I have tried to talk to someone about our stay for 6 days no response I was promised a call back Monday well that did not happen. It is not a 5 star resort just becauese you have water pool does not mean you are. It is also about service. We left early becaue of issues every day we only take one vacation a year with the kids and to resort because of cost and trade our time share.

We belong to the Marriott Vacation Club, and we exchanged through Interval International. Interval International gave this resort 5 stars in 2007. Well, don't believe it! This resort is 25 years old and it shows! The rooms have been upgraded, but, each room is a 1 star at best! The \"water park\" pool is overcrowded, and dirty. The ONE bar and grill onsite (Shipwreck Sally's) is worst than a shipwreck. It is old, dirty, smelly, falling apart, moldly, slimely, and fly infested. What's more, Shipwreck Sally's (did I mention it's the ONLY place to get food or drink at the resort?) closes at 9:00 pm!!! There are 2 other \"quiet\" pools, but, they have no access to food, drink, or other things you would come to expect at such a \"resort.\" The clientel is third rate. We witnessed TWO different families having picnics in the parking lot after being asked to leave the \"water park\" because they brought food and coolers. They actually took the sheets off their beds to make picnic blankets IN THE PARKING LOT. This will give you an idea of the type of clientel that Liki Tiki caters to. The resort is clearly not interested in catering to the existing guests, but more interested in selling additional timeshares. A 2 bedroom will run you $29K, and a 3 bedroom will run you $39K - AFTER they finally break ground and begin building in 2009. In the meantime, you are stuck with a 25 year old vacation nightmare. This experience makes me question any of the other \"5 star\" resorts that Interval International has to offer.

However we were very happy with everything there. We stayed in one of their newer buildings 1300 building. All the buildings 700-1300 are newer buildings. It was BIGGER than any other resort we have stayed at. The rooms were clean and beautiful. If you stay in 700-900 buildings you will have a view outside of the lagoon where the water park is. In the 1000-1300 buildings you have a tiny walk to get over to the lagoon, and you have a view out your balcony of beautiful Florida woodlands--wildlife. The lagoon/water park area was really nice, especially for small children and young teens. It was very crowded in the afternoon. We found that it was best to go to the water park when it first opened around 10 am. There were life guards on duty and they were very attentive. The tiki bar was great--not just a bar! It had food and sodas and everything else you might want. I have older teens and they were more interested in the activities --basketball, putt putt, golf, shuffleboard, racketball, paddleboats, and bumper boats. The whole family enjoyed the family bikes that are available. If you are an owner or an exhange visitor--most the activities are free. I think there was a small fee for the bikes and boats but it was well worth it. Now--as an adult--the water park was too loud and busy for us. So we walked over to the center pool in the park--which was quiet, warm and fun. There was also a hot tub there and it was a big hit. A small walk further lead to another pool and two more hot tubs but we never needed to go over there as we were entertained already. The whole place was clean and every staff member we encountered was professional, clean, and helpful. The only suggestions we have for the place is more hot tub areas, a bigger workout room and a much bigger archade/game room. The fitness room was very tiny and had few machines etc. The archade/game room was so small and most items did not work. So when it rained there was little for the kids to do.

So I speak from experience of reading both good and bad reviews. The overall grounds are well maintained. We arrived early but had no problems with checking in early. We didn't like the first room they gave us. It was in one of the older buildings on the ground floor and you could see the wear and tear of the room. But the thing that got me was all the bugs in the room. There was about a inch gap under the door that allowed the bugs to come in and out. But we were able to switch rooms (1100 building) with no problems. The young lady at the front desk was very polite and helpful. The second room was on the third floor, although the view from the balcony was of trees, it didn't bother us at all. I would say if you are considering Liki Tiki please ask for a room in one of the new buildings. I read that a lot when I was researching the resort and that would be the best advice I could give. The overall feeling of the place is, it's clean, the staff was nice an helpful and you get what you pay for. The pools during the day had a lot of kid traffic so my boyfriend and I went later on in the evening which was perfect! There are plenty of restaurants in the area and a few grocery stores. We ate out a couple of days and then bought groceries to cook the remaining time we were there. If you are looking for the Ritz this is not the place for you. I saw the good and not so good about Liki Tiki. All in all it wasn't so bad. Other than the first room we were put in and the time share people it was actually nice. I went expecting the worse because of reviews I read but it wasn't bad at all. The only thing I REALLY disliked was the time share people. We sat in on one of the meetings and at first the guy was nice and we were actually considering it. But with more thought we decided against that for right now. Well, that made the manager angry and he was down right RUDE when he knew we would not be purchasing the time share. So my advice would be to avoid the time share people. The attractions were about a fifteen minute ride from the resort but we printed out directions before we left home to all the attractions we wanted to see and that was perfect!", "Date": "July 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cWarning!

When you own a timeshare and have had so many wonderful stays and you do have options, this is one place that you need to avoid. I agree, some of this is very petty but when you are a timeshare owner you begin to expect certain things from the resorts you book with. Trip was planned down to the smallest detail even thought so far as to call ahead to request a unit in a newer building so as to avoid the two level townhouses I have heard about. After waiting in line forever we were told that the only unit available was a two level townhouse. After the third spill off the stairs my 18 month old took we decided that maybe on Sunday someone would be checking out and we could get a different room. Who wants to have to worry about a kid falling down the stairs the whole trip? We didn\u2019t get too much sleep as the townhouse units were packed and it was like living in a city. There was loud music from a car radio people partying out in the lot and the people in the unit next to us were up partying on their patio until 3 am. I go on vacation to get away from this kind of crap. I wasn\u2019t happy with the room to begin with as it was really dumpy. There were two 19 inch TVs in only the main bedroom and the living room. Small little dinky TV\u2019s is nothing to get excited about but we haven\u2019t been in a timeshare condo with anything less than a 27\u201d in ten years and most have big screens now. The bottom of the dishwasher was rusted and falling off, there were ants everywhere in the kitchen, the light on our patio was popping and flickering when you turned it on, there were burn marks from cigs everywhere, there were numerous cracked tiles in the kitchen area, the patio areas were not screened in and the list goes on. Petty stupid stuff I know but it all adds up. We called the front desk the next morning and after about a half hour of trying to get through, someone finally answered. We were told that they would see what would be opening and that we would get a call in ten minutes or so. An hour later after no call we finally got through to the front desk and they had no idea what we were talking about. So here we are wasting our vacation time trying to get an answer and to make it worse, we were supposed to be leaving to go to the beach on this day. We were wasting so much time trying to get an answer my wife finally walked over to the desk and an hour later came back and said we had gotten a condo unit in one of the newer buildings. We were to pack up our stuff and they would take it over for us while we were at the beach. The person at the front desk took our cell number and said they would call as soon as the room was set up with our stuff. At about ten o\u2019clock that night and after trying to reach the front desk for a few hours we finally got through to them and we were told we were all set, just pick up the new keys in the morning. When we got back the next day we were set up in a room more to our standards. This place charges you for everything! It costs money to rent a crib, never had to pay for one of those. They charge for renting a highchair, never had to pay at any other places. There is no complimentary shampoo or hand/body lotion. Basically, they nickel and dime you to death at this place. The pool area is great but very crowded and for young kids like ours it was awesome. Funny thing though and this should sum up our stay and give you an idea of how this place is run\u2026.one day while at the pool and one of two days they had the kiddie pool shut down for repairs (?) we went over to get some pool towels and they were out. The day before they were out but the girl said they would have more in 15 minutes or so. It\u2019s noon and they are out of towels and they don\u2019t want you taking any from your room. The second day they ran out they never got any more for the whole afternoon. A very strange thing did happen right after that though. All of the sudden out of nowhere, I didn\u2019t see this before or after, they hung up some models of towels they were selling. So no free towels on this day, only ones for purchase. Like I said in the beginning, if this is a timeshare exchange, go somewhere else because I can tell you first hand there are better places and places not so damn far off the main roads too. You expect things to be a certain way especially when you pay big bucks for a timeshare to exchange, Interval International I guess needs to revisit this place because if this is a high star rated place, I\u2019d hate to see a three star. I wont go so far as to say it was horrible but for me there is of course a very simple fix to this. I didn\u2019t like it so I won\u2019t go back.

Our room was actually closed for renovations and accidently given to us. We noticed and notified the front desk of our concerns. The manager was very friendly and accomodating. They even offered to help us pack and move. She gave me a walk through of my choice of rooms before renting out the new one. I give the staff \"two thumbs up\" for helpfulness and friendliness! There are newer rooms in a more hotel like environment. So, when you make your reservation, be sure to state which type of room you would like. Personally, I loved the cabin! The water park was a lot of fun and easy to watch your kids. It was hard to get the kids out of the waterpark long enough to visit Universal Studios! If you have the time, I would recommend going through the tour. They offer a variety of choices as your \"reward\" for listening.

We stayed 5 days inside Disney at the Old Key West Resort and then trying to save some money, reserved the last 5 days at Liki Tiki Village as it looks so beautiful on their website. Well lets just say, \"you get what you pay for. \" I can't say it was all terrible, but this was our experience: I had checked many reviews and done much research before booking and was a little nervous due to all of the negative reviews but went for it as I did get a great rate. As all of the reviews had stated to make sure to get a \"condo\" in the 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200 or 1300 section (5 stories) because these are the new condos and the other townhouse units are old, falling apart, dirty, etc, I made sure to reserve a \"condo\" in one of the new buildings. I made sure Hotels.com called the resort to ask if we would be getting one of the new units and they assured us that yes, this would be the case. I also called the resort myself to make sure this would be the case and they told me yes, my request was down and was all set. Upon check-in, they checked us all in and then handed me the keys with room number \"209\". I told her that I had requested a \"condo\" in one of the new buildings and not a townhouse which was one of the old buildings. She told me that my request was just that, a request and not a guarantee and that they had 200 people checking in that day (Saturday). So I said we would look at it. Well all we had to do was walk in and walk out. The townhouses are 2 floors with the bedrooms and bath on the second floor. They are dark, dingy, old and dirty. You could tell that no one had stayed there for quite some time because there were dead flies on the kitchen floor. So back we went to the desk asking to speak to the manager on duty. We spoke with a different rep. at the desk and not wanting to bring the manager into it she said she could offer us a condo in the 800 unit which she said had been newly renovated, etc. and was very nice. So we were very pleased with that. She said she would call us on our cell when it was ready. We waited about 4 hours and when we went in to get the keys, we were given yet a different unit. We were given a condo in the 700 building which had obviously not been updated within the last 5 years. But we were exhaused and said fine, and it was a lot better than the townhouse. It was very spacious, 2 bedrooms, 2 baths on the 5th floor. The inside windows were very sticky and dirty with kids fingerprints all over them and the couch was very stained. Other than that, it was clean and comfortable. As far as the main waterpark pool goes, don't go there with your kids on the weekends!!!!!!!! It is soooooo crowded that we could hardly see our kids, they have karokee in the afternoons on Saturdays and the music is soooo loud and there was a girl laying on the ground in the tiki bar at 5:00 in the afternoon. Not a great place to go with your kids on the weekends. Believe me, we are no prudes, we love a good time, but geeeeze. It was much better come Monday, a lot quieter and we did find another pool that was a lot quieter as well. We were ready to check out though on Sat. night, but it did get better after the weekend. Also, don't let the \"free continental breakfast\" fool you. It consists of a donut, period!!!!!!!!!! Unless of course you are willing to sit through a 45 minute timesharing speal and then they would give you a full and wonderful breakfast. We said forget it and went somewhere else for breakfasts or just ate in the condo.", "Date": "May 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Canaveral, FL", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly Surprised!\u201d", "Author": "SeaBrzJo", "ReviewID": "UR15733782", "Content": "My family (8-yr-old boy, parents, grandma) stayed at Liki Tiki from April 6 - 11, 2008. We booked the 2-bdrm suite on the Liki Tiki website in March, and received our request to be near the main waterpark pool. I originally called the resort to book, but the very kind reservation rep advised that I could get the same rate by booking on the website PLUS get a Resort Pass that entitled us to unlimited free use of the pedal boats, bumper boats, bicycles, and putt-putt golf during our stay. Sunday afternoon check-in was a breeze and we were thrilled with our 2nd floor suite in Building 800. It was HUGE, spotless, nicely decorated, well-appointed, had a big balcony with table and chairs overlooking the lake, and was just steps to the waterpark pool and Tiki Bar. My family has been staying in similar accommodations for years for family vacations (including Marriott and Hilton timeshare properties) and this suite equaled or exceeded any that we've stayed in. It also had the BIGGEST indoor jacuzzi tub I've ever seen. Ok, so there are going to be downsides to every stay, regardless of the property and cost, so here are ours (off the top of my head and in no order of priority): 1. The doors between adjoining suites are regular interior hollow doors. Although they are locked very securely, even two of these doors back-to-back, provide very little soundproofing. Luckily, we had a noisy 8-yr-old and the adjoining room had a couple of delightful toddlers so the noise didn't bother either family (I met the other family daily in the hallway), and all was quiet after 9 pm. I mention this because a family without kids might be disturbed. 2. Donuts, coffee, tea, and juice are served every morning except Sunday at another one of the pools (approx a 5 minute walk from Bldg 800), but the setup is ridiculous. Two women in a tiny shed attempt to serve as fast as possible, but we stood in a 30-minute line on a Thursday morning at 8 a.m. Luckily, we only tried this on our last day of the vacation. 3. Had read reviews of limited towels poolside so we brought our own beach towels. These worked well to mark our pool chairs and were glad we brought them because. the couple times I thought of checking, the clean towel bins were empty. 4. I had also read critical reviews here about the bar staff at the Tiki Bar and have to agree somewhat. However, what is strange is my (daily) experience was that the female bartenders were very rude, but the male bartenders were extremely friendly. Because I knew I was going to post back here, I paid particular attention and it didn't seem to matter the age or gender of the guest. The lady bartenders had as little patience for the kids as they did for the cute 20-something guys, and the guy bartenders made us all feel welcome and on vacation. One exception: the table waitresses (all female) were all great. Also, I found the drink and food prices very reasonable, especially if you asked about specials. One female bartender failed to tell me that drinks were two-for-one one evening (either double shots or get two separate drinks), but the male bartender mentioned it when he served me a second drink and gave it to me free. 5. Our free Resort Pass seemed useless the first three days (Sunday - Tuesday) as none of the boats were running, nor were any bicycles available. I had read here that others had experienced that so I called and got the same excuse - \"alligator in the lake\". Well, I'm an over-50 Florida native so I challenged them with \"I have a balcony overlooking the lake and I've seen no trappers out here to get the gator for the past three days.\" We went to Aquatica the next day so not sure if the boats were back open, but the following day they were, and remained so the rest of our stay. Never did see any bicycles though, and we were too busy to ask. 6. Some of the resort info pages inside the room are outdated. Example: One page in the binder says towels are only exchanged by housekeeping on Tuesdays, but that is no longer the case. Just call Housekeeping, tell them what you need, and leave your dirty towels in a bag outside your door; new towels will arrive within an hour or two. 7. The waterpark pool closes every Thursday night at 5:30 pm for the rest of the night for a big Luau Party. Tickets for the Luau are approximately $42 per adult, less for kids, and swimming is not allowed during that 3-hour show either. Big disappointment for the 8-yr-old. We didn't attend but could hear the music from our balcony. Also didn't get any feedback on the show from the other guests since we checked out the next morning. 8. Traffic on 192 eastbound... oh my gosh, WHEN did this road get SO busy??!!! Because I live on the coast directly east of Kissimmee, I rarely do a touristy thing like this trip, so the last time I was this far west on 192 was over 20 years ago. One day during this trip we decided to go to Epcot (big mistake - forgot it was still Spring Break and we don't do lines well) and it took us 1-1/2 HOURS to get 7 MILES to the EPCOT gate, and we left at 9:15 AM. Not sure what the problem was because we saw no wrecks or other road blockage, but the same stretch of highway for our Aquatica trip a few days later only took 30 minutes. It's still a nightmare traffic jam at most times, and many guests were complaining about it at the pool. 9. No Internet connections in the room, but my laptop found a wireless signal from an adjacent resort while on my balcony. I didn't opt in for the $9.00 daily fee, but the signal strength was excellent. 10. Newspapers: I'm a morning newspaper freak and, for the rate, I didn't expect morning suite delivery, but I did expect the ability to go to the main building and buy one. Unfortunately, no newspapers are available until the Gift Shop opens at 8 or 9 am (can't remember exact time). Luckily, a 7-11 convenience store is a very short, light traffic, walk from the resort. Those minor things are all I can think of for on entire stay. On the PLUS side, here's what was right: 1. Great parking (at least for buildings 700, 800, 900) and security. I reported a pair of lost prescription glasses one day (later found them in the room) and the front desk had Security at my side within two minutes. Also, plenty of luggage carts (at least in Bldg 800) and the center building elevator (closest to our suite) was quick and always operational. 2. Lifeguards are plentiful, alert, and fair to the kids that just want to have fun. We've been to other resorts with overly power-happy guards that just love blowing whistles. Except for one day, we LIVED at the waterpark pool and never saw a child hurt or crying. 3. A brand new full-service Publix supermarket has opened just 3/4 miles WEST of the resort, and it's super-easy to get everything you could possibly need in a quick, easy drive. 4. Except for the rude female Tiki Bar bartenders, EVERYONE at Liki Tiki from the front desk to the janitors were extremely friendly, happy, and helpful. 5. If you can't stand to sleep on anything other than 300+ count thread sheets or use only Egyptian cotton towels, you might want to bring your own, but everything, including the bedspreads and blankets smelled clean and fresh. 6. Timeshare Sales: I received an evening call on Night 3 asking if I was enjoying the resort. Realizing that it was a timeshare salesperson, I quickly (and nicely) told him that I was very happy, but not interested in buying. Our call lasted only 20 seconds, he wished me well, and I was never contacted again. 7. I loved that the kitchen amenties included a blender and a full-sized 12 cup coffee pot. Would we stay here again? Absolutely YES, but only to stay on property to relax and use the pool and other amenities. I will not fight the 192 traffic again to get to the parks, especially since I can get to them in the same amount of time from my east coast home 50 miles away.

We did get a newer room in the 1400's. Was in great condition! We were swimming by 2:30. The pools were great, the lifeguards were attentive and friendly. They kept en eye on the faster black slide at all times. The kiddie pool was great for even my 3 & 5 yr. old to lounge around and play. Never had a problem with the pools closing early for their functions. It was never before 5 and by that time you had enough of the pool. Plus it was only 2x at the most thru the whole week, but in itself it was for a lua or a dinner/karoke thing. It's in a wonderful location to everything. Away from the hustle of the tourist strip and right next to the cleaner, not so swarmed walmart. (taking a cab to a park is a dumb idea, considering they have buses that pick people up for parks. just got to ask people). Upon checking in, we did get talked into signing up for a tour brkfest. We had to put $20 down to hold it, but got it back of course when we went ( and would of if we changed our minds). We made it for Wednesday at 8:30. Took a little golf cart about 50 feet over to another building. Ate for 20 minutes, with our kids, then looked at a slide show. Told them off the bat this wasn't possible for us at this time. He was great & the promised time of 1 1/2 hrs. was right on. We left, picked up our dep $20 and got to pick form a list of prizes. We chose $75 in cash and away we went. The lake was closed still for one alligator they still need to catch. They did say they caught the other. It was a little deterring, but what can you do. You're in Florida, enjoy the rest of the place! We swam every day from about 10 - 3. Ate lunch from our hotel alot, bought lunch once or twice from snack bar by pool. Every evening we found things to do that the kids loved! ( ages 3, 5 and 9) We used the $75 at Old Town carnival ( wed buy one bracelet, get one free). Went golfing with a coupon. Went to the Flea market down on other end by carnival. Went to Downtown Disney (GREAT TIME) free to go, free parking. just walked around, listened to a band, played with lego's, rode the ferry. ( if you eat at rainforest, there will prb be a 3 hr. wait, ask to sit on patio and you're right in). We did drive to Cocoa Beach 2 days. bought $5 boogy boards and the kids were in heaven. It is about 75 miles, but took a bit longer b/c of disney traffic. But again, you're in Orlando, you just deal with it. ( and bring about $4 in cash for tolls each way). We did have to leave a $50 dep. on our CC when we checked in. Which they never really charge unless they had too). We did make calls using our calling card and occured a .75 /call charge, but we were never told nor saw a sign about the charge so they deducted it for the most part. ( they guy calling NY, uhh, there would prob be a long dist. charge on top of your .75 charge dont you think? and wouldn't you check your bill BEFORE you left at check out?) All in all great place, great location. Room had 2 flat screen tv's, large screened in porch, tub with blower jets. Do bring extra laundry detergent and dish soap. Besides the kid pool area, there are 2 others pools along with a hot tub. I'm sure the older buildings were in more need of care. Just request for the newer beforehand by calling and again at check in say you were told on the phone you were in a newer building. Hopefully that works!

That night we could hear every word from the people and the tv from the unit next door. The bed had seen better days because we felt like we were sleeping on the floor and the sofa bed was broken! Needless to say we got no sleep and the next morning I left a message on the voice mail of the supervisor in customer service. Of course I never did get a reply! Decided to use our own plastic utensils when we discovered that the dishwasher was disgusting, filthy and rusty. The waterpark that looked so nice on the internet was packed crowded both days. The resort details that there are heated pools. We never found them! The elevators never worked and there were bugs and ants all over the entrance door to our units.

For the most part this is a nice place to stay. Our room was on the 5th floor 1051E, which was a two bedroom. The buildings 1000-1300 are more recently built and are more modern. The room was nice as it had a jettison tub and nice balcony. Very roomy with a full kitchen. There were only a few things that I did not thrill me about this place that made it less than a 5-star resort. One being there is NO WIFI in the rooms only dial up, that was a total joke as it did not even work. I was told the resort does have WiFi in the main building but it cost like $6.00 a day. A second thing that wasn't great was the pool while being very kid friendly offers not much for anyone over 10 or 4 ft tall. The resort stresses its a water park and it indeed is but a waterpark for small kids. Another thing is there are alot of kids running all over the place here and I mean ALOT. If you are trying to find a quiet place for RR this is not it. Its not a real problem and most of the kids are in the pool are all the time. We were disappointed that the paddle boats and bumper boats they have on the lake were not in operation the entire time due to fact they said a gator was residing in the lake. Not sure how accurate this was since noone we talked to ever seen it and the lake looked pretty shallow. The staff at the front deskwho check you in and out are half dead and not very friendly at all!! They almost seemed annoyed at the fact of having to check us in when we arrived. Not sure what was going on with that. The final thing that was annoying about the resort was the SALES PITCH on the timeshare tour presentation. We have been to many timeshare tours and we are timeshare owners but this tour is very LONG and the sales pitch is VERY PUSHY.. They say its a 90 min presentation , but took us 3 hours and the staff was visibly annoyed at the fact we kept saying NO we did not want to buy the resort. This is a high pressure sales tour despite what they tell you! Avoid this if you can. BUt all in all we had a great time as we spent most of our time at the disney parks and the beach. The resort is a great place to go and just let the kids run around. The rooms are nice..and they have alot of activities for kids and families. Also you can get some free disney world tickets buy attending the timeshare presentation.

Like others, I read the mixed reviews about this place. Either people loved it or hated it. I even apologized to my wife ahead of time if the place was a dive since I made the arrangements. This place was perfect for a family of four with a 6 and 9 year old. It was clean, lots of space, and had the amenities that we needed. Here's the summary: The good: The room was huge. We got the 2 bed/2 bath for a few extra bucks. It was absolutely worth it. We were able to spread out after a long day at Disney and have our own space. There was even a day when my son had terrible stomach flu. It was nice to be able to \"quarantine\" him in a different bedroom. This is something that we could never have done at a comparably priced Disney Resort. There was a kitchen with dishes, silverware, breakfast nook, coffee maker, etc. We were able to eat breakfast there daily as well as a few dinners. The kids preferred eating in after a long day at the park. The room was indeed clean, contrary to other reviews. Do not expect laundry/cleaning service though. They will clean the room for an additional charge and you must call guest services for extra towels. I personally can go a week without cleaning services. Big deal. The kids LOVED the 50 inch flat screen TV and whirlpool tub. It was very nice after a long day of walking. The pool was great for smaller kids. The waterpark was definitely for smaller kids. They had smaller slides and the wave pool produced 6-12 inch waves. Nothing to get too excited about. They also had karaoke at the pool 3 out of the 7 nights we were there. The kids had a great time with that. They also like the playground near the pool. My older son preferred the playground to the pool. There was also basketball and putty golf that we did not use but they appeared nice. WE WERE NEVER CALLED OR EVEN APPROACHED about going on a timeshare tour. I really appreciated that. The staff were friendly and helpful although slow at times. THere were security vehicles all over the grounds. THE BAD: The check in was horrible. We came in at 6:00 after a long day of travel and it took 40 minutes to check in with only 5 people in front of me. It appeared that 2 of the 4 desk staff were struggling with the computers and were maybe new as they were asking other staff alot of questions. I was also delayed as I had asked for a newer building back in January as well as 3 days before check in. However, upon arrival I was in an old building. It took her 20 minutes to get me in to the newer building for a week. (It was worth it!). The bumber boats and paddle boats were closed the whole week. We may have been upset by this if we spent more time at the resort, but it was no big deal. The room seemed to have been made poorly. While this was no big deal now, I can see in a few years that there will be problems. The tub had no caulk around the edges to the point that there was bare, unpainted drywall exposed at the top of the tub wall. There were two large cracks in the ceiling over our bed along the drywall seams. It looks like someone tried to repair it with spackle and a different color paint very poorly. All the doors squeeked and one would not stay shut. The lock to the bedroom seemed to work but did not. The elevator control panel was smaller than the opening and had large gaps around it. It looked bad. Even one of the staff commented to me about it when we were waiting for the elevator. He said \"makes you wonder where all those maintenance dues and taxes go...\" Overall we had a great time at the Liki Tiki. The positives far outweiged the negatives. I would definitely stay there again.

Most all the staff was extremely rude .. with the exception of the bartender's at the pool. I suppose they have a vested interest in being polite. After checking in last Friday night (and standing in line for 35 minutes to do so), we encountered numerous rude staff members. A few days after getting there, I returned to the check in desk to ask where I could find a postbox .... the girl behind the counter looked up at me and said \"Do you need something?\" -- rather than \"Can I help you.\" The elevator in our building was broken for nearly 5 days .. we felt so badly for the people on the 5th floor. It was 80 degrees all week. Imagine climbing 5 sets of stairs each and every time you go to the pool. The door to our room was open multiple times when we returned from the pool or from being out. I thought it was my absent-mindedness or due to my chasing my toddler out the door. I noticed someone else said they were certain someone had been in their room. Seems very strange that on at least 5 occasions we'd return to find our door open. On most of those occasions, I remember the door slamming behind me. Makes me wonder now. The housekeeping staff rides around the complex on bicycles that resemble the Wicked Witch of the East on The Wizard of Oz. Talk about exploitation. We felt terrible for them .... 88 degree heat with all their cleaning supplies, riding a delapitated bicycle around. The clubhouse is a joke .... it's a boiler plate for timeshare sales. Just know that if you are considering purchasing a timeshare here, stay as a guest first and do your research. My mom is an owner and for all intents and purposes, they thought I was my mom. Trust me, I didn't get any special treatment. Apparently, after you sign that purchase agreement, your stock goes way down. When you go into the clubhouse on any given day, it sounds like you are on Wall Street. Business transactions, loud sales conversations ... ridiculous. We avoided the clubhouse at all costs. My husband had to pay $29.00 for the use of high speed internet which could only be used at the clubhouse. For God's sake, even the \"no tell-motel\" offers high speed internet. OH ... and then their is the donut story. Monday through Friday they offer donuts and coffee out by the pool. We hadn't utilized this \"service\" until Friday (the day we were leaving). To make it easy (and because my toddler had an ear infection), I went \"poolside\" to \"fetch\" breakfast. I approached a woman in this little makeshift tiki hut who was apparently manning the donuts. When I asked her for a few to take back to my room for my family, I was interrogated and made to feel like a bank robber. I almost told her to keep her crusty old donuts but before I could get the words out, she slapped three donuts down on a styrofoam plate and handed them to me. You would have thought she had paid for them out of her own pocket. Perhaps if there is a problem with handing out three donuts to a person you've never seen before, it shouldn't be a service provided.

The children were able to visit the waterpark and ride on the paddle boats which they really enjoyed. Everything in the room was in working order. The only turn off was a roach that one of the children discovered in the bathroom. But hey, it's Florida, it was wet out and there were trees around. As a Florida native I wasn't that surprised. We did not get to spend as much time as I would have liked on the actual property because we were \"park hopping\". I plan to go again when the children are on Spring Break. We were in Bldg. 13. I took the advice of one of the reviews I read before going and knew to ask for one of the newer Bldgs which are bldg. 13 and up.

We had requested a room in the 1100-1400 buildings, but due to flight delays, didn't get in until 1am and were given a villa in the 400 building. As with many other visitors, I was a bit worried due to some very bad reviews of this property. Overall, we had a good stay, even with a few probs. So here are the pros and cons to help you make a decision. First the Cons: Inside of villa showed wear and tear, nothing major . . some chiped paint on the cabinets. Doors and shower needed a good scrub down (Hotel offered a full maid service, but we didn't want to bother). I invested in $3 lysol wipes and wiped down all handles, remotes, phones and what-not, then never gave it a second thought. (I do this anytime we stay in a hotel anyway) Toaster only toasted on one side (no big deal , we only used it once), couch had seen better days, elevator was out of service for a day, And last but the worst problem of all, No recycle bins. And now the Pros: Security guarded gated entry, we felt extremly safe! Nice exteriors, very clean and well maintained property. VERY quiet property. We almost never heard our neighbors and they tell us they were booked to capicity. Check in took less than 3 mins and check out, less than 45 seconds. Pools were nice, but slides are best for younger children, 7 or under. Great bbqs in pool area. Villa was completely stocked, even had items for baking (we made cookies several times) and a blender. Other than shower and doors, it was very clean. Floors so clean, your white socks stayed white! Loved the layout of the villa, I think it was bigger than my first apartment! Two separate bathrooms, DVD player, And enough soap for two loads of wash and dishes. All employees were very friendly and helpful. Even map quested the local Centra Care when my son came down with dual ear infections. We were asked just once to attend the tour, I said we'd think about it, but they never asked again. Overall, we liked the place. Very good deal for the price. We were perfectly happy there and the cons never effected our enjoyment. We also liked the location. Close to everything you'd need, but out of the hussle a bit.", "Date": "February 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MONTREAL", "Title": "\u201cloved liki tiki\u201d", "Author": "Rickki27", "ReviewID": "UR13461865", "Content": "I was very nervous because of all the bad reviews I read about liki tiki, I still took a chance and booked it.

When we got there there was no one at the timeshare desk. Perfect! Check in was quick, 10pm at night. I asked if we were getting one of the new rooms at check in. The clerk said its not our newest, let me check whats available. Do you mind a bottom floor room. I said no problem so long as its the NEWEST rooms. We got a 1st floor room in section 1300. It is perfect!!! Full kitchen, everything looked like it had never been used. Large living room with a sleeper sofa. Large master bedroom with a jucuzzi tub for 2!!! With a glass shower. Kids have there own bathroom, [regular bathroom] next to there room with 2 twin beds. All three rooms have a plasma tv, living room has the largest, with lights on the side. There is also a patio, enclosed, balconey if you have upper floor rooms. Great for checking the weather, and sitting with a glass of wine or coffee in the morning. Be careful how much bubble bath you use in the jucuzzi, we almost filled the whole room up. No maid service at all. But you have a washer and dryer in your room. They provide you with packets of laundry soap and dishwasher soap for $1 each. We used it once to wash towels and go home with clean clothes. Also came in handy when we got caught in a downpour at Magic Kingdom. They said the rain would start at 8 and by 630 it was pouring nonstop. We really needed the dryer for our coats and sneakers. The time share people called the room. If you dont want to talk dont answer the phone. I answered the second time and told them i would talk to my husband about it and that was the end of it. Be careful by the pool, i stepped out the jucuzzi, which wouldnt turn on by the main pool, and stepped into an ant hill. My feet were bit up bad for over a week. It was dark out. Water shoes would have been good. The pool and jucuzzi were pretty warm for january. Don't got ot 7 11, go to Publix. Even Walgreens prices were outragous. We just got milk, eggos, banannas, cereal, and a loaf of bread, and butter. I was there to eat in the parks. Also a case of water. We each carried one bottle, or i had them in my bag. It saves a ton of money, even 4 per day. I would Love to stay there again and try the water park next time.

We were upgraded to the new building room 1343F. When we arrived, it looked like someone either didn\u2019t make the bed or someone was playing on it. Also, there was trash in 2 out of 3 trashcans. We called the front desk and the cans were emptied and bed linens were changed within 10 minutes. We also got a voucher for a free meal because of this. After one night in this villa, we decided it was too small for 2 adults, a 3 1/2 year old, and an 18 month old. We requested to be upgraded to a two-bedroom. This was granted for a $100 fee. Our new room was 1351E. It was about 3 times the size of the one-bedroom. It certainly met all of our expectations. The girls had their own room and so did we. There were 2 full bathrooms and a full size washer and dryer. Some things this villa had that the one-bedroom did not have (but should have) were laundry detergent, dishwasher detergent, resort directory, TV channel guide, and soap. Pros: Screened porch (the other buildings did not have this luxury when traveling with children) Nicely decorated Spacious \u2013 living room, dining room, 2 bedrooms, 2 full bathrooms, full kitchen, nice size closets, utility closet (with vacuum, mop, and broom) Mattresses \u2013 Sealy Posturpedic that were very comfortable: king-size master bed, 2 queen beds in the 2nd bedroom TV \u2013 3 flat panel/screen TVs with a DVD player in the living room. We were able to get HBO and Showtime. Full size washer and dryer Fireworks - Able to see partial view of Disney fireworks from the balcony each night. Alarm clock Boom box with CD player Cons: Noise \u2013 from the lock-off door We did not hear neighbors from the other adjoining wall, but only from the lock-off door area. Door lock \u2013 with a push down on the door handle it would open. There was no other form of lock/security. This was a problem with my kids. Other places we have stayed have a latch for a better sense of security. Master bedroom/bathroom suite \u2013 the shower and tub are not separated from the actual bedroom. This was disruptive in the morning when my husband woke up early to shower before his meeting. Other amenities on the property were a fun pool area, bar, and a sundries/gift shop. These are amenities that we used. The main pool with the slides was generally on the cool side. It was too cold for me. We spent a lot of time in the toddler pool that was so warm like a bath. Also, there was what we called the adult pool over by the townhouses. It was a bit quieter, with very few people. The water in this pool was warm. There was also a hot tub in this area. The temperatures in January were crazy, anywhere from 45-70. So, water temperature made a big difference as to which pool you were to choose. Yes, we were the crazy ones swimming in 45 degree weather (along with many other people). A great feature the main pool had was a gradual increase in the water depth. There was an area where it started out like on a beach, it gradually got deeper. Pool towels are provided at the pool areas. Major complaint about room 1343F, which we only stayed in one night was that the front door was not plumb/square. There was a big gap on the bottom left and top right. When I say big, I mean about 2 inches. You could see the light and I am sure a great spot for pests to enter. Before moving to our final destination of the beloved room 1351E, I checked out townhouse 101 C. It was one of the oldest buildings. I was expecting a whole lot worse. It was actually very nice. Because it was a townhouse, the bedrooms were upstairs. The master bedroom had a king bed and balcony. The 2nd bedroom had 2 twin beds. There were 2 bathrooms, one upstairs and one downstairs. It had a very nice size screened in porch downstairs. There was a living room and full kitchen. I don\u2019t recall a dining room, but I am sure there was at least a dining room table. I would have considered staying in this villa if my kids weren\u2019t so small. My biggest issue was safety with the stairs and the balcony was not screened in. Disney World was 20 minutes away. It was very easy to get to. If there was traffic, it could take up to 30 minutes. We did not go to Universal, but I do believe it is a bit farther. Liki Tiki is on Hwy 192 with is also called Irlo Bronson Hwy a few miles up the road. Within about 2 miles is a 24 hour Walgreens. There is also a Super Walmart nearby (I just went to the closest Publix). There are 2 Publix groceries, one east and one west. There are several restaurants, fast-food chains and gift shops within 2-7 miles. Within 10 or 15 miles was Old Town that my 3 year old absolutely loved. Just don\u2019t eat at the Chinese restaurant there. It was horrible. Front desk information: The check in was fine. I do believe the front desk crew should take classes on customer service. Initially, they are not too friendly, but if you keep being nice to them, they finally come around. If you locked into a time-share tour, sorry. If you want less expensive amusement park tickets, then do the time-share tour. We didn\u2019t want to be subjected to the time and hassle so, we got tickets on our own. Remember you have the right to say no to the timeshare spiel (unless it is part of your package). All in all, I would stay here again.

We had a crawling infant and her clothes would turn black from the dirty tile and carpet which was very old and not clean. The units were very old and need to be updated.

The villa also had a large plasma TV mounted on the wall; unfortunately we couldn't figure out how to play a DVD and again the maintenance man was at our door within 20 minutes and showed us the process. The grounds were spotless, and housekeepers always cleaning. There is a large adult pool that was clean and warm plus a whirlpool with nice contemporary music over the speakers. OR, there was the waterpark pools for families with children; always something going on there that was wonderful for the children. We exchanged into this property through Interval International and we definitely give Liki Tiki a \"Thumbs Up\" in all respects and we would return again. As an added note, we told the timeshare people we were not interested in their presentation and they totally left us alone for the entire stay.

We used our exchange week at Liki Tiki Resort. I was a little hesitate to stay at Liki Tiki with all the bad reviews, but since this was the closet property that had availabily to Disneyworld, we stayed here. We stayed from 12/1-12/8. We are were in Building 1000. the room was spacious and perfect for the 2 of us. We had 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, but only used one bedroom. One thing to remember is to bring a sponge for the kitchen since they don't provide one. We are also use to hosekeeping coming in at least once a week to change the towels, but they don't do this here, you have to pay extra to have them clean your room. So it was good we had 2 bathrooms, we just took the towels from that one. I don't like the way the master bedroom was set up. The toliet was separate in its own room, white the shower was spacious, but no where to put your shampoo or conditioner ( on the floor of the shower) the hot tub was in the general vicinity of the bathroom and the master bedroom was right in that room. There is a nice kitchen and a nice living room area, with enough TV stations for us. There was HBO which was cool too. Disneyworld is about 8 miles away, it is quick to get there. We rented a car too. The Resort is located on Rt 192, there is a Publix Supermarket down the street, and in the same plaza the library where you can use the internet for FREE. ( the resort charges you $5.95 for 24 hours) If you head to Route 27 there is a 24 hour Super Walmart //On Route 192 are all sorts of places to eat and Big Tourist Bargain Shops. In order to get our discounted Disney tickets we had to sit through a sales pitch to buy into the Naviago Resort Club. The Sales Agents when we checked in told us it would not be more than an hour 1/2, well we were mistaken. Even though we said NO at least 4 times, they kept pressuring us to buy, buy, buy and 3 1/2 hours later they got the hint. Needless to say I won't ever stay here again. We didn't use any of the amenities, since we were here to sleep and go to the parks only. Although we did take the tour, I think the waterpark is a little misleading through the pictures I saw.

I must say that I was a little worried after reading all of the negative reviews online. However, for the most part, I was really suprised. The grounds were just beautiful and units were wonderful. There were the usual quirks, like not enough towels or dish soap, but a simple call to the office, and those items were taken care of very timely. The waterpark was nice, and my kid's loved the slides. Although, I do think the photos make it look a lot nicer than it actually is. The pools were fine too and the location isn't bad. Just 10 minutes from Disney and 20 minutes from other attractions. There is a close grocery store and a Wal Mart within 2 miles. There were however, a few items, which I found to be real negatives with this resort. First, it is a timeshare and as a result, they will try to preasure you into attending a timeshare sales meeting. Every morning you would see the timeshare sales reps (Vultures, as I like to call them) gathered around the pool and lobby...kind of steals some of the beauty away from the tropical landscaping!! Also, I don't know if it is the free waterpark, but this resort seemed to really draw a wild crowd, at least the week we were there. I have never been to resort in Orlando which had so many unruley kids and teenages just running wild. They would take over the pool every afternoon and break just about every posted rule. One day, my 8 year old daughter even told me that someone had even ripped the sink right off the wall at the pool changing room/bathroom!", "Date": "July 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia Beach", "Title": "\u201cIt depends on your expectations?\u201d", "Author": "mikeobiwan", "ReviewID": "UR8233433", "Content": "Our family of 4, children ages 8 and 4, stayed at the Liki Tiki for a week in July. I have previewed every review on this site as well as any others that I could get my hands on and came to the following conclusions: 1) Many of the complaints that you read involve the Timeshare ordeal, which we did not do. Simply put, they ask you about it at check-in and if you opt out you will not be bothered by it again..period! Sure you get a couple of free tickets to Disney, but if you have ever experienced a timeshare speech it simply isn't worth it. 2) Another common complaint is that the water park is only for smaller children or overcrowded. What do you expect? This isn't Blizzard Beach they are advertising. I challenge anyone to find another hotel complex in Orlando that has anything more than a nice pool (or several nice pools at that). The Liki Tiki does have several pools AND the water park is sufficient. If you plan on THAT being the mainstay for your vacation then yes you will be dissappointed. But for a change of pace from the parks, you can't beat it! 3) Rooms are dirty or need updating? This depends on where you get put. We stayed in unit 104 which is a 2 bedroom condo. Yes it was very outdated and paled in comparision to the newer units in the back of the complex. You will have absolutely no say so in where you get put, they will tell you that they are full no matter what the case. If you are simply staying there and have no interest in the timeshare deal then I would suspect they are going to put you in one of these units. That being said, they weren't THAT bad and I had a separate swimming pool that was right out of my door and the waterpark was a simple stroll across the street. Again, depends on YOUR expectations. While I am picky about some things, I also realize that you spend very little time in your unit if you are in Orlando visiting parks, swimming eating etc. It did provide us a cheap alternative for breakfast and a few dinners but we unfortunately did not take as much advantage of the kitchen facilities as originally planned. 4) Staff isn't friendly? Never really encountered this, but again people treat you like you treat them. The countless complaints about this sort of thing exist no matter what hotel you choose. I would have to say that most of these complaints usually come from people who bring it on themselves. That is my input on the usual complaints that you hear in regards to the Liki Tiki village. In addition to that, I have to say that you must have a rental car because you are about 10-15 minutes from Disney. We actually did the Seaworld/Universal Studios vacation this time around and had some reservations regarding the distance to those parks. I have read a few complaints that these 2 parks are way out of the way and to some degree they are. If you choose to drive down 192 every day you will get the usual morning traffic and lights etc. Fortunately, we were given an alternate route which puts you right on an interstate up the street from Liki Tiki and this helped avoid the snarls. It was exactly 15 minutes to Seaworld and about 20 minutes to Universal. I believe a vacation is what you make of it, and if the Liki Tiki fits your budget and you go in with reasonable expectations you should have a good time. For the money it certainly offers quite a bit at a low price. You may find other accomodations with lots to offer but the price is also going to increase accordingly. I would probably stay again if I went back, but our family likes to try different things and I may try other alternatives as well.", "Date": "July 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cI guess its all relative\u201d", "Author": "razoopicky", "ReviewID": "UR8204111", "Content": "This place is a dump.

Liki Tiki was not \"clean.\" On the property we saw: cigarettes butts around our condo, DUCK POOP that we had to step over to reach the door, paper thrown about, cigarette burns on the porch/concrete. There were several items that I listed as being \"wrong or missing\" upon check in. The itemized list that the maid left was not at all accurate so I was sure to list what I observed. The shower was not a place that I was comfortable with. By tour day I just wanted to get it over & check out of this place. I wanted to find another hotel--anything but my DH told me to stick with it this time. I like staying in condos--because it's easier & less expensive to prepare meals (before/after park visits) for the kids/us as opposed to eating at the parks. We brought lots of things from home. I mentioned and took my list to the tour for the sales person to read. They were willing to move us to a better room (if we were to sign to buy). There were also stains n the bathroom wall that i c/not identify. I hope they were mop sloshing stains. After the sales person gave her speech, I gave my itemized list of all that was wrong and told here how could she expect me to purchase a time share with her comp. after living in the trash that they gave me. Her reply was that that maybe they wanted me to appretiate the new condos better. She was not being a smarty--she just \"didn't have a clue.\" She was very nice in her presentation and during the tour. I replied that was a cheap and disgusting way to do business. The manager was informed, the closer was informed and the lady after the closer (from the corporate office) that visited the table to find the reason ---again that we were not willing to purchase. The main reason is that we are in the process of purchasing a home and don't want to buy a TS before we do that. The lady from the corporate office tried to convince us that to have a \"mortgage\" on our credit report is a good thing to have when you are about to buy a home. It shows that we \"can handle two mortgages LOL. We didn't bite. We were also informed that these units (older) are the ones used for the \"tours\" and they are not putting money into repairing them because they are scheduled to be demolished and funds will be put into the new units to be built. There is not Wi-Fi in the rooms. We had to use the computer at the front office and be charged $5.99/day. that's the first place I've ever been to that didn't have Wi-Fi.

It's changed hands a number of times. As a former Florida resident I would go up to Disney at least once a year. I've been here with a group of girlfriends, with family, with children, and I loved the place. I never bought into the timeshare, I'd just call up and see if there were any units available to rent. I've stayed in December, over holiday weekends and pretty much any time I felt like it. The rates were super cheap and I enjoyed having my own bedroom and bath. The last time I stayed was with my husband. I got a call at our home in Florida offering us a \"customer loyalty\" deal. I actually PAID to hear the timeshare pitch. What a moron I am! We were to get two nights of accomodation, breakfast and two tickets to Disney. Since we were moving out of state, I thought one last trip to Disney World would be a nice way to say goodbye. Check in was a nightmare. We had to go to one place for the vouchers, then fight traffic on Irlo Bronson Hwy to get to the resort. Then we waited around forever. Customers came up complaining about the clenliness, or lack there of, of their units. I was thinking seriously of bailing, but they already had our money, so we hung in there. Our room was a huge disappointment. I had wanted a two bedroom unit because my husband snores like a bear. We had a one bedroom with a double bed. When I called down to the desk to complain, their answer was, \"if you're an owner, you can get what you want.\" Wow. Way to sell me on your customer service. Our plan was to do the timeshare thing early, get it out of the way and then head to the park. Our appointment was for 10:00 am. Due to a huge number of people though, we waited until nearly noon before we could sit down with a high pressure salesman and crush his dreams. I told him up front that there was no way we were going to buy his timeshare. We still had to hear the pitch and take the tour. Remember, I've been staying here for years, so I knew the place better than he did. He tried some bogus math on us to convince us that the place was worth the equivalent of a million dollars. It was cute, in a pathetic way. Finally we were free to go. We arrived at Disney in the early afternoon and tried our best to have a good time. When we arrived back to the unit, late in the evening, the family next door to us was apparently using the furniture as a trampoline. Their kids were screaming, yelling and thumping like crazy. We heard everything clearly through the tissue paper walls. Finally, their Ritalin kicked in and I was able to enjoy a few hours of sleep, on the floor, with the kitchen fan on to drown out any noise. This place has gone down hill. I can't imagine anyone thinking that it is worth even $100 per night, let alone BUYING it as a time share. The proximity to WDW is reasonable, but it's in Kissimmee, out in the wilderness practically. This visit is the one that moved me to stay on WDW property last year.

We arrived to the hotel around 1pm, two hours before the check in time, and the staff was ready to check us in no problem. We were very happy as we had traveled all day from NY. The room was in the \"800\" building, which was perfect as the view off the balcony was right over the lagoon, and waterpark. The room was very clean, and better than we expected after reading the negative reviews. The full equipped kitchen was just that, everything we needed was there to cook and store.( FYI there is a Super Walmart just around the corner 5 min away). We saved a lot of money by stocking our fridge and cupboards. There is a Publix grocery store also 5 min. in the other direction, but much more expensive. Having the washer/dryer combo was also great, we just washed our own towels and washcloths as they do charge for replacements, but big deal if you can throw them in while your eating, or resting. The waterpark was awesome!!! Our kids had a blast, and never got tired of the waterslides. The water was very clean and clear, and 3ft deep on one side, 4ft deep on the other. i just put my sons lifejacket on because the pressure of the waterslide pulls you under momentarily when coming out. The park was staffed with 4 lifeguards at all times, who by the way were GREAT!! I saw them jump in the water several times, many times not needed but they were very cautious, and always on the ball. The restaurant \"Shipwreck Sallys\" was right at the waterpark area. The menu was reasonably priced, and the food was really good. Advice to buy your own alchohol as the drinks were pricey, good but pricey. The one complaint I did have was the activity center. The employees over there were not very helpful. We took a paddleboat out for a ride and they acted as though they would rather have a nap than help us. But that wouldnt stop me from going back there. i definatley plan on going back next year. Also upon check in a woman offered to have me for a \"VIP Breakfast\". Of course this was a timeshare meeting and wasnt mandatory. They offer you $75 cash, or discounts off Disney tickets if you go to this. I figured why not for $75. I went alone, and had to sit through 2 hours of pure torture listening to the rep tell me how I would be silly not to buy a timeshare. Then get bullyd by his \"manager\" when I said I wasnt buying. But I did this at 8am, and was $75 richer by 10am in time to go to the waterpark. We just blew it on dinner at Joes Crabshack which by the way I recommend. Great seafood and the staff dances, and make balloon animals. Another FYI, I will take this with me next time, people go to the waterpark starting at 8am and save loungers with towels. I dont think this is something that is right because there are a lot of people left without chairs, and the saved ones are empty a lot of times as people go back and forth to the water and their rooms. I think next time I will join this madness though because it is nice when you dont have to be a \"chair stalker\" all day.

Washer/dryer made it very convenient to pack less since we were flying to Orlando. Just to let you know-all 1-bedroom units have a QUEEN bed and fold out sofa. We thought it had a king. The 2-bedroom units have a King bedroom, a second bedroom with 2 full size beds and also a fold out sofa. My son loved the water park. He and my husband had a blast doing karaoke by the water park at night. We did so much Disney/SeaWorld stuff that we didn't have time to do all we wanted at Liki Tiki but loved everything we did. We booked through a place online (the-vacation-store) for only $239 for the whole week. NO LIE!! We had to do the 90 minute timeshare presentation but who cares for that cheap price we did it. At the end, we just said that we weren't interested and still got 2 free Disney tickets. If I had a complaint about anything at all it would be that the water park was somewhat over-crowded at times. We learned that owners in their timeshare group can come in and use the water park even if they aren't staying there at the time. It wasn't unbareable but just keep a super close eye on kids especially if they are young. This pool area doesn't get over 4 feet deep so it's great for younger kids but still the older ones can be a little much around them if not careful.

After reading several poor reviews we were a little hesitant but overall found this a nice place to stay. They provide free transportation to and from both Disney and Universal. The service was very good and they brought us any additional items we needed, extra blankets, toilet paper, etc for our condo unit. The pool area is nice but is really geared towards smaller children ages 12 and under. Not a lot to do for teens older than 12. They do have paddle boats and fishing gear to rent but there is a fee for this. There is a very small gameroom as well but only has a few games and an air hockey table. There is a bar and grill near the pool. Very limited menu and hours and they close early, however the bartenders were friendly. The food there is okay and the drinks a bit over priced but handy if you plan to spend the day by the pool. Some of the downsides of the hotel were that there was no phone book in the room nor any instructions on how to use the telephones. Also the sales people for timeshares can be a bit aggressive if you are not a current owner but they do give out some good freebees if you take the tour and have the breakfast. Some tips I would offer is when checking in ask for a list of restaurants in the area that deliver. They provided us with several different restaurants and coupon offers. One place I would recommend is JT's, only about 2 miles away. This restaurant provides free transportation for you and your family and the food and drinks are very affordable, much cheaper than the restaurant on site. They have a gameroom for the kids and usually entertainment nightly.

As for service we didn't need any major help other than changing in towels and the check - in went fine. The pool is wonderful and there is plenty of room pool side for all types of travellers( lots of kids but lots of sun tanners too.)We read up on this resort AFTER purchasing the 2 wks.and all we read was negative reviews so needless to say we were nervous and scared. We aren't by any means low class travellers but if it's good enough for my kids it's good enough for me and the kids love it here. When they are asking to go home from Disney to do the water slides at the hotel that is the best feeling. We stayed in the 1000 building but there is a new building 1300. Good luck trying to make requests for a certain building ,anyone I talked to there that has been a # of times say that they have never had their request met. I still would try to request. The only thing that we read that was true and very annoying was the walls are very thin, like paper!

To our right was the very spacious bathroom; through a sliding door were the Jacuzzi; another sink and washer and dryer with a spacious closet. The master bedroom was very spacious with an entrance to the patio. The full kitchen had everything they said and more, and we saved a lot of money on eating out and just bought stuff to make from the publix which is about 1 minute away from the resort. We loved the dining area, and living room which also led to the patio. My daughter enjoyed the patio a lot because it overlooked one of the three pools, spa, fitness center and she was excited to be feeding the ducks every morning as they visited our window expecting bread. That is just the room. The resort amenities are great just too bad it was not warmer to fully enjoy them. Whatever you see on the websites about the water parks, bar, playgrounds etc.... it\u2019s all true! Our stay was an absolute joy and money saver. You can spend the day there as opposed to going to Wet N Wild, Busch Gardens, and Disney etc... It is located on US 192 which connects you to all the parks just mentioned. Service was great. Any problems we had been taken care of. I read some bad reviews about the place and I am sorry to hear of those people's terrible time but ours was totally opposite. I read about insect problems, customer service problems, room problems etc but we just did not have that. I think a lot of the problems people have are just due to the overall upgrade needed for the place. The insect problem is due to the water park, pools, spa etc and heat bugs are attracted to heat and water. The room problems I think are just based on the fact that a lot of upgrades are needed. Whatever lack of customer service experienced is inexcusable. You don't be rude to people especially if they are guests/clients. You spend money you expect service period, so anyone who went through that it is really unfortunate as that is a vacation spoiler.

About 45 min passed and we heard nothing... so we called the front desk from my cell phone. It took us 3 tries before we could even talk to anyone ! The first call went unanswered. We tried again and this time whoever answered on the other end hung up on us.. so on the third try we were told the room was ready and to come back to the front desk. We were glad to hear the room was ready so we went back to the desk. The front desk supervisor asked for our last name and then gave us a key to the room. Piece of cake!!!! WRONG... we go over to the room which we had to enter through an enclosed porch. As we were going to put the key in the door, I saw a woman sitting on the couch inside watching tv! Immediately my sister and I walked out (with our luggage in tow) and went back to the front desk to tell them that someone was in our room!!!! Come to find out, the front desk SUPERVISOR failed to check our FIRST name and sent us to a room that was already occupied (with someone with the same last name ----not a very common last name either). She apologized and sent us to another building . Once again thinking we were going to the correct place, we dragged our luggage to the elevator to go to the top floor! When we got in the elevator, a couple guys working on the grounds also were getting in the elevator... which was fine... BUT the elevator didn't work!!! The thing wouldn't move!!! The door shut but it didn't move.... when they guys decided they weren't using the elevator, we got out !!! We dragged our luggage up to the top floor via the stairs. OK, enter room # 2 ... we were to have a 2 bdrm/2 bath . This was a one bedroom1 bathroom.... and very small . We called the front desk and were told that they saw what we were \"supposed to have\" and told us to come back. By now we're ready to call it a day and go someplace else. We went back to see the front desk supervisor AGAIN!!!! This time she was telling us we needed to pay an \"Upgrade fee\" to get the room we had already paid for ! But, she decided (good call) that since we had already been trying to checkin for more than an hour that she would talk to her supervisor and get the fee waived! We went to the CORRECT room and were pleasantly surprised. The place was 2 bdrm/2bathroom with a BIG SCREEN TV. We forgot about the ordeal we had at the front desk and had a great week here. The only problem I remember in the room was the jacuzzi tub would turn on by itself.. which freaked us out. It did it twice and then didn't do it again.

I am pleased to say that everything went beautifully, staff was friendly; rooms were clean, the pool was excellent and most importantly the kids had a blast. Upon checking in, front desk staff said they couldn't promise us a room in the newer buildings (1000, 1200, 1300), but said they'd do their best. To their word, we got a large two bedroom suite in the 1200 building with a full kitchen, plasma screen TV, full laundy facilities, very peaceful sitting area facing the forest. (it was screened - bugs weren't a problem at all). The older townhouses did look dated and i was very happy that we only got to experience the brand new suites. I think as previous people have commented - that is one of the keys to a pleasant stay at this resort. It doesn't seem you can reserve a newer suite ahead of time. when you check in, it's a first-come first-serve basis - or so it appears. As for location - I'm not sure what some of the complaints are about. Disney parks were under 10 miles by car (by Toronto commuting standards - that's heaven); publix grocery store was five minutes; wal-mart was under 10 minutes and there was a lot of restaurants close by. As for the pool - no it's not Wet n' wild. it's a hotel pool complex. A lot more elaborate than just a swimming pool for sure. The kids loved it. I read some previous reviews where the on-duty lifeguards were too strict, sometimes not strict enough in watching over the pool activities. huh? you know, complaints are getting a little carried away when you have that type of conflicting viewpoints. But to each his/her own. For a young crew, I found them to be well in control of things, while still allowing everyone to have their fun. There is not maid service every day. Personally, I have no problem with that. In fact, on a week's vac i like the fact that they're not in there every day cleaning up. How dirty can things get in 1 week? As far as clean towels, you call a number, ask, and they were delivered promptly. no problems at all. So for those planning a trip to this resort, take all of the reviews with a grain of salt please - positive and negative. This resort is definitely not the 'horror' that some make it out to be.

She promised we would be done in one hour and would receive a free week at a timeshare resort for our trouble. She also said no sales person would talk to us unless we requested it so, imagine our surprise when we were greated by a salesman who took us to a table to watch the presentation and then drive us crazy to buy. The first \"reward\" for the Liki Tiki required a $15 deposit from some cheezy marketing company called Tiano Incentives. They sent a junky paper certificate to request where you want to vacation & then required another $18.50 to process the request. Over two weeks after the second check was cashed, we still don't have a confirmation and have no idea what hotel it might be - they give you no clue so they will probably ask us to upgrade for another fee. The second \"free reward\" for the one hour presentation (that really took two hours) requires a $100 \"refundable\" deposit (after you take the vacation & request the refund in writing) then a fee of $160 per person double occupancy. We aren't going to bother with it because of all the red tape involved. The Liki Tiki was an ok resort if you don't mind crowds. We didn't get to enjoy it much because we checked in after 4:00 (as required) on Sunday, the timeshare presentation was Monday and it started raining by the time we were done. They talked us into wasting our morning on Tuesday and checkout was at 10:00 am. My advise would be not to do it if you think you're going to get a free vacation by taking a tour.", "Date": "September 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "indiana", "Title": "\u201cI know why it's called Leaky Tiki!!\u201d", "Author": "jenjen789", "ReviewID": "UR5728377", "Content": "My family and I stated at the Liki Tiki the week of August 12, 2006.

Five years ago, when the resort was under the Ron Jon name, it was really great. So good infact that we booked a second week. The rooms were great and it really was a 5 star resort. We decided to return this year with our son and his family and right from the start the difference was clear. The room we were assigned was a 2 story town-house typeithout enough linnens and a leaky patio roof with obvious mold growing in the cracks and a clothes dryer that didn't work/ . The evening of our arrival , my grandson went onto the balcony and ripped his shirt on exposed metal on the railing. They fixed the railing but offered no compensation for the torn shirt. Thank God he didn;t cut himself. Trying to get extra linens was a farce. It took 4 phone calls to an answering machine to get towels and pool towels for the family. By the time we received them we then had enough linens to open up a linen store. Yes they did fix the railing the next day and also eventually fixed the dryer. Again after multiple calls. There were three swimming pools, two of which had no lifeguard or staff supervision, which allowed all the kids to do whatever they felt like although part of this should be blamed on parental lack or indifference. The Lagoon offered minature golf( 9 holes which you got to play twice for 10 dollars), Bumper boats ( Out of commission because an alligator was in the Lagoon) A totally over-crowded wave pool and water slides with children running amok They did have a life guard there. The phone systen was another story. On Thursday evenings the resort offers a luau dinner and show for $30 per, which is nice but starting on Sunday you start getting 2 or 3 calls a day about signing up for the party. After the third day we called the operator and asked to not be disturbed about the luau any more. She could not do anything to stop these messages and basically told us to disconnect the phones, which when plugged in again had all the luau messages that we missed. To throw salt in the wound on thursday we got 4 messages for the friday night fish fry. At checkout we were billed for over $5 worth of phone calls which we made with the phones disconnected. Next they sent us a bill to our home for these calls and upon inquiry there was no manager available to help[ us.

If you are looking for a place close to Disney, don't mind a large crowd and are not looking for quality just a pool and room, than this is your place. But if you are expecting a star resort this is not the place. We are timeshare owners and have exchanged many times in the past and we were pleased. We own in Myrtle Beach at Ellington(a festiva resort) this is a first rate gold star resort. What we got in exchange, we should have stayed in a regular hotel room and saved our week. If you are seasoned traveler and are used to great resorts with a smaller crowd this is not the place for you. You will not get the quailty that you are accustomed to. I promise. The facilities are old. My first clue that this place was not top standard was the long line to check in. I thought I was at the local hotel and not a timeshare resort. Anyplace that you have to place your trash outside on the lawn is not top rate when it stays there all day. To me it was very obvious that this place have a lot of non-timeshare clients. We expect more and better facilities. The carpet was not clean, the sofa was not clean. The laundry dryer's knobs were broke, the masterbed headboard has some brown stains, the tv in the master bedroom was sitting on top of the chest, and was only 19 inches. We had a townhouse and it was in bad shape. The master suite did have a small one person whirlpool tub. Not the larger version. The paint was peeling. Compared to other 2 bedroom villas that I have stayed in, this was not spacious at all. Who want's to climb stairs all the time. The second bedroom did not even have a tv. There was an old vcr player. The very old kind. Not many people have vhs now days its dvd people!. To make a long story short, my 11 year old thought it was poor quality. Don't take the chance that I did and be disappointed. Stay some where else. I wish I had. I hate that I gave Interval my nice 3 bedroom villa in mytrle beach for this dump. I am not a high class sob. I am a pt working homeschool mom with 3 kids. I think Embassy Suites is 100% better. And they don't claim to be a star hotel much less a star resort.

The young lady at the desk was very helpful and from my experience everyone that we met, who worked for the resort was very polite and helpful. Yes the place is a little dated, but from talking to a few people this was one of the first reorts built in orlando. We noticed that they were upgrading furniture, televisions and all that and are in the process of breaking ground on 50 acres that they purchased to add more condos, lake and a lazy river. our room was more than enough for the five of us, very clean when we arrived and my wife was concerned with the whirlpool tub when it kept turning on by itself so she called the front desk, and was told that it has a built in self cleaner and after all parties are finished bathing it automatically cleans itself, pretty nice. There are 3 pools at the resort, two regular and then the Liki Tiki Lagoon, which is geared toward kids, deepest is 4 feet, five slides, and water squirting everywhere, 3 to 4 lifegaurds on duty at all times, Shipwreck Sally's where food and drink is served, and activities throughout the day for anyone who does not want to swim or gets tired of swimming. The food is very good and not priced that bad.

Now the bad, the only thing that we did not like about the resort was that at 5pm they have happy hour and on certain days karoke at the lagoon, we do not drink, but we respect others who decide to partake in the alcohol, the problem we had (even though lifegaurds are on duty) is that some parents bellied up to the bar and commenced to get drunk while their children were running around the lagoon, we made a statement to someone in charge and we were told that the bar only serves 3 drinks to each person, but the problem is that they will drink in the room and then come down to the lagoon with kids in tow, now i do not have a problem with that its just (to me) not very good for the kids to see a bunch of drunks acting a fool, seems the resort could move that to a seperate location away from the kids (just me).

Check-in was quick and smooth. We were in the 200 block of townhomes. Nice idea, with screened-in porch, living areas and full bath downstairs and two bedrooms including master bath ensuite upstairs. I felt bad for anyone in the 2nd bedroom who may need to use the washroom during the night - they have to go downstairs! The architect wasn't thinking, I guess. The unit was basically clean, but details were missing. The shower rod was a little (c)rusty, there were marks and stains on walls that a simple wiping down could probably remove, towel hooks were missing in one bathroom, but the frame was still screwed to the wall. The shower pressure was so poor in the master bath, we gave up and just took showers in the downstairs bathroom. If you need to sleep in total darkness, this is the wrong place for you unless you have a super-duper blackout sleep mask. The rooms are SO bright in the morning, you'd best have a pair of sunglasses on the nightstand. TVs in the living room and master bedroom were no bigger than 20\"; the second BR didn't have one. And the channel choice was very limited. It would be nice if they printed new channel guides to replace the outdated, over-photocopied one you are given when you check in, especially since it isn't even accurate! There is more than adequate closet space in the 2nd bedroom, and drawer space in the master bedroom, for a one-week stay, but the opposite isn't so. The blankets and bedspreads could use an updating, but they did seem clean. Very important - unlike some others who have posted reviews - we didn't see one bug inside the unit. On a very positive note, we complained after the 1st night that the master bedroom mattress was impossible to sleep on. They sent someone from maintenance to check it out, and we got some song-and-dance about how the warehouse might not have a new one. He must have realized just how bad the mattress was, because they miraculously found one and made the change that afternoon. If you saw what they took off the bed...... AND THERE WAS A BOARD BETWEEN THE MATTRESS & BOX SPRING!!! Obviously, the dilapidated, decrepit, unfit for human sleep of a mattress was already known to be in need of replacement. Why did they have to wait for a request for free chiropractic and massage services to do it??? The so-called Water Park was great for children up to the age of 8. Can't figure out why it only opens at 11, especially since it is so incredibly hot this time of year. If you want to keep your children out of the midday sun, it's best to choose one of the other pools and get an early start. There is some effort toward resort-like activities, but they seem to fall a little short. The mini-golf is, well, miniature with about 6 holes. There is a nice playground for the younger kids. There are tennis courts and a basketball court for the older ones. We wanted to rent a surrey bike one afternoon, but they seem to have only 1 of each size, and the small one we needed was broken. Can't comment on the food or prices. Shipwreck Sally's, located at the lagoon, is open every day. At the pool behind the shilling room, I mean free breakfast where they try to sell a timeshare to you, there is a little hut which opened one day for drinks, snacks and hot dogs; business was so slow, I guess they decided to stay closed the rest of the week even though the pool got busier with every passing day. Generally speaking, the place is okay. It's not luxurious. It doesn't overwhelm with outstanding amenities. It's clean but not spotless. Service was relatively efficient, although don't bother calling the front desk 'after hours'. We wanted information about access to internet services and a printer, and got tired of waiting for someone to answer the phone after 8 p.m. 'Customer Care' will respond rather quickly between 9 and 5.

When we got there after having a very long trip from Cali, the customer service reps say that rooms are available on a first come-first serve basis and they are SOLD OUT!!! NO ROOMS AVAILABLE. We have already traded our time share, which is paid for obviously and paid the transfer fee up front. There are no managers on duty and everyone seems to walk away because they don't know what to do. Finally about and hour later, (and let me have you know - we are on our first trip with our two children ages 9 mos and 2.5 sitting in the car with me so they do not see the anger in mine or my husbands eyes), they say they've found us a room?? So, after reading many reviews and knowing my daughter would be crawling all over, I asked for a newer room up front, and since they didn't have a room available at all, we of course got put in the sh*** section. The rooms are OK. They're are nothing compared to what we traded for. Another HUGE thing the sucked was our card keys wouldn't work work. We carry a lot of stuff w/us w/two small children and we are carrying one of them, too. We had to drive back to the lobby once to get new ones (they give you 2 and neither worked) and one time we called security to bring us new keys because we weren't going to the lobby again plus both kids were asleep on our shoulders while we stood there and waited. We tried calling the front desk for different questions and the phone would ring and ring - no answer. One time, I was on hold for so long that I hung up and called back.

When a customer has a good experience, they tell some of the people they know. When they have a bad experience, they tell anyone who will listen. My girlfriend attended a home show in Clearwater, FL in march 2006. For $49.95, and a promise to attend a timeshare presentation, she received a 3 days/2 nights stay at Liki Tiki. And we arrived today\u2026 About a week ago, I wanted to look at the resort so I \u201cGoogled\u201d Liki Tiki Village and came across quite a few reviews. Know what I found amazing? The spread between absolutely wonderful and absolutely atrocious. There wasn\u2019t anything in the middle. It seems like either you loved Liki Tiki it or hated it. So I had to say I was skeptical. But away my mind worked, from \u201cWell, it\u2019s easier to rave or trash than get into detail\u201d to \u201cthese people have an ax to grind\u201d to \u201cthese people must work for the resort\u201d. And yes, there are 2 things I WILL NOT stand for when I travel. Rudeness and dirty or unhealthy accommodations. First, I have been coming to Orlando now for about 20 years, some years 6 or 8 times in the year. Yes, some times for 1 night, sometimes for a long weekend a few for 5 days and everything in between. So while not a travel expert, I have experienced quite a bit in the area. Don\u2019t think this place is a Marriott, it isn\u2019t. Marriott is in another class, up there with Hilton, Hyatt, Loews. This isn\u2019t a full service hotel, it\u2019s a timeshare resort that also rents rooms and sells vacations to fill space otherwise unoccupied. It\u2019s common in the business. The only complaint in the 1st day was that my girlfriend had to check in 3 miles east of I-4 for the timeshare presentation only to be told to drive west to the resort for the presentation. She went there, her son and I wet to Disney for a couple of hours (we have annual passes). Afterwards, she said while they didn\u2019t take the 1st or 2nd \u201cNo\u201d, they did take the 3rd. Which is common in sales anyway. It was firm pressure, but it wasn\u2019t \u201chard sell\u201d. Afterwards, check-in took less than 10 minutes. The staff we dealt with was friendly and helpful. The room was in one of the older buildings, 200 series. 2 story townhouse. Yes, they don\u2019t give you a lot of amenities like toilet paper, or soap, etc. They only give you clean towels when you ask for them. But again, this isn\u2019t a 5 star, 1st class hotel. Hell, even Disney doesn\u2019t give you clean towels every day any longer unless you toss them in the empty tub. It was clean, it was cold, the ice maker had been turned on. There wasn\u2019t any dirt we could see or bugs around we could find. By the way, we live near Tampa, ie in FL. We know what a problem bugs are down here. It\u2019s an unending battle to keep them out of the house. And sometimes, no matter what you do, some get inside. I have only found 1 way to keep the bugs out. Don\u2019t keep any food or dirty clothes in the house. So if you have someone occupy a property prior to you and they left food out, housekeeping will have a hell of a time getting rid of the bugs. Don\u2019t blame Liki Tiki because the people prior to you who used the room were slobs. Liki Tiki isn\u2019t a traditional hotel. Look at the back of the front doors. The rooms don\u2019t have the traditional hotel rate cards required of hotels and motels. Comparing it to Marriott is comparing Apples to Freight Trains (forget Oranges). Like I said, Marriott is a 5 star, 1st class, full service hotel. Liki Tiki isn\u2019t that. I looked at the \u201cregular\u201d prices for this place. $649 for 6 days and 5 nights. And it included 2 - 4 day tickets to Disney with the Park Hopper option. I think they cost about $200 each. So, right away, you know that you\u2019re paying $300 or less for the lodging portion. $50 a night. I have stayed at most Marriott and Hilton properties within a 10 mile radius of Disney over the years. I never paid $50 a night. I did pay $35 a night for a Best Western once, a motel, without anything except a pool. And oh, the terms for Liki Tiki? It\u2019s a timeshare, you have to sit through the sales presentation. Don\u2019t knock Liki Tiki because you got a steal of a deal from Marriott. Now, on to the facility itself. I found nothing wrong with it. I really didn\u2019t. I stay at Hiltons and Marriotts when I travel for business and I have been in some a lot cleaner than here and a few a lot dirtier. And even if we had paid $50 a night here(we paid $50 for 2 nights), we got a lot. Yeah, it isn\u2019t a \u201cwater park\u201d. Duh, this place is a small resort, you think you\u2019re going to get Adventure Island (Busch Gardens), Typhoon Lagoon (Disney) or Wet \u2018n Wild in Orlando? Get a clue! You\u2019re paying $50 a night! Yeah, the pools are noisy till about 9pm. Duh, at Disney, pools are noisy till midnight!!! This is a FAMILY VACATION AREA! It\u2019s like people moving into a neighborhood with kids then getting mad that the kids play outside or make noise. Duh, this place attracts FAMILES. FAMILES COME WITH KIDS! We didn\u2019t eat here yet, we\u2019ll see if and when. For what you get, it is outstanding. And convenient. The 5 year old loved the pool. It was convenient to Disney, yeah, maybe a 15 min drive, but then, we\u2019re paying a lot less than a Disney hotel (I\u2019ve stayed in them all) and this side of I-4 is an easy drive to Disney property. Yeah, you need to bring some things, if you want to. But how many people have the chance to wash any laundry on vacation? Normally you don\u2019t at all. Here you can if you want, just get some laundry supplies on the way in. Yeah, you only get 1 roll of paper towels and one packet of dishwasher soap. Well um, when was the last time you went to a hotel and even had the washing machine, kitchen and dishwasher in the room? Unless you\u2019re a Marriott \u201cInterval Vacation\u201d owner, even 1st class hotels don\u2019t provide that. And 3 grocery stores & Super Walmart are less than a 10 min drive. Yeah, this place probably has some rooms that are run down or in need of refurbishment. It\u2019s old. Probably 15 or 20 years. So are most hotels up and down 192. So are many along International Drive. Every place has wear & tear. Don\u2019t beat up this place because it has some. Again, you\u2019re paying $50 a night. And with it\u2019s amenities, it an outstanding bargain. You want Marriott, go stay at World Center, it starts around $200 a night. Or The Hilton at Walt Disney World, it starts around $125 a night. Again, outstanding bargain for what you pay, outstanding bargain for what you receive. I may even do the presentation just so we can come back for the $49.95. Don\u2019t knock this place because it isn\u2019t a Marriott, it isn\u2019t one and it isn\u2019t fair to compare it to one.", "Date": "June 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Cod, MA", "Title": "\u201cHad a wonderful time\u201d", "Author": "amesisland", "ReviewID": "UR5294642", "Content": "We stayed at the Liki Tiki resort in May of 2006.

We had a fantastic time at the Like Tiki and I highly recommend it! We encountered only one issue during our stay which was quickly rectified by the staff. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and were assigned to stay in the 800 building. Unfortunately, our room was on the first floor right next to the entrance to the Liki Tiki Lagoon water park and bar (and there was a kareoke party going on). While inside the room, you could not hear anything but it was hard to sit on our patio without everyone seeing us and the music was a little loud. We asked the front desk to be moved to a quieter spot and they quickly moved us to the 1200 building. This building is newer and the room was a little larger than the first (bathroom was huge!). I thought both of our rooms were spotless and very nicely decorated but if you want a newer, larger room, I would recommend requesting the 1200 building. The waterpark was a blast for our son. Plenty of lifeguards on duty also. We spent 1/2 of our time at the parks and 1/2 of our time at the resort. There was so much to do at the resort, always children's activities, bar specials, kareoke parties, Luau party etc. Sometimes the waterpark was a little too busy so we would go over to one of the other pools at the resort to relax because there was hardly anyone at these pools. It was great to be able to make breakfast and supper in our room and just pay for lunch at the parks. There is a Super Walmart and Publix right down the street and plenty of restaurants nearby.

After reading a few reviews here I was somewhat apprehensive about it, but we went ahead and booked anyway. I'm so glad we did!!! We rented a 2 BR condo in one of the highrise units (as opposed to the townhomes). It was beautiful!! Great decor and immaculately clean. Having a full kitchen, washer/dryer, and 2 baths really made this place feel like home away from home. It was very cool to come home with CLEAN clothes, instead of bags packed with dirty clothes. There were 4 of us, and we had all kinds of room to spread out and relax. The location is great, too... not too close to the theme parks, yet just a short drive away. The liki tiki lagoon is great for younger kids, and really really cute. My sons, ages 9 & 13, did not like the lagoon pools...too shallow. They are more suited for younger kids. My boys really enjoyed the other two pools, though. The only down side to that, is that the tiki bar is at the liki tiki lagoon. My husband would have liked staying in one of the town homes because they have outdoor patios, and screened in porches...also no stairs or elevators to access them! It seemed to me that the townhomes were not kept up as well as the highrise condos, but I never actually went inside one. We had very minimal involvement with the staff. We checked in on a Saturday night, and the front desk was very busy, so check in took quite a while. The toaster in our room did not work, and they replaced it within an hour. I think that some of the condo's and townhomes are privately owned, and some are resort owned. That may make some difference in the upkeep of individual units, but ours was absolutely wonderful. There is a Publix grocery store just down the street, and it came in very handy. They had everything we needed, including pool supplies, film, beer and wine. I'm sure Walmart is cheaper, but it was very convenient. WARNING!!! DO NOT ATTEND THE V.I.P. BREAKFAST!! It's a complete sales pitch when they try to get you to purchase a timeshare, or something. We did not attend one, but saw them in action, and they were obnoxious! They try to lure you in by giving you free dinner show tickets. Don't do it!!!

Thats like going to Las Vegas and saying this hotel had a casino in it and catered to gamblers...DUH..it's Vegas. All resorts cater to children and families, that is why people go to Orlando, Disney, Universal, if they don't then people won't stay there. Do yourself a favor, look elsewhere for a resort. I give this resort a 2 star and thats being generous. I'll give you a little sample of what to expect. We checked in on Friday, got a room in the 600 building, which is one of the older buildings, the newest being 1200. The accomodations were the worst I've ever seen, tiles cracked in the kitchen, pieces of the countertop all damaged, outside of the refrigerator all banged up. I mean this was really bad. So my wife complains and they move us to the 1100 building. We move the next day, get all our luggage unpacked ready to go out for breakfast and my wife spots a few ants on the kitchen counter top by the sink. She cleans them up and were off. We come back later that afternoon and now we have a bunch more ants, so she cleansd it up again and heads to the front desk to show them. They decide they are going to move us again, this time to the 1200 building. Now we pack all our luggage up again, take our toddlers to 1200. We get there, I am about to slide the key when a gentleman smoking a cigerette on the balcony says \"Excuse me, that's my room.\" So I check the paper they gave my wife and its the right room. So now she goes back to the front desk with our toddlers in tow while I wait with all our luggage at the 1200 building getting eaten alive by mosquitos. They give us accomodations back in the 1100 building, the unit directly below where we had the ant problem. And to make up for all this they offered us a free lunch, and a noon check out instead of 10 am. Well, we passed on the free lunch. But I will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER waste time share or recommend thsi place to anyone. And as far as all those fun kids activities they try to sell you on, forget it. They have one 4 seat paddle boat that is broken, two single seat character boats that are always out. Then you can rent a for seat bike or two seat bike, they only have one each. the pool area is tiny, not much of a water park if you ask me. The kiddie pool was dirty, the jets didn't work, and the picture they show of the octopus with the baby seats must be ancient, there are no seats anymore.

We informed the front desk we needed a ground unit or elevator assessible unit due to health reasons, and we were told appropriate accommodations would be made for us. When we arrived back at the resort at about 2:15, we were informed that a glitch in our reservation had resulted in us checking out on Sunday, 3/26, and not 3/30; which is the vacation we had originally purchased through Orbitz. The staff assured us they would make the changes, they said to take the unit they had for us, and they would notify us when the corrections were made to our reservations. At first, we were more than skeptical about signing the front desk reservation agreement, and instead simply initialed the part that acknowledged we were checking in to the unit, but did not sign the stay agreement. Much to the staff's credit, they fixed the problem before we left the front desk. Our first unit was 308c. This is an older unit. We were pleased that it was ground level, and could park almost right in front of the unit. The unit itself was newly decorated with new appliances and ammentities. It was a pleasant, spacious, and a well equiped unit. However, the unit was two story, with living quarters on the first floor and sleeping quarters on the second floor! This made navigation of the unit difficult and uncomfortable for us. Aside from the fact it was two story, the unit's linai and upstairs balcony looked out across a parking lot to an 8 foot wood fence, and the towering Summer Bay Resort in the distance. On top of that, the balcony had an errie slope that made one feel they were sliding off onto the top of the linai. We decided that the unit was unacceptable for us, and called the front desk for a change. We were told no other units were available for that evening, and to call back at 10am the next day. We called down the next morning and were told another unit would be available at 2pm, and to check in at the front desk. We arrived at 2:15 and were assigned another unit, 1123e. With the exception of re-programming the keys, the transition went off rather smoothly. Another guest informed us that his party had just left the 1100 block, and the rooms were nice. One tip we will bring up here is that of manners. While waiting for our new unit, a guest began to demand a room prior to 4pm. She stated that because of her \"connections\", she would not wait untill 4pm, and began to verbally abuse everyone on the front desk staff. She eventually huffed and puffed her way outside, while the staff laughed at her, for good reason. The old saying comes to mind, \"you attract more flies with honey, than you do with vinegar\". Attacking someone's abilities based on their race and ethnicity rarely gets you preferred treatment, and is just plain wrong. WOW! 1123e proved to be a HUGE uprgrade. The room was a two bedroom single floor with a nearby elevator and an exquisite view off the single balcony of forest land. The decor, ammentities, and appliances were all beautiful and efficient. Major bonus: The huge spa tub, big screen TV, and comfortable beds. The only down side with the unit was the clothes dryer which took two, eighty minute cyles to dry an average cotton load. However, we immediately felt at home and truly enjoyed the remainder of our stay in this unit. Perhaps the best feature of the resort was the water park. All the activities are located next to Ship Wreck Sally's pool bar. Our son participated in the Kid's Kamp activity for three hours at a cost of $15 US. It was very nice and comforting to enjoy the Liki Tiki punches at the bar, while being able to see him most of the time. Becky on the activies staff was outstanding, and really went the extra steps to make all the kids fit in and feel at home, Kudos. The water park is myriad slides, fountains, bridges, and entrances, including stairs and a slow decline walk in entrance which is vital for younger and senior guests. We highly recommend the all you can eat Friday Fish Fry for dinner, if you can make it. It is delicious and an extremely good value, ($8 US and $6 US for kids). Overall, we found the lay out of the water park and it's close proximity to the activities desk and pool bar to be exceptional, convenient, and well above average for typical time shares we have stayed at in Orlando. In closing, although we are not time share owners, we have stayed at several time shares in the US and Mexico. The Liki Tiki Villages, with the exception of our first unit lay out, was a good value, a pleasant stay, and an overall excellent vacation experience. We will not hesitate to stay in Liki Tiki Villages at this unit in the future. PS One warning we can offer is the commute time between the resort and I4. The resort is on SR 192, which is bottleneck all the way to the interstate. Our average commute time just to I4 was typically 30 to 45 minutes. Keep in mind that it will take you over an hour to get to the major theme parks located \"conviently minutes away\", but this is the case for all the resorts southwest of the parks as road construction continues.", "Date": "March 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire, UK", "Title": "\u201cLoved Liki Tiki!\u201d", "Author": "DarrenYorkshire_UK", "ReviewID": "UR4690988", "Content": "This is excellent accommodation, ideal base for Disney (5 mins drive) Universal (15 mins drive) & Busch Gardens (1 hour) My family (myself, wife & 2 kids 9 & 12) stayed in a spacious 1 bedroom unit which was superbly equipped with 2 tv's, DVD/video player, auto washer/dryer, huge fridge, microwave, dishwasher etc and a whirlpool bath.

The other bedroom consisted of twin beds, access to the same L-shaped balcony and plenty of closet and bureau space..We had the fifth person sleep on the pull-out couch downstairs.The downstairs consisted of a full kitchen(which we used everyday, a living room which has the pull-out couch, a washer and dryer in a closet and a screened in front porch(which was used often too).We only had a 21inch t.v. upstairs and downstairs but who goes on vacation to watch t.v.?

The front desk service was excellent, the few times we called(smoke detector battery and for cribs) they responded within 15mins and called after the issues were resolved to see if we were happy. Our only criticsm was we rented 2 cribs at $34 each for the week and they gave us Pack n Play (play-pens which have no mattress and a very thin bottom) so the infants would start the night off sleeping in the pack n plays and end up in our beds( which they never do at home), so if you bring infants, bring a thick blanket or something to put in the bottom. There is no maid service(we knew that before we got there), we had plenty of towels which we washed ourselves,and there is a dishwasher in the kitchen(which was stocked with plenty of dishes), so we cleaned our dishes every 3rd night and we left our trash by the side of the road and they picked up in the morning.

All of my friends thought I was crazy to purchase a vacation from Ebay, and after reading several negative reviews about Liki Tiki, I was beginning to think I might be crazy! LOL!! We took a leap of faith considering we got such a good deal. Check in was easy and the room was ready and clean. We had everything we needed in the room - full kitchen, dishwasher, washer and dryer, and everything to make it a homelike experience. The resort gave us starters like dishwashing and washer detergent, roll of towels, tissue paper, and other goodies to enjoy. We stayed in the 7000 building which overlooked the lagoon and lake. We enjoyed meals on the very large patio. We had a great time visiting the waterpark and pool daily. We declined the tour without further harrassment. The location is really great. Publix and Walmart were very convenient for our needs. We drove to WDW within 15 minutes. We've booked another vacation for July 2006. It's a great place to vacation for a family. It's not a fancy place but for us it was simple and sufficient. Here are my negatives though....Some of the staff couldn't speak English. Most of the staff that we dealt with weren't very friendy or \"vacation oriented\" in making us feel like guests. During transactions at the paddle boats it was like pulling teeth to get one kid to even speak. They could definitely use a customer service review with some of the staff. Also, at the Lagoon, I carried in a very small cooler for my 8 month old daughter full of milk bottles, baby food, crackers, water, medicine, sunscreen, diapers/wipes, etc. When we entered, the pool manager (without asking) took my bag off of my shouldar (and wanted to store it at the bar/grill)saying that \"we have everything you need (to purchase) at Shipwreck Sally's Bar,\" in which I replied, \"I doubt you carry breastmilk or baby food on your menu,\" and kindly took my bag from her hand. I was appauled with her behavior and inability to respect my personal belongings. She definitely could've approached this situation better! We did purchase items from the bar/grill daily such at lunches, snacks and drinks but no one is taking my infant's bag full of items that she needs while it's 90 degrees at a waterpark!!

Too many kids in the hot tub. 3. They could use supervision at the pool areas. Every thing else was perfect. The staff-members were attentive to any questions or problems.

We booked the trip last January through Expedia and got a wonderful package. I too read all the reviews, most favorable but some extremely unfavorable so I was prepared for the worst. We arrived on a Friday at 5:00 to find that our room was not ready, at 6 it was still not ready so we went to dinner. When we returned at 8:30 we were given a key to a room but when we got there we found the housekeeper in the middle of her routine. By now we are all exhausted and short on patience, I went back to the desk and requested a new room. The front desk was very apologetic and gave us a new room in the same building. Aside from the check-in I cannot say anything negative about our stay, the room was new and spotless, the beds very comfortable, the linens appeared new. Because of all the reviews I had seen I called the resort the week before we arrived and requested to be in a new building which they granted without a problem. The original town house style units look dated and I am sure the interiors are variable, buildings 500-800 are fairly new and face the pond and water park which can be loud at times. Buildings 900-1200 are across the parking lot and face \"woods\", they are extremely quiet and have screened balconies. There is a new building under construction, the workers are on site around 7am but we were up and out early ourselves. The construction is cinder blocks so I am not sure about the complaints of \"paper thin\" walls. We had neighbors around us and were not bothered to any significance. The location is remote, about 7 miles from the maingate of Disney down 192, I am sure during busy seasons this can be a problem, in October or November there was no traffic to speak of, we sailed into the parks and home again. Our trip was centered around Disney World so we spent little time at the resort except to sleep. It was nice to have coffee and breakfast on a few occassions in the unit but otherwise we did not take advantage of the kitchen or laundry facility. The flat panel TV in the living room was great and both bedrooms had 32 inch units as well. It was nice that the kids had their own room and bath. We did spend some time in the water park on 2 afternoons, my kids ages 7 and 8 loved it, thought it was great fun. It was certainly a unique feature to provide, the water park was well staffed with life guards as well. The grounds were well kept, there was a small playground and mini-golf as well as paddle boats for kids to enjoy. When we checked in we were asked to sign up for a \"tour\" breakfast which we declined and were never bothered again. For what we paid we had a very lovely and comfortable unit with plenty of space for all. You will spend plenty of money on food and other items in the parks, it was nice to be able to save on our accomodations.

The only complains I have were that at the time of the year we went warm weather is hit or miss - a few days we went to the little waterpark and the water was quite cold and there isn't a hottub in that pool area! They need a hottub over there so you can warm up! The so called lake is also more of a big pond but still nice. There is also a beachsand area and my kids had fun playing in the sand. Also we went to the timeshare thing - got the whole tour - the guy who talked to us was really nice, until the end when we told him no, then he brings in a manager to lower the price - we still said no and I was very surprised that he got very upset and was really trying to make us feel guilty. So if you can avoid the timeshare thing - unless you don't care and want the cheaper rate or free tickets like us!:>) Also the location was a little far for us. Way down on 192 - we've stayed on International Drive on previous trips and like that area. Although where the Liki Tiki is located is off of the main highway so it is secluted and quiet.

She got us a new unit later that night. They balked when I suggested they help us move our stuff. The new unit did smell clean, but as you walked in you noticed grout missing in the tile floor and still a two story. To tired to argue. Tried to order pizza but no phone book or hotel book. Tried to vacuum the carpets but no vacuum. tried to put our medecines and valuables in the safe but no safe. I called the front desk and asked for the General manager. I was told no management was on site. The desk staff was in charge but couldnt make any decisions. I called housekeeping for a frying pan that was supposed to be in the room (I had family coming over for breakfast). Housekeeping told me I would have to get on a list and see if any showed up at 10am during check out. Early next morning found a wasp nest over the balcony. I called the front desk. The exterminator showed up and sprayed the nest, spewing a liquid chemical all over the balcony and railing. When I requested he clean it up because I have children staying there, He suggested I call the front desk to help me. Next morning went on an owners walk and they showed me a $30,000.00 price tag. Went to the General Managers office. Told him about the Rudeness and lack of concern of his staff and the unclean facilities. He informed me we were now in a newly remodeled unit. Clue - fire the contractor. I told him we were going out and needed a safe. He said he wold try but couldnt guarantee anything. He offered me a free cleaning of the room and a free pass to the luau. I told him it was his job to clean my room and the luau didnt interest me. I told him he needede to get me into a single floor unit. Later that night he got us into the single floor unit. It was better but had drywall corner bead coming off. it was missing some of the required items but we were done with place. Tried to make the best of what we had left.

They could have gone around the corner to Walmart and bought a frying pan or a safe. These items would have cost them less than $60.00. I cant believe they handed me a $30,000.00 price tag but were not willing to give my family service. The worst thing a resort staff can do is tell a customer I dont know if I can help you.

Having seen the pictures of Liki Tiki on the web we believed the accomodation to be of a very high standard and looked like it ticked all the right boxes with the facilities on offer. Unfortunately whilst not bad enough to insist on a move the reality was quiet different as the accomodation was tired looking and in disrepair. The main issues were a broken entrance door, a leak in the conservatory area that sometimes formed in to a big puddle outside the door, stained furniture and a blocked toilet. In addition we had problems with the safe being locked on arrival and after renting a video for the children one evening we found the recorder did not work. One final problem was with small ant like creatures daily found on work surfaces in the kitchen. Whilst the resort responded to some of the issues we had, the place seemed to be more interested in selling timeshare with loads of visitors being shown around the pool areas whilst we relaxed. Whilst we had a couple of decent days on the complex the pools were very busy after 11am and quality of food was average at best. The worst part was the sheer volume and size of flying insects and ants that were attracted to you when eating etc so we chose to eat indoors or away from the complex after the first time. We would not return to Liki Tiki but would certainly go back to Florida as it was the best yet with regard to parks, shows and shopping, (as we hit the tax free week with loads of sales).", "Date": "August 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dundee, Scotland, UK", "Title": "\u201cexcellent place to say\u201d", "Author": "citylover0", "ReviewID": "UR3759209", "Content": "We have stayed at the Liki Tiki 2 years in a row and will be going back next year.

Room was very nice in size. I would give the room a \"6\" on a 1-10 on cleanliness. The pull out sofa bed was broken (leaned down where your head lays - just old I believe). The pool was completely over crowded, no room to swim even. My biggest compaint was the service. The service at the restaraunt/bar was terrible. The waitress was never there. The steaks for Saturday night were like shoe leather. (Although the chicken strips were good). The service for the room was absolutely lousy! We started cooking pizza ryes and realized we had no cookie sheet so they said they would send one right up. About 1 hour later (and 3 phone calls) we received it. We ended up cooking them on the oven rack and were done eating by the time it arrived. We called down for pillows and blankets another time as there were not enough in the room and got a recording from housekeeping to leave a message, so we did. And the we called front desk and said we would come get them ourselves as we were tired of waiting and they said they would be right up. Again, 3 more phone calls and getting very angry and tired, as the kids already fell asleep, they arrived. (after I threatened to come down in 5 minutes if they were not there yet). Total time was about 1 1/2 hours, with them telling me they were on their way in 5 minutes. Front desk almost never answers the phone. No exaggeration. We put it down and let it ring for about 20 minutes, with no answer still. Bottom line is we would never again, stay at this hotel, as the service is horrible. The waterpark closes at dark due to the fact that there are no lights in the pool and the bar closes as well at the same time. One other gripe we had was 1 night a week there is a luau which the guests are required to leave the pool area at 6:00 for the night, unless you want to pay $70 for a family of 4.

The parking at Magic Kingdom is a pain when you drive yourself, as you have to take either the monorail or boat after parking. The traffic was heavy a few times but not really a big deal. The water park was OK - always crowded but my daughter enjoyed it. I preferred the pool near our room, less crowded.

Let me start by saying that this hotel was not our first choice, but my mother-in-law let us use one of her bonus weeks from her timeshare and we got the week stay for $400. It was an excellent value for $400 for an entire week stay in a two bedroom villa with complete kitchen, washer/dryer, jacuzzi tub and two full bathrooms. The full kitchen saved us so much money being able to make breakfast, pack lunches for the theme parks and make some dinners in the hotel room. There are three sections to the resort. The 100-300 buildings which have 4 units in each. The 400-600 buildings which are high rise and nearer to the road. The 700-1100 buildings, which are the newest of the high rises and closest to the water park area. We requested a unit in the newer section and were put in the 700 building on the top floor (5th). I didn't get to see the other units, so I cannot comment. Because our unit was on the top floor it had vaulted ceilings in the living/dining room and master bedroom which made the unit seem very open and airy. This was nice. I'm not sure, but I don't think the lower units have the high ceilings. The unit was pretty clean. The only part really showing wear was the carpet which was a dark color, but still showed lots of stains. Because there isn't daily housekeeping, I think the carpets take a beating. The bedding, towels, kitchen appliances, plates, pans, servingware, etc. all seemed very clean. The walls were pretty thin, and we could hear the next door neighbors coming home late after the theme parks. Didn't bother our kids or us, but it is good to know ahead of time. We have a 3 & 5 year old and it was so nice to have a separate bedroom/bathroom for them, so mom and dad could have private time. During our week stay, we only went to the waterpark twice and never went to the other pools on the property. The grounds were clean and well maintained. The pools in the waterpark all empty into water at least 3 feet deep, so our kids could only go on two of the slides and we had to catch them at the bottom. It wasn't set up very well because kids have to be older to go on the slides and then the slides in my opinion are to short and slow for an older child to enjoy. We live near Wisconsin Dells, the waterpark capital of the US, and we go to a waterpark at least twice a year and have been to many in the Dells, so we are used to really great, well set up, fun waterparks. This was a little disappointing. We didn't eat at the bar/grill around the pool, but the food smelled and looked good. It would have been nice to have had at least one restaurant on-site or within walking distance, but we had a car and there were many restaurants nearby. The staff was very nice except for the lady in the gift shop who seemed annoyed that she had to interrupt her phone conversation to take my money for the postcards I purchased. I had read reviews before we left, so I knew to avoid the counter next to registration where they try to get you to take a tour of the property in exchange for breakfast/money off tickets/etc. No one ever approached us or bothered us regarding timeshares. Overall a nice place. I don't know that I would stay there again unless I got an incredible deal like we did this time. Their regular rates are comparable to much nicer resorts with many more ammenities.", "Date": "April 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Contoocook, NH", "Title": "\u201cGreat family vacation at Liki Tiki Village\u201d", "Author": "NHmember", "ReviewID": "UR3259640", "Content": "We just returned from a week at Liki Tiki Village (March 1-7) with our 3 kids ages 7-1/2, 4-1/2, and 8 months. We had a 'townhouse' style unit, which is in the 'older' section of the resort. We didn't do the timeshare tour, so we didn't see the units in the 5-story 'high-rise' buildings, but think we much preferred where we were. The townhouse style villa was very relaxed and close to everything at the resort. There are 3 'rings' of 'older' buildings that circle around a pool/hot tub at the main lobby. Each building has 4 townhouse-style villas, each with 2 bedroom, 2 bath, living room, eat-in kitchen, screened sunroom/patio, with a small balcony off the bedrooms. The townhouse style buildings (particularly the 100 and 200 series buildings) are very convenient to the pool, lobby, waterpark and playground. There is a second pool and hot tub in the '3-4-5 building area'. The 300 series buildings are townhouse style and the 400-500 buildings are the 5 story high rises, but all are close to that pool. The exercise room is also in the 3-4-5 section of the resort. On the other side of the lagoon (pond), there are another group of highrise buildings - the 600 through 1100 series buildings. They seemed to be a bit 'out there'.....even though they were close to the water park, they weren't close to the other pools at all. Our unit (in the 200 buildings) was very spacious and it was nice having 2 full baths. The upstairs bath had a deep tub with jets, although it was a bit short (5 ft), and only had 4 jets. Nonetheless, it was a little perk. The unit had a TV and VCR in the living room and a TV in the master bedroom. The master bedroom was very spacious, had a very comforable king size bed and a slider to the balcony. The kids room was a tad small but had a large closet, 2 twin beds and a slider to the balcony. One twin bed seemed kind of old and soft, but the other was very comfortable. The unit was very quite and we never heard so much as a voice or bang from the neighbors. The unit was clean and well decorated. The kitchen was well equipped with all the plates, glases, silver etc, full size stove/oven, dishwasher, microwave, coffee maker, and toaster. They give you a single use of dishwashing detergent and laundry detergent, so we wished we had packed a little thing of that from home. The unit had a small washer/dryer. The dryer seemed to work well for drying a couple damp towels, but we did one load of laundry and ran it through the dryer twice before hanging the stuff up to air dry. Although we were in the 'older' units, they seem to have been updated. There were a few signs that they were older (creaky stairs, a little frayed carpet, cracked plaster, etc), but the cabinets and bath fixtures seemed new, the tile was in good condition, etc. There were little things that could have used some attention, like a broken shelf in the refrigerator, a broken handle on the dishwasher, etc, but nothing major, and everything seemed to work. They served free mini-bagels, donuts, juice and coffee in the 3-4-5 pool area each weekday morning (but not on the weekends). It was very quite during the week, but was bustling with activity on the weekend. The pool near the main lobby was very warm (my kids referred to it as 'the warm pool'), and the hot tub was almost too hot. The pool had a large 3 ft area for the kids with a large area of steps to enter and went to I thing 6 feet at the deep end. We didn't try the pool in the '3-4-5 area', but it looked to be similar. The pool was fairly large, so there was plenty of room to play catch/etc even when it was busy. The pool was open 7 am till 11pm or midnight I think. The Liki Tiki Lagoon waterpark had 5 slides - 3 small ones that went into the 3-3.5ft deep section, and 2 larger ones that went into the 4 ft deep area. The postings say you have to be 48\" tall to go on the slides, but it wasn't busy when we were there and the lifegards let my 4-1/2 year old go down the slides as long as I caught her at the bottom (which can be a challenge when they come shooting out!). There was also a zero entry section of the pool which was supposed to have a wave pool, but it was never going when we were there. Other than that, its mainly a lot of spraying water/fountain type things in the pool. There is also a separate baby pool that has swings and looked to be about a foot deep. The water at the park was heated, but not to the extent the regular pool by the lobby was. The park is also situated in the middle of a little pond in a big open area, so there is more of a breeze there and that made it cold. It was in the low 60's when we were there, so my kids weren't so crazy about the water park because it was cold. We spent most of our time in 'the warm pool'. I'd say the water park is geared for the 10 and under crowd. My niece and nephew visited (ages 13 and 16) and they were pretty bored with it. The water park was open 10 am till dusk. The resort restaurant (Shipwreck Sally's) is at the waterpark and is definately a poolside bar and grill type place (not a regular restaurant), although the food was good (my kids were especially fond of the chicken fingers and fries). However, they seemed to do last call for food around 6 pm (dusk), so you couldn't grab a late dinner there. They did have specials on the weekened though - all you can eat fish fry on Friday, kareoke, etc. and seemed to be open later then. We really enjoyed our week there and didn't venture out of the resort much. There is a Publix (grocery) about a half mile west of the resort on rt 192, and a super Walmart (much cheaper than Publix) just around the corner on Rt 27 (about 1-1.5 miles). The resort is a bit out in the middle of nowhere compared to most of the hustle and bustle of the 192 corridor. The only downside to that is you won't be walking to any restaurants or shops like you might be able to at some of the hotels further east. From the I-4 interchange there is probably 4 miles of heavily developed area along rt 192, then you go through about 3 miles with little plazas, resorts here and there before you get to Liki Tiki. For us with the kids and the baby it would have been nice to be able to just walk down the sidewalk to get to a restaurant instead of having to load everyone in the car and drive 3-4 miles, but then again it was nice and quite being out where we were. It was about a 40 minute ride to the airport though. There seemed to be a lot of timeshare tours, wining and dining, etc going on all the time, but we received only one phone call about it and said no thanks. We actually wouldn't have minded going on the tour, but have absolutely no interest in buying, so didn't want the hassle of the 'salespeople'. We did recieve a couple voice messages advertising activities etc at Shipwreck Sallys, but it wasn't a big deal. My only slight beef was that there was a lot of 'nickle and diming' for little things. They charge you $0.75 for a phone call, video rentals were $7 each, they had paddleboat rentals and bike rentals. They had kids activities (tie dye T shirts, crafts, etc) scheduled, and they cost $4-10 each. I've been to other resorts where that kind of thing was included, so I guess I got spoiled. They were in the process of building a mini-golf course while we were there. Overall we had a great time and would definately consider going back. There seemed to be a mix of older folks (retirees) and families with young kids there. The accomodations were nice and there was plenty to do to keep the kids busy.", "Date": "March 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Hartford Ct", "Title": "\u201cgreat for families\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3257506", "Content": "We just returned from the Liki Tiki on March 1st. We had requested a newer unit and they honored that request. We stayed in a 2bd2bth on the 4th floor of the 500 building. We were very impressed with the size of the unit. We (my husband and I and twin 2 year olds) were really able to spread out and relax. The place was extremely clean!!! It was wonderful to have a washer/dryer, full kitchen--we saved alot on breakfast. A few times, my husband grabbed some complimentary donuts which were served m-f.The girls loved sleeping in big double beds and having their own TV in their room.The master bdrm/bth was quite spacious and had a jacuzzi tub. The water pressure in the shower was weak.We didn't really have any dealings with the staff other than checkin/out, but the pool grill was pretty good for a pool grill-fast service. The smaller pool right outside our window was very warm and we used it a night--great for sore touring feet!!The location was fine although there is quite alot of traffic on 192. The liki tiki lagoon was alot of fun for the girls even though they were too short for the slides. They also enjoyed the little playground by the lagooon pool. Overall, the place is nothing fancy, but it is much more economical and spacious than staying onsight at Disney!!!This was my first time not staying at a Disney hotel and I would definately stay at Liki Tiki again.", "Date": "March 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Yorkshire, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLiki Tiki, \"We'll be back\".\u201d", "Author": "AmeliaT", "ReviewID": "UR3198103", "Content": "We stayed at the Liki Tiki 28 Jan - 11 Feb. (We were in the 800 Block). This was our first visit to the US and we were not too sure what to expect. Certainly we had read all the reviews of the resort and even visited their website. I would agree with the comments written in an earlier review and say that the Liki Tiki web site does not do itself justice. We are definitely aiming for a return visit. The 2 Bed apartment was like a home from home. 3 TVs, hi-fi, dishwasher, washer/dryer and a huge bath tub in the master suite, plenty of space, better than two kings in a stuffy hotel room on I-drive! It was clean but we did have one uninvited guest, which was quickly flushed away!! One issue we had was the fact that we were connected to another apartment via an adjoining door. Unfortunately there was no sound proofing and they were like any normal family with kids, quite noisy. This did not in anyway spoil our stay at the Liki Tiki, but I do think the next time we visit, and we will, we will try and get an apartment without connecting doors. Although there is the Ship Wreck Sally Bar & Grill, this closed fairly early in the evening, I do honestly think, with a resort as large as it is, they could benefit from an indoor bar/restaurant on site so you've not got far to go after a hard day trekking around the parks! WDW being only a 10-15 min drive away and Wal-Mart only 5, its nicely placed for a quiet holiday but maybe a little bit too far out if you want to be close to restaurants/bars/shops etc. We and our 13 yr old will most certainly be returning.", "Date": "February 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, MD", "Title": "\u201cNice Place!\u201d", "Author": "rkmemkc", "ReviewID": "UR3092203", "Content": "Hi there...we have become secondary citizens to Kissimmee and WDW. We like to travel there at least once a year and have experimented with several timeshares in this area. Well we stayed at the Liki Tiki from Jan 8-Jan 15, 2005 and I offer you this honest and open minded review of our stay. We have stayed at Westgate Lakes and Westgate Vacation Villas and were so impressed that we bought a timeshare at Westgate Blue Tree...although we have never stayed there we decided to 'trade up' to a 2 bedroom at Liki Tiki. We may be spoiled by the lavish properties and room that Westgate has shown us so let me start with - this resort is ideal for families with children. The rooms are clean and nicely decorated. We stayed in a 2 bedroom townhouse-like villa. There was a kitchen, living room, laundry room and bathroom on the first floor and 2 bedrooms and master bath on the second floor. The rooms were small and the televisions were very small-13\"! There was also no television in the second bedroom. My kids travel with videos and video games and this was something we were not used to. In 2005 the size of the televisions was pretty interesting to us. Now you are probably thinking...you are in sunny Orlando Florida and you are worried about the televisions! Well we didn't have sunny days all 7 so this became and issue when we had to move the couch closer to see the one in the living room and if I had known this before booking, it may have changed my mind. Anyway, if you are looking for a nicer-than-a-hotel room than this is the place. The only 'free-owner' perks are the free coffee, juice and doughnuts in the morning. They offer specials at the pool bar but the prices are not any lower than anywhere else. Before our trip, I read all of the reviews on this site...I can say-I did not see one bug. The kitchen was spotless and all of the appliances were brand new. This was the older part of the resort so I cannot report on the newer high rise buildings. Each of the buildings that we stayed in had 4 units. We did not hear any noise from the other rooms and the staff was extremely helpful. So my overall opinion is this is a very nice place to stay, clean, well staffed, beautifully landscaped, wonderful 'water park' and very clean pools. Great 'pub food' at Shipwreck Sally's and a peaceful setting. It takes about 15-20 minutes to get to Walt Disney World but its far enough away to be able to relax after a long day.", "Date": "January 28, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Liki Tiki Village", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34352-d86038-Reviews-Liki_Tiki_Village-Kissimmee_Florida.html", "Price": "$78 - $163*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">17777 Bali Blvd</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Kissimmee</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34787</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "86038", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/41/1a/7b/waterpark-mushroom.jpg"}}

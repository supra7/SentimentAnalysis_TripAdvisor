They have a shuttle bus, but we didn't take it. The room we had was spectacular. I believe we were on the 17th floor in a suite. The views of LA were fantastic as the whole front of the room were windows. The room itself had a couch, a desk, a mini refrigerator and a separate bathroom. The bathroom was just like a spa bathroom, very roomy, clean, modern and very good lighting. The bed was extremely comfortable. My only complaint was the location of the TV. It was located in a cabinet and was hard to see from the bed, and it was a little small for the room. They had a very nice outdoor pool, which we didn't use. I would highly recommend this hotel.

So then she started to help us then because I forgot to bring my AAA card, (to get the better rate) she pawned me off on the manager on duty. Instead of just doing what he could to do help with the fact I didn't bring my card, he was determined to find on my paperwork where it said, it was necessary. (Which he didn't due to the fact it wasn't on it)! We finally got that sorted out. We finally made it to our room, the room was very nice and big. We ate at the buffet, there was a huge variety of things to choose from, we really enjoyed it, till a girl came up and wanted to take our picture, I was a little taken back, but said okay. Well she was back about 10 minutes later with it in a frame and wanted to know if we would like to purchase it! Really, in the middle of eating? That was a bit of a turn off, but other than that we really did love the convenience of Universal being a shuttle away, we walked back at the end of the evening, shuttles don't run that late, but it wasn't a bad walk and it was very nice.

If you are a \"Hollywood\" fan, the property is only a $15 cab ride from many of the Hollywood tourist areas.

I was expecting to arrange for luggage to be stored until the official check in time of 2.00pm but was pleasantly surprised that our room was already available and ready. Check in staff were friendly and efficient. I don't think they noted my HHilton Honours membership at the time so can only assume they treat all their guests like this. And what a room! It was spacious, clean with a comfortable King Sized bed and a truly beautiful view over the Universal Studios theme park and the North Hollywood hills beyond. It was a treat to watch the sunset every evening. Well worth the extra $28 (I think) per night I paid for the higher floor/view. We also received a small welcome basket of goodies, including 2 bottles of Hilton water, which I believe was for HHilton Honours members. Very nice touch. Universal Studios is a short 5-10 minute walk across a car park and up and over a walking bridge. The hotel also has a shuttle, if you don't want to exert yourself. I would not want to do the same walk from the Sheraton a little further down the hill - it's a very steep climb! The hotel can arrange theme park tickets for you but I recommend you just go over and check at the Park's box office first as we found prices to be cheaper than those advertised online. We didn't eat there but the hotel has a good restaurant and the Sunday buffet breakfast is popular. We did get room service on our first night - there was a bit of confusion about the menu as apparently the one in our room was the \"old menu\". The panini or sandwich I ordered was no longer available, but the burger and fries I got instead were good. We did head down to the bar for happy hour one evening, which was very relaxing and pleasant. The bar staff were really good - some of the best I'd encountered on this trip. My favourite part of the hotel was the Starbucks corner which is hidden down the corridor from the bar, by the conference rooms. Besides coffee, there was a small selection of donuts, slices and fruit to choose from. Prices were the same as the Starbucks over at Citywalk, but this was a much more pleasant experience. By the third visit the server knew our order (although we were there at least twice a day, every day :)). You can see and ride everything at Universal Studios in under a day and Citywalk in the evening. The Metro station is located at the bottom of the hill (there's a free shuttle from Citywalk) from which you can travel to the usual tourist traps - Hollywood Blvd, Kodak Theatre etc. Still there's not much else to see and do in this neighborhood so I wouldn't recommend this for longer-term stays.

The Hotel has also got a cool bar that serves drinks and lots of complimentary nibblies of an evening - a very nice touch.If you are lucky you may overhear conversations from \"movie\" people which is always a buzz when you are in Hollywood!!! Food wise we loved the freshly prepared Sushi that can be eaten either in the bar or in the Restaurant....very delicious. If you are there when the BUFFET is on then make sure you GO - this is by far the best buffet we have experienced in the US!! We ate in the Restaurant both nights and found some of the servers to be excellent and others rather average.

After some research of hotels, we decided on the Hilton Universal Studios. Both the Hilton and the Sheraton are very convenient to Universal Studios. We never arranged for a rental car for this trip and took the Supper Shuttle from LAX to the Hotel. It cost $22/person and roughly took us about 40 mins to reach our hotel. We were greeted upon arrival and the staff at the front deck was very polite. Even taking the time to walk us to the elevator and explaining the layout of the hotel and taking any questions we had. A very nice touch. I booked the King Bedroom Alcove room and was very surprised at the nice layout of these spacious rooms. Being a Hilton Gold Member I received coupons for free continental breakfast in the morning but you can also upgrade to the huge buffet for only $9. How can you pass that up. We arrived on a friday early and had nothing planned for that afternoon. After talking with the host at the travel concierge deck, She suggested a Hollywood Tour, which with our luck was leaving in a few minutes. We took the tour, which cost us $64/person. The tour lasted around 5 hours and included such sights as the Hollywood Sign, Hollywood walk of fame, Historic Farmers market, and traveled thru areas of famous stars homes. The tour I would say was a 3 out of 5. It could of been better but given little research we took it. Both Saturday and Sunday we spent at Universal Studios, the hotel offers a free shuttle to and from the park or you can also walk it, which is a short 10-15 min walk. Food options are plentifully as well. With CityWalk also right next to Universal Studios, you have lots of food and shopping options to keep you busy. To sum it all up. If you just want to spend the weekend at Universal Studios, you can't go wrong with the Hilton.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gorham, ME", "Title": "\u201cFrom the time you drive up to the door til the time you settle in your room AWESOME\u201d", "Author": "karlahannaford", "ReviewID": "UR123314091", "Content": "Everything about this hotel is above and beyond what i would expect.

The room itself was poorly cleaned, you could write a message on the dust on the TV. If someone had opened the cabinet door when cleaning the room they would have noticed. There were stains on the carpet, one one morning there was no hot water at approx 7.00 am, tried to use the transport to Universal twice but couldn't get on it so walked instead etc. At the buffet breakfast (which isn't the cheapest) it felt that tourist are on one side and business guest are on the other. On our trip we also stayed at a Holiday Inn, whilst they cheerfully acknowledge us at Priority Club members, the Hilton staff ignored us as being HH members........perhaps we were only tourists?

We stayed here first in October, then again over Christmas. I was a little disappointed with the holiday decorations, I expected them to be incredible, but that is not a reason to chose a hotel. The carpets the second time did show lots of wear and dirt which surprised me. They have large, very ornate carpeting and it looked horrible. They were trying to dry out some leakage in October so perhaps this caused the staining? This hotel gives you a voucher for a continental breakfast if you are gold members of HIlton and it is the biggest continental breakfast, with the ability to upgrade to the full buffet for $9.00. If you are a breakfast eater this is a bargain as you cannot try all the different offerings on this wonderful buffet. There was a large amount of foreign visitors and they cater to many different food likings. This hotel is at Universal Studios and they offer tickets and free shuttles to the park. We have not gone but it looks very handy, it's also close enough to walk over to the park or the City Walk area. The staff is very helpful and friendly, at the restaurant, the front desk, and the housekeeping. There is the option of self park in the garage, or valet. The parking does cost money either way, the self parking is very easy to use.

I recommend the Cafe Sierra for breakfast- great buffet with great service. LARGE assortment: from fresh fruits, pastries, toaster/ bagel station, Asian food, traditional English Breakfast, eggs/sausage/bacon/home fries to yummy fresh squeezed orange juice. Great service - last time I was here the gentleman waited until I was back at table from buffet for my coffee as he didn't want it sitting & getting cold!

BIG room, two big full beds ,full desk with comfy office chair and the light has multiple outlets for computer, Ipad, etc. Sitting area with chair/ottoman, lamp and table. TV is flat screen and pulls out & angles. (I wish every hotel would learn this). Mini fridge in every room. Nice bench for luggage or for getting ready. Coffee/ tea maker as well. Good large table btw. the beds that again has multiple outlets for your phone, laptop, etc. Big marble bathroom with decent light, lots of mirrors, lighted makeup mirror w/ magnification & hair dryer. Nice toiletries as well. Careful though - floors can be slick although I think they re-surfaced the tubs awhile ago so they aren't slick anymore ( a good thing). Good closet space & hangers (double wide closet) and good size safe that can fit my 17\"laptop in it. Room service always fast and amazing. Best steak & burger I've ever had. No one ever seems to be able to do medium -rare, but the Hilton can! Always perfect & pink. Very courteous Yet friendly room service staff. Good bunch of guys. Yes, room service is expensive but they have a diverse menu compared to many hotels (including apps, Asian, sandwiches, Kid's menu, large dessert menu, etc.) Nice that they carry Coke & Pepsi products too!

It is convenient if you are a contestant on \"Wheel of Fortune\" or \"Jeopardy\" as there were several at the bar hoopin and hollerin like they'd won the rodeo but that's more funny than annoying. The annoying thing is the bathrooms are so outdated. They are worn and rather sad. The rooms are nice and the telly is HUGE for the room. The breakfast was absolutely FANTASTIC and the restaurant staff were wonderful. I love Hilton most of the time and I liked this hotel but one thing....IT IS NOT CLOSE TO THE AIRPORT. Do not let the reservation agent fool you. It is very very far so let the shuttle take you or it will cost you about 40 bucks.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel, located right at the studio\u201d", "Author": "BamaGreg", "ReviewID": "UR120720954", "Content": "I stay here for business travel.

It was wonderful to walk past the lines of people waiting in their cars knowing we could pass right by them. We ate 2 meals at the hotel. We tried the evening buffet. The selection was wonderful. The seafood was fresh and they never ran out of everything. Even though it was very busy, the service was excellent. Given this was a seafood buffet, the price tag is larger than normal.

The Hilton is also near the top of the hill, so the walk from the hotel to Universal is not too bad, but if you want to go down the hill to the Metro or to Studio CIty, the walk back up is a hike for flatlanders like us. Universal does run a shuttle up the hill, however. The pool is nice sized and private. We did not try the resturant, but most meals seem to be served buffet sytle, and were impressive looking.

However, I am so disgusted that I feel compelled to share our experience with this hotel. We had a VIP event at Universal Studios as part of my daughter's 21st birthday celebration. I booked two upgraded alcove king rooms on the 20th floor for the four of us to stay, the night prior to our Universal Studios event. We booked this hotel based on the proximity of the hotel to Universal Studios. When we arrived, only one room was available (which was fine), so we dropped our baggage off in the room that was available. The view was nice (windows filthy) but the room seemed tired. Being in a rush to leave to got to Beverly Hills, we did not really look too closely at the entire room and left for the rest of the day. Upon return to the hotel, we picked up the keys to the second room and went upstairs to get changed for our birthday dinner plans (Universal CityWalk). This is where the nightmare began. The first room had an intoxicating smell of Febreze. The floor was filthy. Dog pee (or something else?) on the floor behind the couch. Food stains (or something else?) had run down the baseboards in several locations. Old food and jam containers were under the television stand. This room was dirty everywhere we looked! I went next door to the other room (where my daughter was staying) to take a look at the conditions. The room did not smell of Febreze but had several stains down the walls and baseboards. I put my hand on the back of an armless vanity chair, to move it away from the wall, so I could sit by my mom. I felt something wet and looked at the back of the chair. The back and top of the chair had someone's fresh blood on it. Maybe the previous guest? ( Earlier- we had been told by the front desk that the person in that room was doing a late check out). I immediately ran into the bathroom and scrubbed and scrubbed my hands fearful of catching something. After numerous phone calls and waiting around for a long time(ruining any chance of making it to our birthday dinner plans), hotel security came to take a report. The front desk supervisor refused to come up to take a look at the filthy conditions of our rooms or the bloody chair. Christine, from security agreed that the rooms were filthy and that it was unacceptable. Nathan [--] (hotel manager) called us and said that the hotel would find us other rooms and he would personally make this right, including them getting me a doctor (which never happened!). For the next 4 hours, we had to either wait around in the lobby, the dirty rooms, or follow them up and down to different floors while they tried to find us two clean rooms. In between waiting around, we were escorted by the staff to the hotel lobby bar because we had missed dinner. We had 2 appetizers, 1 burger, 4 soft drinks, for a charge to us of $76. The food was so terrible, we left it (insult to injury at this point). Somewhere between 10:30 and 11:00pm, we ended up in 2 regular rooms on separate floors. At that point, we were too tired to care if the rooms were dirty and too upset because of ruining my daughter's birthday. I could barely sleep because of being so upset and my worry of what I might be exposed to by placing my hand on a bloodied chair. The next day upon check out, they had the nerve to try to charge me for parking and internet access. I requested that my parking fee, internet charge and previous night's bill for food at their lobby bar be removed. After some confusion, they removed these charges. I was assured by the Director of Operations that he would call my husband later that day to see how to make this right. In addition, I was told by the front desk supervisor (on duty at 8:30am) that Nathan Duke would call us personally. Neither person bothered to call us! The worst experience we have ever had at a hotel and we have traveled all over the world. This ruined my daughter's special birthday! In addition, I am left to worry about medical issues. There is no excuse for the lack of basic cleanliness that this hotel has clearly been cutting corners on for a long time! Spraying Febreze fabric spray (or an equivalent) is not a replacement for cleaning.

The front desk was able to accommodate for our early check-in because I called when we were about 30 min. away.

Additionally, the food at the hotel was ok. We ended up getting room service one night because we ran out of time and our baby was ready for bed. The food wasn't what I would expect a Hilton to deliver. Since you are within walking distance from Universal City Walk I would suggest dining at the many restaurants over there.

The food was delicious and proved to be excellent value for money - we'd definitely recommend that. My one minor complaint was that we had a room with an adjoining door. This meant that you did get a bit of noise from the room next door. My wife and I both had coughs, as did whoever was in the room next to us. We probably all annoyed one another at some point during our stay! Right next door to Universal Studios is the \"Citywalk\". This has lots of shops and restaurants and is really handy if you don't fancy eating in the hotel. There are a variety of food outlets there, from fast food to restaurants. We enjoyed the Mexican (complete with very large margaritas of course!) in particular. We also took in a tour of Los Angeles, which was worth it (booked via the concierge at the front desk) as well as deciding at the last minute to take in Disneyland as well. My personal views are that if you are only going to visit either Universal or Disney, I'd opt for the former - although the Indiana Jones ride at Disney is excellent and worth heading for early! Neither of the theme parks were too busy, given that kids had just returned to school, so we did not have excessive waits for any of the rides. I'd definitely recommend this hotel.

I called the front desk and hotel security was able to quickly provide me a charger (for free) for the duration of my stay. Apparently, the retain chargers that guests leave behind in case something like this should happen. That was super helpful. I used the hotel's fitness center once. Although it's on the main floor, it is way back in a secluded corner. I was the only one in there at the time.

We didn't want to complain again, plus we wanted to head out of for the evening and unwind.

We were on the phone with the front desk at the time who was nice enough to call and offer us free breakfast vouchers for the room mix up (problem was, I had already paid for the bed & breakfast package online, so instead, they comped our parking and gave us a free in-room movie). They sent security up to open lock, she couldn't do it and had to call engineering. 30 mins later engineer came to unlock door - quickly did that and left - as soon as he departed, we checked the door and it was still locked! I turned the handle and the doorknob came off in my hand. We tracked down the engineer again before he got on the elevator and he stayed to fix the door while we headed out to dinner.

The location is, to me, a great central location - great for families who want to do Universal as well as for business as close to neighborhoods, stores, restaurants, freeways, etc. I always have a short wait to check in and staff is always friendly and efficient. I have noticed from time to time (when I've used Self Park) that the conference areas/ remote lobbies from the self park could use some cleaning of the carpets and a bit of a clean up. One time we came through the restaurant/ lounge/ buffet area apparently after a big party or catering event - and then it was almost dangerous - cords, spilled water & ice everywhere and the place looked trashed. I understand how much work it is to clean up after a rowdy bunch of conventioneers or partiers - but this was a bit, well, gross. Other than that I've seen nothing but clean, prompt service. I've used self park as well as valet - easy to use and find and no wait for my car. Rooms: I'm with the Hilton Honors Club so not sure if that affects the rooms I've been given - but I've always had nice clean rooms with enough room for my things. ***My one BIG complaint is no hair dryers!!! A girl needs her hairdryer and on a short business trip I'd rather not have to pack one. ***** Room Pros: comfy beds, usually a great view, flat screen TV, enough pillows and space, enough outlets for charging Iphones, etc. Room Cons:On occasion I've also had the light up magnifying mirror not light up at all..bummer. I've also had a TV where the remote barely worked - you had to try about 10 times to get a channel to change. I also received a room once on 5th floor that was bigger, but was the LOUDEST ROOM EVER! I was too tired to go to complain - but it basically was lower roof level and the entire room shook and vibrated with noise from the air conditioners and fan systems. Bummer since the room was huge with a really nice bathroom with an additional sit down vanity/ mirror area. Room service: I'm not a big room service gal - but when you work odd hours it's really nice. The food here is EXCELLENT and always served fast, hot and friendly. The burgers are cooked properly - medium rare is actually beautifully pink in the inside. The steak is great and veggies aren't mush. The desserts have been excellent and moist as well. Gift shop: Gift shop is handy but could stand to be open longer - usually assortment of snacks, drinks, OTC, etc. Business center: on main floor past gift shop - you use your key card to get in and then pay for the computer use. My big issue is I came back from late work meetings (10 pm ?) and the center was closed. If you have to use your key card I would expect you should be able to use it 24/ 7 - I had a very early flight and needed to check in & print out my boarding pass - no luck with a closed business center. *Hilton - please allow the center to be open longer! Pool: I haven't used it but many friends have and really enjoy it although I heard it's small my friend enjoys getting laps in early in the morning. Restaurant: We've used the \"main buffet\" restaurant for breakfast several times for groups. Very quick seating & friendly service. Wide variety of breakfast items - including considerations for international travelers as there was a section for full \"British\" Breakfast with beans, grilled tomatoes, sausage, etc as well as a general Asian breakfast section with fish, rice, sushi, miso soup, etc. It is a wide selection from bagels & pastries to eggs to fruit to waffles and more. There is fresh squeezed orange juice as well and the coffee is strong.

Stewart, the front desk personnel at the Hilton HHonors desk, was very professional, friendly and accommodating. The whole check-in process was smooth, quick and he addressed all the questions and concerns we had regarding our reservations. We had two separate reservations due to the hotel being sold-out and needed to contact the Hilton Reservations and Customer Care to reserve for these dates. Being a Hilton HHonors (Diamond level) member made the reservation possible. Since this was our first time at this particular hotel, he made an effort in stepping out of the counter to show us the main layout of the entire hotel lobby, the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Sierra, Lobby Lounge, the Coffee Corner and gift shop etc. After the mini-tour of the hotel lobby, Stewart showed us the elevator going up to our room. Unfortunately, the room location we walked into was not what we expected; we pre-requested a room with Universal Studios view, not the Freeway 101. We immediately contacted Stewart to let him know regarding the room situation. I need to point out again that the hotel was sold-out during our stay.

Most days, trays of fruit and candy and bottles of water were delivered to our room. Even turn-down service was provided. If we left the room, we always returned to find fresh towels and a clean bathroom. It seemed that housekeeping came several times a day. We were also provided with breakfast coupons that included a continental breakfast that was more than enough and well-presented. For only $9 more, there was a breakfast buffet that included things like shrimp dim sum, omelets, and more. The coupons even said that they included tips, but the service was so superb that we left tips anyway. Each weekday, we received a coupon for a drink and an appetizer for each person. These were huge portions. Between the breakfasts, trays of food to the room, and coupons for appetizers, it felt like we were being fed all day. We did go one time to their evening buffet, which was elaborate, delicious, and beautifully presented. The location of the hotel was just perfect.

I know that this isn't the hotel's fault, but I feel like I should point it out because it was a cab that the hotel arranged (and we tipped them for!). The cab driver tried to pull the tourist scam on us by basically taking the longest route possible, trying to turn a $20 cab ride into a $50 one.

My husband and I booked this hotel for two nights while we were in LA in March 2011 with intentions to book a few additional nights. After our first night we realized that this hotel was not up to Hilton standards and the two night stay was more than enough. When we arrived we began our check in process and found the front desk person to be really rude. After waiting for almost a half hour to check to our room, which we booked online, we were advised that our room was not ready and to come back in an hour. Once we returned we were assigned to our room and realized that we were given two double beds instead of the king that we requested in our original reservation. We decided not to complain after being tired from a long day of travelling and sightseeing. Needless to say that we ended up sleeping in separate beds (not because we wanted to but because their doubles are the size of twin beds) for the duration of our stay!!! The room was comfortable, a decent size but there was an unpleasant odor that seemed worse in the restroom. Every morning before 8am we would receive a wonderful wake up knock from the housekeeping staff even with our do not disturb sign on the door! We thought the additional charges were somewhat extreme (parking, internet, etc). The day we checked out we began reviewing the bill and noticed significant charges for the mini-bar which we did not consume. We went to the Front Desk to inquire about it and the lady was extremely RUDE!!!!! She refused to listen to our inquiry and just said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you consumed these products so you will have to pay for it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Rather than dealing with our inquiry she asked for our email address and advised us that she would look into it further later in the day and email us. Finally after arguing with her and having her talk to us like children, she finally called the person who was in charge of the mini-bar billing to obtain a print out of the charges. Turns out that we received the bill for the mini-bar consumption from the previous guests in that room!!!!! We were charged for two bottles of wine, a bottle of whiskey, six beer, snacks, etc.). Finally, after the Front Desk person reviewed the bill she adjusted our bill. This is not a hotel that I would recommend to anyone who is visiting LA on vacation. The hotel has a long way to go to be up to Hilton Standards and the first thing that should be reviewed is the customer service level of their hotel staff.

Since we are Hilton Gold members we convinced the family members we were meeting to book their rooms here as well and subsequently spent the entire trip apologizing for the poor quality of the hotel. We arrived at the same time and while we were assigned a higher floor as is listed as a preference in our Hilton profile, when we gave our room number to our extended family at the front desk when they were checking in the front desk made absolutely no effort to look for rooms on the same floor. I understand that people may join a rewards/loyalty program for \"special treatment,\" but quite frankly its embarrassing when that special treatment (which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all that special anyway) isn't extended to other members in your party. Please note that our room types were exactly the same and we paid the same rate. Upon inspection of our room, I found an orange slice on the floor by the windows. It was gross, but I wrote it off as a simple mistake, grabbed a Kleenex and threw it away myself so my two year old wouldn't decide to make a snack of it. Later that evening after I took off my shoes I discovered a nasty, crust spot on the carpet in front of the TV where something had been spilled and the carpet needed to be cleaned. The last straw was the next morning when looking for a pair of shoes under the bed and we discovered an opened maxi-pad under one bed and the remainder of an orange wrapped in a paper towel under the other. We asked to change rooms and were assigned a slightly smaller room on a lower floor and we had to re-pack all of our stuff and re-tip the bellman to help us move our luggage. The hotel made no further attempt to apologize for the inconvenience. Additionally, after I moved the luggage and went back to the first room to check for anything that I might have missed before turning in the old room key, I found that the staff had already \"cleaned\" the room including taking out the trash, restocking the toiletries, and rearranging the hotel literature placed on the desk and nightstand. Please note that I had only been out of the room for the time it took to get our bags off the luggage cart and ride the elevator back to the floor. I don't think that the staff intended to make any special effort to further clean the room (especially the carpet) before assigning it to new guests even though we'd complained about it. I later found out the our extended family members (who'd stayed at this hotel upon our recommendation of the Hilton brand) were stuck in room where the heating unit was not functioning (it was blowing cold air instead of hot) and they'd had to have a hotel maintenance man come in to fix it after freezing in their beds the entire first night of our stay. I was embarrassed to have recommended this hotel to our family and won't be staying again. Also, it was raining the morning we checked out and apparently the roof leaks. A drop of water from the ceiling hit me while walking through the main lobby and there were trash cans set up underneath the chandelier to catch the dripping water. Classy. Also, while the hotel is technically within walking distance of the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park, it is across a 6-8 lane major through-fare and slightly uphill. There is a walk-way over the street with a ramp on the Universal Studios side, but we had to carry our stroller down a fairly steep set of stairs on the other side. I recommend taking the free shuttle that the hotel provides, but the hours are strictly limited to the hours the theme park is open so you'll miss your shuttle back to the hotel if you want to stay for dinner at the Universal City Walk shops.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Modesto, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for Universal Studios\u201d", "Author": "monester209", "ReviewID": "UR100885307", "Content": "Hotel was incredible.

My sister lives about 1 1/2 hrs from LA so we decided since it was a short trip (3 days) that we wanted to be close to the touristy stuff so we stayed at the Hilton Universal City. The location couldn't have been better. We were not far from anything. We went to the Staples Center, Santa Monica Pier, Hollywood & Highland for the Walk of Fame and all that stuff. It was great being so close to everything. There is also the Universal City Walk right across the drive from the hotel. It is an area where they have restaurants, shops, entertainment in a walkable little area. It is really nice and fun. The hotel itself is great. We had a great view of the hills which was nice..The room was really good sized and had an amazing honor bar with all kinds of soft drinks, water, liquor and also a HUGE assortment of snacks. Loved it. The beds were super comfortable with great bedding. That is a biggie for me. I like beds with bedding that is super thick and cozy. There was also a Starbucks in the hotel which was nice and also a really nice lobby and restaurant..but we never ate at the restaurant. Because we were running crazy busy all day we usually ended up ordering room service late each evening and it was always delicious with great service.

One thing to note is that my daughter has an IPOD touch and she used the wifi on it..which they charge for per day. But everytime she signed out and signed back in, it would charge us again.

The first room we got, upon asking for a quiet room, overlooked the Hollywood Freeway, but we were given the opportunity to switch to another room, this one facing Universal Studios. The hotel is semi-eloegant, especially in the lobby areas, but overall has an outdated feel, from the decor to the older, non-flat-screen televisions. I had requested an alcove room, and was to pay $10 extra for this, but this request seems to have gotten lost (I did pay the regular conference rate). Parking was $17 for self parking. Wi Fi was not outrageously priced (about $10), but to print, you had to jump through hoops, seemingly using a third party vendor connected with the hotel, with print jobs coming out in the business center, and there was a minimum printing charge of something like $3-4 each time you printed (best to save up any printing jobs or the cost would quickly add up). I went to the business center to print, but the process was confusing there, with the representative on duty unable to reach the support technician. We asked if we could check out a little late (we were leaving the last day of the conference but not until 4, when the conference ended; we hoped to leave about 1:30). The desk clerk on duty said no, without asking what time we wanted to leave, saying that we were there with a conference if she let us stay late, everyone would want to (another representative later said okay). The hotel is within walking distance of Universal Studios and City Walk (shops and restaurants). There is a shuttle from the hotel to Universal Studios and back, but it stopped about 5 p.m. (notmuch use for dining out at City Walk). There is a shuttle between Universal Studios and the bottom of the hill (from where you just need to cross a street to access busses and subway) but did not, as far as I could see, stop at the hotel.

Service: We found the service was excellent, nothing was too hard for the staff at reception, the hotel managers were kind and helpful, we wanted to eat cereal in our rooms every morning (as we would be eating out for lunch and dinner daily) and we requested a little fridge as there was none other than the bar fridge which we said we did not want access to, the hotel manager had a small fridge sent up right away which was very convenient for daily milk storage. All in all very happy with the service. Breakfast: On the return trip we did have daily buffet breakfast at the hotel which was great as there was a lot of variety, you could either have the continental breakfast or the full breakfast which was based on an honesty system. Appearance: The appearance of the hotel was somewhat outdated however it was still in good order. Amenities: They even have a business center which came useful for printing documents and such things which we used to print our trip info.

The Hilton is basically 'on the lot' with the Sheraton Universal right next door, both are roughly a 7 minute walk, but the Hilton was cheaper. Arriving is a bit complicated with various freeway off-ramps and streets and signs guiding you where to go. I made some mistakes and had to backtrack but eventually found my my way to their self-parking ($17 a day). After parking it's a bit of a journey to wander through the complexity of the hotel to get to the front desk to check-in. I suppose if one went to the main entrance and was valet shuttled it would be easy, but also cost more. Check-in went smoothly and I was upgraded to a 'corner room' (not to hard as the rooms are in a tower, so virtually half the rooms are corner rooms) on an upper floor with a full view (as much as you can see) of the park. It was a wonderful room with a quiet digital climate control and I slept like a baby in the very comfortable bed. Lots of thick soft pillows which you don't find a lot. Suprising for a Hilton they still had a standard definition 27\" CRT tv in the room. There was a bar/snack area which I didn't indulge in since they charge you quadouple what it costs. Also bottled waters were available for $5 a bottle. I also didn't indulge. The bathroom was stocked with Crabtree & Evelyn toilatries consisting of mouthwash, shampoo, conditioner, soap, haircap, and shoe buffing cloth; no toothpaste/brush, shaving cream/razor. I brought my own anyways and was told these can be purchased, certainly at a huge mark-up. The hotel has a main bar/lounge and a restaurant which all seem to inter-mingle. There is a large breakfast buffet ($22) each morning and at night a Seafood & Prime Rib buffet which looked and smelled amazing, crab, scallops, turkey, prime rib, lamb, salads, etc... but at $46 I passed. I opted for room service but my order was delayed so much the lady I called 'comped' me on the meal which later arrived. If you don't want to drive once you park you are really stuck with Hilton or next door Sheraton dining, or go to CityWalk which is packed with crowds and not fun if you're by yourself.

The front desk staff, Robin was very helpful in getting us the mini bananas which my younger son loved.

We booked the hotel because it is a Hilton and did want to visit Universal but we also wanted to see Hollywood, Beverly Hills, take a walk etc. It was a hassle to get anywhere else from this Hilton, yes there is public transportation which we did use but to get to the Metro station you either have to take 2 shuttle buses or walk and then get on the Metro to Hollywood and Highland. Thankfully we got our rental car on Friday (we arrived on Wednesday) and drove ourselves around to visit Santa Monica, Beverly Hills etc. The hotel is spotless and the staff is very friendly and ready to help with anything. We did eat at the buffet a couple of times. My husband loved it because of all the sushi/shashimi they had but I am not fond of that so I found the buffet to be just mediocre at best. In my opinion I have been to better buffets for less money. There was also a huge religious group staying there while we were there and they became very annoying. Apparently it was some kind of convention for them and I am all for freedom of religion (I am Roman Catholic and go to church regularly and pray) but these people are in your face about believing the way they do and preaching the bible while you are waiting on line for coffee or inviting you to services in the elevator and if you say no they again start preaching. We couldn't wait to leave because it made it very stressful because we didn't want to be rude to them but they just wouldn't stop.

My second time (Earlier this month which is why I'm writing this) the view was of Studio City and a large amount of California as it seems because I could see beyond the horizon (My Gosh) (2) THE CLEANLINESS: I normally do not write about cleanliness because its normally at least a little to average of what I expect. This Hilton property is CLEAN! Everything is completely clean and fresh for you! They even supply you with bath robes and extra towels that make you feel amazing. The Decor was a tiny bit outdated but still looked new which I liked. (Its like having a clean looking jukebox from the 50's) (3) AMENITIES: The Hotel has an amazing pool and jacuzzi with bar outside that honestly made me want to just stay all day ( but we eventually had to go which was sad ) There were a lot of families but this is typical because you are right next to Universal so its fine. I mean come on...we were all kids at some point in our lives. Also the Hotel has a cozy bar and restaurant which I liked and quick coffee with their version of starbucks. (4) OTHER: The Service was very good and i found it easy to communicate at check in and with the maid. Overall everybody was pretty real; I even had a chat with the maid about California and what her life was like (I know unnecessary but interesting) She was actually pretty nice. (5) WHY NOT 5 STARS? AND JUST 4? Well 4 is pretty amazing but 5 has to be superb. 5 I would place on that perfect hotel which I am waiting to see. This hotel charges 17.99 for parking and 22.99 for Valet. I found this quite ridiculous and this is the reason why i did not give this property 5 stars. Why should a hotel guest have to pay to park at somewhere where they are already paying for other services? Also, The Internet was 9.95 a day in 2009 and when was came back earlier this month it was 4.95 a day which I was happy to see.

The requested snacks were delivered to the room shortly after the bellhop left, and the staff was courteous and helpful whenever I called to ask questions. An array of snacks is available in the standard room, and there are plenty of beverages as well. Wireless internet was $5, but that's better than the $15 other hotels charge. Internet connection was always good - never any delays of interruptions. The gift shop downstairs is stocked well with clothes, souvenirs, snacks, drinks, toiletries. If you'd prefer that the bar snacks in your room be refurnished via delivery, they're happy to bring what you want as well. Late dinner was ordered the evening of arrival and they delivered in about 30-minutes. They graciously pickup the tray afterwards instead of just picking-up from outside of the room. Breakfast ordered via doortag the night before was delivered the next morning right on time! And all special requests with the food was followed to the T. Supposedly this hotel has some of the best steak and seafood selections - I'm vegan so I didn't explore this option. But the selection is available in the restaurant in the lobby, or through room service. The pool is relaxing and staffed, so you can have lunch/appetizers/drinks delivered outside. As mentioned, though it was the peak of tourist season, the crowd was quiet and relaxing. Parking is available in the garage below the hotel and I REALLY like that self-parking was available within the same structyre (I usually valet if self-parking is in another structure - laziness =P ). I couldn't have had a better travel experience. At first I was uncertain about the stay considering it was the middle of June - the peak of tourist season around Universal Studios. But the busy season wasn't a problem at all and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Checking-out was just as simple and I would easily stay here again.

We are a family of 4 (2 daughters ages 20 and 18) from New York. We came to get an LA experience and wanted an upscale hotel in a safe area and not too far from the attractions. We had considered the Hilton and Sheraton Universal, Rennaisance Hollywood, Hyatt Century City and Andaz Hollywood. After checking out each hotel and it's location we were glad we chose Hilton. We carefully planned out this vacation so that we can get the most out of LA. WE flew in from NY on Delta and picked up our car rental (compact SUV) from Fox CarRentals. I was pretty concerned renting from Fox because I almost always rent from Avis, Alamo and National and never had a problem. But the price difference was significant so we tried Fox. Although it took a while for us to find a shuttle from LAX and a shabby looking office and a jeep that was not new/ had 53,000miles on it and with manual windows- we had no problems. WE needed the Jeep because the 3 females in my family always pack enough luggage for a months vacation and it would not fit in anything smaller. It was about a 40 minute drive to the hotel. We planned to seeing an LA Dodgers ballgame ( got our field box tickets on Stubhub weeks before the trip), taking a tour of the stars homes/Hollywood/Beverly hills tour on Starline tours, a day at Santa Monica Beach, see a taping of the tonight show with Jay Leno, and visit Universal Studios Hollywood.( we bought a 7 day unlimited pass to Universal on line for the price of one day). We were able to do it all as well as see Mark Whalberg get his hollywood walk of fame star (with friend Will Farrell) and take the rest of the day to personally visit hollywood and Beverly Hills. The hilton was convienently located no more than 15 minutes from where we needed to go. More importantly it was in a safe area and a short 5-7 minute walk to Universal Studios/City Walk. Since we had a 7 day unlimited pass we went to Universal Studios almost everyday for just a few hours, We ate at City Walk 4 nights (Mexican, Wolfgang Puck, Steak house and Tony Romas) and walked around late at night without safety concerns. Upon check in we had reserved 2 rooms and were given a huge King Alcove room for my wife and I connecting with a 2 double bed room for the girls. Our room had huge windows looking over LA. Linda checked us in and upon seeing I was a HH Gold member gave us cuopons for free continental breakfasts/ free afternoon snacks and drinks and free wifi internet connections each day. In addition, twice during our stay they delivered to our rooms complimentary water bottles and snacks. The free continental breakfasts in Cafe Sierra were very good. It included everything at the buffet except for smoked salmon and the hot items. If you wanted the full buffet you can upgrade for $9 pp. We did not feel the need to upgrade. The snacks/drinks coupons included a choice of 5 or 6 items which include a cheese basket or fresh fruit platter or 2 hamburger sliders w/ chips or veggy platter or a fish sandwich plus a non alcohloic beverage and it was served in the lobby lounge. It was enough for a nice free lunch or late night snack. It was good from like 11am to10 pm. This Hilton had a nice pool and hot tub and a business center with airline boarding passes computer available for printing (free). The center also had computers and printers available for a fee. The hotel itself had an upscale feel and service was professional. This Hilton, unlike some others we have been to, had most of it's act together. Housekeeping was fast and efficient. Service in the Cafe Sierra was also quick. Bellhops and Car Hops were ready to help. Concierge was mostly helpful. Front desk services were top notch. We had a small problems during our week stay but within minutes they were resolved. If I had to nit pick- the waiters in the Cafe Sierra should all be told the rules concerning the continental breakfasts together. Each had a different set uf rules. On our first morning we were specifically told that we can self serve anything from the buffet except for hot items. 2 mornings later they said we could not have the smoked salmon- no problem. On our last morning, the waiter said we could not go around the buffet but instead he would bring us a plate with several items on it. Each time we faced this we told the waiter what we were told and they didn't have a problem but it was embarrassing to have to explain this to each waiter. Parking was expensive @ $17 per day self parking or $22 per day for valet. We self parked. My final small pet peeve was with the internet access. WE were given free access but instead of just waiving the $4.95 per day per room fee they said they will remove it at the end of the stay. This happens in alot of hotels but I wish they would just not charge it in the first place because there is ALWAYS a problem at the end. We did have it removed but after a few phone calls and explaining the situation. Overall we recommend this hotel for an LA vacation especially if you plan to visit Universal studios. I went to see the Sheraton Universal and found the Hilton to be much nicer with a more upscale feel. Yes, it had more of a business feel to it but it was much newer/nicer and a shorter walk to Universal. Better yet, the Hilton was priced considerably lower in all room catagories. We are also Starwood members but we liked the Hilton better. The hotel was never more than a 15 drive to NBC studios, Hollywood Walk of Fame, KodaK Theater, Beverly Hills and even Dodger stadium. Finally it's in a safe/ theme park environment with lots of security and City Walk for restaurants/shopping and strolling. I was very comfortable with my daughters going to City Wmalk on their own without concerns.

I worked in my room for much of the time, so started to get sick of it, but all in all it was very good. The TV was a quite old 4:3 CRT but worked fine and provided a decent range of channels... fine by me. My room was on the Universal studios side of the building, which gets sun in the morning.. the rooms on the other side got the sun all afternoon and can become a bit warm (one of my colleagues found the AC in his room on the other side had issues with the solar gain through the picture windows. generally I was very happy with the room and would recommend a King Alcove for comfort and size. The restaurant is pretty standard Hilton fare - the hotel loves its buffets (Thursday thru Sunday nights were very well patronised) - and the room service food (especially the chicken sandwich) is very good and prompt. As ever, eating in a hotel is not cheap, if you stay here for any time and fancy eating across the road in the Citywalk I can personally recommend the Saddle Ranch - great steaks and ribs for the carnivores amongst you. The rest of the food in the Citywalk was poor - especially the fast food which was universally (no pun intended!) bad quality imho. The pool at the hotel is lovely, the 101 is nearby but hardly bothers you - lots of space by the pool with a lovely bar and spa pool (which was a fabulous temperature). I can also heartily recommend the weekend poolside BBQ food - very good. One final thing, the Wifi has recently been dropped in price to $4.95 per device per day... it works OK but annoyed me that every device has to be paid for separately... but at least it is $4.95 rather than $14.95 like some hotels of this rating.

Rather than staying on the Disney property for the entire visit, we decided to move to a more central location, and based on the high ratings on TripAdvisor, chose this hotel. We arrived at 1:30, the hotel had an atmosphere of chaos as there were a ton of news vehicles parked outside and there was this buzz of preparation in the hotel. When we checked in, we were informed that our room wasn't ready( no biggie at all), but we could leave our luggage and when the room was ready, it would be sent up. We also verfied that we had upgraded our room to an executive floor which included a continental breakfast. They tagged our bags and sent us on our way. My husband had parked in the garage which had come and go priveleges, but the desk hadn't given us a pass so the attendant had to look up our room; she told us our room number and sent us on our way. When we returned at 9:30 that night, we went to the desk to get our room key. There seemed to be some confusion as to where our bags were, and there was nothing in the system about our upgrade;the bellman that took us to our room, assured us that he would check it out. Again the hotel was absolutely hopping and very busy( It turned out that the Republican candidate for governor had her election party there that night). We were delivered to our room tired, frustrated, and feeling like noone really cared about a simple booking- we didn't even have a key to the mini-bar. My husband went down to check on the vouchers for breakfast and was told that since we booked online, Hilton was not responsible for the mistakes in our room booking; we would have to take it up with the third party booking service when we got home. I then called downstairs when he returned to clarify that we didn't use a third party agency like Hotwire or Expedia and that we made our reservations on the Hilton website; the lady on the phone said that there was no proof in the system, and wanted the name of the person that told me otherwise. I couldn't remember the name of the woman who checked me in, so I was then told that there was nothing that she could do, but if I wanted to continue, she would get a manager. I agreed and I was put through to voicemail. Argh! I left a message explaining that I was really frustrated. An hour later....I called back, ranting that this was not like any hilton where we had stayed before, and I felt like we were being dismissed...the person on the other end of the phone, calmly explained that she was not the person that I had spoken to before, and that she wanted to hear about our day. I have to tell you, just feeling like someone was listening helped tremendously. After I explained, she introduced herself as Pamela, the manager, and said that she wished she had known earlier. She said that there had been some breakdowns in service and to make our stay better, she would upgrade our breakfast to the buffet and move our room the next day to a park view. This was so very nice and just having someone make us feel like we mattered was huge. We spent the day at Universal Studios- it rocked and Front of the Line pass is the way to go. When we got back to the hotel, I got to meet Pamela. She told us that she had two rooms available-park view and a suite- which one would we like? We choose the suite. When Danny, our bellman took us upstairs, this was a suite with more than just a couch; it had a dining area, bar, extra bathroom-it was gorgeous. Pamela had the staff bring in separate beds for our kids so that they didn't have to sleep on the fold-out. AND she sent up waters and snack platters for each kid with fruit and chocolates and candied apples. That was the way that we were treated for the rest of our stay. This location is gorgeous, the food is fabulous, and the people that work there do recognize how important the client is. The visit started shaky, but it finished strong-way above expectations.

This hotel is conviently located to Universal and the City Walk area and has an efficient and reliable shuttle if you don't want to or can't make the relatively short walk. The pool area is also nice. While the overall hotel amenities are great, the friendliness and willingness of the staff to answer questions and address problems made the stay one of the best we have had in a hotel. The only exception to the great staff service was the wait staff in the hotel lounge area. While they were generally friendly, they were not very efficient in dealing with the customers at the tables. We visited the lounge several times during the stay so we had 3-4 servers and consistently the service was slow. I'm not sure what the reason was, but the staff literally (I timed it while waiting for attention) spent more time at the cash register than they did out serving customers. Before reading the rest, be aware that I don't blame the hotel for the noise issue I mention and I complement the staff (security and hotel mgmt) for being customer-focused in dealing with the situation. About 2AM on our first night in the hotels, the guests in the adjoining room arrived and were exceptionally loud and using plenty of four-letter words that we could hear clear as a bell. I called hotel security to make them aware and they promptly arrived to address the issue. This worked for about 20 mins until someone else arrived to visit the \"neighbors\" and once the voices got loud and the language got pretty spicy. I called hotel security again and they promptly arrived to warn the guests again. This time it worked. In the morning, I went to the front desk to make sure the manager was aware and she was and had already started the process of relocating us to a new room that was an upgrade to a two room suite for the remainder of the stay.

As we were staying for 7 nights we were offered a complimentary refrigerator. Upon entering the room we were pleasantly surprised at how spacious it was. The large windows really made an impact; we could view Universal for the corner of our windows. There was a complimentary pack of fruit and candy which was a nice touch. On the whole though it was an impressive room. Some things in the room are a little dated, the TV for example. However on the whole we loved the room. The bed was huge and very comfy. The bathroom was very spacious with great mirrors and generous amount of plug sockets. The shower itself was not very good, in that there was no power behind it at all. Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Sierra the main hotel restaurant was a bit pricey; we did eat there 4 times during the course of the week, would have used it more had the price been a little more reasonable. The breakfast buffet was 22 Dollars per person (includes drinks) plus tip. It was an extensive buffet and very nice but well over priced. I think there should be a discount for people staying a week and over. There are individual Breakfasts available from their menu as well but again these are overpriced. You can also walk over to City Walk to get a more reasonably priced breakfast. There is 24 hour room service but this has additional charges to the menu prices. Certain days of the week Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Sierra have an early bird 3 course dinner between 4-6PM for 17 dollars plus taxes and tip. This is well worth it if you are able to eat at those times. The early bird meal we had was good quality and very filling. We also ate from the late night menu in the bar area again not the cheapest but not bad food. Having a Starbucks on site was great for morning coffee and a light breakfast. One bad point I have to raise is the charges to use PCs to access the internet. The charges were extortionate. In comparison to other hotels the charges to use an internet terminal are a disgrace. Also only limited hours for the business centre, more and more hotels have these facilities available 24 hours and at sensible rates. The location is good and in particular for Universal Studios as you can walk there in less than 10 minutes. I personally think they could design a quicker walkway to the bridge that takes you over there but they do have a shuttle that takes you over for free while the park is open. If it is city walk you want in the evening you will need to walk but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that bad less than 10 minutes and you are there. We did not have a car so relied on buses, the metro and cabs. The Metro Station is about a 10 minute walk in the opposite direction to Universal and you can get a day pass for 5 dollars which you can also use on the buses. Hollywood Walk of Fame Area is only 1 stop on the metro. There you can get the movie stars home tour etc. The hill leading down to the station is a little steep which is not too bad on the way down but is a little harder to walk on the way back up. However you can get the free shuttle across the road to Universal and walk from there. Staff were all polite and always said things like welcome back when we returned from a day out. Concierge were helpful. We used them to order a transfer from the Hotel to Anaheim/Disney Area. We opted for a private transfer which was 132 dollars including tip. But there were cheaper options such as Lux Bus America. I recommend the Warner Bros Studio tour, fun and interesting. To get there in a cab from the rank outside the hotel it only cost about 15 dollars. Plus they have a nice restaurant to grab breakfast or lunch before or after your tour. If I was to come to this area again I would stay here. From what we saw guests here tended to be mainly business people more then people on family holiday. I did like the idea of staying in both the Universal/Hollywood area and staying in Anaheim to cover Disney and other local things to that area.

Staying 4 nights. Good Items - Great hotel if you are going to Universal Studios because you can walk over there in less than 5 minutes or take a shuttle if you are lazy/ can't walk it. - All staff were uniformly friendly and helpful from the first valet attendant who opened the door of my shuttle to the last valet attendant who wished me farewell in my return shuttle. - Received an upgrade to the 22nd floor Tower room, which was HUGE and very spacious and included a nice welcome gift of 2 bottles of water and a large snack platter with fresh fruits, chocolates, pastries, and a chocolate dipped apple. First time I have received a welcome gift in US as a Gold. Also received coupon for free continental breakfast every day in the hotel restaurant and 2 coupons for a free $10 appetizer in the lobby lounge. I don't believe there is an executive lounge. - Very comfortable bed/ pillows and nice working desk. - Very nice bathroom amenities which were refreshed daily and a complimentary coffee/tea maker and supplies which was also refreshed daily. - USA Today delivered for free every morning and complimentary Financial Times available on front desk. - Bar food and drinks were surprisingly affordable. After trying in vain to get a seat anywhere at the Universal CityWalk, I came back and was able to get a large Alaskan Amber for $5 and a really nice burger with fruit tray for $10. Much cheaper and less crazy than CityWalk. - I didn't use it, but they have a LARGE pool (much bigger than Sheraton next door) and looks really nice. Negative - Wireless Internet is $9.95 per day but atleast it is 24hours from purchase so you can time your purchase to maybe cover 2 days. - Old 1980s CRT TV in the rooms. - First time I have was not offered the full buffet in the restaurant as a Gold member, kind of annoying they try to upsell you the $7 every day. - Toilet was always running and randomly turning itself on and off, even when I hadn't been in the room all day. - Temperature in this hotel isn't great. All day in meetings I would freeze and then go to my room and find it very warm. No controls in the room. - Traffic noise from highway even all the way up on 22 was noticeable. Didn't particularly bother me but know my significant other wouldn't have loved it. - Location isn't great without a car unless you are only doing Universal. There is nowhere to walk around here at all as it is up on a hill. I paid $10 one way for a taxi to Radford Studios for CBS show taping. Paid $20 from LAX on SupperShuttle one way. This is further impacted by the fact you are going to pay $22 a DAY if you want to park here (and you pretty much have to). - Lastly, and the most annoying, the elevators. SLOW, SLOW, SLOW. Really, this hotel was not full at all and never more than 1-2 people on at a time but I swear I never waited less than 3 minutes and often 4-5. Not sure where they sit, but they need to be adjusted. OVERALL - I really had a nice experience here and felt I received good value for my money. I was here for a convention at the hotel and wouldn't hesitate to do it again as the staff were superb and the hotel is pretty well maintained and treats HHonors members very well.

The rooms have always been spacious but ever since staying here first in 2006 the common areas have needed updating. It's outdated in general.

If you want to park a car and drive to see sites each day, I'd say the hotel is very well located. It's a pretty quiet area. If you have a high-up room, the view is also pretty good - depending on the side you are on. The rooms are large with big windows and the bathrooms are very spacious and mostly marble and stone. The rooms are clean and well-maintained, although the bathroom sink was clogged and I kept forgetting to call down about it, but you'd think the cleaning staff would have done something after 4 days. The lobby, on-site restaurant and meeting space is all outdated and slightly dingy. There's a lot of muted colors and brass. The staff that worked the conference were very nice and the service from them was generally very good. The banquet food wasn't bad either, considering it was banquet chicken.

The staff were very helpful, and were able to provide information on what activities there were in the area. This hotel also has a travel desk which can book various trips and tickets for you. I mentioned the bar already. They always had quite a few people in there and some live piano music and singing. The bar tenders were friendly and helpful. However they did hand me a leaflet about tipping rules when I was paying once, which I though was unnecessary. I've been to the US many tmes, and am fully aware of the culture on tipping which exists there. There's a small shop at the hotel which is pretty good for essentials, but may be a little overpriced.

Front Desk staff \"Linda' (reminds me slighltly of Karen from WIll and grace) was fantastic, friendly, helpful and upgraded me to a king civer room.

Nice to see logo jars back, theyre always a nice gift. Has a problem with the act another guest had my exact name (uncommon) and was handled poorly on phone by a male at the front desk, however Yoschika at front desk corrected same and is pleasant and professional. @ male staff on earlier were inept , and either ill informed or were deceptive with me. I could not stay in the exact same room, as they were \"out of king rooms\", hed 'do me a favor' and \"grant me a 1:30, well ok how about a 2pm departure\", (my guest card level grants a 4pm) and when a double was open i could occupy same. Now he did call housekeeping to 'rush a double' on the same floor which i requested. a Nice show.....When i went up to my room to make future res, I forgot to chaneg dates and found a king alcove was available that day, reservable and guraranteeable for 13.00 more . I went down and said of you need the 13.00 that much ill give it to you and a 20.00 tip for your trouble but I dislike being mislead and his condescending attitude. Michelle W and the supervisor corrected it promptly and I stayed in the same room but it wasted 3 hours of my day, first waiting for my room to be changed, then checking back etc. Plus the bad experience with the same name occupant.

ROOM SERVICE is REASONABLE essentially same price as dining room wth a small delivery charge and gratuity included. There is a small starbuck like outlet with coffe sandwhiches and desserts. Aslo the lobby bar has happy hour hors deouvre and gold diamond hhonors members get a free selection from a pre designated menu. A full menue is available but you cannt apply the certificate value unlike with breakfast coupons. Of course this leads one to drink alcohol but the quesadilla was hot flavorfull and had great guacamole- and im not a big fan of guac. Pleasant informed waitstaff. My Random RANTS. SOME road noise may be heard if youre twd the 110, and universals occaisional production shows can be heard a bit during daytime, but not annoyingly.

Here is my review. I'll start with the good: service. I have to admit that service throughout my stay was absolutely amazing. Check-in staff was super-nice and helpful. Cleaning people and room service were friendly and helpful. Also, the room service menu had some nice healthy extras that you don't normally find on other Hilton menus. I sampled several different salads and fruit dishes and was impressed. Now for the bad: the room. The first room I got was on the 14th floor. It was hot upon my checking in. So I turned the AC down. Almost immediately upon checking in, I left the hotel for an excursion. When I returned a couple of hours later, the room was still hot. I called downstairs and they sent a maintenance guy up. He was unable to fix it. Meanwhile I was hungry and wanted to settle down and order room service. So after a lot of hoopla, they transferred me to another room on the 17th floor. Now, I had actually ordered one of the deluxe rooms. I was disappointed to be presented both times with a standard room although they assured me it was in fact an upgraded room. Anyway, I settled into the new room. By the next day, the AC in the new room was having problems. It just didn't get cool enough. Instead of complaining again, I dealt with it. The wireless internet access was sporadic in that room and half the time the connection would be lost. The water that the maid left behind one day had a lid that wasn't even closed, yet I got charged for it. And speaking of charges... I'm a Hilton Honors Gold member, yet they didn't include one special in my stay. All the other Hiltons do. But this one charged for every single little thing. The bathroom was nice and big. The bed sheets were very nice and comfy. Upon checking out, I mentioned the problems I had but didn't get refunded or comped. Honestly, I probably won't be staying there again. Way too expensive and the room quality was not worth it.

My only gripe was being told to pay 8 bucks more for a buffet breakfast when as a hilton honors diamond member, it should be included for free as it is at other hilton sister properties. Also, the elevators were quit slow for a building that has 25 floors. The reason I gave the property only 3 stars is due to the fee for internet access (I never understand why Hilton must gouge their customers to use the internet when sister properties hampton inn and garden inns manage to include it for free) which should be free for all diamond members. Also, the parking was quite expensive at 17.00 dollars a day. Again, this is something that should be comped for diamond members as it often is at other hilton properties.

The only cons about the room is that the TV is old and not a very good picture and there is no in-room refrigerator. There is a cabinet for the coffee maker and we thought that was the fridge, but nope, seems like they can turn those into mini-fridges. We did have a safe in the room and one robe was provided in the closet. We also had a park view room and we loved looking out over Universal and the surrounding area. Overall, it was a very nice room! We opted for the breakfast package and received 4 breakfast buffet tickets to have breakfast for two mornings. Their breakfast buffet is excellent, a large variety of breakfast items and drinks. It is normally $20 per person for this buffet at the Sierra Cafe restaurant. The room next door to the Cafe is the continental breakfast room and it seemed to have a nice variety of pastries and small breakfast items. Both rooms were very nice and had an elegant feel, even though you can arrive casual! We also had dinner at the Sierra Cafe one evening and the food was very good, especially their bread basket with a plate of butter, oil and olive dips, very good! All of the staff was extremely friendly and welcoming during our stay! There are more than enough employees for your every need and all very willing to assist you, that was great. There is a shuttle from this hotel to Universal Studios that runs every 10-15 minutes. It only went until park closing though, so if you stayed later to walk around the Citywalk, you would have to walk back to the hotel.

Our room appeared to cater for the disabled but the shower chair might come in handy after a big night! It was a nice size room just overlooking the side of the hotel, no view to speak of but I don't worry about that if there's no balcony anyway. The bathroom didn't have much shelf space but that's the only downside, and for some reason our bar fridge was glued shut!!! We also couldn't make local calls which was annoying, and reception couldn't seem to figure out why. We didn't try the surf and turf buffet although all you can eat crab is usually my idea of a good time - we ate at the Cantina Mexican restaurant at Universal which was good, authentic Mexican with nice cocktails. We did however spend a few hours at the Hilton's bar, drinking their excellent cocktails made by very friendly waiters. We slept well and the late check out of midday suited us perfectly after all those cocktails the night before - although housekeeping couldn't wait to get in the room they just had to! The room service menu was simply amazing - didn't use it, but really wanted to... Things to do: obviously Universal. Didn't go on the Jurassic ride due to an expensive camera and the amount of water, which was disappointing - but the Terminator 3, Special Effects and Backdraft were all good. House of Horrors - yawn, and I'm a big chicken usually (tip if you're listening, Universal: let people go through in their small groups and make the next group wait a few mins - much more fun than just trailing through in one long line with bored actors waiting to 'pounce'). We went to Sunset Plaza for dinner but that was a big disappointment; it should be re-christened Dogsh*t Plaza and who wants to eat dinner whilst inhaling car fumes? The 20% service charge on top was a bit steep at the Cafe Med and the food was ok but nothing special.

However since the hotel is located atop a hill, the uphill walk from the station/ bus stop to the hotel can be pretty tiresome. As a solution one can take the free shuttle operated by Universal Studios from the bus stop to Universal Studios. However it needs to be kept in mind that this shuttle runs only till 4.30 pm everyday. All the major Hollywood attractions are only one stop away on the metro (one needs to get down at the Hollywood/ Highland station). The area around the hotel is peaceful and seems to be quite safe, even at nights. As for the rooms, they are quite spacious and clean with all the basic amenities. The interiors are also very well done. The hotel offers room service and also has a couple of restaurants besides a Starbucks outlet.

The carpet in the room was worn thru to the pad in several spots. Several dark blotches in other spots. It just gave an impression of uncleanliness not typically found in a four diamond hotel. No air was flowing in the west facing room which had its drapes open in the sun on a 80+ degree day. It was hot!!! It took 4 hours before the room cooled down. Old box-style TV, no flat screens here. Bathroom was clean, but wallpaper was peeling in a couple of spots. Too tired to go through a room change after a long day of travel, we stayed put. There is a restaurant in the hotel that we didn't try, but the buffets looked pretty good, although expensive. The Starbucks is small and limited in it's offerings. Room service was very typical, mediocre overpriced food, but tolerable and convenient. Obviously, the location next to Universal Studios Hollywood and CityWalk are a big reason to stay at the hotel. There is a hotel shuttle (I presume provided by Universal) which was nice, but they stopped service at 4:30PM. If you stay until Universal closes or spend an evening at CityWalk, I'm afraid you'll have to walk back and sidewalks are few. This hotel may suit business travelers better, but I that's kinda strange considering it's location next to a family attraction.

Based on a recommendation from a friend in LA, we chose the Hilton Universal City for our LA base---even though we never even went to Universal Studios (aside from CityWalk 2 nights). Most of the things we needed to do were in the North Hollywood/Hollywood area and the hotel couldn't have been more convenient. It also provided very easy freeway access to Santa Monica and other side trips. The hotel staff was notably friendly, courteous, and helpful. Special shout out to Stuart at the front desk, who was wonderful and handled a couple of minor issues promptly and professionally. The hotel itself is beautiful and the guest rooms are very attractive, contemporary, and clean. The beds were amazingly comfortable! If it had been warmer, we would have used the pool. I did use the gym, which had everything I needed. There are only two issues that prevented me from giving 5 stars: As noted by others, there are some real elevator problems. Surely, engineering can fix the issue. Waits were very long at times and sometimes the elevator would go down when the only button pushed had been for up. Also, on our check-out day when we were especially rushed, we had a problem with hot water. They sent someone to our room and it was more a matter of fiddling with the faucet handle than anything else, but it was annoying. Still, I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone visiting LA looking for an attractive, quiet, safe location that's close to so many things.

We thoroughly enjoyed our 5 days and had a fabulous room looking out towards Universal Studios - very impressed with decor, room amenities, comfort of beds(awesome),cleanliness of room, size of bathroom, Crabtree & Evelyn bathroom amenities,coffee maker etc. This was one of 14 Hotels we stayed in on a recent world trip and it was by far the best for the price. We ate breakfast most mornings and had the evening buffett (available over weekends) twice. I have never seen so much food, the variety of culturally different dishes, the presentation of the food and the quality of ingredients were exceptional. The service was also pretty good in the restaurant and the staff were pleasant and accommodating. The Hotel was only a short walk to Universal Studios/City Walk and if you didn't feel like walking there was always the complimentary shuttle service. We also walked to the subway station - all down hill which was fine. After a short wait and only one stop on the train we were on Hollywood Blvd walking on the famous \"stars\" and enjoying all the hand/foot prints at Grauman's Chinese theatre. There were also some great prices on tours once in this area so we enjoyed a 3 hour Hollywood Hills/Beverly Hills/Rodeo Drive Tour - great way to spend the afternoon. Caught a cab back to the Hotel which was reasonable at USD $14 for a family of 4. Also hired a car whilst at the Hotel (we had to source the company ourselves as we wanted to drive to Los Vegas and leave the car there). Hotel can assist with day car rental (by means of a phone in the lobby to a specific company) but were no help at all despite several calls to their transport/concierge department for other car rental places. This was probably the most frustrating part of our stay - the lack of interest shown by this department! The Front Desk staff were OK - they weren't too interested in the guests as people rather they just wanted to check us in/out and be done with it. Always felt like I was \"intruding\" whenever I went to the desk - compared to the F&B staff this area of Front Office along with Concierge could really do with some decent staff training in Customer Service. SMILE guys-we are paying your wages! Maybe it's the \"tipping\" thing in America - those that get cash tips go out of their way, those that don't become a little complacent! When will the US pay their service staff properly - that's a whole other debate I guess. So...all in all impressed with the Hilton.

Hill can be a bit of a pain and extremely tiring especially with luggage but there is a complimentary shuttle that takes you from the bottom of the hill up to the hotels (hilton + sheraton) and onwards to Universal Studios which is worth waiting for but its not 24 hours - it stopped around 5-6pm when we were there. Hotel set in nice grounds with fountains and nice greenary. Bit of a pain if you're not hiring a car to get to the hotel either from Universal or the top of the hill (unless we just went the long way around all the time). You enter the site of the hotel at what i would've called the front (off the main road) however you have to walk all the way around to the back of the hotel to actually get in. I'm not sure if there was another entrance or a cut through but we couldn't find one. Arrived at 9am and explained i understood if we were a little early to check in but could we leave our bags because we wanted to go to Universal. The very helpful lady on the front desk started looking on the computer - she said they had some rooms available. I decided to try my luck with the 'upgrade' Q..... i managed to get us what i think was an executive corner room (1564) for an extra $20p/n which I was more than happy with paying. Our rate had already dropped about $50 p/n from when i originally booked so was still in theory in pocket. The lady at the front desk showed us to the lift and also gave us some maps and things to look at with regards to nearby places of interest. We entered the room (after a little bit of difficulty with the key!) and WOW !! The room was amazing. So spacious, clean, tidy, modern - everything you want in a hotel room. Sofa, television, wine (obviously not free!), massive bed, massive wardrobe and a desk to work on if necassary. The bathroom was humongous with plenty of amenties and towels. Then came the drawing of the curtains - WOW WOW WOW !! What a view !! We overlooked Universal. Seeing that and the hills in the background made it a $40 very well spent !! Didn't get room service or anything however it did seem reasonably priced to be honest - well it would've been less the gratuity, delivery charge and another charge they wanted to add on. Second evening there we got back to the hotel and there was a nice basket of fruit, with bottles of water and chocolate biscuit type things. Didn't know if they were free or you had to pay so partner only had one of the chocolate bar and a bottle of water. I see now on my credit card though that there's $4 having been charged to it care of the Hilton but because we paid up for the room on leaving i'm guessing it probably for what he ate. Maybe worth asking if its free or not should you receive one before you dive into it !? For some reason the hallways were extremely hot and i mean hot - they were sweltering however was pleasantly surprised that whatever was happening with the heating out there wasn't effecting the heating in the room. Was very easy to control - never got too hot nor too cold. Overall i'm very glad I picked the Hilton up at Universal City and should we ever head back to LA and the North Hollywood area I will most probably stay here again - its in a quiet area ideal for Universal Studios, its not far away from the subway as previously explained and the freeway that takes you down to the centre of Hollywood should you want to explore using a car. We went down to the Hollywood/Highland area and it was madness - i honestly don't think i'd have been able to stay directly on Hollywood Boulevard. It was very busy and as i have previously said the Hilton took you away from the hustle and bustle into a world of your own in effect but meant you were still within one subway stop should you want to check out graumans etc. Hope this helps", "Date": "January 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cSoft beds and huge buffet\u201d", "Author": "Sue2000", "ReviewID": "UR23022455", "Content": "Stayed for one night when going to Disneyland and Universal Studios.

For me it was just average. But here are a few things I want to mention regarding the hotel. First, if you are a smoker, I want to let you know that all smoking rooms are only on the 5th floor! Kind of sucks if you ask me. Also, you do get a very nice complimentary basket in your room that has water, fruit, cookies, and cheese & crackers. I felt that they were understaffed for a holiday weekend. It took forever for them to answer the front desk phone. And when we were changing rooms it took them forever to get someone up stairs to bring us the new keys, so we ended up leaving. The nice thing the hotel did was they never rushed us out of the previous room and held the other room for us until we got back later that evening. They were really nice just understaffed. I must say I was a bit baffled that we did not have a room service menu in our room. I had to call room service for them to bring me one and then when they did they first only brought me the breakfast menu that you hang on your door the night before. I had to tell them I already had that I need the binder with the full menu. The valet were extremely nice and helpful! They were always happy to help. We never had a problem asking them for directions to somewhere, they just printed them right out for us. They also suggested a wonderful local place that serves breakfast and lunch only. It's called Good Neighbor. I highly recommend eating there at least once while you are in town. Great food, not expensive at all, and the atmosphere is so friendly. As for the location of the hotel. You really do not have to wait for the Universal Studio shuttle! It's less than a 5 minute walk. You are litterally right across the street from it! Now as for the metro, it is a hike. You have to walk all the way down the hill and cross the intersection to get there. The walk down isn't bad but the walk up is not fun at all! That is a very very very step hill! Now there is a shuttle at the bottom of the hill that will bring you up (drops off at the Universal Studio entrance) and down the hill. I highly recommend taking the shuttle back up.

I was actually pleasantly surprised by Universal City Walk too, which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel (or a shuttle bus ride away). On top of the usual theme park shops, there are also a fair few decent places to shop (if you're into California-esque surfer type clothes...maybe not for designer labels). The hotel and its location is excellent for families. There are many kid-friendly places to eat in City Walk should young children not necessarily favour the Mandarin cuisine, plus the hotel is within easy reach of anywhere in LA really with a car.

We purchased a two day pass to Universal Studios and loved how we could just walk to the park, then walk back to the hotel for a rest around 3pm, then walk back to Universal around 6pm to finish the day. It made everything worth it. I also went to see The Ellen Degeneres Show, and it was a quick cab ride down to NBC Studios. On day four we left the hotel and walked down to the subway station, about a 10 minute walk, and got off on the NEXT stations and you were right in the middle of The Hollywood Walk Of Fame. I couldn't get over how great the location of the hotel actually was! The pool and hot tub was amazing! The pool was a little cold, but since we're Canadians, we swam in it anyway. Many Amercians couldn't believe it, and thought we were crazy. Keep in mind I went in December, so I'm sure the pool is much warmed in the summer time.. Although, the BEST TIME to go is December, about two weeks before Christmas. There were no line ups at Universal Studios. I walked right on every single ride.

This turned out to be a poor decision, from the beginning the check in process took too long due to the fact that only two employees were working at check in desk and the hotel was quite busy, the next problem was poor communication from the staff, we were initially told that we could take a complimentary shuttle over to the Universal lot , we walked out to take the shuttle and were give three different responses to where and when the shuttle would be there, after waiting for 20 minutes we asked the same person that had told us at check in about the shuttle status and he advised us to walk because he didnt think they where allowing the shuttle up due to amount of traffic; so with 15 minutes to spare we had to start walking down the dark pathway which only has a partial sidewalk so you are basically walking in the lane of traffic (the walk is only about 5 minutes but it is not pedestrian friendly); the television had a poor signal, the ice machine was not working on our \"executive floor\" and the elevators are extremely slow. I wont rate it as terrible because the room was nice and clean, however it was not as smooth of a stay as expected and based on the price we paid I think we will skip this Hotel next time around and would suggest the same to others.", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blackpool.

Tip number 1!- For airport transfers hire a town car. It is a fixed price and very comfortable. it costs about $95, however the taxi can work out alot more on the meter, especially if you hit traffic! We stayed for 4 nights at the start of May. It was our first time in LA and I must say everything is so far apart, it takes alot of time [and money] to get around. However the location of the Hilton is perfect for Universal Studios (the shuttle picks up from right outside the hotel and drops off right outside city walk). Also Hollywood is quite close. Ok now the hotel is a good standard. When I arrived check in was very quick and there was no waiting around whatsoever Tip 2- It is well worth joining the HHonours reward scheme. You get lots of freebies including quick check in/out and a complementary paper delivered to your door. Our room was on the executive floor, which was about $33 extra per night. May I say it is well worth doing this in my opinion. First of all the executive floors are to the top of the hotel so you have a much nicer view. Secondly, your executive upgrade includes access to the executive lounge. This provides breakfast and afternoon snacks. Breakfast includes every type of cold food you can think of. Afternoon snacks include fruit and a choice of 2 hot snacks. There were things like potato croqets andspring rolls. Although not eneough for a big dinner it definately filled the gap and worth doing for an afternoon snack in between meals. Considering the breakfast downstairs is about $18 each per day it is worth upgrading. Also the people in the executive lounge were so helpful with any queeries we had, its like your own concierge desk. The room quality was good, I understand what people are saying about updating the rooms, they certainly wernt contemporary. However, the Hilton seems to get away with this, as it forms part of the identity of the hotel (just like going to a stately home for example). Bed was huge and view was very nice. Bathroom was well equipped and modern. Everything was very clean. Room service is very good (twice per day). The resturant buffet downstairs was disapointing. This wasnt because of the food. We went to the seafood and lobster buffet which was $38pp. The organisation was not very good at all. By that I mean there were crouds of people, maybee 20 or 30 crouding around the front of the resturant as you come in, not waiting to be seated, just standing around! This ment you are constantly walking round them when trying to get some food. It would have only taken the front of house to have a word with them for them to move, but they seemed happy to let them stay there for about half an hour, seemingly doing nothing! This ruined the dining experience for us and certainly wasnt worth the money. Food quality was good and lots of variety. Warning though, they automatically add 15% grats on to the bill, which I think is a bit cheaky, and I would be inclined to take it off if you have any problems, as you are already paying alot of money. The bill came to $96 and we didnt drink alcohol! General facilities were very good. What I noticed was that the pool area wasnt crouded at all, and seemed most of the time like an exclusive pool. The jaquzzi was very hot though! took me about 10 minutes to get in! There is a quiet area one floor up from the reception, business centre on the entrance to the pool area and gym. All facilities were to a good standard. There is a transport desk, which will help you with any queeries for trips and general transport. If you are visiting LA for the first time, or indeed America like we were it is worth booking this hotel. You'll definately tell the difference between this and a basic 'travelodge' type hotel. Definately book this over the Sharaton, which was $100 extra per night! and looked like a dump compared to the Hilton. Price wise the rooms were $249 per night including TAX for a king exclusive room. Some may think a little pricy, which it is, but worth it if its your first time as you get food included and lots of advice and support to plan your holiday. We had a couple of bad experiences with room service (coming in at 6am without knocking) and people being loud in the middle of the night (the room had a connecting door therefore not very well sound protected from the next room.

Nice bathroom. I'd stay here with my family and kids, without hesitation. We had executive floor access, and I was pretty underwhelmed by the breakfast offerings there. I am beginning to think having executive floor access is quite overrated. Of course, getting free yoghurt and cereal and muffins and orange juice is not to be scoffed at on vacation is it? We'd probably have paid $15 for all that, if we had eaten downstairs. Enh. Eating at hotels is never really a treat, is it? Otherwise, the bar service at the hotel bar was average, the drinks were...average, but at hotel-lobby prices. It was ho-hum. That's about all I saw of the hotel! There was a mini-bar, which we didn't use, and there were some nice fruit baskets in the room when we got there. It was pretty nice, but it just didn't blow me away. This hotel is close to the red line's Universal City stop. Indeed, for $1.25 we rode all the way from the airport to the hotel. Two things you should know before you do this. The first is, it is a pretty long ride, and it was pretty rowdy on the green line from airport to imperial. But once you get to Universal City, the hotel is *uphill* significantly from the red line station.

This is a long one! Let me start off with the positive points: The staff (all that we encountered) were very helpful and friendly. We arrived late (about 12 AM) due to a delayed flight, so there wasn't anyone else checking in...no complaints there, the process was fast and easy. We had room 1767 which had a beautiful view of the mountains, valley and also overlooked Universal City Walk. Beds were comfortable, although the pillows were a bit too \"poofy\" for me, but it's all a matter of preference. The shuttle to Universal runs every 15 minutes like clockwork and we (luckily) never had to wait more than 5 minutes for it. Saturday night the 7:30 shuttle was packed (it picks up people at the Sheraton too), so some people had to stand, but it's only about a 5 minute ride (if that long) to the park. There was a 7:45 concert at the Gibson Amphitheatre that night, so I'm sure that had something to do with the full bus. The down side is that the shuttle stops at 10PM, but City Walk night clubs are open until 2 or 2:30 AM. There is a taxi stop at the front of City Walk. They charge $10.00 to go up the hill...pricey, but worth it if you're in heels and/or have had a few drinks!. Otherwise, the hotel is walkable. The negative points were: Bathtub/shower and sink had a very sluggish drain, not totally stopped up, just slow. I thought the plug was down, but it wasn't. The bathtub faucet constantly ran unless you used force to turn the water off. However, when doing that you notice that the fixture is loose (probably from everyone trying to shut off the water!)...was a bit disappointed in this as I'm sure housekeeping would be aware of this and report it. The bar had my liqueur (yay), but only one bottle!! When they ran out (I didn't drink it all...only had two drinks...really!!!), that was it. I would think they would have had another in reserve if the one they had was low. A minor issue though. After a day at Universal, we returned to our room at about 4pm to rest up and get ready for dinner and the concert, but our room was still not made up. We found the housekeeper and she explained that they had to clean the vacant rooms first. We said ok, told her she didn't need to make up our room and just asked for coffee supplies and fresh facecloths & hand towels. Another minor issue. The biggest gripe I have is with the restaurant there. We went downstairs for dinner a little before 6PM. Since there was a long line for the seafood buffet, we decided to dine off the menu. We (mistakenly) thought it would be faster since the buffet food was already prepared and the wait staff only had to do \"maintenance\" since everyone was serving themselves. We figured an hour +/- was sufficient to be done with dinner and get the shuttle to the concert (we weren't planning on eating a big meal). We were seated right away (by this time about 6:05) and we each ordered a drink. Then at about 6:10 another waitperson came over and we ordered two shrimp cocktail appetizers and two caesar salads (one chicken and one shrimp), thinking a salad could be prepared pretty quick. At about 6:20 the waitperson came back and that's when I found out there was no more of my liqueur, so I ordered a glass of wine. Drinks (one rum & coke & a glass of wine) arrived around 6:35. Appetizers arrived at about the same time as the salads, approximately 6:45. The chicken and the shrimp were very dry. All in all, extremely dissappointing for a bill that ended up being a little over $80.00!!! Sorry, but I have to continue...next morning before checkout we thought we would try the breakfast...again we avoided the buffet as we're not big eaters and the buffet was $18.00 per person. Ordering off the menu was a bit cheaper....so-o-o-o-o we ordered the 2 eggs with bacon, hasbrowns and toast (simple). I asked for eggs scrambled well. I received runny eggs and burned bacon. My friend received burned bacon and burnt toast. The waiter didn't come right back to see how things were, so we muddled through it, not really enjoying it, but too tired by this point to fuss (probably a mistake). When we ate just about all we could stomach, the waiter finally came back to serve a refill of our coffee and asked how everything was. I said not too good. He immediately said something like \"oh the bacon wasn't too good was it\" and that he would get some better bacon...I said don't bother, we're done...but off he ran...came back a little while later with bacon the way it should have been. What irked me is that he obviously seemed to know when he served us that the bacon wasn't acceptable. We didn't even want the \"new\" bacon, and didn't eat it. We just asked for the bill. The waiter credited us for the bacon. He was a very friendly person and seemed to want to help us, but maybe a bit overwhelmed?...I'm not sure. Sorry for the long story, but I'm not a \"picky\" person, and can tolerate some inconveniences. However, for the price we paid for the room (including tax approx $230.00 per night), and the rather inflated price of the meals, I would expect better quality. If I had to do it again though...I would probably stay there for the mere convenience of it. The hotel itself is very nice.

The Hilton is lovely to look at (the lobby). However, what everyone else says is true - they nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING - parking, internet, you name it. Sad that such an \"established\" hotel must do this. Yes, it is close to Universal, but so is the Sheraton. In fact, if you have a car (most people do in LA - even a rental for vacation), stay somewhere else. Universal is not that hard to get to from basically anywhere in LA. Oh, and as for the \"fancy\" dining, there was none here. At breakfast (which is not complimentary unless you're one of their members) in their restaurant, they serve a very large buffet. You also have the option of choosing from their menu (super expensive!). When I went to get some raisin bread (which was not covered - a no-no when TONS of people are coming through), there were fruit flies on it. As I moved to the fruit section, they were there too! I told the manager that they had this \"pest\" problem and she said, \"Oh, sorry about that.\" Because my husband is a fair man, we went back the next morning (to give them another chance) and found the same issue. After having worked in restaurants, I can tell you that this is not just a \"one time\" problem. In fact, if this is what the staff allows the public to see, I would be absolutely TERRIFIED to see their kitchen! Wouldn't be surprised to see them on Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares soon. There were other issues - my card key for the room didn't work - had to go down to the desk THREE times. Each time they assured me it would work - yeah, right. Problems in the room with ventilation - bathroom was FREEZING - no heat in there. Their explanation was that people generally generate enough heat from their hot showers to warm the room. Not acceptable. I've stayed at the base of a snow capped mountain that had a HEATED bathroom. Oh, and just FYI - the hotel is a HUGE place with conference rooms, restaurant, bar, etc. The problem with this is that during the holidays every company under the sun has their Christmas party here or there is some huge convention or another celebrating here as well. I was told that this was \"normal around this time of year.\" Problem? There were SO MANY people in the lobby and the hallways (leading to the restaurant and garage) that we had to push our way through them just to get to the garage! Before we checked out, when I asked to speak to the manager about our whole experience, she was always \"at a meeting,\" or \"away from her office.\" I felt so strongly about speaking to someone in authority, that I left my contact info for the manager to reach me upon checking out. Yeah, it's almost a year later and I'm still waiting for that call. I guess the customer is not most important at the Hilton. Nice. I've actuallly stayed at Sheraton Universal and they had an OUTSTANDING buffet. It was so well maintained and fresh that I asked for the restaurant manager just to compliment him on the fantastic job he and his staff were doing. That was a couple of years ago.

Right as I arrived at the hotel, I was put in vacation mode. The location is very nice. It's isolated at the top of a hill, away from noisy traffic. I got there through Super Shuttle and right as I got off, a greeter asked for my name and led me to the check-in counter. My friend and I are young and we weren't exactly dressed our best that day but we were still treated with respect. I was there 2 hours before check-in time but they gave me a room right away with no hassle. The elevators that take you up to your room were dark and slow. Nothing major but just a slight inconvenience. If you have to meet someone at a set time, plan a few extra minutes for the elevator to arrive. The room we had was great. Our view wasn't fantastic but it was nice enough since we didn't put in a special request. It overlooked the parking lot of Universal Studios. We also saw part of the theme park. The furnishings in the room were nice, clean, modern, and very inviting. The size was also amazing. We had a standard, non corner room but the size was still larger than the standard hotel room. My room only had two people but it could easily accomodate a family of 4-5. Another nice touch is the huge windows. It let in a lot of light into the room and made it very welcoming. The bathroom is large and very clean, even cleaner than my bathroom at home. The countertop was marble and there were a lot of vanity lights. The shower stall was a good size and the showerhead is placed high up to accomodate taller guests. The toiletries that the hotel provides are Crabtree and Evelyn. You get a shower cap, mouth wash, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, hand soap, bath bar soap, and an eyeglass polishing cloth. The beds are very comfortable. King size beds for doubles rooms with high quality sheets and a lot of pillows. I would even say it might have been pillow overload. My friend and I had to plop some down in the closet when we were ready to crawl into bed at night. The next morning, we felt great and very relaxed. For breakfast, we ordered room service. I ordered the All-American breakfast and my friend had granola with yogurt. For room service, the food was very reasonably priced. It's not cheap but it was a few dollars less than you would find at other hotels. When I placed my order, I was told to expect delivery in half an hour. The wait time was actually 10 minutes. The food wasn't gourmet but it was good. If you don't feel like ordering room service breakfast, I highly recommend Saddle Ranch in Universal Citywalk. That place has great food, amazing staff, and a nice ambiance. When we ate there, our orange juice was complimentary. When we went down to start off our day at Universal Studios, the greeter at the door actually remembered my name and said good morning to me. I have never had anyone remember my last name and actually greet me by name anywhere else. An example that shows the attention to detail that they train their staff to have. The hotel has a shuttle that takes you to the theme park but it's not necessary. The walk downhill is only 7-10 minutes to get to Universal. (Little tip for Universal parkgoers: in order to avoid the long ticket lines, buy your tickets at the automated machine off to the left side of the ticket kiosks. It's in between Saddle Ranch and the Universal fountain.) I didn't use the pool but I did go to take a look. It's small but I don't think a lot of guests use it. If I ever return to Universal Studios again, I would definitely revisit the Hilton. I had a great experience there. When I was checking out, there was a short line of 3 guests waiting and the manager immediately got more staff to speed things up for the guests.

Hopefully they can get rid of the smell because what can I say, a smell in a hotel of this class is just probably the worst thing you can have! Also, they really should check the directions thay they give to the hotel in the internet - I haven't checked if they have already corrected this but when I printed the directions from the internet, it said and I quote \"...exit on Lankersham Blvd, then follow the signs to the hotel\".

ARRIVAL: We arrived in a pre-booked taxi from Anaheim and the door staff were opening the car doors and greeting us before we even realised we had stopped at the entrance. Check-in was swift, efficient and friendly and we were in our room within 5 minutes of arrival. ROOM: We had a superb executive level room with fantastic views out across Universal Studios and the surrounding hills. Lots of space, supremely comfortable beds and pillows and a large luxury bathroom. Everything was spotlessly clean and the air-conditioning kept it cool and comfortable. Wireless hook up for the laptop was really simple and not too expensive. FOOD: A beautiful fruit basket, cookies and chocolate were placed in our room on arrival together with still and sparkling water and this was most welcome after a long day out in the Californian sunshine. Although we knew we could have taken breakfast in the executive lounge we didn't actually make use of this service as we were out and about most of the time. However, we did use room service on a couple of occasions and the food delivered was hot and of good quality. The wet and dry bars were a little pricy but did come in handy when we had settled down for the night but were in need of a quick snack or juice. SERVICE: We only had one minor maintenance problem in the bathroom during our 4 night stay and a plumber was sent within 5 minutes of reporting the leak. As soon as it was fixed, a cleaner appeared with his trolley and the bathroom was clean and spotless again within 45 minutes of reporting the problem!!! Although we had made our own itinerary before we arrived, the TRANSPORT DESK was most helpful in arranging a tour of downtown Hollywood and the Hollywood Hills for us and they were quite knowledgable regarding good places for shopping etc. They also sorted out our taxi for us on our departure day. The door staff were courteous and polite every time we left or entered the hotel and on our final day the hotel were happy to store our cases securely so that we could spend our last few hours wandering around Universal City Walk. OVERALL: Our stay at this Hilton was the icing on the cake for us. We had a fabulous time everywhere we stayed but the staff and quality of this hotel meant we didn't want to leave! TIPS: Take the regular FREE shuttle bus that travels between the hotel and Universal City Walk; although you can walk the short distance it is all uphill and during the summer months was a most uncomfortable journey on foot. Don't bother booking the VIP Universal Studios Tour.

They have a shuttle which transports you there - shuttle leaves every 20 minutes or so. This was great to do with the kids while the husband was working. City Walk offers so many great restuarants and shops. The staff at the Hilton were beyond polite. You could not walk by an employee without them wishing you a good day/evening.

The beds were nice and comfortable and I loved the Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries. The walk to Universal Studios is not bad. I don't understand the comments in the past reviews about it being a long walk. The only thing we found to be a little tiring was getting up the steep steps to the walk way that you have to cross to get there but the walk overall was fine. We never took the shuttle once. The weekdays went very smoothly but by the weekend we were wishing we had stayed at another hotel for those days. The buffet they serve at Cafe Sierra comes out into the walk way that you have to go past to get to the elevators and it was packed with people, more so on the weekend then during the week. We never ate there for that reason. Always very crowded and for $36 a head there are plenty of other great places to eat in L.A. that are a lot more affordable. Another issue was the hotel pool, which was so full of children at 10:00 at night that there was not one adult in it. The hotel never bothered to fix the hot tub either during the duration of our stay so there were many unhappy couples who would have enjoyed having that since the pool was taken. But it was cornered off with yellow tape. We asked to be moved on day 6 (a Saturday) due to loud children in the room next to ours. They were so loud that my husband and I could hardly hear one another. So we called the front desk and they moved us up one floor. Curiously, they had mailing tape around the window in the first room we stayed in. For $248 a night, you would think they could do a better job of securing a window. It looked tacky and I'm not sure what the purpose of it was. But aside from those issues we had a good time.

I went to check in while my husband waited in the car. Apparently during this time a valet had asked him if we were valet parking and my husband wasn't sure what I was going to pay for. So a manager came over and informed my husband that he believed self parking was full due to three wedding receptions being held at that time so to go ahead and pay for self parking, then if the lot was full, we could valet park for a cheaper price. Well, inside I was checking in with the front desk supervisor. She was very helpful and upgraded my room for free. We booked a 2 bed room, but when she found out it was only because the website wouldn't let us book a King room due to my son being 3. She moved us to a corner King room because it had more space. She was very helpful and we thought we were off to a great start. However, everything changed once we tried to park. The self parking lot was COMPLETELY full that people weren't even parked in spaces, just anywhere. So we came back to valet to try to get the deal that the manager had told my husband about. Instead the valet driver insisted on radioing the lot to find a space. Which the lot attendant swore there were spaces even though we just checked ourselves. They INSISTED that we park in self parking and the manager was nowhere to be found. So I got out with our luggage and son and waited in the lobby for my husband while he parked. The lot attendant made him park in a place that was CLEARLY not a parking space and anyone that turned a corner wrong could hit our car. That's ridiculous...all just so we wouldn't get that deal on valet parking that a MANAGER informed us about. Upset, I went to talk to the front desk supervisor that was so helpful to me. Instead I ended up waiting 15 mins in line (I was the only one) because she was on the phone...trying to work out another guest problem.

However, it's not just a brunch buffet for guests, it's for anyone so it was PACKED. It's all in the hallways of the lobby too so it was a little interesting trying to even walk through that area. Then we found out it was priced at $32 a person!!! THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

The hotel staff was excellent and extremely helpful (which is the highlight of the hotel). The room was very clean as was the bathroom and the shuttle to Universal was a great convenience (save your money and refrain from renting a vehicle - you won't need it). Now the problems... What ultimately upset me the most was the noise. We stayed on the 22nd floor and were awoken in the very early hours of the morning by what sounded like furniture being drug across the floor. We finally decided to call the front desk and were told that security would go to the floor above us to see what was happening. After 15-20 minutes and the noise only getting louder, we called back only to be told that the hotel signed a contract with a film crew and they were filming. Are you kidding me? The man at the front desk offered to change our room (yeah, right - who is going to change rooms at 3:00 in the morning?) then after I became more irritated, he told me that he wasn't the one that booked our reservation. What did that matter? We didn't care who made the reservation and that only irritated us more. If the Hilton is going to contract their hotel, they need to ensure their guests aren't affected by the noise, especially at such an early hour. Also, the food was very overpriced and just wasn't that good. Based on the prices they charge, their food should have been of a much higher quality. Drinks at the bar were also pricey and there was only one waitress, which doesn't seem like too big of a deal, but we had to wait long periods of time for service. Tips... ask if they're filming and if they are, tell them you want to be as far away from the filming as possible (only if you want sleep), eat at CityWalk (many options, food is 100% better and priced appropriately) and don't rent a vehicle because you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need it if you're going to stay in the area.

Location: The Hilton was convenient to Universal Studios/City Walk by walking or free shuttle. It was also convenient by car to some activities we had planned in Hollywood and Burbank. However if you are planning anything at or near the beach, it is a long drive and there seemed to be traffic at times one wouldn't consider rush hour. Check-in: Check-in was smooth, and the bell staff and valet were very friendly and helpful. Our luggage was brought up very quickly and the bellman also filled our ice bucket. Room: Judging from the hotel floor-plan and building shape, it looks like our room (1855) was among the smallest on the floor, and after having two double beds desk/chair, and reading chair, there wasn't much floor space. If I stay here again, I'll request a corner room, as they appeared to be the largest. The room was comfortable enough, but I wouldn't recommend it for three adults. The beds were full size, not queen. I had requested a roll-away, but was informed by the front desk that the hotel is not permitted to put roll-away beds in a room that already has two beds. It would've been nice to know that upon booking or checking in. The desk clerk also could not / did not offer to change us to a king room w/ roll-away, but did offer us extra sheets/blankets so that someone could sleep on the floor (unacceptable). The bed was comfortable, but the mattress sagged a bit - a little too soft for my taste. A nice touch was a fruit and cheese basket upon arrival, with some bottled water, and a second basket was left for us mid-week. We never did get the in-room safe working. It was a key safe, not electronic, and there was no key in the room. Reported to the front desk but they sent up the wrong key. It wasn't a big deal, so I didn't pursue it. Mid-week we returned very late from Disneyland to find that all three of our room keys were not working. I called the desk from the phone by the elevator and they sent security up promptly to let us in and sent up new keys shortly thereafter. Security told us our keys were probably de-magnetized in our wallet by another card, but I find it difficult to believe that would happen to all three at the same time when it had been working fine all week. Cleanliness: Housekeeping did an excellent job each day, and left plenty of towels. Overall the room was very clean and up-to-date, with the exception of the carpet. I agree with an earlier reviewer who said it turned their socks black. I too walked around for a bit with only socks, and they became quite dirty. The hotel definitely needs to invest in carpet cleaning or replacement. Dining: We used room service twice for a late dinner and ate at the breakfast buffet once. The room service food was average (except the gazpacho, which was excellent) - service above average. Everything was delivered quickly and hot. The breakfast buffet was excellent, and at $17 a good deal. There were fresh omelettes, eggs & waffles, as well as what seemed like an endless selection of other items, including fruit, cereal, pastries, side dishes, etc. After you are done with breakfast, they also give you a to-go coffee for the road. The servers at the buffet were friendly and attentive. This hotel has a substantial seafood/primerib buffet Thursday - Sunday that seems very popular with non-guests. The buffet is so extensive that it will not fit in the restaurant and it is set up on temporary tables in the lobby hallway. I had to navigate a crowded buffet line to get from the garage elevator to the room elevator. I am also not a fan of seafood so was quite turned off by the smell that filled not only the restaurant, but the lobby and lounge as well. Even if I did enjoy seafood, I wouldn't visit this buffet as it it set up in a hallway where there is a fair amount of lobby traffic walking by all the uncovered food dishes and displays. Overall this was a good hotel, and I may visit again if I have the need to be in the area. It was a good price and good location if you are planning on going on studio tours or attending television tapings. I have also stayed at the Sheraton next door, which was awful. However I wouldn't use a single room for more than two adults again.", "Date": "April 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa", "Title": "\u201cNot Impressed\u201d", "Author": "rayray0", "ReviewID": "UR7428341", "Content": "Hilton Universal Hotel was at a nice location, if one wanted to stay close to the Universal Studios and the City Walk. There were free shuttles that ran every 10-15minutes from the hotel to the Universal city walk and back. But to go anywhere else in LA, one had to rent a car. The hotel itself was not bad. The lobby was nice and well maintained, some bellmen were very polite, but not all were. The room was well laid out and looked nice but could have used a bigger TV. Bathroom was clean and everything worked. I found some questionable stains on the carpet. I felt itchy in bed and found a couple of bug bites on my legs the next morning... that was gross. Next three nights were no different... I think they may have bed bug problems. The biggest problem with the hotel was the staff. The staff who checked us in never once cracked a smile. I found that to be odd. As I mentioned, some of the bellmen were very nice and polite, but some were downright rude. Especially when we requested them to hold our luggage for an hour after we checked out so we could go and have lunch before the departure. Also, I resent the fact that they charge for the internet usage. They have highspeed internet available in each room, but you must PAY to use it. They have a business center, but once again you must PAY to use ANYTHING in there. At close to $200 bucks a night they charge their guests, I think they can afford to provide free wi-fi. The Sierra Cafe in the hotel had very nice breakfast buffet in the morning($17.00) and a very good dinner deal between 4-6pm (3 course meal for about $15.00). But once again, some the the wait staff were terrible. When we specifically asked for the dinner deal, their attitude changed immediately and our waiter pretty much forced us to order drinks. He never once came to ask us how our food was or to fill our water glasses. If you don't mind such horrible service, the food itself was very good (better than what we ate at 'wolfgang puck express' restaurant at the city walk... that was a rip off).

Since my friends were flying in from different cities and to both LAX and BUR, I wanted a place where they could all take the Super Shuttle to the hotel, and we could walk over to the CitiWalk and shop, etc. while the rest were arriving.

Most hotels don't have their rooms ready until 3 or 4pm. The room was incredibly clean! Again, I always check for bed bugs & thankfully none were found :-). The room was quite spacious for a corner room & the bathroom was huge! They offer great Crabtree & Evelyn ammenities.

I called a day before to confirm my reservation & their agent couldn't find my reservation! I was so upset & freaked out because our trip down south was for a convention & many hotels we looked up to book at were either sold out or way overpriced for their location / value. Thankfully when I was speaking to the agent, she found me the same room & it was $10 cheaper than my original reservation, so I booked it (again). When I arrived at the hotel their assistant manager checked me us in & realized I had double booked. I explained what happened & he realized that their agent spelled my name incorrectly when I told her how to spell it SIX TIMES (no joke). My name is NOT hard to spell (honestly)!! I was worried that I would be charged double because it was past their cancellation requirement. I mean, it was THEIR fault & not mine! I was pleased that he didn't hassle me, canceled the original reservation & gave me the lower price. Their agent gave me quite a scare & I spoke to their head manager the following morning & explained what happened. He was EXTREMELY nice. I felt better about the whole situation & also comfortable again with planning for future stays at their property. My only other \"complaint\" was the $15 charge for self-parking!

We had booked the Executive Floor on the Hilton website for an additional $30 per day. I figured it would save us on time and $$ at the hotel restaurant for breakfast. That was true except that the hotel failed to inform us in advance that they were renovating the Executive floors and that the lounge had been moved to a very unattractive, windowless, function room on the 4th floor. I had hoped to be able to pop over for coffee, bagels, etc. while leaving my kids in the room. This wasn't possible with the 4th floor location. I also thought that the staff in the Executive Lounge was not overly friendly and seemed more like waitresses than concierges. I didn't even bother to ask them for restaurant suggestions because they seemed timid. The breakfast buffet itself was as I expected--muffins, cold cereal, bagels, pastries, fruit, coffee and juices. Hopefully the new space will be finished soon as the temporary space is really a downer. We liked the pool area (saw no algae or mold) and the availability of drinks there after a day of touring Universal.

I understand problems arise, but it goes to more than a lack of water issue. Just plain dirty and a lack of upkeep. The following is what we found at this hotel, the good and the bad. THE GOOD 1. Close to Universal Studios, walk up the hill or take a free bus that comes every 15 min. to Hilton and Sheraton. 2. Strong bar drinks, with a patio for smoking...had a nice Partagas from the bar...nice to find in So. Cal these days. 3. Wonderful buffet breakfast..expensive unless you get a package deal...$18. 4. Nice lobby, friendly bell desk, doorman, bartenders. THE BAD....where do I begin.... 1. A/C didnt blow cold in room...ran entire time and was 80 the whole time of our stay 2. Soiled carpet and blankets....totally gross stains!!!! 3. Pool had black algea growing, and spa was unfit to sit in....very murky and smelled bad....proper chemicals fix this....so noone taking care of this obviously.....very surprised from a Hilton 4. NO WATER in entire hotel from before 5am till checkout...many upset customers on that one!! Supposed to be working on a couple of floors water, which they had signs about...but someone screwed up and the water for the whole hotel was shut off all morning. 5. Bathtub had HUGE chunks of enamel flaked away...didnt use cause we couldnt, but wouldnt anyway. 6. Video game system on TV wouldnt work, kept freezing and restarting, son not happy in a hot room with no games or water. Wow, what a dump this place was...and then to be over $200 a night is a crime. This place is a tourist trap. I felt they didnt care about us or others and didnt maintain the property because you probably won't be regular customer....it is for the Universal Studio vacationers.

The hotel parking lot was huge, and I was lucky enough to find a spot on the ground level. There was a separate elevator that takes one from the parking garage to the lobby, then a different elevator that took us from the lobby to the room upstairs. To me, this is not even an issue. Upon checking in: We got there real early and a room was not available, so we just kept the bags in the car, spent the day at Universal, and checked in at night. We were actually prechecked in when we got there by the desk clerk, as he knew what room we would have, it was just that the room was not ready, as it was still before noon. The clerk told us about an upgrade, which we took , as we were entitled to the free breakfast in the business wing on the upper floors, with this upgrade. The room was enormous and quiet. The girl who eventually checked us in at night was originally from our part of the country, so we had a really nice chat with her. So, both the morning and evening check in people were well spoken, knowledgeable and friendly, which I found soothing.

The food that we did have was all delicious. Again, not your standard, tired, hotel conference fare. The service at every level was top notch. In fact, I went through my stay knowing that no matter what, every need would be attended to if I wanted it. For example, I had one last meeting on my last day before catching the shuttle to the airport. The meeting ran long and I knew I was cutting it close, so as I passed the transportation desk, I asked the girl to hold the shuttle for me if it came.

The breakfast buffet on the first floor was great too if you wanted things such as eggs, bacon, waffles and the like for breakfast.

We chose the concierge(club) level as the amenities offered (drinks, light food) was worth the small extra fee and afforded us the ability to have a quick breakfast or light snack during our days in Los Angeles. Note that rates for less than a week were charged at a daily rate, once we decided upon 7 nights we were given a cheaper weekly rate. The location was good. For visitors to Universal Studios, a short walk got you there in about 7 minutes. We avoided most of the LA traffic by staying here, as it was easy to find off-highway routes nearby that, with the help of a map, took us wherever we wanted to go. We did a lot of driving around and felt our location was a bit far for some trips (such as the beach) but centrally located to the highway, simplifying most other excursions. The hotel was clean, the most important criteria. As we arrived at our room we saw carpets being shampooed between guests. The room was a good size for two adults, one teenager, and one pre-teen, but kids shared a bed. I believe there was a sofa that could be pulled-out, but I'd double check that if it pertains to you. The bathroom was very clean, toiletries plentiful and of excellent quality. Robes, hairdryer, iron and board were provided. Beds were comfortable, nice linens, great pillows. Separate check-in area at main desk for concierge speeded up the process. Something to keep in mind - we were on the 22nd floor, and the noise from outside seemed a bit loud for a floor this high. We just couldn't put our finger on why until we realized, though the windows had a bolt on them to keep them closed, one of ours was open. Not only was street and park noise creeping in, but all it took was a slight push to fully open this unlocked window. We called and received immediate response from the staff. A noise issue in the next room, however, didn't seem to rate any attention at all. We called the front desk, which passed the buck to security. Luckily this was at the end of our stay, as nothing was done about the noisy neighbors. The concierge lounge area well-monitored. Guests had to sign in. Card access was required on the elevator to access these upper floors. The food choices were limited. There were light breakfast items, coffee, teas, and juices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c OK for a family on the run. Water and soda was available during the day, however it was requested that you not take it from the lounge. We had no problem taking water or soda with us. Keep in mind that you have to ask for your beverages as they are kept in a refrigerator in another room. This is inconvenient, as you have to wait until staff can assist you, though they do their best to keep on top of it all. Evening choices were limited (snacks and one warm appetizer dish) and there is a charge for alcoholic drinks. Personnel in the concierge room were very helpful in getting us tickets to a studio tour, and very pleasant. In fact, one sweet lady took a liking to our children and made a special effort to give them each a small gift the last day of our stay. Per the Hilton website this service is offered Monday through Friday, however we also found the lounge staffed on the weekend. There is an easy walk down a hill to the train station that will take you throughout California's metro system. Beware of the steep walk back. It was not a problem for us, but if you have strollers, elderly or young children, wheelchairs, you would not want to attempt the hike. There are free trams and buses taking guests and park visitors up and down the hill to Universal City and/or hotels. Be prepared to wait, however, as they run slowly and fill up fast. Hollywood Boulevard is only a few stops from the hotel on the train. Fair was about $1.50 each way for this venture, per person. One negative is the lack of nearby fast food and/or supermarkets. City Walk can easily be accessed for evening dining or entertainment, however when staying for a week, that becomes repetitive. We had a rental car (definitely needed to stay at this hotel) and drove for food. There is a supermarket about a mile or so away and lots of Dollar stores. No need to carry too many supplies with you. Between the hotel offerings and these stores, it's easy to buy what you may need. There are no laundry facilities at this hotel, though they will do it for you for a fee. We searched the Internet ahead of time and found suitable laundromats within a couple miles and did our washing there. This is a big negative, however, as you must plan it into your trip. There is a pool and fitness room. Though we were unable to swim due to weather conditions, the pool was unremarkable as this is not a resort. The hotel's shop seemed limited in its offerings and hours. There is a restaurant and a separate lounge area. Though the restaurant offered elaborate themed buffets, the prices were very high. Be prepared to pay a daily parking fee of about $10 or $12. This Hilton caters mostly to the business traveler. Though we did not feel out of place as a family, they did not offer the experience a mom and dad with young children would like. If your kids are older, you may consider this hotel. Universal Studios, however, can be covered in two days. Have other plans and be ready to drive or take the train if you plan to stay here longer.

So we were greeted by a rather obstinant manager (Phillipe, you know who you are) who impolitely informed us preferences are just that when you book through Expedia, and our non smoking room was now a smoking room. With bad allergies, we reluctantly took the room and were greeted by an old bar-like reeking room of smoke - with air condition apparently not on. We turned it on, and left. Coming back later that evening to find the place hadnt cooled down. Did I mess up the ac settings? I turned it on further, down to 50 - and as the night went on it finally cooled a little while we slept. After a long day the next day - we came back to once again - no ac (it was 20 degrees cooler in the hallway). The day staff had turned the ac off while we were away, so we were left with the door open cooling the place off. We turned on the tv, and promptly found out all buttons on the remote changed the channel down. I went to call the front desk and the only phone that worked was in the bathroom. At 11 at night, they - impolitely again - told us they'd switch us to a non smoking room with double beds (I'm 6'3 240 pounds, so that was a no go) - so we gritted our teeth and said whatever, we'll talk to the manager tomorrow. The next day, upon checking out - the manager - Phillipe - SOMEWHAT politely informed us we should have said something before check out. We were supposedly comped for the ten dollar internet connection (supposedly - as I just received a charge for it anyways, four days later) - and an offer for a free upgrade for our next stay.

The guy said they couldn't do that so we'd have to pack up our bags and store them until a room is available at 4pm. It was 11am and we wanted to go shopping for the afternoon. No way I was going to pack up again and then move into another room. I called the manager on duty again and explained that we didn't want to have to do this. She said we could keep our things in there and she'd sort it out. So we left to go shopping for the day. We got back to the hotel after a couple of hours and decided to go for a swim. We sent up our friend to go grab some drinks from the room and when he went up we had a problem getting back into the room. The door wouldn't open. We went down to the front desk and called down from the hallway phone several times. Finally I waited at the front desk until someone made a call for someone to go up to our room because we had been waiting for 45 minutes already. They finally sent security to open the door manually. They said it was an engineering problem as the battery on the door swipe was out. After that our key card also took about 10 swipes each time before we got a green light. Oh and the hot tub is disgusting. It's brown and murky. The pool is okay. It was the saving grace. When we checked out of course, we were billed incorrectly. The manager on duty hadn't sorted out our bill so we had to stand at front desk and argue for a bit again. This hotel is a nightmare. I recommend people to not stay here. It's totally dingy and not worth over $100. Stay at another hotel close by or at the Sheraton. I'm sure it's better.", "Date": "September 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cHilton Universal: An Excellent Choice\u201d", "Author": "JoshThePilot", "ReviewID": "UR3802986", "Content": "We stayed at the Universal City/Los Angeles Hilton from March 14 till the 17th and on March 19th. From March 17th to March 19th we stayed at the Residence Inn San Diego. Please see my review on that hotel too. Introduction/Location: This Hilton property is located in the heart of the touristy Hollywood/Beverly Hills/Universal Studios area. The area is very nice and safe. This hotel attracts the more civilized (but not snobby) guests rather than the sloppy and messy people which are better suited for a cheap motel. You enter on Universal Hollywood Drive. There is also Sheraton property located on the same street and there is an elevator which takes you between the two hotels. There is a hotel shuttle which takes you to Universal Studios and City Walk. It runs about every 15 minutes and the trip takes no more than a minute or too. It is very convenient for travelers without a car or people who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to pay the money to park at Universal. The hotel has 24 floors. We stayed on the 18th for the first part and on the 11th for the last part. Features: This hotel was built in 1986 and seems to have been renovated recently. When we were staying there I overheard one of the desk clerks telling one guest that they are replacing the carpet starting with the top floor. We were given room 1872 for the first part of our stay (March 14th-March 17th). This floor/room had newer looking carpeting which was clean and did not have any stains. The desk and night table also looked to be in good condition. There was also an armoire which contained the television, a mini bar drawer, a minibar fridge and a small safe with a key. The television had the basic US TV channels plus the standard hotel movies, internet, games, etc. Everything worked fine. There are also many banquet/meeting rooms which are used quite a bit. There were a lot of parties/conferences and functions are held at this hotel. All were kept at a reasonable level (the people here are civilized). On our last day after we returned from San Diego we were given a room on the 11th floor which was not in such a good shape. The carpet was older (but clean), the night-table/armoire was worn/scratched and the beds were quite soft and creaky. I believe this is because they had not yet replaced the carpets/beds in this room since they had been working from the top floor (24th) down. Luckily it was just for one night and we managed. Amenities: Standard Hilton amenities are present at this hotel. People who are HHonors members with high status usually get a gift of some sort. We are not members but we still received a nice fruit/snack/water tray. I believe all the guests get this, although I am not sure. On the lobby level (Fourth floor) there is a nicely equipped fitness centre which has working and new machinery such as treadmills, stair climbers, bikes, etc. The place is split into two rooms which have difference types of equipment. One room had a TV and the other had a stereo with speakers on the wall. Also on the 3rd floor is a gift shop with travellers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 supplies and food/drink items. The prices are quite high for the drinks so I suggest you just pick up some from a local variety store. The access door to the outdoor pool is on the first floor. You need to use your keycard to open the gate. This is to prevent non-guests from using the pool. The pool area has a large pool with shallow and deep ends as well as a smaller whirlpool which has an adjustable massage/bubble control. The whirlpool was nice and warm (actually HOT) but once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in for a few minutes you get adjusted to it. Both the pool and the whirlpool were clean and heated. There are towels provided for you on a table as well as a basket for used towels. Surrounding the pool are chairs for tanning and poolside resting. You must pay to park at this hotel. Self Parking in one of their two underground garages is $11 per night and $16 for valet parking. Remember, to access the self parking you must take one of the elevators near the meeting rooms as the main ones do not service the garages. Service: Right from the start I was treated with care and attentive service. Upon pulling up to the door the attendants help you with unloading your luggage as well as holding the door open for you as you enter. Staff the front desk were incredible and helped us with driving directions as well as the locations of the different attractions in the area. The travel guide suggested tours for us and helped us choose the right one. Housekeeping came to make the beds daily and to replace towels, toiletries, etc. Everyone in the hotel was always there to help you. Dining: The hotel has a restaurant called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Sierra\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. Each morning we ate the breakfast buffet there which cost $15 per person. The price was a bit steep but the breakfast buffet was so filling we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat until dinner. Some of the food included the normal breakfast food such as bacon, sausages, pancakes, eggs as well as a nice fresh fruit and 2 or 3 dim sum dishes such as shrimp dumplings and BBQ Pork buns. If you want to save yourself some money and spend your time touring the city, take the buffet for breakfast. It will keep you full until dinnertime. On Friday/Saturday/Sunday they had a very large seafood buffet complete with hot/cold crab/lobster/shrimp/fish as well as sushi, dim sum as well as roast lamb and beef. The dessert selection was also quite nice with fresh fruit, cakes and cookies. It cost $38 per adult which is worth it if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a big seafood lover (like us) but if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat seafood it is not worth it to eat at this buffet. Also available Monday to Friday from 4pm-6pm is a happy hour snack in the lobby. A different hot hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeurve was served each afternoon as well as a selection of cheeses, spreads and breads. Drinks were available for a nominal fee. Value: We paid $159USD per night which is a fantastic price for the quality and service we received at this hotel. This was for a standard guest room. The suites with whirlpools and the rooms on the executive floor were in the $200USD+ category. Overall: This hotel is an excellent choice for anyone who is going to be touring the Hollywood/Universal area that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a car. Tours information is available from the concierge and there is a free shuttle that runs every 15 minutes between the Sheraton, the Hilton and Universal Studios.

During our stay, our room was overlooked with several necessities that should have been replaced daily One evening, I tried calling the front desk and the operator I tried for one half hour and still the phone was not answered (Given how nobody here answers the phone, it is laughable to have been asked about calling security earlier!) Exasperated, I called the bellman to report the problem He said he would take care of it and call me back in ten minutes to make sure the problem was handled You can guess where this is going--nobody ever handled the problem and he never called back I sat on the phone another half hour until the operator answered, and she wanted to put me on hold! I told her absolutely not, explained the problems, and asked to speak to a manager I was given the voice mail of the manager, who spoke very poor English (There is no manager on duty?

I read other reviews stating how guests received a complementary fruit basket. I too received my fruit....most of which was rotten. My big orange was cleverly arranged so the 1/3 rotten part was hidden. I chosed not to eat any of the fruit. Upon arriving back to my room one day, I found that no soaps were left. The housekeeper removed the bar of soap that had been used only that morning. I discovered that there was no \"housekeeping\" selection on my room phone. I called the front desk and got NO ANSWER. I called the operator who transferred me to the BELL BOY phone. The person who answered the bell boy phone assured that the front desk would call me within 5-10 minutes regarding my problem. Patiently waiting for over 1 HOUR I received no phone call from anyone. I re-called the operator and explained the problem and was assured AGAIN someone would bring me upon some soap. Within 5 minutes of this call I finally received my items. I also called the \"manager on duty\" but got voice mail. I barely could understand the message left on the voice mail. I am all for diversity BUT having individuals who do not speak English in charge of hotel operation, as evident from the manager on duty's voice mail gives me reason to wonder what's in charge and why such a simple request took so long. After receiving my soap I went down to the front desk and saw little to no activity. The phones were ringing but the 2 individuals on duty chosed NOT TO ANSWER THEM! I've had better service staying at a Red Roof Inn or a Motel 6. I would guess that Conrad Hilton is rolling over in his grave if he could see how some of his hotels are being managed (or un-managed)!

This was our first visit to LA, and we were basically interested in sightseeing, as well as Universal Studios. I agree with everyone else that this hotel is perfect for a family visiting Universal...you can't get any closer. However, if you plan to go anywhere else (Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Disney, etc) then you should stay somewhere else. This hotel is not convienent to any other attractions but Universal, and for the price it is not an exceptionally nice hotel. Cons: --Seafood Buffet almost constantly. If you love seafood, this is great. If the smell of seafood turns your stomach, you'd better walk all the way around the outside of the hotel to go back and forth between Universal and your room. To get to the crosswalk to Universal, it is necessary to walk THROUGH the buffet...not only stinky, but also annoyingly crowded. --Beds are very uncomfortable. I read on here that the beds are comfortable...but after experiencing it for myself, I must say that these beds are actually LESS comfortable than the ones at the Holiday Inn Express in Tulsa, OK!! I expected much more for twice as much a night. The pillows are quite flat...bring your own! --Weddings. While were were there, twice we had to walk much of the way around the outside of the building to get to Universal because of a wedding going on. I understand the importance of these people's special day, but guests paying these prices to stay here should not be shut out from half the hotel...especially when that half contains the exit to Universal!! Pros: --Bathrooms. The Bathrooms were huge. Nothing special about the decor, but they were large and that was nice. --Location to Universal. Like I said, best place to stay for a family going to Universal. It's the closest hotel to it...you can see it from your window! --fast check-in/check-out. Very fast...I had no waiting at all. In all, I would never stay at this hotel again. Comfort is a high priority for me.

I read the reviews on The La Quinta Inn along with finding out their features, ammenities and location and right now we are currently enjoying our third day here. Super pleased with the room, the bed's bedding, pillows soo comfy they will transport you to relaxation to sleepy land as fast as a NASCAR can.go from 0 - 125 mph in 0-30 seconds! The room is pleasingly CLEAN!, the Inn's staff from the person at the front desk personal to the housekeeping and groundsmen extremely friendly and really nice to accomidate to your needs right away. The location is a little bit of a drive to the beach however you get to go by the Daytona Speedway, pass many shopping centers that house a fine selection of restraunts, fast food chains and department stores. I was tickled to see a dollar tree close by and YES we did stop and shop there. We did not have enough in our budget to dine out because if we did we would definetly be checking out the Wing House right next door that we keep smelling a delectable aroma and seeing a pretty full parking lot of diners there. Next time we come here we are so going to try it! We are currently I call it \"Hotel Camping\" Coolers with food & drinks for our stay. Though treated in the morning by going to Breakfast which The La Quinta provides a Belgium waffle maker that my son just absolutley gets thrilled for waking up early for lol and I share the same excitement with the coffee and selections of fruit, cereals, muffins shared in a sectioned off area off the side of the lobby that makes one feel like they are in a bed and breakfast. The pool here is good, hot tub came in handy to aid my aching muscles after a 23 hour drive from Jersey.

First, the room wasn't as clean as I hoped it would be -- the pillow cases had mascara marks on them, random hairs everywhere and the shower flooded when on for more than a couple minutes (who knows what has been down that drain and now floating around my ankles?) Also, the \"sliding doors\" in the rooms -- the only windows-- were kind of sketchy and odd.. not a good view out the window obviously, but to me, a safety issue as well.

Before I talk about that, however, let me just briefly mention that the reviewers who were angry that there was no \"ocean view\" might want to make a note - it's the LaQuinta at the beach that has the ocean view, NOT the one in Daytona proper near I-95. The addresses are completely different, so if you're looking for that ocean view, be sure to book the correct LaQuinta. At any rate, we were pleasantly surprised on several levels, especially after reading some of the reviews. First, regarding noise. We could hear the occasional commercial jet roar overhead, but other than that we were pleased at how quiet our room turned out to be. Also, we were on the side of the hotel closest to the race track, and there were 24-7 tests going on. We would step outside and be blasted by the noise, but inside our room, even quiet conversation eliminated the rest of the noise. Second surprise? The beds. They were firm, comfortable, and outfitted with clean linens. (In fact, there were so many blankets, comforters, etc. I think we would have been warm in Alaska! Third surprise? The bathroom linens. For the very low price we were paying, I expected tiny towels, worn transparent. Instead, they were large (not huge, but definitely adequate) and in great shape. Cleanliness? Everything in our room was clean. I'm one of those people who would have pitched a royal fit if there had been a dirty bathroom. The public areas were also very clean. The staff? Terrific at all levels, regardless of age, ethnic origin, or gender. All were helpful and cooperative. Downsides? Only a couple. If you MUST have a minibar and a microwave in your room, then this is not your hotel. Neither are provided. However, for the price, we didn't much care!

Now I've come to expect mold in low cost motels in Florida, but this was above and beyond. The picture on the wall was mold encrusted. The last two feet of carpet before the patio door was pure white (it's a blue-gray carpet). I so wish I had my digital camera with me. The ceiling, especially by the main door, was pocked with mold.

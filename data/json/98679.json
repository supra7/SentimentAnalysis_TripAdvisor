We were there for a very large conference and overall they seemed unprepared and were not staffed appropriately. I'm a Hyatt member with a profile and always request high floor and quiet which usually means away from the elevator. First room was next to the elevator lobby and had not been cleaned; I called down and they moved me to a room on a lower floor but further from the elevator. Rooms are large but very dark and dated and if you are on a low floor be prepared for highway noise on one side of the hotel and train whistles through the night on the other side of the hotel. Luckily, I got the highway side; which seemed quieter according to my colleagues. Dining is limited and there is really nothing close by within walking distance. The only good meal we had was at Five-Sixty by Wolfgang Puck. After several nights of \"we're booked\" we finally got a decent table by the window and enjoyed an excellent meal; despite the misplaced attitude of the hostess. Otherwise there is a terrible Tex-Mex and Italian place downstairs. One person in our party simply could not eat his meal it was so bad. Like I said, we were there for a conference and as you may imagine the hotel was fairly full with the bar area packed each evening. They were clearly understaffed and at times the manager had to clear the empties from our table. Overall, the only reason we were here was due to a negotiated discount conference rate. I would never stay here on my on dime.

The front desk person apologized that we were not informed and gave us a $20 coupon for drinks at the bar! My first impression was that would not be near enough.

First let me say the hotel is huge & beautiful, inside & out. The location is great as it is at the edge of downtown Dallas. We always get a government rate, which makes this a super deal in my opinion. In my online reservation, I asked for a high floor & NOT facing east, as we were gonna be out late & wanted to sleep in the next morning. Our room was on the 9th floor (963), facing east. :-( We checked in late & didn't want to bother with changing rooms, so we didn't say anything. We opened the curtain & saw a beautiful night view downtown Dallas & ......the train station below. I thought, this is gonna be a noisy night. But it wasn't. We only heard a train blow it's horn once. The room was large & beautiful. The bathroom was clean, spacious & very nice. The bed was really comfy (only complaint is wish they would tuck in the bottom sheet, as it got all bunched up during the night). The room was clean. The door to our room opened into the atrium & it was not too far from the elevators (6 of them). You could hear the water features from the 1st & 2nd floors while in our bathroom, but not in the sleeping area of our room. Also, you could hear the roar of the elevators going up & down pretty much constantly. Once in a while, you could hear the \"ding\" of them arriving on our floor. You could also hear people talking in the room next to us & outside in our hallway. Again all of this was heard while in the bathroom & not in the sleeping area. We ate at Centinnial Cafe on the property for dinner & it was good. Expensive, but good. We ate (again) later that night when we returned from our outing in the bar, having drinks, chips & queso. Again, quite good. The ambiance in the second floor atrium is really nice. Very relaxing with comfy sofas & chairs all around. The next morning, we got our starbucks coffee in the Coffee bar before heading out. The valet is a bit crazy here..... lots of people coming and going, lots of cabs, but it all went smoothly. You can use the valet service overnight for $22.00 plus tax & tip or self park down the street for $10.00 for every time you come & go. Check-in went smooth & checkout the same.

The rotating Tower Lounge, 570+ feet up, offers good (but expensive! $16 for a martini, etc.) drinks and features a Wolfgang Puck restaurant as well as sushi. Very nice and worthy of going to as the views are quite spectacular. The only reason I didn't give them 5 star was due to the getting out of there procedure. First of all, they did not honor my tax exempt certificate, so the final bill had to be redone, and instead of them doing it and redeliver, it required going downstairs and having it done at reception. Then, despite one verbal request of the bell staff and two phone calls, they never came to the room to help with luggage (and we had a lot). The valet staff was overwhelmed, and there was a major traffic of people and cars in the front of the hotel. So, it was a scramble and required three trips to get all of the luggage out of the room.

The room was a typical conference hotel room. The bed was ok, the sheets were clean. The one major negative for the room was that there was only one outlet accessible in the entire room, and one of the two sockets had a lamp plugged in. The other outlets were apparently behind the bedframe and I could not reach them. Hyatt needs to take a lesson from Marriott or Starwood where they put extra outlets at the desk. I ended up charging my phone using the bathroom outlet, though I always worry about water. The positives were helpful staff and a very nice fitness center.

We arrived with 6 persons and we all heard different stories about the wifi, one had to pay, the other had to join the Hyatt club, the next one got it for free. The rooms are very basic and have not been upstyled for ages. The beds have all loose sheets, so you wake up in a mess. Sometimes directly on the matrass! The duvet is not in a cover, but also between loose sheets, which obviously come off during the night. Very unhygienic!! The lights in the room are very harsh white energy saving bulbs that do to contribute to the atmosphere in the room - which is already basic. And then food - if you want a burger, go for it, the rest I would not recommend. Buffalo wings and quesadillas seem to come from the microwave. The rest of the food seems to have been defrosted. The Italian restaurant tries its best, but misses the point. Steak ok, but risotto sticky and fatty. In the morning there is a great choice to get your own omelette prepared, which is fine. However the smoke and smell from cooking them is flowing into the hotel lobby as there is no air suction system above that stove. Be aware that this happens for at least 4 hours every day. You can smell the oil in your clothes if you sit too close to where they make the omelettes. The rest of the breakfast buffet is ok, just too few fresh fruit and the bread is fabricated and feels old. The food in the coffee shop in the lobby is all fabricated pizzas and sandwiches, coffees and other snacks are fine. The location of the hotel is between a super busy highway which results in a constant humming of cars and on the other side a railroad. When your room is at the side of the railroad and on a lower floor, you hear the trains and the heavy sound of the trains horn/whistle.

So the Hyatt gets you either way. Fact is, I can get most of these items free or for a few dollars at almost any chain lodging. Granted, the food at the Hyatt is much better, but.... Physically it's a lovely hotel with wonderful and informative displays on Texas history (ask for the self-guided walking tour brochure at the front desk). The furniture in my room was a little dinged-up, surprising for a luxury hotel of this ilk. The location behind the train station means that (surprise) you'll hear trains. I liked this, but you may not. Temperature controls were good. Walking into town involves climbing a few small hills and passing under a rather unpleasant underpass. I would not have done it after dark. Watch the drivers in Dallas--they are cowboys (haha), and I say that as a bona fide NY jaywalker. I planned to have dinner at the hotel's Italian bistro, but it was closed the nights I was there--\"low occupancy\" was the reason. The adjacent Centennial Cafe was open. Pricey but good.

Victor, Jesus, and their staff were amazing! With that being said, I did have some other not so stellar experiences in my 15-hour stay. It started with Valet. Due to the size of the Association of Water Board Directors conference (which was held at the Hyatt in 2008, 2010, and 2012), one would think the hotel would be better prepared for the amount of people. It took me 30 minutes from the time I got to the hotel to hand my car to the valet. There didn't seem to be any order with when cars were taken care of. I had 2 bags, a garment bag, 2 posters, and 2 easels, and was not asked if I needed any assistance. Once I made it to my hotel room, unpack all of my bags, and started getting ready for my event at 7pm, I noticed three things \"wrong\" with the bathroom: the tub did not drain properly, the toilet did not flush properly, and the tub floor was dirty/old with rust. A few other things \"wrong\" with the room included: the wrong time on the clock (not a big deal), splintered footboard, the dresser being pulled further out than normal because I'm assuming a previous guest was looking for a plug (which I managed to only find in the bathroom), a crack lamp shade, and chipped armrests on the chairs. I was actually very surprised by the noise level. I was able to clearly hear voices outside of my door, and noise from the lobby (7 floors down) well past midnight! I checked out at 7am, and although I was greeted, she did not inquire about my stay. When I told her of some of my issues, as I believed the hotel should be aware of these items, she offered me a free coffee for my trouble, which I did not take her up on. I went to the valet cashier to pick up my car, and no one was available. Someone from guest services managed to track someone down to get my car for me. I guess in short, it can be summarized by these two sentences. The Catering staff was fantastic. The rest of the hotel was lacking. I found it quite disappointing for a Hyatt.

We drove to the front of the hotel, and valet was right there to greet us despite the overwhelming amount of cars pulling in. The guys were friendly, organized and very competent in getting our bags and ticket for parking in valet. We proceeded inside to check in where we were greeted and welcomed by very friendly staff. We made our way to an extremely long line to check in. They had provided a table of flavored water for the guests checking in, which was a nice touch. Although overwhelmed at the first site of the line, they had 10 staff members\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 checking people in which helped us move quickly through the 25 minute wait at the check in line. Once we received our room key, we walked the long hallway to the two elevators which took us to our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the hotel. Normally two elevators would be sufficient, unless the hotel wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t full to capacity of 1500 quests. We walked into a musky, dingy, old hallway to our room. The pictures below show the condition of the room and the disgusting mess that would start our night at the Hyatt. Within 30 minutes of entering our room we had issues with room service, overflowing toilet, lighting issues, plug outlets, and air conditioning smell. Tip; room service does not understand the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153carafe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but understands \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pitcher\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and it only took us 20 minutes on the phone and a lot of frustration to understand this language barrier. After finally ordering a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pitcher\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of cranberry juice and two glasses, and a bucket of ice; we flushed the toilet and watched as water filled the bathroom floor immediately while one of us tried to turn the water off the other one called for maintenance, which took 45 for them to show up. After using all the towels to clean up the mess, we requested more towels from housekeeping so we could get ready for our New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve plans. This too was a long wait and almost impossible to get. After returning to the hotel later that night we were greeted with the following; no ice at the bar for drinks, no food (bar and restaurant closed at 11 on New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve? smart decision people), one elevator broken, the one elevator that worked was covered in something so sticky my shoes stuck to the floor, food (or blood we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell) was smeared on the elevator walls, trash, cups, food lined the hallways. I doubt that this was the Hyatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, clearly the management staff was not prepared for the sold out hotel and the cliental that was staying at the run down Hyatt.

The location is only good if you're there for business downtown. Otherwise, it's really hard to find the entrance and not really close to anything. The lobby and common areas are gorgeous and impressive, which is a huge contrast to the rooms. The rooms have more of a bed and breakfast feel to them than that of a big city hotel. By that, I mean they were kind of run down and dated. The bathroom was tiny and more like a bathroom you would expect to find in an apartment. Everything in the room just felt kind of cheap. For example, one morning I was sitting on the (covered) toilet to put on my tennis shoes without waking up my significant other, and the lid caved in. I'm a small person, and the lid was obviously made of really cheap plastic. As others have mentioned, the parking situation is ridiculously expensive and inconvenient for Dallas, but probably fine if you're from another major city. I believe it was $23 per day for valet parking with in and out privileges, and $10 per day for self parking in a non-hotel-affiliated lot across the street without in and out privileges.

So thank you for those tips, they're very good ones! The atrium is very pleasant with plants and fountains and an 18-floor glass wall on one side. A bar and two restaurants make up the other sides. Service was very good, and I loved it that in the lobby there are two computers and printers specifically set up for printing out your airplane boarding passes when you're checking out. I also appreciated the espresso shop which also sold beer and sundries. This is a gigantic hotel geared towards business travelers, with many conference rooms. It's a bit cut off from the West End by train tracks and an overpass, but it is possible to get out of the hotel and walk to some restaurants and bars. I did wish the hotel had better outdoor areas to enjoy, with benches to sit on - it seems a shame not to, with such good weather there so much of the year. The small outdoor pool area on the third floor had lounge chairs but was quite bleak, to quote a previous reviewer. No plants, cracked concrete - not an inviting place to hang out like most pool areas are. I was surprised to read in other reviews that this is supposed to be a 5-star hotel, as it didn't seem luxurious to me. It was perfectly satisfactory, but my room didn't even have a mini-fridge, which I've come to think of as rather standard. So I made good use of the ice bucket instead.

In fact, previous reviews have been followed up by the management indicating that they are working on a multimillion dollar renovation plan. My advice, wait until AFTER that plan is done. My room had loose electrical outlets, and one of the two beds had visible dirty linens. Further, the bed was not made correctly each day and the linens came apart each night when hitting the sack. The bathroom was not very pleasant either. I had noticed a little grime in the shower, but not until my shower on the last day did I notice mold. There was a fair amount of it, and both black and red mold... that was also the day my mold allergies acted up. I'm not severely allergic, and can tolerate mold (Don't need the hypoallergenic room for example). These allergies only act up when exposed to growing spores and those that are suspended in the air... Well, I noticed fresh growth all over the ceiling of the bathroom and the red mold growing on the curtain and in many place in the grout. It also looks like there are areas where the mold had grown before as the paint was bubbling in a few places and had been badly patched up in others. Overall, I would recommend staying at one of the other area properties. You will find other similar chains nearby, with much newer facilities and equally awesome views. This location has a fair amount of work to do, and has refocused my efforts on attaining the next higher status level with a different \"h\" hotel chain, instead of Hyatt.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queensland - Australia", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Hotel great location\u201d", "Author": "AussieTJ", "ReviewID": "UR119089365", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here September 2011, it looks amazing from the moment you pull into to drive way and it gets better when you enter the hotel, the staff were really friendly and could not do enough for us, after we settled into our room reception rang to check that we were happy with everything have never had service like that before.

The property is an easy walk to several Dallas sights, and the light rail/ Commuter rail station is connected by a tunnel to the lobby. There is an observation deck on a lower level, I think level 5.

Both times I felt disappointed. We had a great start- valet very attentive, and carried our bags to check in. Then the trouble began. Hyatt is trying to be a \"pet friendly\" hotel, it has a \"few\" rooms which it made pet friendly. We had tried for two days the week prior to make a reservation for a pet friendly room. When we called, they said the manager was out and this person was the only person who could make it. Then we called central reservations, same thing, called and left a message with no return call. We went ahead and booked online and left comments about a small pet and how we weren't called back. We also upgraded to the city view \"VIP\" program. When we got to the desk, the CSR did not have a king size bed, then did not have a pet friendly room on the city view. Only left with the 4th floor (which we had already stayed at, before they became pet friendly). I understand they only have a few pet rooms available, but how about the fact that their customer service is so poor they don't even return your calls? I told them we could wait no longer and went ahead and booked reservation. If they would have called me sooner, i could have booked at another place, They are not the only hotel in this town. But it was too late! Checking in at 10 pm, where else were we going to go? we got stuck on the 4th floor. The rooms are a disappointment. Again being a 4 star hotel, you would expect everything to be modernized. The hyatt is an old hotel with some minor covers to make it look \"updated.\" the furniture is so old, its probably from 1980, old wood, and the desk looks like something I had in 5th grade. I am not sure if the upper level rooms have better furniture, but I was depressed when I was in the room. At least this time the bathroom was clean. Like other reviewers, the previous stay, the bathroom was so dirty, with mold growing on the tile- needed major cleaning of the caulk. The bed was comfortable, the TV a large LG, no DVD. We had breakfast as compensation after I told them they were not the only hotel in town. The breakfast was good but on the greasy side. We ordered egg white omlets, side of bacon and coffee. Food was brought up promptly. We visited wolfgang puck 560 and def agree, it is the highlight of the stay. The food is definitely overpriced and the bottle of champagne as well but you are paying for the view. I understand. The food was very good though. I would recommend the bar area, where you don't have to make reservations and you can just plop down on the couches and enjoy the view. We had also asked for late check out and paid the extra fee. Upon check out, we scrutinized our bill, good thing! because they tried to charge an extra day of valet parking and an extra day of pet fees. Be careful and ask for your final bill. It saved us 70+ dollars and hassle of phone call to argue. All in all, go for the reunion tower/wolfgang puck's view, but skip the 3 start trying to be 4 star hotel and stay somewhere else. bleh.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange Park, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel.

Be aware of panhandlers though. The hotel is very close to everything Dallas has to offer. Staff at hotel were almost eerily on top of things, example our 8yr old was squirming in his chair as we ate breakfast in the lobby, he was being silly and fell off his chair no big deal, within seconds staff appeared to ask if he was ok.

The hotel was very well decorated. The front desk was very friendly. We booked 2 rooms and requested a refrigerator for each room at the time of booking. However, only one room was equipped with a fridge. We were told that they will send another one to the other room but that never happened. The refrigerator we had was a small, old, beaten-up one so we didn't care to get another one anyway. The rooms were medium size (not very spacious) and looked quite outdated. The beds were comfortable though. But it's really nothing remarkable about the rooms considering it's branded as a \"luxury\" hotel. The swimming pool was very small for a hotel this size. It was a hot weekend - the temp was in high 90s when we were there. They served free lemonade at the lobby which was refreshing, especially for the people that just came in from outside. The front desk staff was very courteous and made you feel welcome. The location of the hotel was excellent - right in the downtown (sort of) and next to the DART train line. In one afternoon, we walked to the train station and spent a few dollars to take the train ride to Plano and then back. The round-trip ride took about 90 minutes in an air-conditioned train. It was relaxing and enjoyable. The kids loved it! We used the valet parking while staying there. Didn't have any problems for the first 3 days. On the last day, after we checked out and were ready to leave, we waited a long time for our car. Granted, a lot of people were leaving at the time, so we waited patiently for our car to show up. After 20 minutes or so, I had to ask a parking attendant where our car is. After 7 or 8 minutes, she came back and said she's not sure because \"the record\" shows the car has already been brought out. She told me to ask their supervisor who was standing a few feet away. The supervisor checked and gave me the same answer - the car has been brought out and waiting. But the car he pointed to is not my car! He ran to the key box and checked again and realized that they had made a mistake by bringing a wrong car. He immediately ran to the garage and brought out our car. He was very apologetic. He loaded our luggage and offered us some icy water which was much appreciated.

From the time that I arrived by car, I was treated like I was the only guest there. Now, I absolutely hate to pay for parking but when I arrived, the valets were actually fun. The current rate was $19.00 per night with unlimited in and out privileges. They were quick to my car, opened the door for me and greeted me with bottled spring water. In the short amount of time from arrival to securing a bellman for me, my valet really tried to get to know me and to show interest in the purpose for my stay. He stayed with me and my luggage until the bellman came, making sure that I had someone to take care of me. The bellman was equally attentive and stayed with me until I checked-in. The reservation staff pulled up my loyalty card profile and added amenities that I had even forgotten that I was entitled. I didn't have to ask her, she just did it. That is was good customer service is about, anticipating the client's needs. The bellman was very careful with my luggage, not just slinging things everywhere. He was prepared with a master key and did not have me fumbling to find mine. He gave me safety tips before he left and pointed out the exit routes. Because of all the recent tornadoes that we have had in the South, the bellman made sure I knew what to do and where to go in case of danger. I had a Deluxe King Room with very simple traditional, clean lines. My bed had a white duvet cover, crisp white sheets and plenty of pillows. The mattress was a little firmer than I was accustomed to but that did not cause me discomfort or problems sleeping. There were two upholstered chairs at the adequately spaced work desk with in-room high-speed internet access. I did not have any problems with accessing the internet and not problems with interference or dropping connection. There was also a large upholstered sleeper chair. The 42\" LG flat paneled television had a wonderful picture and great sound quality. The television sat atop of a large credenza with 4-large drawers and two open shelves for storage. I do not have an Apple device so I am not sure if I am describing this properly but the clock radio had a built in ipod/nano adapter. The clock radio had a night light that you can adjust the illumination. I really loved the bathroom because even though this property had been around a long time, it did not seem old. The bathroom now has double French doors with etched glass inserts. The coffee maker is in the bathroom which I do not like but since I don't drink coffee, that is really irrelevant to me. The pendent lighting, granite-like counter tops and the contrasting color scheme gave the bathroom a real sophisticated feel. There were high quality Portico toiletries. I can't say enough about the hotel staff. Everyone was excellent. I had really gotten disgusted at the level of customer service at domestic hotels but this hotel rose to the occasion. As much as possible, they tried to call you by name (I know, I know I had a name badge on but it still makes you feel special when someone calls you by name). They were so attentive, I almost felt like I was on a cruise ship. If they said that they would do something for you, they would do it or come tell you why they could not do it. There were a lot of us at this convention but they kept the common areas spotless. And they were smiling. I know everyone was working very hard but they were still smiling and made me feel very welcome. Hotel managers would stop you and ask if there was something they could do for you and would do it. They just didn't assign it to someone else, they did it themselves if possible. This hotel is adjacent to the convention center with a connecting corridor. It also has the famous revolving restaurant atop the Reunion Tower. It is now the home of Five Sixty by Wolfgang Puck. I did not eat here on this stay buy I have eaten many times before Puck so I know the view is spectacular. The convention meals and snacks we were served were excellent with lots of creativity and variety. When I would enter our dining room, I felt like I was walking down the red carpet at the Oscars! When I checked out, things went just as seamlessly and smoothly. I really did not mind paying the parking because I felt that I actually got something for my money. Some of the valets were in training but the managers were instructing them every step of the way to make sure they learned their job correctly.

Second, it is situated between a 12 lane interstate on one side, and the Union Station train station on the other, so there is a lot of exterior noise both late into the night and early in the morning. This would not be a problem if the Hyatt had decent windows and sound insulation, but it does not.

So if you are a light sleeper or troubled by this sort of noise, you should stay elsewhere, as you will be very unhappy here. The staff at the registration desk apparently get a lot of complaints and comments about this issue, but there is really nothing they can do for you.

You're also right on top of Union Station with access to the DART tram which is convenient if you're visiting other parts of the city.

I would certainly recommend saving yourself dollars and hassle by parking at the perfectly good open parking lot at the bottom of the Hyatt Regency Drive.

The room itself was very nice, and the bed comfortable. I asked for a quiet room, and got a room on the 23rd floor facing toward the back of the hotel (away from the train station). I would recommend doing the same. I paid for valet parking which was fast and easy. I sat at the bar one night and had an AMAZING cheeseburger (really!), but was a little disappointed to watch the bartender pour Cuervo when an order for Patron shots came in, and Smirnoff when someone ordered a Grey Goose and soda.

Our group also held two private receptions in our suite during the trip. To give this review proper context I need to provide a bit of history as to how I have provided ratings in the past on Trip Advisor and my travel experience in general. If you note my other reviews you will see that high praise is well earned or I do not give it. There are too many people who rate standard and acceptable service as 5 Star / excellent. I use the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Star\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rating on Trip Advisor to demonstrate exactly what I experienced in relation to hundreds of hotels I have been to all over the world; from dumps in Eastern Europe, where we shared a BR and shower with the entire floor of rooms, to true 5 stars in the US, Europe and Asia. One star is a warning against staying at a dump \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 5 star means on par with the best in the world at up to $1000 per night room rates. With this in mind the Hyatt Dallas at Reunion has provided one of the best front end service experiences I have ever had with a few exceptions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a definite and strong 5 star. See my staff kudos below for details. Food in the hotel was fair to absolutely disgusting, (<1 star for in room dining \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 2 stars in the restaurants) I ordered, from room service, the crab and goat cheese dip which was unappealing in appearance as it looked like soup rather than dip. Worse it tasted like warm vomit - no kidding, no exaggeration \u00e2\u20ac\u201c When I complained they did not even take it off my bill. Interestingly enough, I ran into another convention attendee that had the exact same dish and the exact same opinion except he said that it actually made him ill. Restaurants in the hotel were not good even for convention food. Hot foods were served cold and tasted like something out of a box that had been micro-waved. Fresh fruit had been over chilled, were watery and had chunks of rind on the melon slices. No excuse that they are undergoing a $2Million restoration including the restaurants. It is the hotels job to ensure quality food. Rooms and Environment: Furnishing were standard business class (a low 3 star). The Wolfgang Puck (Asian fusion) restaurant 560 was very good although the wait staff was slow, uninspired, and low class. The view made the experience worthwhile. At 50 stories up and a revolving view it was truly amazing. It is very expensive ($30 and up for entrees) but good food cooked properly. The view makes the higher than warranted prices worth it! A definite 4 star for the food and view combined- the General Manager and the Sommelier really added to the experience, they were knowledgeable, friendly, and professional. Location: The location was great. walking distance (15 - 20 mins) from down town and the west end restaurant district. Lots of excellent choices, hard to go wrong. Lobby: The Lobby was impressive and the elevators were fast and efficient. We actually rode the lobby elevator to the top floor so we could ride it down! It was like the \"Drop Zone ride\". I have attached one pic I took from the elevator from about the 20th floor. Details: On day one of a 4 day trip we arrived at the hotel. The lobby is HUGE as one would expect of a large conference hotel. Bell men were at the ready and the front desk was well staffed. We were taken care of very quickly by a friendly helpful front end. Several of our rooms were not yet available and bellmen appeared in droves to take care of storing our baggage. We were told that our bags would be delivered to our rooms as soon as they were available. With our check in complete half the group went to the rooms and the rest of us sent directly to meetings and or elsewhere. We also informed the front desk and concierge desk of our pending reception in our suite. They immediately set up a table for check in of our guests and spread the word of our meeting so that the staff could direct lost guests to our table. Unfortunately the staff was VERY large (more than a dozen at the front desk, at least 10 bell men and more at the concierge desk) and the lobby was ENORMOUS; see the photo with the 2.5 story water fall below) and not all the staff were informed of our event and several guess were missed in the process. We also had 4 sets of business cards lost while in storage. The staff (including two bell men, the front end manager and at least two security personnel) turned the hotel upside down looking for the cards and when the cards did not turn up immediately they had a 24 hour print shop reproduce new sets of cards in about 5 hours including time for two proofs. The concierge was amazing in helping us get set up for our first reception that took place only two hours after our arrival. Conference services kicked into gear and we had drinks on ice, light finger food, extra seating in the suite and a multi-site conference call set up almost immediately. They even produced a sign for our company for the Lobby and put our event on the Hotel lobby board without being asked \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just \u00e2\u20ac\u0153because we thought it would help\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Avis was to have picked up another colleague that was going to arrange a rental for our group and provided the worst experience ever- lazy, uncaring, and with a poor attitude. In response to the Avis mess a hotel driver came to the rescue. He drove our colleague all over town trying to get issues resolved for our stay and participation in the convention. For three hours he did everything he could to help resolve issues. When offered a gratuity he replied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no thank, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a tough day and I am just happy I could be of assistance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. WHAT! Incredible. We called on him time and time again during our stay and each time he was both an excellent guide and outstanding assistant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c gratuities later accepted. We also adopted a Bell Man / Concierge who was faster to respond to issues, needs, and requests than anyone I have ever seen. Without our asking, he had housekeeping make additional stops by our suite to ensure that it was kept neat and clean for our guests at all times, kept ice on the drinks throughout the day, and ensured that food was kept fresh \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no old unrefrigerated items stayed out for long enough to make someone sick. When I left to pick up our business cards, before I got in the car, our driver asked me if I had the data and or documents I needed to have reproduced with me. Since I was picking up I did not need anything but this level of attention to detail and care for my situation is outstanding. KUDOS! Although all of the front end and security staff were truly excellent there were two Specific Standouts: Victor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Bell Man / Concierge and our Driver Paul were outstanding. Equal to or better than my experiences with the staff at the: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153W\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hotel and the Joule in Dallas, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Intercontinental in Prague, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 George V in Paris, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Savoy in Moscow, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Peninsula in NY and Shanghai, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Willard in Washington DC.

The room was clean, well organized and pleasant. It also was relatively quiet, except for some occasional noise from the train tracks below, but that seemed to fade away. The staff at check in was extremely friendly and helpful. The only curious thing about this huge hotel is the swimming pool. If you're looking for a great pool, this is definitely not it. There's a tiny pool on one of the lower rooftops, where on a July day it was hotter than you'd care to experience. To say this pool is tiny is an understatement.

The elevators in this hotel are a bit frighting! The ones that do not have glass fronts seem to be missing sections of the kick board around the bottom edges and tend to have gaps in the wall coverings so you can see into the elevator shafts which is a bit unsettling.

When I asked my waiter if they always have fruit flies, he asked if they were bothering me. They are not only there, but there was one in my room and several around the buffet in the main dining area. I found silverfish in my sink. The food is very mediocre and very overpriced. This place really made me miss the DoubleTree. It is so much nicer than here. Also, my room was not the cleanest. I noticed that there were pieces of string and little pieces of paper on my flower. During my four-day stay, those pieces remained on the floor. I was curious if they vacuumed, and I can tell you that they didn't while I was there. Nor did they ever dust the top of the tv cabinet, which had a light coating of dust. The bathtub had a feeling of soap scum around the top of the tub. The people at Registration are not at all friendly, Even when I checked in and out, I did not receive one smile or thank you from them. Other areas of the staff were very friendly in the dining rooms, guest services, and concierge desk. The dining room people were very nice, but very lax at removing your plates, especially for a buffet service. Besides most of the staff being very friendly, I was lucky because I had a great view of Dealey Plaza and downtown Dallas. Also, the linens and bed were wonderful very comfortable. I was supposed to stay here for another night and have a relaxing day, but decided to cancel and leave the hotel. Why pay $200 a day for this service?

I travel often for business and usually stay at Marriotts. This was a last minute trip and found a cheaper package through orbitz. I figured that I couldn't go wrong with a Hyatt. First, the location is very awkward for walking around. You have to exit the property and walk through one of two tunnells under the railway system. They are very dark and pretty seedy. First night I walked to dinner and was threatened on the way back by two \"not friendly looking\" young men. This isn't the hotel's fault but something to know. The staff was friendly, especially in the labby bar. The bartender remembered my name and my drink on the second night. This was a nice touch. However the room left much to be desired. First, the television was very old and in a very awkward piece of furniture that made it hard to view from the bed. In any case I have stayed at Holiday Inns with 40\" + flat screens and a \"world class\" hyatt for business travelers have tiny 20 year old junky televisions? Secondly, the bathroom was dirty. The showerhead had a ton of gross looking deposits, and the tub was filthy. I am also submitting pictures you can view. I ordered a sandwich one night from room service that was awful. Valet charge is $20 a day and there is NOWHERE close that you want to walk back from at night to self park. The business center charged me $15 to access the internet to make a printout. It was very tacky and nickle and dime for a Hyatt that caters to business travelers. When i checked out she asked how my stay was. I told her I was dissapointed that my shower was dirty, television was old, small, and hard to see from the bed, and valet is very expensive when there isn't really an alternative. Also, my room was opposite the train station so I got to listen to that all day and night. She asked me why I didn't ask to change rooms. I told her that I assumed the hotel didn't maintain a list of which rooms have filthy showers and which ones don't.

Our only other option was going with a suite which would most likely have a bed, sofa bed, and the option to bring in a roll away. Hyatt Regency was the cheapest hotel with a suite option. We had the horizon suite which had a king bed, 2 bathrooms both with tub/shower combo, a living room with sofa that pulled out to a queen bed and two large chairs, small kitchen with fridge, and a huge dining room table.

It's a full block away, at the bottom of a hill, is owned and operated by the City of Dallas, and does not offer \"in and out\" privileges.

I'm not a particularly light sleeper, but I woke up several times during the night to the sound of train horns.

It was possible to park a short distance away for $10 and carry your luggage to the check-in desk, but if you needed to leave for any reason, you were charged $10 each time you returned. For this reason, we opted Hyatt's valet parking for $20/day which meant whenever we needed to leave: 1. Wait in line to turn in your ticket to the valet desk 2. Wait in line while your vehicle was retrieved (I waited about 25 minutes since it was so busy on Saturday night). 3. Give the valet a tip (optional, but you know how that goes). 4. Once you return, wait in a traffic jam 20-30 minutes to simply return your vehicle to the valet (it was backed up for about a block when I returned, hence the aforementioned lack of organization).

Perhaps if you get a room on the opposite side of the train tracks, the noise won't be so noticeable. And what's with the relic TV, Hyatt? The one in our room must have been at least 15 years old. It's way past time to update to the HD's that have been around for a number of years now (you know, the same way your competitors such as the Hilton and other hotel/motel chains have already done?) On the upside, I have to say the room was spacious and very clean. All of the employees were courteous and helpful. I won't mention the food or the location as other reviewers have already hit on that. I would recommend with one caveat--if you can get a really good discounted price, but certainly not if you have to pay the full price.", "Date": "November 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tolar, Texas", "Title": "\u201cOur stay at the Regency was wonderful\u201d", "Author": "blsntx", "ReviewID": "UR48786224", "Content": "We had a room on the fifth floor and we heard no trains or airplanes which some people complain about.

Last time I stayed at the Hilton Anatole, and this time I stayed at the Hyatt Regency, some of my comments are comparisons. I got a great deal on this room at $50/night + tax. They get you on the parking, though....$20 per day for Valet. (Normally I'd self-park, but if you do that you pay $10 every time you exit the lot....no thanks) The valet service can be charged to your room but it is managed by a separate company. Be sure you check your charges carefully upon check-out...the valet company tried to charge us for an extra day's worth of parking. The front desk clerk quickly caught & corrected this issue. The desk clerk was pleasant and happy to accomodate our request to be in the tower and on a higher floor. (She also gave us a room with a great view). Other front desk staff were also pleasant, as was the concierge. The Fitness Center in this hotel had some of the nicest equipment I've seen at a hotel fitness center, and is open 24/7. The 3rd floor rooftop pool was small but we didn't do any swimming. The room we got was non-smoking and had 2 double beds. The room seemed small and the furniture was just ok...seemed somewhat dated. The bathroom was nice and we had excellent water pressure even on the 23rd floor. There are train tracks that run right by the hotel and yes, you'll probably hear trains at some point during the night. They weren't loud enough to wake me up but might be a problem for light sleepers. I like to sleep with the room cold, so the first thing I did when we got to the room was to turn the thermostat down to about 65 degrees. Even with the thing set on high the room never got below about 68...usually hovering around 70. The ac was also very quiet which can be a bad thing because it doesn't drown out any other noise. Sounds in the hall & in adjacent rooms weren't muffled well in this hotel. I had planned to at least stop by the Wolfgang Puck restaurant or lounge but never made it up there so I can't comment on that.

I must say, it was not quite what I was expecting. Now let me start by saying that I was there for 7 nights and got a screaming deal on the Hyatt website. The rate was $67 for four of the nights and about $80 for the other three. This was direct with Hyatt and not a third party booking service. The hotel was very crowded on our arrival and during the entire stay for that matter. Despite the fact that we have a Diamond status with Hyatt, we had a very small, outdated room, no upgrades available. The television old, the furniture was dinged and worn looking , the bed was very uncomfortable (unusual for Hyatt), the linens were thin, the air didn't work great and the closet was extremely small. In our reservation, we also requested non-feather bed pillows and comforter due to allergies and it took them two days to get that right. I think the most disappointing thing of all was that they no longer have a regency club. My source had told me that this property had one of the best regency clubs around. Evidently, it closed earlier this year. As a result, breakfast was served in the restaurant and complimentary to Diamond members. It was okay and we only ate there one time. Some other items to note; the hotel is not within walking distance to any real restaurants or activities. It is conveniently located near the freeways and is easy to access if you are traveling around the Dallas area. The parking was about $20 per day for valet and what seemed odd was that each day when returning our vehicle we had to get a new ticket and start all over, rather than keep the same one for our entire trip. This seemed to waste time, particularly when the hotel was so busy. The pool resembles a large bath tub and is located on the roof on the 3rd floor. Okay if you want a quick cool down, but not a good place for families. Not sure if I would stay here again. There were a lot of negatives and the only true positive was the price.

Common/public areas are quite nice and the overview of the center waterfall is exquisite. The rooms were nice but there was no refrigerator nor microwave available; neither was wifi included, it had to be purchased in order to be received in one's room. There was bottled water available in the room for $4.50 per bottle-well over-priced. For a stay at over $100 per night the perks that required payment were excessive. The staff were well groomed and friendly for the most part with the exception of a very small few. Although helpful, a couple of staff members from the front of the house (concierge and front desk) seemed less than anxious to provide need services, but others were very warm and willing to provide any services required. There was also a problem with service in the Casual Restaurant where service was never rendered. It took about five minutes to be acknowledged when waiting to be seated; when finally addressed, servicing was quickly interrupted by another patron cutting in and the hosted promptly began helping him and never returned to take my order. I do admit that after about a 10-15 wait, another staff member noticed me standing there and asked if I needed help but I could not wait any longer due to business restrains. Service had to be sought at their Specialty Restaurant (\"Coffee's Post\") instead where the quality of food received was less than desired. Personal pizza made-to-order was ordered and it was pre-made frozen pizza with merely a sprinkle of cheese and was heated an insufficent amount of time and the crust was burnt. The pizza tasted of freezer burn and was less than tasty; it was priced at $7. What was provided was much less than what was paid for. This same restaurant seemed to over-price most items; in example, individual Yoplait yogart that I typically purchase for 50 cents per container at Kroger or Wal-Mart was more than $3 per container at the \"Coffee's Post\"-EXCESSIVE!

This hotel is big and hosts many conventions and events. There was a line during our check-in, we had to wait. That was not a big deal but the front desk was in such a hurry to check everyone in that it felt very impersonal and more like we were in a conveyor line. Definitely not the same Hyatt we experienced elsewhere. The location was hard to find when driving by car because it is at the intersection of several major highways in downtown Dallas. You have to navigate through some off ramps and on ramps if you are getting off one of the highway exits. Luckily we had a Garmin GPS and that helped tremendously. This hotel is part of the Reunion Tower and Arena complex. It looks modern on the outside but the room's were a little dated circa the 1980's. It reminds me of the Hotel Pennsylvania in NYC. The bathroom was small, old manual thermostat, old clunky 27\" TV, old carpeting, and the gym had old equipment w/o AC. We had a Priceline reservation, they might have given us a dated room but I have a feeling all the rooms are the same. There is a big parking lot on the premise of the hotel but they restrict it for valet parking only at an unreasonable price of $20/day. We saved money by parking a block away (albeit down a small incline) at Reunion Blvd West for $10/day or less if you park by the hour. It's called Ace Parking which is directly to the left of the hotel and I have a picture of it. There is an attendant there 24/7, no in/out access but you don't have to deal with the busy valet. We were there when they honored Ross Perot one night and the hotel was more crowded and the valet was a giant mess. It looked like midtown Manhattan gridlock, we were glad we did self-parking. The Reunion Tower and restaurant is closed until at least Dec 08 for renovations. If you get a good deal for this place, it's not bad because of the location but otherwise I would stay elsewhere.

If you are interested in roaming bands of hundreds of unsupervised screaming children, apparently this is the place for you. There's really not much for kids at the hotel or in the area, so they were just chasing each other all over the hotel and joyriding in the elevators with the hotel staff doing nothing about it. Multiple times I waited over 20 minutes to get on an elevator along with a lot of annoyed adults. A group of kids would show up and literally push people out of the way to get on an elevator. I pointed out the > 100 or so people waiting on an elevator to the front desk staff and they suggested I go up to the 2nd floor and try to get on there. Another 100 people were waiting for the elevators on the 2nd floor. I went back down and asked where the stairs are - to my room on the 12th floor. The atrium area echoes sound so badly that the sound of the bar, restaurant, and lobby (oh and don't forget all the screaming kids) is amplified and very loud inside the rooms, even with towels shoved under the door and the tv on. I'm not saying the hotel should be supervising other peoples kids, but if they book kids dance competitions and volleyball tournaments and allow children to stay in rooms together without an adult, then they created this situation and should take the responsibility to deal with the result. Clearly Hyatt was not prepared for the situation they created, or is not interested in maintaining their reputation with business customers - or adults in general, for that matter. Other than that, the rooms were ok, although becoming a bit worn (peeling paint, torn wallpaper, scuffed furniture, stains) and it doesn't look like they are properly maintaining this hotel. Most likely their business has fallen off due to Reunion arena and renovating reunion tower and this is the result. On the positive side, the valet staff was great and very friendly. The (Parrinos?) restaurant was surprisingly very good. I got this room for $60 on priceline - so beware on priceline - if you bid on a 4 star hotel downtown, you are most likely to get the hyatt.

Check-in was a breeze and overall I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any problems with the room. The room was a good size and was clean. The Hyatt had a note in my room that said if you use your \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Privacy Please\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign then the maids won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change you room at all. I used this sign so I could leave my laptop setup when I was out of my room and to their credit the maids didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enter my room at all over the 4 days I was there (I left the sign out the whole time). I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to other hotels where they pretty much just ignore the sign and the maids enter at 8:00am anyway. I have different observations if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a business traveler versus a family traveling on vacation. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll start with a quick tip for business travelers. I was traveling on business and high-speed internet is always key for me. I ended up on the 6th floor in a room pretty far away from the lobby area. When I connected to the hotels high-speed internet service via wi-fi (the only option possible in my room) the signal I got was very low. A number of times my connection would just drop when I was connected for even a short time. I asked at the front desk regarding what could be done and they gave me a device (they called it a booster) which plugged into my laptop and that did the trick. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any problems with dropped connections after that and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to pay anything for the booster, so good save on the Hyatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part since otherwise they would have had to move me to a room with better reception. As for my other business (and families) advice, the Hyatt isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t near much in terms of restaurants that you can easily walk to so either rent a car if you tire easily of room service, expect to take some cab rides, or go across the street to the light-rail system if you want to venture away from the Hyatt (room service was actually pretty good and pretty fast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but not cheap). For families traveling who are looking for a resort experience just one word or warning, the pool and hot-tub at the Hyatt are fairly small and are on the roof on the 3rd floor. When I was there it was very, very hot on the roof with virtually no shade (no umbrellas or covered chairs). If your looking to spend some serious time by the pool I think that would make the Hyatt a bad choice -- I was out on the pool deck on a 90+ degree, sunny day and it was unbearable. Also, the Hyatt has a coffee shop on the lobby level, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great place to get soft drinks, pizza or snacks for the kids. I almost walked past without noticing all the goodies they had for sale. Cab fare from DFW to the hotel was $45 and took about 30 minutes.

It is set off from the rest of the downtown by some underpasses that are not particularly hospitable at night. Thus, while much of downtown is within walking distance, you may not wish to chance the walk after dark. The Hyatt has the obligatory huge atrium and multiple dining/drinking options. The next-door revolving restaurant tower, however, is under construction. The food/drinks were serviceable, if overpriced. The staff was most friendly and well-intentioned.

The rooms are modern and clean, the beds are comfortable, and the hotel staff is friendly and helpful. However, the issues we (and other families in our group) had with room service were terrible. After tallying up the \"damage\" our group ended up with 4 dinners delivered more than one hour after promised time (out of 5 dinners ordered). In our case, we ordered breakfast for 6:30-6:45am. Because of past issues at Hyatt's we not only filled out the door-hanger-menu but we gave it to one of the staff who delivered it to room service the night before. We needed to leave the hotel at 7:15am sharp for the gymnastics meet. At 7:05, no breakfast. I called room service, they acknowledged my order, but said they were busier than usual and it would be at least 15 more minutes before breakfast would be delivered. We cancelled breakfast (and were not charged for it) and were able to run to a nearby store and get a bagel and some fruit juice. On the bus over to the gymnastics meet we talked to other parents who were very upset that they travelled 2000 miles, stayed in a fairly high-end hotel, and now their kids would be competing in a 4-hour gymnastics meet without having had breakfast. This is something that would be forgivable for a 2-star hotel but not for a 3-star or higher hotel. It's possible the room service experience might be better if the hotel were half full or less.

Best part about this place is that there are always Hotwire and Priceline deals available - this is \"4 star\" on Priceline and most recently I got a room with a $70 bid. The hotel has \"express check in\" kiosks - even if you book on Priceline or Hotwire the kiosk will let you pick the kind of room you want (which floor, park view vs. city view, etc). The hotel is a great location on the east side of downtown Dallas - convenient to all the major freeways (I-30, I-35E, I-45). You are minutes away from the West End Marketplace, the JFK memorial, the State Fair, Deep Ellum, and the clubs/restaurants in the Oak Lawn/Cedar Springs area. Dallas' rail line runs very close to the hotel as well. Some tips: The hotel is at the I-35E exit for Corporate Drive *East* (not West). When leaving the hotel, you need to take a right at the second light to get onto the freeway (the first light will take you into downtown). For parking, use the public lot at the bottom of the hill. Its a max of $10/day - its cheaper than paying the Valet parking plus you can come/go as you want *quickly* any time day/night. You'll just have to walk your suitcase a short ways up the hill.

I had a problem with my bed light not working and they sent up a mechanic who fixed the problem in no time (it really was electrical--I had identified the faulty cord, but he made the thing work consistently!). I ordered room service three times and it was impeccable every time--expensive and extremely filling, but very good ($23 for the standard breeakfast). You even get the unexpected steamed asparagus and grilled tomato for breakfast...veggies for breakfast--a nice treat! Thermostat in the room was crazy, it took some fine tuning to adjust it correctly. The beds were awesome--so comfortable. My view stunk--roofs, trains (and the whistles!) and the tower elevator was my view, but hey, I'm working, so what. My tub was clogged--I left a message with the front desk when I left--didn't have time to call before then and it didn't seem to bother me (my own filth, I guess? Eww!). I had dinner in the revolving tower one night--it was great and an absolutely wonderful view--nice sunset, full moon, great view of the book depository...I'm being bad, but it really was our initial view...apparently you revolve once an hour and that's how we figured that out. Having a drink up there proved to be a weird experience, so we opted for the hotel bar. Great bar but the World Series was on (poor Rockies!), so it was packed--no service at all. But I was here the day before the Series (and ironically, the day before our conference) and there was hardly anybody at the bar and I received superb service. I got to know \"Bob\" really well! I also had breakfast in the breakfast buffet area (forgot the name)-it was $15 (included juice and coffee) and a nice selection. I like that the hotel serves Starbucks--I know, I'm a coffee snob. Stay away from scrambled eggs though. They will cook whatever eggs you want, so do that option! I had the scrambled \"eggs\" at a conference brunch and they were gross--it tasted like powdered eggs...I backpack, so I know what they taste like! Other things, let's see--I forgot my workout clothes and they have a pretty nice gym and an outside terrace on the 3rd floor. They actually sold me a workout outfit (shorts and a t-shirt) for $15! It wasn't that bad and hey, I felt better about all the drinks at the bar! The one bad thing: The atrium rooms are LOUD!! Granted, I am a light sleeper and I always bring earplugs. On most nights, I just cranked the AC fan and the little wall that separates the foyer from the room seemed to work well for noise control (bar noise like loud laughing, glasses clinking, etc.). However, on my last night, there was a YoungLife conference or something and those kids were going nuts clapping and chanting until 1:00am. It's a good thing I have insomnia when I go on work travel, otherwise I think I might have killed them. I ordered a glass of wine to my room at 11:30 to wind down and the room service guy was saying that alot of people were complaining about the noise. So, just be forewarned: Atrium room=great interior view, lots 'o noise. My friends in the interior rooms said they heard nothing, so that might be something to consider if you don't bring earplugs! Last things--you can check in and print your boarding passes at the front desk and cabs were always lined up whenever we needed them. Really, the staff was absolutely wonderful in every aspect. Oh, one more thing--there is a BBQ joint called Sonny Bryan's Smokehouse BBQ that is relatively close to the hotel...it was recommended, but eh, not so much. I'm from the south originally, so you really have to have some good BBQ to impress me. I was happy to have some good fried okra and all, but the place struck me as somewhat of a tourist lure.

Maybe it was because we used priceline, but the entire floor had a sort-of septic tank smell to it. The rooms didn't stink, but the hallway sure did. The room itself is fine -- big, cushy bed. I loved the double french doors on the bathroom. We had a single king room, and were somewhat perplexed by the placement of the TV. ... you can't see it well from the bed (it faces the desk and two chairs.) We left early the next morning to continue on the Austin. Check-out was easy, as was retrieving the car from the lot down the straight. The overall: I was pleased with it, flaws on all, because we paid 64 bucks a night for it.

It was within walking distance or a short cab ride to the Convention Center, Kennedy Plaza, Market St., Etc. The lobby is really nice inside with a waterfall and a nice relaxing feel to it. I worried, because if you read my review last year of the Sheraton in Arlington, TX, the lobby was great, and everything else was horrible. But I proceeded with hope. Front desk check-in was a breeze, unlike my last review at the South Point in Vegas, as staff was very friendly. In the lobby they have kiosks were you can print airline tickets, which was helpful. They also have a nice market store for late night snacks, and a nice gift shop. The rooms were very nice, which shocked me since other reviewers were down on the rooms. The decor was very nice, and you know me, I love the beds. And this bed was REALLY comfortable! Best part about this place. You could really sleep on these baby's! The TV was in an odd place where you had to pull it out of the cabinet, and twist it towards the bed. If you're on the bed, you're looking down at the TV, odd, but no big deal. The bathroom was nice, and the sink area was modern and new. The shower area is starting to look a little worn out, but it wasn't too bad. The worst part of this hotel was the dinning. I was there for a bodybuilding & fitness expo, and the hotel was packed with people. They were hosting this expo, which was at the Convention Center, and they knew of the large crowds months in advance. However, there were HUGE waiting times for the main restaurant on the 2nd floor. One night, I was alone, and waiting 45 mins to be seated, then the waiter, who looked like he was the only one working, said my food, which I only ordered an appetizer, would take an additional 45 mins! I figured they were just understaffed for that night. However, the next day for lunch, my table waited 2 hours for our food, which wasn't even that good!! That really made this hotel drop down a few notches. The pool was not good either as others have stated, very small. It's an expensive place, so not everyone could stay there, but overall it's not that bad a hotel. I'd stay there again, and just eat elsewhere.

Check-in on Sunday was a snap. 2,500 conference attendees present from law enforcement, d.a. offices, mental health, and social work fields. I was initially booked a room facing west, and found that a/c was not working. Requested engineering to fix a/c and was told that I would be moved to another room. Room arrangements were made within 15 minutes. Was assigned to 26th floor with a panoramic view of the Dallas Skyline! Wow! No a/c problem here. However, hallways were warm. Room itself was large enough for myself, wife and 3 year old daughter. Plenty of space - desk, sofa chair w/ ottaman, pillow-top king bed, 27\" T.V., microfridge, beautifully appointed bathroom w/ typical Hyatt touches. Carpeting and window drapes a little outdated. All staff (valet parking attendants, bellman, concierge, check-in/registration) were professional and very courteous. My daughter lost a blanket for her plush toy, and cleaning staff found it and returned to my daughter! What a wonderful touch! Room service exceeded my expectations. Portions were large, and always received a follow-up/courtesy call from room service if everything was satisfactory. Hotel is \"connected\" to downtown via underground walkway that leads to Union Station and Light Rail platform. Very easy to use and take to shopping/eating areas of Downtown (West End). Valet parking is a little steep @ $18 + tax, but very convenient with minimal wait for your vehicle to be brought out, with in/out privileges. There are city-owned parking lots to the north and south of hotel and charge $10, but NO in/out priveleges. Pool very small relative to number of rooms, but was hardly used by guests during my stay. Pool never had more that 4-5 kids in it at anytime. Never found any beggars, or panhandlers around the hotel, but would avoid Union Station unless your walking thru it. Hotel is within 5 minute walk to West End District, Dealy Plaza, Sixth Floor Musuem, as well as Union Station DART light rail stop. Hotel atrium is very pleasing to view and spend the afternoon just people watching. Prices for breakfast / lunch buffet run $15/pp. Explore other eating venues via 2 min. light rail ride to West End district. Check-out was a breeze. Slight wait for valet parking because of enormous amount of guests checking out of hotel on Aug. 16, but handled well. Rate was $113 + tax /nt., but I'm sure that priceline / hotwire deals are out there. Lots of praises for this hotel in spite of prior reviews. I really felt and was treated like some VIP. TIPS: -Hotel connected to light rail station via tunnel. Costs $2.50 for all day pass, incl. bus routes -If possible, consider parking vehicle in $10 lot, and use light rail to get around downtown and nearby attractions. -Use a map to get familiar with streets around hotel as downtown one-way streets can be confusing. -Drive defensively in downtown expressways. -Very helpful concierge, utilize to eliminate uncertainties about attractions, shopping/dining options.", "Date": "August 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cTeacher Conference Unorganized\u201d", "Author": "TDShaw30", "ReviewID": "UR8272703", "Content": "Nearly 4,000 teachers - half sitting on the lobby floor!

The next night I was at their Dome lounge for cocktails, which was one floor up from the resturaunt. Same smell. Good service on both nights, though.

The underground tunnel attaching the hotel to the tour (and train stations) is stuck in the 70's and has many panhandlers asking for money for \"a burger.\" The last issue that I will raise is the extremely poor quality of the internet service.

The beds are magnificent. It is hard to get out of the bed it is so comfy. You can buy their signature bedding from Hyatt and we are strongly considering it they are that fabulous.

Parking is $18, vallet only. The is another parking lot not far away but it is no in and out and cost $10... Another negative was that the room are not very soundproofed. I woke up in the morning to the noise of a bed squeaking and moans (Seriously it was right out of a movie). Also it is right next to the metro so you hear trains. Nothing too bad we had a great view of the city (17th floor) which was great, overall I am extremely happy with my stay and the few negatives are greatly outweigh by the positives.

Unfortunately, this hotel did not meet my expectations. Fortunately, I got a great deal ($89) on Priceline, so I didn't get ripped off, otherwise I would have demanded a refund and stayed elsewhere. When I first arrived at the hotel in my cab, the staff completely ignored me. They were moderately busy, but I still saw a couple of bell guys or valet guys standing around, so they could have came over and assisted. I ended up carrying my own bags over to one of the bell carts, and wheeling it into the hotel myself! Bad way to start off the stay. I used the self check-in, which was a mistake, because you can't ask for a different room if you don't like the one it assigns you. So, when I got in my room, which was on the 3rd floor, I called down to the front desk, asking for a higher floor. They asked me to come back down, so I had to cart all my luggage back down (thank goodness I still had the cart), and then when I got to the desk, it was so big, I didn't get the person I talked to on the phone, so then they had to go find the person I talked to and ask them. They moved me to the 22nd floor in the Atrium Tower, where the view was MUCH nicer. And, finally, this time around, the bell person saw me pushing the cart myself, and offered to take my luggage up to my room. The re-assigned room they gave me had a beautiful view of downtown Dallas. The room appeared to be clean on the surface, but further inspection found that there were a lot of rough edges. For example, the heating/AC vents were caked in about 10 years worth of dust, which is really bad if you are an allergy sufferer. The furniture and decor in the room were of a southwest nature, I felt like I was in Albuquerque, NM! Unfortunately, everything in the room is dated, and obviously needs to be remodeled, especially the wallpaper, and the fabulous popcorn ceiling! The bathroom was adequate size, and appeared to be recently updated with granite counter, new tile in the shower, etc. I liked the double doors with the frosted glass windows on them to enter the bathroom, about the only nice touch in the decor that I appreciated. Unfortunately, the next morning when I took a shower, there was ZERO water pressure in the shower. It had a messaging shower head, but there wasn't enough pressure. So, I called down to the front desk, asked them to have maintenance come and remove the pressure regulator valve, and when I came back that evening, they had done so. The water pressure was then too high, but it was MUCH better then having no water pressure in the shower. Amenities in the room? Standard hotel fare, ironing board, coffee maker, hair dryer, soaps & shampoos, etc. NO MINI BAR or fridge in the room, so I had to use the bathroom sink as my ice chest to keep my sodas and beers cold. The ice holder they give you does not come with a plastic bag, and mine was dirty, so I had to clean it out before putting ice in it! The towels feel like sandpaper, so bring your own if you don't like that effect after taking a nice relaxing shower or bath. The internet access costs $5.55 a day with tax, and it's wireless, but it totally sucks. I got faster speeds using the wireless card through my cell phone company while in the room. The bed was fairly comfortable. It appeared to be a pillowtop mattress. There were plenty of fluffy pillows on the bed, and the comforter may have been a down comforter. Thank goodness they at least have the sleep part of the room down, after all, that's why we need a hotel room! The TV was an absolute joke. Standard 27 inch black hotel TV with keyboard & remote, internet access, PPV movies, etc... Highly overpriced, so I didn't order anything. I guess they didn't want to block the view, so they put the TV on the LEFT wall, and it's facing...The desk, not the bed. So if you want to watch TV in bed, you really won't be able to! The fitness center was alright... Had a very dated and worn look to it, but they had replaced some of the equipment with newer LifeFitness elliptical machines and treadmills, some of which even had your own personal tv built into the machine. There didn't appear to be much in the way of free weights, but that's pretty standard for most hotels to not have a REAL fitness center. Water was NOT complimentry, they had a vending machine so you had to pay for drinking water. I did not use any of the restaurants, but I did go to the revolving 50 story lounge, which is the main attraction of this hotel, so you would think they would want to make a good impression right? Wrong! It's an absolute dump!!! The decor is completely dated, the lights are too bright, so at night, instead of seeing the georgeous view of the entire city, all you see is a reflection of yourself sipping a cocktail! The windows are even scratched and dirty. The music sucks too, they were playing the same song over and over and over, i counted 8 times, and I finally asked them to change the music, so then they put on another CD and it kept skipping, so they shut the whole thing off. Oh, and it closes at 10:30! What kind of bar closes that early!?! So can you get a good drink at this bar? No! They charge $8 bucks for a martini, but it's mostly sugar, and very little alcohol. The nail in the coffin for my rating on this hotel was the pool. You would expect a hotel this size (2 towers, and 30+ stories) would have a large pool, and a really nice relaxing cabana area for you to enjoy your vacation! Not this place. The pool and sundeck are an absolute dump. The size of the pool is about the same as the large hot tub they had when I stayed at Raddison in Phoenix... I kid you not, I think you could fit about 5 people in there. Everything is so worn and dated, and it's not inviting at all, so I spent zero time there, and was highly disapointed. Parking is $18 dollars a day for valet, and you can call down for your car during \"non peak\" hours, it usually takes about 5-10 minutes, so that was convenient, and it included in and out priveledges. Be aware, the hotel must have bought off the city of Dallas, because there is plenty of on street parking, but it is ENTIRELY LABELED AS NO PARKING - TOW AWAY ZONE, so you can't park on the street unless you want to get towed. There is a self park lot for $10 bucks a day, but it does not include in and out priveledges, and you have to hike up a little hill to get back to the hotel. There is a train station adjacent to the hotel property with a tunnel that takes you there. The tunnel is kind of cool, it has a lot of history about Dallas with interactive talking displays. The train can get you to the hot spots downtown such as the west end, it's just the next stop right next to the hotel, and also to the airport if you take the commuter train, so you might not even need a car. Do not try to walk anywhere from this hotel, the neighborhood is very shady, and you have to walk through a tunnel to get to downtown, which might be kinda dangerous at night. Overall, I would never stay at this hotel again. The Hyatt needs to revoke their franchise on this place, and this place needs to be bulldozed and rebuilt... Or, I guess they might be able to save this beautiful landmark if they just remodeled the entire thing. It's far from being a 4 star hotel as priceline rates it!", "Date": "April 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "waco , texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay for the Money!\u201d", "Author": "TeamBell", "ReviewID": "UR4569841", "Content": "Okay-- the Hyatt is huge and very Hyatt-ish, but that can be good.

Every room in the hotel opens onto the atrium. This could be a lovely design feature, but turns out to be a nuisance because the hotel hasn't bothered to install seals around the room doors. As a result, the noise from the lobby bar, reverberating through the atrium, is quite audible inside the room. To add insult to injury, the hotel backs onto a busy train station, so if you're unfortunately enough to be situated on that side of the hotel, you'll also hear train whistles.", "Date": "February 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cHustle at the Hyatt\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4467016", "Content": "I promised my wife and self that I would sit down and do this hotel review. My wife was attending a seminar and I was planning to take care of some business in Dallas. My wife was excited that we could couple up and maybe get to share some one on one time for a change. Internet costs $40.00 per 72 hours. Parking is not in and out after 2 hours 10.00 charge this got old early. Overcharded for 2 cab rides same night. This part of DT dallas is not the cleanest or safest to travel by foot. Hotel beds and Pillows = Comfortable, Room temp could not get below 74 degrees. Hot as hell in the day. Lounge = $10 drinks watered down, Food= terrible. $18 for club sandwich and tea, bread over-toasted (fell apart in hand)Wife ordered soup - $18 as well and tasted bland., Felt like a prisoner. No fresh air in hotel. Checked out after the first full day second night. Toilet paper .12per foot(kidding), charges everywhere and for everything, tip this one, that one. Dang, I can carry my own luggage, walk to my own car, park my car, wipe my own butt, burn my own toast and screw up my own drinks thank you. Advised of checkout intent and left hotel at 9am. Charged me $75 additional for early checkout (guess I should have waited till noon). Total cost for 2 nights $443.00 w/ taxes and parking excluding $40 internet charge. Tips, taxi, room for 2 nights and 36 hours in hotel ran over $600. Moved to Hotel in Las Colinas (Irvin)- 3 Nights w/ tax $184 total, free internet. Took 15 minutes to drive to Hyatt Downtown leaving at 7:15am and 18 minutes in the afternoon to pick up wife at Hyatt. Had a blast in Las Colinas, saw Bill Parcells in small italian resturant off of Oconnor street, very professional area, very clean area, safe Hotel stay, free parking, downtown easy access, drinks are considerably cheaper ($2.50- $4.00) than downtown area which were all 10.00 each. The \"O Bar\" on Main Street is very cool. Nice looking, fun, young crowd (21-49). Drinks are 10 bucks each w/ no cover. Expensive but well worth the trip. No Hyatt No Way! Over rated.

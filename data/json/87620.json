Checking in was quick and efficient, the receptionist was warm and friendly. She gave me free breakfast coupons as soon as she found my information in the system. Although it is a little bit pricey, the quality and location of the hotel is worth the money. The location for this hotel is just perfect. The Navy Pier is just straight down the street, shoppes and restaurants are within minutes of walking out of the hotel. The only complaint that I had was that the pool was closed for an indefinite time. They suggested the option to go across the street to the Marriott for swimming but it is very inconvenient. Imagine walking out of the pool, out of the hotel and crossing the street in your swimming suit in downtown Chicago. Other than that, the room was very clean, spacious and had a very good view of the Magnificent Mile.

They take an old building keep the high ceilings and the wide halls and then take this shell and put in modern everything. So many hotels take the old infrastructure and put in window heating and cooling units that are noisy, cheap doors so you hear people in the hall, small bathrooms and crowded sinks. The Intercon in Chicago does a very nice job blending the two. I was upgraded to a suite but it was too much an entire second room bigger than the bedroom. But the bedroom is great. Wifi is free with membership in their rewards. The concierge was great with suggestions and reservations. Across the street is the Purple Pig. It is an upscale meditteranean restaurant with an emphasis on pork. It is served in ways that make your mouth water. They take no reservations and I have walked away in the past because the wait was 1-2 hours. The concierge got me and my customer in with a 5 minute wait. He showed us on the map every where to go in the area. So now for the restaurant at the hotel. Michael Jordans is the steak restaurant there are several in the country. The prices and menu in the bar were just too over the top. Two hamburgers and 2 ok wines came to $70 with a 20% tip that the bar put on the bill whether you liked it or not.

We were exhausted and hoping without optimism that there would be a room available. The man at the front desk was incredibly helpful. Even though a single room was not available he let us take a double and then switch to a single when it was ready. It made a huge difference to our first day to be able to grab a few hours sleep. The rooms were beautiful. Honestly I wish I would have kept the double room because it was much more spacious and had more furniture - not just the extra bed. The furnishings were better than expected - even with a four star hotel. We slept very comfortably. I found everything to be clean and the lobby was impressive. You can take a self-guided tour of the historic building - they will give you instructions. I thought that was a nice addition. The location can't be beat. We walked almost everywhere we needed to go - the Art museum, to the theater, to the famous hot dog restaurant. It was so convenient to be able to walk out the door and have endless options for eating, drinking, and shopping. It was wonderful having a Starbucks right in the lobby. I always woke up before my husband and enjoyed going downstairs for a cup of coffee and to read the paper. We went to ENO and felt they were arrogant and borderline rude. We thought it would be fun to try this ultra-trendy wine and chocolate restaurant but we were really disappointed. We asked for advice on the best menu items to sample but the attitude of our server was almost comically snobbish. We ended up spending an insane amount of money for two glasses of wine, a few bites of cheese and a piece of chocolate - all while receiving bad service. That was one of the most disappointing parts of our entire trip to Chicago. I recommend this hotel because all of the staff were friendly and helpful because the rooms were nice and comfortable, and because the location was great.

The overall service is ok but the staff would not go out of their way to make you feel special. The wait for check in was about 20min. What I didnt like was the fact that everything costs extra. The value for price ration wasnt too good. Internet access costs, the bottle of water in the room isnt complemetary either and there is not even a small selection of free TV on demand. The feel in the room is a bit strange and my room had connecting doors to both neighbouring rooms. The bathtub is old and the bathroom not really appealing. The furniture in the room is chipped and worn out quite a bit. There are no slippers in the room and amenities are limited. There is no safe-deposit box. I expect that from a wannabe 5-star property. Meeting facilities have their charm but everything is arranged like a maze due to the age of the building. I liked the Starbucks that is integrated into the lobby and the bar on the other side of the lobby has a great selection of beer on tap.

This is a high rent district, but this is still about $10.00 higher than average d) our shower was 100% stopped up when we got there.

It is obviously a big selling point as it is pictured on their website and most of their literature, including the free postcards in the room. It looks to be at least 10' deep and huge. Unfortunately it was closed and had no water in it. This wasn't mentioned until being told by the bellhop in our room. He had no idea when it is to be reopened. The kids were ready to leave.

It is a nice property, and if stars were awarded solely for location, the Intercontinental would be tops. It was amazing to pull to the side of Michigan Ave. and hand the valet our key. The staff on the street were very motivated and friendly, and helped us into the lobby very courteously. But precisely at this point, the experience stopped being amazing. The lobby is fairly mediocre with nice touches, but it is very small and there is no traffic pattern. At busy times, people checking in will get mixed into people waiting for concierge services. The front desk staff were nice, but not incredibly efficient or overly concerned with providing superior service. They were competent at best. The set-up of the concierge desk is very impersonal and the staff look and act simply like more front desk staff. The staff seemed to portray the same aloof, forced-interest in the customer that I had experienced at the front desk. The room was even less impressive. It was at the end of a long and serpentine hallway, and the room directly across from it was both unmarked and had a door that look like it had been scratched open by wolves. I am not kidding. The door across the hall so damaged that it looked like it was in a neglected apartment building. Once in the room, it was small but reasonably appointed with two full size beds (I hadn't slept in a full size bed since high school) and a very small bathroom. Upon further inspection, the room had dust on the fixtures and wall hangings, stained duvets in the covers, and crumbs in the carpet near the walls. In the bathroom, the faucet fixture was missing the fake white pearl on the cold faucet leaving an exposed screw. The bathroom also featured two panels that looked like fuse boxes that were disturbingly loose against the wall. All night long, there was something that sounded like a very loud shower that ran whenever the heat was on. I heard this sound whenever I was in the hallway on our floor. At times I also smelled a bad odor in our room throughout the night. Finally, in terms of amenities, I can not figure out the 4.5 star rating in this hotel. I went out to get some ice and looked on my floor, plus the next two floors up from my floor. I then picked up the floor courtesy phone and asked where I could find some ice. I was told that the seventh floor was \"the ice floor\". Are you kidding? I did find two ice machines on the seventh floor. Again, they were very competent. Everything is an up-charge, from $57 dollar/night parking (which is comparable but still MORE than most Chicago properties) to internet, in room services and more.

Upon check-in there was VERY little seating anywhere in the lobby. Also this presented a problem at check-out, as we had to check our luggage when we had to leave our rooms upon check-out the last day. We had about 2 hrs to fill, no seating, no hospitality room for a group of about 15 and no where to wait. I will also add that we had to wait about 1/2 hr to retrieve our luggage from the bellman, therefore our bus had to wait 1/2 hour for us, too! There were some disappointed kids with us, as they had to walk down the street to the Marriott hotel to swim....the pool was inoperable or under repair. Mind you, it was 15 degrees out! As for our room, it was very noisy, I finally figured out we had a room behind the elevator and we were hearing the gears, as it went up and down. The maintenance men were working on the elevators for our entire 3 night stay. I did hear several guests talking about how hard it was to keep the most comfortable temperature in their rooms. This was true for us, as we sometimes had to turn the heat off at night due to the noise of the fan. I finally laid a towel down in front of the door to keep the draft from the hallway from coming in to our room. The Continental Dining Room serves a very nice breakfast.....If you don't mind spending $28.00 for a bowl of oatmeal. My husband objected and they did bring his bill down to $14.00. There were 3 of us who ate the breakfast buffet, the bill totaled $84.00. Our last morning we ate at Starbucks right in the hotel, for less than $10.00....very reasonable! On the plus side of all this, we were near good shopping, cabs were easy to get, the Chicago restaurants are wonderful. Michael Jackson's Restaurant is right inside this hotel, which is a fun place to go! If you go, try to get to Giordanos Pizza....delicious!

We were assured something would happen. An hour later we called again - the same person made the same assurances. We decided to go out and get a light, late dinner. When we came back it was much quieter, so we assumed something had been done. We settled in for bed. At 12:30, the yapping started again - this time, mixed in with howling. That prompted our third call. A different manager was on duty and made more assurances. Fifteen minutes later he called us back and offered us a different room. The dog had been quiet during that time, so we said we'd decide and let him know. A minute later we finally hear the phone ringing in the next room (yes, this place has uncomfortably thin walls) for the first time. Why wouldn't the people causing the problem get moved first?

The hotel seemed very nice but I think we had some bad luck. We arrived before our room was available, which I have no problem with. We sat in the bar and had a drink. But as we sat there, I figured hey, we're on a mini vacation, I'm gonna see if I can upgrade our room. I spoke to one of the managers at the front desk and he upgraded us for free because we had to wait. We were put into a room on the 25th floor. So far so good. The room was not at all what we were expecting. It was extremely small. The main room had a king sized bed, which is what we wanted. But the room was only big enough for the bed, a small desk immediately next to the bed, a closet and a dresser. Without question the smallest room I've ever seen at a hotel. The bathroom was pretty good size though. Oh, I forgot to mention the digital thermometer in the room told us the room was 91 degrees, and it felt like it. It was roasting in there. I lowered the thermostat as far as it would go and I opened a window a few inches (it was very cold outside). We dressed quickly and left the room for a night on the town. When we returned, the digital thermometer read 85 degrees. Still very hot and made for a very uncomfortable night of sleep. I worked in hotels while in college, so I hate to bother the staff with my problems. But after a very sweaty night, I called maintenance in the morning. They arrived a short time later and stated the problem was fixed. A couple hours later, it was still in the mid 80s and the vent was simply blowing air, not cold air. I went to the front desk and they immediately gave us another room. The 2nd room was very nice. A large main room with a king sized bed and a very nice view on the 32nd floor. If we had this room originally, I would probably give this hotel 4 or 5 stars. Although we did not have a great experience, I do believe this hotel is very nice. The staff was great and handled our problems very professionally. The hotel is in a very good location. I just wonder what upgrade we got when we first arrived. The first room we had was so small, I can only guess the upgrade was a higher floor.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cClassy, beatiful, old world, medieval styled Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "ZzZzzzzzzzzzzzjjhh", "ReviewID": "UR121677377", "Content": "Stayed 1 night at the Intercontinental Chicago on 12/9---One of Chicago's many older grand, gorgeous Hotels, right on Michigan Ave. Close walking distance to Navy Pier, Water Tower shopping, Millenium Park--The Bean and ice skating, Trump Tower, John Hancock Center, and the Palmer House Hilton Hotel and much more!

This our first stay at this hotel. We were offered to join the frequent traveler/rewards program for free. By doing so, our room was complimentary upgraded during our stay. So if you are not a member of their rewards program, now is the perfect time to join. 2. The car parking is very expensive. I parked for 6 hours and it was $32. Don't drive/park unless you must. 3. Awesome location on Michigan Ave! There is a Starbucks in the lobby, Michael Jordan's Steak House in the hotel, and shopping across the street. This hotel is a the start of most of the Maginificant Mile shopping so once you go out the door, you can walk and walk to all the stores. 4. The gym was nice but there is a charge to use it.

We requested a room in the historic tower, after reading several Tripadvisor reviews, saying the rooms/bathrooms in the tower were more spacious. Our room was on the 20th floor and was spacious, but was in desperate need of a facelift. What really turned me off was the $7 bottle of Evian, with plastic cups to drink it in. And if you wanted to blow dry your hair, you had to use the old dryer attached to the wall that you had to hold the button down to keep the air coming out. We could've been at a Holiday Inn Express and paid much less. Our room overlooked Michigan Ave. and it was very noisy with traffic and sirens. The computer in the room was annoying-it glows all night long. But it was convenient to use for ordering room service and check out. The service at this hotel is very good. We ordered room service at 1am and had breakfast delivered one morning-very quick in arriving. There's also a Starbucks in the hotel that was very convenient.

Mt room, 2216 was spacious and comfortable. My overall experience was good, and I would both recommend and stay again at this property. As usual, The Good, The OK, and The Bad The Good - Check-in. Fast and friendly. Seriously, I think I was checked-in and on my way to the room within 3 minutes. The check-in employee (Jason I believe) was super nice, welcomed me back and had me on my way in quick time. Well done. - The room. Clean with nice large bed, soft/fresh towels and a warm shower. A comfortable room to spend 6 nights in. The bed, a king-size was comfortable with a selection of pillows (6 or 7) with different materials and such. Well done IC. The room included a large working desk, a comfortable sitting chair and a window looking to the north towards the Hancock Tower. The room had a \"homey\" feel with a comfortable feel. - The bathroom. Clean and solid. The amenities are not spanking new - but they were nice, worked well. Across from the bathroom - the hall closet. It was large and had 10ish hangers. The closet needed to be a bit large because there was not a large dresser of drawers - but all worked out well. - The room quietness. I did not hear a peep from anyone (neighbors) throughout my stay. A nice positive for me. - Cleaning service. My room was nicely freshened each day and the staff paid attention to details (new lotion bottle, hand towels, etc.) Well done and appreciated. - The \"one touch\" hotline. I called one morning because my large floor-standing lamp was not functioning. Not a large issue, but I wanted to use. I called the hotline and the lamp was up and working that evening. Thank you. - Fitness center. Not huge, but worked well with new/well maintained equipment. While there was 15ish pieces of cardio equipment (treadmills, ellipticals, bikes) - on a couple of mornings they were all full prior to 06:00. Each piece of equipment had a TV and the locker rooms were quite expansive and well maintained. Note that to enter the fitness room prior to 06:00 you need to go to the front desk so they can update your room key card. The front desk visit was quick and painless - and again friendly. - Laundry services. As promised - on-time, folded well. - Michael Jordan restaurant bar. We did not eat, but enjoyed some beverages in the bar. The staff were quick, friendly and knew how to pour a drink. The atmosphere was busy and quite fun. - Location. You're in the heart of the action, especially if you're shopping or enjoying the North Michigan avenue area. You will be about 3 minutes from the Chicago river, 2 minutes from the Nordstrom mall (across the street) and about a 15ish minute walk to the Water Tower Mall/Hancock Tower. You cannot get more central to this area of the city. - Check-out. Electronic over the television. Quick and painless. - Doormen. Always friendly. Helped me with some tips across the stay. They were the first and final employees and interacted with - and they did a fine job. The OK - One morning I needed my laundry picked up (around 06:00 on a Friday morning), so I called the \"hot line\". A couple issues with this. First, I waited on hold for 15+ minutes. Not good. The second is that the advertisements that run while on hold discuss the \"beautiful pool facilities...\" They're closed. The pool option is across the street. I didn't want to swim so the pool being renovated did not bother me. But - if you're on hold for a while and want to swim, the message may irritate some. It's a detail. The Bad - Nothing. And nothing close during my stay. I recommend this property whole-heartedly. From the service, my quiet - nicely appointed room, and the employee interaction which was always friendly and returned value. Well done IC. Enjoy Chicago.

One of those was right - the location on Michigan Avenue was very convenient to everything I needed. However, from the moment I checked in, the experience was pretty much a disappointment. I am a member of their Ambassador program so I went to the special check in area for Ambassadors. The woman seated there seemed a bit distracted when I showed up so I just waited for her to look up and acknowledge me. She said she was checking me into the \"historic tower\" - when I hear that, I ask does that mean it is older rooms and not renovated (hey, I've been traveling long enough to know what these things mean...). She said the rooms were larger in the historic tower and that's where I would be upgrade as an Ambassador. I went to my room, keys in hand, and when i stepped off the elevator on my floor, I could tell I was not going to like the room. Older hallways, fixtures, dimness of lighting etc. It wasn't a good sign. I went to my room and noticed the do not disturb sign was on the door. I thought it was odd, but I used my key, opened the door, and... The room was still occupied by someone! Their luggage was there any everything! I couldn't believe it. Major security blunder. I went back downstairs, went to same check in and she acted all surprised but found me another room. Went to that room and it was definitely a smaller room than my first room. Too tired and hot to go back down again, I just took the room since it was only for the weekend. Immediately I noticed here were no drawers to out my clothes in. There was a small closet with louvered doors that didn't really close right. It did have a safe in the closet for my valuables. The room was dark even with the fluorescent lights on. I had to turn every light on in the room plus the closet light to feel like here was even any light on. The bathroom was kind of dirty - mildew on tiles, a rusty shower head, scratchy towels (one had brown stains on it as a \"clean towel\"). Toiletries were nice though. On day of checkout, I was in the bathroom when all of a sudden, a hotel staff member entered my room and asked when i was checking out!!! I didn't hear his knock since I was in the bathroom. Mind you, I had the do not disturb sign (the electronic kind, not the hangtag on the door) ON. To me it was a last straw. I called downstairs and asked that the on duty manager call me. The only positive thing out of this hotel stay was that the manager did call back, I explained calmly to her what had happened with my first check in and now the maid coming into my do not disturb room. She apologized and promised she would both take care of these issues and give me some extra points. She did both. However, in some ways, the visit did a lot to diminish the InterContinental brand in my mind. I have stayed at nicer properties such as their new one on Howard in San Francisco and it was great, this \"historic tower\" at a grande dame of Michigan Avenue was bad... Just bad.

You could not beat the location, being right next door to the Tribune building and opposite Nordstroms on the Magnificant mile. From here, we could walk to the shops, downtown, millenium park, navy pier, restaurants, beachses and just aabout everything. We stayed in teh historic tower, as whilst we could have got a better view in the new tower, we were advised that the rooms were much bigger in the historic tower and they were. We had 2 doubles and a rollaway bed and still had plenty of space to open out suitcases and walk around...the room was huge. We didn't try any of the dining options, as the Michael Jordan steakhouse was still under cosntruction and whilst I liked the look of Eno, it probably wasn't the place to take young teenage daughters, as it is the more adult, winebar type place, that appealed to me and the win list looked great. We hate Starbucks coffee(as most Aussies do), so we disn't use the starbucks eaither, but found a great cafe (Baci) atound the corner in east Ohio st that made Lavazza Espresso, which is where we had outr breakfasts.

We also ate out at other concoierge recommendations, such a sa great d=restauarant next door and portllos and Unos, both Chicago institusions, and only a couple of blocks away. Parking was very pricey and we used a salf park station behind the hotel for overnight parking at $25 rather than the $55 the Hotel charges, but teh hotel allowed multiple re-entry valet parking. As we only had a car for 1 night, this was fine. Close to public transport, with busses both north (to the zoo, Lincoln Park, beaches) and south (downtown, the museum campus, Hyde Park (miuseum of science & industry/University/Obama's house) outside the front door.

My room lacked a TV remote (to the hotel's credit, a remote was provided within 2 minutes of requesting one). The pool, while quaint, was showing heavy signs of wear and there was a cockroach walking amid the plants. The pool attendant had run out of pool towels and was giving out hand towels.

Overall, the hotel is very nice and the location is great. There are bus stops out front and just down the street from the Grand subway station. We were with a group (9 couples) that came to Chicago to see Red Sox/White Sox games. Unfortunately, our rooms were scattered all over the hotel (both towers) and it was very difficult to meet. It would have been nearly impossible if not for cell phones. I must say that my first impression was not the greatest. I was already apprehensive due to some of the not so great reviews on Tripadvisor. We had already been told that this InterContinental was not quite up to level of other InterContinentals in other places. The lobby is very small for the size hotel. Half the lobby is blocked off from the contruction of the Michael Jordan restaurant. Check in was uneventful until we went up to our room. We were given a room on floor 6 in the \"new\" building. When we got off the elevator, our room was literally right there next to the elevators. No way! I did not want to hear people and/or elevator noises while in my room. We didn't even go in the room. I went right back down to the woman who checked us in and told her that we must have another room. She was very nice about it and started looking for a better room. I also told her that it was our wedding anniversary and we wanted the best room she could give us. She changed us to a corner room on the 27th floor of the \"historic\" building and said it was an upgrade due to our anniversary. I know it is a must asked question but why did she give us a \"bad\" room in the first place if a \"better\" was obviously available? The new room was VERY quiet and we never heard a thing. Our new room was down a hallway in the corner. Actually, there were large windows on 3 sides because the room jutted out just enough for a good size window. Our first impression was the room was clean & not outdated. It was quiet and comfortable. There was a desk & chair, king size bed, sitting chair & ottoman, 1 bed side chest and some sort of armoire. The armoire had the TV on top and inside was the refrigerator, coffee maker and a tray of items to purchase, such as candy & nuts (intimicy kit??). There was a tab on the refrigerator that said \"pull tab\" and we didn't dare open it because we were afraid it was one of those minibars that have sensors and you pay if you move anything. It was an inconvenience not having a usable refrigerator, but we dealt with it. Personally, I think ALL hotel rooms should come with at least a cube refrigerator at NO EXTRA CHARGE. But that is just my opinion. There was no bureau or chest in the room for our clothes. The armoire thing was not for clothing. We hung up as much as we could and then lived out of our suitcases. There was a computer screen on the desk that supposedly would let you access information about the hotel & area. We could not get it to work properly. It would go to the screensaver itself but it suddenly went on in the middle of our first night and was so bright it woke us both up. It again went off and did not work the rest of our stay. The windows and roll down blinds plus curtains and kept the room dark when closed. The closet was medium sized and okay for us. It had 2 doors that opened out and was a pain to keep open because only 1 door would stay open and the other one would SNAP closed when you let go of it. There were 2 robes in the closet. The bathroom was HUGE. You could fit a twin size bed in there and there still would be plenty of room. There was a stand up, glass shower, pedestal sink, toilet and soaking tub. There was another big window but that was okay because it just looked out over a roof and no one could possibly see in. There was a nice long shelf above the sink & toilet which was nice. There was plenty of room to put your \"stuff\" on it. But, there was only one small towel rack in the whole room and it was too small for a bath size towel. The shower head was very nice and the water was hot enough. I did not try the bath tub but it looked okay. The sink drain did not work well and you had to pull it up manually to drain the sink. That was a pain but oh well..... The toiletries were very nice- citrus mint. There lots of towels so you did not have to worry about using them up. The room was VERY clean and the bed was comfortable. There were 5 king size pillows on the bed plus a decorative one. I usually do not like down pillows but these were fine. We both kept on banging our legs on the corner of the platform the bed was on. It was vinyl covered wood with a sharp corner and it stuck out. We both have bruises on our legs from that corner. We finally leaned the decorative pillow up against so it would force us to stay clear of that corner. We were up and out early on our first day- before 8AM- and did not return to our room again until 4PM. It had not been made up yet. We were exhausted and wanted to rest before the nightime baseball game but knew we had to leave the room. In fact, shortly after we had come back, a housekeeping employee called us on the phone and told us our room would not be made up because we were in it! No way! I said give us 5 minutes and we would be out. SInce the lobby is not suitable to sitting and there is no other place in the hotel to do that, we ended up in the attached Starbucks for 30 minutes or so. Annoying. Luckly this did not happen again during our stay. There is some sort of restaurant/lounge on the second floor overlooking the lobby but we never ate there. It was not very inviting and they don't advertise it well. There is an attached Starbucks that is always very busy. The new Michael Jordan restaurant is scheduled to open August 2011 according to the sing. We had a wonderful time during our first visit to Chicago. Along with the Red Sox game, we went on the Chicago Architectural Foundation river cruise and we also visited the Museum of Science & Industry. We highly recommend both. Make sure you do the 90 minute CAF cruise. We visited Navy Pier, Millennium Park, Grant Park and generally just walked everywhere. We bought bus & train passes and the bus/train system was not hard to figure out. To celebrate our anniversary, we ate dinner on Saturday night at Il Mulino. We have eaten at the Las Vegas restaurant and like it so we gave the Chicago sight a try. Wonderful! It is in this beautiful mansion and we were treated so special! We took a cab to and from the restaurant and it was not expensive. About $6 each way. Overall, we had a nice stay at the InterContinental and a nice visit to Chicago. It is a wonderful city with so much to do. We could sense that the people we met in Chicago had a great sense of pride in their city. There were flower boxes & planters everywhere we went. It is a pretty city. It was easy using public transportation to get around the city. We found the people to be VERY friendly and helpful. Whenever we looked hesitant on a bus or train, someone always asked us if they could help us. Nice! We live near Boston and take the MBTA all the time and the T employees sure could use some advice on excellent customer service from their Chicago counterparts. We were absolutely stunned by the difference. Not to say Boston's MBTA is bad, as it is not. It's just that the transit employees in Chicago seemed to actually care about their job & passengers and you could feel that vibe. We highly recommend using the public transportation as much as possible. In fact, when we come to Chicago again, we will take the train from the airport into the city instead of arranging for van transport because the traffic was awful to and from the airport. Much easier to take the train. We plan on returning to Chicago but will do it when it is a bit cooler out. We had 90 degree days and it sure was hot doing all that walking. Luckily, we missed the rain they had the week before. I think September or October would be better. There are still many things we would like to see & do in Chicago. I would have no issue staying at the Intercontinental Chicago again if the price was right and do recommend it. All the employees were friendly & helpful , our room was spotless and the convenient location is a plus. Those are the things that matter. Boston will always be my favorite city but Chicago sure did impress! Good job Chicago!!

I had some trepidation when I received this room through Hotwire because of some mixed reviews I had read. There was no need to worry--it was great! The temps were in the low 90s, but our airconditioner kept up just fine; we were actually a little too chilly in the room at times and had to adjust the thermostat. As everyone else seems to agree on, this was a great location. We easily walked to all kinds of shopping, the Navy Pier and Millenium Park. The room was very clean and HUGE. Honestly, we could have probably fit 4 pack-n-plays and a couple of strollers in that room. The view was blocked somewhat by columns, but they warned us about that prior to checking in and they gave us the option of a better view if we didn't want the early check in. We heard ambulance sirens several times, but I would expect that being smack dab in the middle of the city. Concierge was always helpful. There was no charge for the pool as some reviewers had indicated. I even asked about it and the attendant looked at me like I was a bit nuts. Maybe that was an old policy? The fitness center looked like it had a lot of machines too. The treadmills and such each had their own t.v. screen on them. The parking was $55 a night, which, with the discounted price for the hotel, did not bother me. Had I paid the online listed price, I would have been a little peeved about that. There was a fee for internet, but if you just go to the Starbucks attached to the lobby, you can get free Wi-fi. I would definetly recommend this hotel if I did not have to pay the full published rates and only when in Chicago in \"walkable\" weather. If you would have to pay to park everywhere you go, you might as stay out of the city and save some $. Oh, the only complaint would be the location of the toilet paper.

Be sure to wander around the lower floors of the old tower where the meeting rooms are to take in the neat architectural details and be sure to see the indoor pool at the fitness center. The new tower rooms are more spacious and as well decorated. The location is great right on Michigan Ave; a short walk North takes you past Water Tower (an indoor mall) and up to the Oak St beach. While a longer walk South takes you to the Art Institute and a few blocks over to the old Marshal Filed that is now a Macys. Be sure to look at the architecture in the old building especially the ceilings on the upper floors. Head West away from the lake for an area that has all sorts of restaurants.

I have stayed at other InterContinentals, and this one was at the bottom of the pile. The pros of this hotel were: it was fairly decent value for money.

Given it's central location to shopping and Michigan Avenue, I think that was a fair price. There also seemed to be a pretty good spread for the Thanksgiving buffet but it was (as most hotels like this) overpriced. The cons of this hotel were: it was a bit ragged and more run down, particularly in the older part of the building. Our bathroom was not terribly nice and seemed straight out of the 1980s. We also had trouble finding just a basic drink (think orange juice or ginger ale) as the lobby and bar was incredibly crowded on a fairly regular basis -- but that may also have been a function of the time of year. The fee to use the gym was also fairly hefty.

The price of the hotel, considering its location right in the middle of Chicago's Miracle Mile, was very acceptable. The parking is $54 a day, so you havve to consider that fact when considering the Intercontinental. One disturbing situation was the pricimg policy in the little store in the lobby selling snacks, tee shirts, newspapers etc. One bottle of Coke was $4.50, If I would buy two, the second was only $2.

But if I had to guess, the problem is that Intercontinental should be paying more because as their guests I am expecting more. The hotel is old and I recognize that there are limitations to what can be done in an older facility. I am 6-6 and my son is 6-7. We barely cleared the hallway ceilings and had to duck at the doorway to our rooms. The bathrooms were so small, that you barely had room to turn around. With many newer hotels in the immediate vicinity, I'm almost surprised that Intercontinental allowed its name to be put on this hotel. On the plus side the location is among the best in Chicago. It is smack in the middle of everything on Michigan Avenue where, e.g., much of the action of the current Transformer movie takes place. It is easy walking distance from Navy Pier, Millenium and Grant Parks, the Art Institute, and North Michigan Ave. shopping. The furnishings in the room were a little dated but quite comfortable.

We got to the hotel and asked about upgrading. We were told we could upgrade to a room for $50 a night that would be about 50% bigger and have a nicer view. I decided we would upgrade, and remembered to give them my Priority Club number. With this the man at the front desk informed my the upgrade would be no cost to me. Already we were impressed and excited about the free upgrade. We went to the elevator and headed up to our floor. When we got out of the elevator our room was literally arms length away from the elevator door. This wasn't a huge deal though because it is always nice to not have to walk as much when you spend all day waking in the city, but we were worried that it would be noisy. We walked in the room and right away our jaws dropped. This upgraded room was about the size of a jacket closet. You walk in the door, immediately to your left is the bathroom, straight ahead is the closet and to your right is the bed. It was literally like a train compartment. I know you are in the city, but still for an upgraded room this was tiny. Other then the size the room was nice and the bed was comfortable so we got over it. We had a nice view of the city, and being that it was my first time in Chicago that was appreciated. We didn't rent a car, which is good because they charge around $50 a day for parking, so consider that when you are deciding if you are going to rent a car or not. And, if you are taking the train from the airport it is close to a mile walk from the train station. So it is semi-inconvenient to get to unless you are taking a taxi. Maybe it just seemed bad because it was close to sub-zero temperatures when we were there. The location is nice, on Michigan Ave, close to a lot of shops and restaurants and things.

Sure, the location is good, but there are also MANY hotels in this price-range on the Magnificent Mile! ___________________________________________________ I got a free night from Priority Club and decided to stay there. We booked a 2 double-bed room in the Main Tower and got upgraded to a bigger 2 double-bed room in the Historic Tower when I called IHG since I'm a Platinum member. Then, we got a new updated confirmation email for the 2 double bed room in the Historic Tower. When we arrived there, a lady (who is also the manager) checked us in. I gave her my confirmation number and made sure that we're in the nicer Historic Tower per our new confirmation email. She said that the system put us in the smaller Main Tower, and that everything else is booked, so she gave us the keys to the smaller Main Tower. I told her that I have a new reservation for the bigger Historic Tower, but then she kept referring to my OLD reservation in the Main Tower. I tried to explain the situation to her, but then she kept referring to my old reservation. Since wifi costs $18 at the hotel, I had to walk to the nearest Starbucks to pull up an email with a new confirmation to show it to her. When I got back, the manager (who checked us in) wasn't there anymore, so I talked to one of the front desk staffs and showed her my new confirmation email which explicative states our confirmation number, the date we're arriving, and the type of room we're staying in (in the Historic Tower). The lady I talked to didn't seem to care about helping me at all, so she went back to get the manager. I waited for a VERY LONG time for her to come back and was given no explanation why it took so long, and when she did come back, she told me that my email isn't valid and kept referring to my old confirmation email. I told her it makes no sense at all because an UPDATED confirmation email should always rule out an OLD confirmation email. Then, she proceeded to tell me \"I don't know, I didn't check you in\" in an I-don't-care-about-you attitude. I was pretty mad at this time. I asked her to speak to the manager. Then, I had to wait again for about 10 mins. While waiting (I've had already waited about 20 mins by then), NOONE in the front desk even looked at me and asked if I've been helped or offered to give me any explanation why it took so long. By the time the manager finally showed up (she was on the phone, but noone told me that till she got here), she, ONCE AGAIN, referred to my old reservation and completely ignored the fact that I had a NEW reservation. I was furious at that point because a new reservation should ALWAYS rule over an old reservation. She said that there is probably a discrepancy in the system and gave me a that's-too-bad-because-the-room-you're-supposed-to-be-in-is-all-booked kind of answer. After going back and forth and me being extremely angry, she decided to update me to a 1 bedroom suite with 1 King Bed. Since I was traveling with my parents, I had to sleep on the pull out couch. The room wasn't ready, so they told me I could wait in my old room and that they'll call me when the new room is ready (FYI, they NEVER called me). Here are the things that they screwed up: 1.) They didn't acknowledge my presence. I felt like they didn't care about me at all. That's the most unfriendly customer service I've dealt with in a long time. The 2nd front-desk lady who talked to me said \"I don't know, I didn't check you in\" in a very I-don't-care-about-you attitude. Poor customer service is UNACCEPTABLE in a 4-star hotel. 2.) They made me wait a very long time without any explanation. A hotel shouldn't make you wait for half an hour without any explanation. A proper way to handle this would be \"The manager is on the phone right now, and the wait could be long.\" I stood there not knowing where those people went and felt like they just left me standing there because they didn't want to talk to me. 3.) People make mistakes, and that's totally fine as long as they try to make it right. In this case, there's a discrepancy in the system. The minute I show my new confirmation email is the minute you acknowledge that there is a discrepancy in the system, apologized, and tried to fix it. They didn't do that. They kept referring back to my old reservation as if I was a liar. 4.) This is minor, but after they screwed up this badly, you would think they would try to go the extra mile to make my stay amazing. They forgot to call me when my room was ready.

This is the part I enjoy the most when I stay here. The FC is two levels, with cardio equipment on one level and strength equip on the upper level. The pool is a lap pool, however, so if you have a bunch of kids that want to lounge around in the pool, there may be better choices.", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Good Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Droynick", "ReviewID": "UR105776588", "Content": "We stayed in the 'Historic Tower\" in a room facing the Magnificent Mile.

There was constantly a line at the front desk and even after several conversations with the staff, they still managed to double charge my credit card. Good thing I checked my credit card statement. This hotel is in a perfect area, there is no doubt about that. But it also has its downsides, they charge for everything under the sun. To use the fitness center for 24 hours, $12.00 per day. To use the internet in your room, $14.95 per day and it is incredibly incredibly slow. I felt like I was using a dial up modem. The On Demand Movie I ordered kept loosing signal and so I wasn't able to enjoy that without the reseting the guide every time and then resuming the movie. I am surprised this hotel doesn't charge to use the elevators. It was quite ridiculous. Maybe if they were a little bit more reasonably priced for their amenities, they would get more business.

I said do you mean outside of the building and he said there was no noise in my area of the hotel. Now, I'm a little upset, because he was telling me that I'm hearing things. Although, there were many apologies, I was still unsatisfied. I was told the previous day I could checkout by 2:00 p.m., but it's now shortly after 11:00 because I couldn't stand the noise anymore.

Some hotel chains adopt this \"continental / historic look to justify extortive rates: take the Ritz Carlton in Berlin. I have stayed in this hotel near Potsdamer Platz literally in the first week of its existence. I was struck by its futile attempt to look like a Ritz Carlton should look, say in Montreal. Don't get me wrong, I am weary of some true classics, read: pathetic maintenance failures in bad need of renovation. And then is the Intercontinental in Chicago. This hotel is the Real Thing of hotels. Everything feels genuine from the lobby up. The decor, though neutral is not sterile. A historic building in its own right abound in Moorish accents which feel authentic and real. A former athletic club, it boasts one of the largest and most beautiful hotel pools I have ever seen.

I travel to Chicago often on business and made my reservations through a discount hotel site, this seems to be where your experience will take its course. It appears if you book directly through the hotel your room will be located in the Historic Tower (Nice) and if you book through a discount hotel site your room will be located in the North Tower (Old). When checking in I was given a room in the North Tower with two double beds and was told if I wanted to upgrade at an additional cost I could have a room with a King bed like I requested. I find it very hard to believe a hotel of this size has sold out all its King bed rooms in the middle of the week. Since I was staying only 3 nights I declined the offer and headed to my room on the 23rd floor. The view over Michigan Avenue was beautiful but the room was below average. The room was so small you could not set up the luggage rack and walk around it. The drapes were frayed and were difficult to open or close. There were stains and cigarette burns on the carpets even though it was a non-smoking room. The bath was a disgrace and looked like a two year old caulked the shower. There was a small fridge in the room stuffed with drinks and a basket on top filled with snacks. The prices for these items were outrageous. Please note, there is a full service Dominick's Grocery store two blocks East of the hotel on Grand. Wireless internet service suitable for business is $17.95 for 24 hours, parking is $52.00 a night.

There is a bus right in front as well and the train is close by too. It's about a 15 minute walk to Navy Pier and the same to Millenium Park. Very easy to get around the bus as well (we bought a CTA 3 day unlimited bus pass for $14). As for service, it was wonderful! The staff couldn't be more nice, unpretentious, or helpful. Check in was smooth. The room we got was on the 18th floor and was very nice. We had two double beds, and a flat screen TV. There is a safe hidden away in the clothing drawers (didn't know til we left, I thought it would be in the closet). The room was very clean, spacious for just the two of us, and yes the drainage was a bit slow but not a big deal. They had the usual bath amenities, but also body wash! I was ecstatic, b/c I prefer body wash over soap. Yes, the little things make me happy. The pool is FANTASTIC. It is the most beautiful hotel pool I've seen. It's very long (maybe 75 ft?) and wide and at the deep end is 10 ft. I was able to squeeze in a swim for two mornings and on one day had the pool all to myself! I didn't really check out the gym but it looked pretty standard. All in all, great service, great location (with a Starbucks next door), and great clean rooms and pool.

The initial rooms had an old musky odor, not to mention leaking commodes and broken A/C's (both rooms!). One of the rooms had a wet floor where our 1 yr old son's crib was placed. The hotel couldn't change rooms for the first night b/c they were 'sold out', so they placed us in suites the 2nd night - or what they call suites. These rooms were arguably worse than the first. Again, A/c in one suite wasnt working, not to mention that one couple in each room had to suffice for sofa-beds (better off sleeping on the floor). The hotel states they would comp us the valet charges for both nights and gave us breakfast for 6 for one day (a fraction of what the cost of the stay was). In the end, they flat out lied, because they charged for both nights valet parking despite my placing a hold on my c/c. Needless to say, we'll dispute those charges. Additionally, they broke our new samsonite bag, for which we filled out forms, but they made no actions. I doubt the hotel will pursue this any further. The 2nd night they placed a fridge in our room for our child formula and milk, the next morning we open the fridge and its not working!!. We called about this and no one ever came to attend, and when we explained this to the manager, she simply looked dumbfounded and kept saying 'sorry' like an incompetent fool. I truly believe the ICH hotels which includes holiday inn, ITC, Crowne and other suboptimal hotels is the worst bunch of accommodations. I would not waste money on these places. ONe is better of paying double, even triple rate for a peaceful experience and one worthy of money hard earned. In major cities, one is more likely to get ripped off, especially because that is the modus operandi of the demographic that own and manage the business in metro areas. Be careful where you allocate your funds and fight for your right to get what you pay for. We usually stay are 'proper' establishments like the Four Season and Ritz Carlton; however, because of the size of our group we opted to more economical. For those who cant afford, places like 4 season and Ritz, here are suggestions of awesome hotels that are good deals : Hyatt, Swissotel, Omni, The James. These are FANTASTIC!!

Surprisingly when advised they had placed me at another property I was also told that I would be responsible for the cab fares there!! The front desk was staffed by mostly 'trainee' people. While one can understand their lack of knowledge of hotel procedures and systems due to inexperience, the disdain for customer service can not and should not be tolerated. I hope management are addressing this issue. The room I finally received was small and tired looking. The desks and tables were dusty. There was no fridge nor microwave and the furniture looked worn.

Check in is slow. In fact, after reading reviews here and then standing in line for 5 minutes with only 1 front desk person on my second day, I raised hell with a bellman who went back and summoned 3 additional staff to take care of guests. Why these staff members dont summon help when they notice a line forming, I dont know! I watched this happen 3 or 4 times.The hotel really needs to fix this. I waited about 10 minutes to check in after a cross country flight. Once I quoted the reviews on this site to staff I did get good service and zero attitude about being assertive. The front desk is quite slow at this property, and I do not think guests should put up with it.We originally booked a budget rooom for a longer stay, and the room was smaill but OK. The carpet seemed worn, and the desk chair surprisingly had a couple of small rips in the vinyl covering. The room was clean, bed was nice, lots of pillows, etc. Then I read a review here that said it was worth upgrading by joining the ambassadors club, which gives you some perks, costs $200.00, and gets you an upgrade to a suite. Thank you, to that reviewer! What a marked change! The service became exceptional, and the suite was small but a good value for the total cost, which was about $30.00 more per night if you include the fee to join Ambassador club. Staff answers your phone calls very quickly.That being said, the ventilation was noisy, and we all found ourselves waking at night perspiring. We didnt want to open the windows because the hotel had posted a sign on the window advising not to open the window due to \"abnormally high numbers of insects.\" We did see a spider spinning its web on the 20th story...after that my kids would not open the window. Was the noisy AC worse than other hotels? Maybe. This is an old property. The best part of this hotel is the location, and the pool, which is a gorgeous vintage 1930s indoor pool with all the victorian decor restored. It is really not set up for kids, though, being used as a lap pool by the management. There is even a sign posted that says \"lap swimming only.\" The fitness center is very good, and a vaue at $17.00 for use during your stay-if you are staying more than 1 night since it costs about the same on a per day basis. The food is very good, but expensive for room service and the bar. Room service is excellent, BTW. The Zest restaurant is reasonable ande very good. Housekeeping was very good. Leave a couple of moderate tips and your maid will Take Care of your room. No scrimping, ask for extra coffee, she leaves 2 or 3 packets.Overall, I would stay here again. This is not the Ritz, but it is the next step down, and less expensive. The hotel has some panache, but I dont recommend the budget rooms due to the difference in service. Oh, and they do gouge for Internet, at 17-18 bucks per day. This small thing, in retrospect, is irritating, and not exclusive to this hotel. Why charge so much more than a motel 6? It doesnt cost the nice chains more for internent, why use this necessity to gouge guests?

I was told that it was fully booked with a group. Then another person told me that if I paid $50/night I could have it. I became annoyed by this and spoke with the manager. Either the room is available or it isn't. I know they are not obligated to give me the room, but clearly I was not given the truth. so management agreed that the front desk staff did not handle it properly and then agreed to move me two days later. Much better/larger room. However, when I called daily for bowls and spoons for the kids cereal, some days I was told there would be a fee and other days no fee. clearly they were making it up, perhaps annoyed that I was calling.

I paid $300/night in the Historic Tower with breakfast included for two. I checked on a travel site and found this was a very average rate for a downtown four-star hotel that weekend. In all our times at this hotel, I had never got the breakfast package, but it was only an extra $25 over the flexible rate (which entitled the two of us to the $30/pp breakfast buffet, including juices and coffee\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 quite a deal.) The Historic Tower King room was beautiful, as was the marble bath with separate tub and glass shower. Extremely comfortable bed. As I began to unpack I realized I forgot my travel fan (which I need sleep)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so I called down and a fan was brought to my door within 10 minutes. The buffet breakfast in the restaurant was excellent: all the standard fare along with an omelet chef, eggs benedict, piles of lox, and thinly sliced manchego. Fresh squeeze OJ and coffee included. Lnen tablecloths and beautiful service make it a very enjoyable experience. I will say the CD they were playing sounded like 50\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s soap opera organ music, which just made us laugh. The thing I love about the Intercontinental is the service. The car valets are quick and friendly. A bellman was there to grab our six bags from the car immediately. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read reviews the occasionally say the front desk staff was rude or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153snobbish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Having stayed at this hotel many times, I can only blame the guest. When I walk up to the front desk it is with a smile. I am always greeted warmly. Of course some staff members are more friendly than others. At the busiest times of day, the service is definitely more efficient, but if there is a line, I wanted a quick and efficient interactions. On this stay, we had just experienced a five hour drive because of a huge storm in the city. We were beat when we arrived at 5:30pm. There was no line at the front desk and the woman who checked us in could not have been more sweet and kind. One word of advice, when you approach the front desk of ANY hotel, be bright and friendly\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be surprised how well you are treated. In other reviews I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read complaints about the price of the valet parking. At $52 a night, it is not cheap. But when you arrive in the rain and there is a doorman standing there with an umbrella to walk you to the front door, it is pretty nice. When you need your car, you call down and it is brought to the lower level garage exit within minutes. That being said, if you are not going to use your car throughout your stay and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a ton of baggage, go ahead and park at a nearby ramp, but be warned you will still pay $35/day with no in/out privileges. For me, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth it to valet. They also charge for internet\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I think it was $17 a day or so. That does seem a little steep, but again, it seems a lot of 4-star hotels are doing that. I have a feeling with more iPhones, people are using the service less and less. I really love the hotel.

At the check-in desk, I asked for a further upgrade and was told about the Intercontinental Ambassador club. For the cost of $150, you get upgrades to next level room for one year, fruit plate and water, 4 PM checkout, applies to worldwide properties. I decided to go for it. They upgraded me to a 1 bedroom suite with 2 bathrooms, separate large sitting area and a Michigan Avenue and chicago River view. 27th floor in the Historic tower. It was wonderful. Did not hear any noise from street or from other rooms. We used the entire space. My 4 year old was able to lounge around wherever. If one person wanted to sleep, the other could watch tv in the sitting area. We each had our own bathroom. One night, after dinner, I entertained 4 friends in the sitting area. Nicely decorated in more traditional tones. I heard the new tower is more modern but rooms are much smaller. Service was spectacular. There is a \"need it now\" button on your phone. Every time I pressed it for a quick question or request, someone would answer the call within the first ring with a personalized greeting. Breakfast buffet in the Zest restaurant is fabulous. Everything you could imagine for breakfast and they are very accommodating to kids. there is a Walgreens across the street if you need to get anything, snacks, etc. Full service Starbucks in the lobby.

We always stay here when we have to come to Chicago and it never disappoints. The swimming pool is gorgeous and the whole building is beautiful. The food at the restaurant was a mixed bag. They have a terrific breakfast buffet - many thanks for that. Unfortunately, the restaurant is very disappointing at lunch and dinner if you are seeking either vegetarian or healthy options. I can't figure out how professional CHEFS, who are supposed to be both creative and understand nutrition, don't get that vegetarians are gifts to them! Vegetarians are very cheap for you to feed but you can charge as much for us as you do for the more expensive meat eaters! Vegetarians and people who are concerned with their health want to eat protein, for instance, but there were no non-meat sources of protein on your menu. Why don't you get a few recipes with beans, for instance? Beans are CHEAP, plus theyPROVIDE PROTEIN as well as fiber and can be made into many delicious dishes that appeal to meat eaters, as well! You really miss the boat when it comes to offering at least ONE wholesome vegetarian meal that would also appeal to healthy eaters; lots of travelers are looking for healthy food that isn't soaked in grease - salads don't cut it, especially in winter. That said, the Intercontinental Chicago is a great hotel. Because I was on business travel and had very long days, I really wanted to eat in the hotel but since there was nothing healthy for me, we went to other restaurants near the hotel. WIth its central location, the hotel is near many restaurants that offer vegetarian/healthy options. One other quibble: the charges for Internet use were exorbitant. I work for the government and felt terrible about having to use this expensive service (they're my tax dollars, too), but I really needed internet access for work. I would suggest the hotel re-think its wireless policy. This must be a cash cow for them but at other Intercontinentals, there is no charge for wireless. (The AMAZING Intercontinental Montelucia Resort in Arizona, for instance, has free wireless.) Overall, a terrific hotel. Highly recommend. We paid for an additional night just so I could enjoy it, too!", "Date": "December 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monterey, CA", "Title": "\u201cFabulous, with a few flaws . . .\u201d", "Author": "califanglophile", "ReviewID": "UR51415052", "Content": "Because I received a very good rate from Travelzoo, I decided to upgrade to a room in the hotel's Historic Tower and--for the most part--was very pleased with my stay. I can't speak for the newer section of the hotel, but the historic portion is near-perfect. (If you stay at the Intercontinental, be sure to take the guided audio tour of the 1920s architecture; it is available from the concierge.) I found the staff exceptional; the room spacious, well-decorated and clean; and the location just about perfect. My friend and I came to Chicago to see an exhibit at the Art Institute; we were able to walk nearly everywhere that we wanted to go--despite temperatures reaching as low as 11 degrees. Whenever we needed a cab, the attentive doormen had one for us in an instant. The plusses: Location, location, location. My room must have had one of the finest views in Chicago--albeit through a rather small window. Located on the 12th floor, it was just opposite the Tribune Tower and offered nearby views of the Wrigley Building, the Michigan Avenue Bridge and the river. It doesn't get much better. Courteous, helpful staff Pleasant bar Good-quality toiletries Minusses (I hope the management will take note): The room's entry was poorly lighted; I had to walk quite a distance in very dim light to turn on adequate illumination. As another recent guest mentioned, the robes were awfully thin. My greatest complaint: no free wireless. I have stayed in both greater and lesser hotels where wireless connections are complimentary--in public areas, if not in the rooms themselves. To go to the trouble of carrying a laptop across the country, and then be expected to spend an additional $17.95/day to use it, is enough to give me second thoughts about a return stay. (I travel quite a bit and was suprised to find that even the business center charges $6.95 to use their computers.) Another small thing for hotels everywhere: please don't ask me to pay $6.95 for the bottle of water that you have so prominently displayed in my room. I highly doubt that there are many people willing to accept such an inflated price for such a negligible pleasure, so it can't be much of a money-maker for you. I suspect that looking at that over-priced bottle for the length of one's stay merely annoys the typical guest. Either offer it as a sign of hospitality or eliminate it altogether. That said, I did enjoy my stay and would probably stay at the Intercontinental again--reluctantly carrying my laptop across the street to the thoughtful bakery with the free hot spot. .", "Date": "December 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "meicurn", "ReviewID": "UR51294357", "Content": "My daughter and I flew into Chicago for the weekend and stayed at the Intercontinental.

Disappointing hotel.\u201d", "Author": "brmusicman", "ReviewID": "UR51187695", "Content": "We stayed at this property in December, 2009 on an annual holiday trip to Chicago. On previous trips we have stayed at other properties, but we decided to give the InterContinental a try. We won't be going back. The hotel's location is great; very central. However, that's not a major advantage for this hotel, given that it is surrounded by several other hotels up and down Michigan Ave. and Wacker that offer an equally good location. The hotel's advantages stop there. While the historic tower looks beautiful, the vast majority of the hotel's rooms are in the \"new\" tower. Our room was in this tower, and it was very disappointing. It is simply not the type of room you expect to find at a \"luxury\" chain like InterContinental. I have stayed in nicer hotel rooms in many other hotels in Chicago that are in a lower price and star category. Let's start with the hallways: the hallways on our floor were lined with air purifiers from the Sharper Image. That is weird -- what luxury hotel has such musty floors that it has to plug in air purifiers up and down the hallway? The ugly pattern on the carpet in the hallways did nothing to cover up the many stains. The decor was also odd -- some classic elements of an old hotel, like gold accents, mixed with Southwestern elements and a few modern touches. Much of the decor was run-down: letters were peeling off of signs, wallpaper was peeling in corners, there were visible dings in the walls at every corner, etc. Our room was tiny, and while that's not entirely a surprise in urban hotels, it was furnished horribly for its small size. Huge, run down furnishings that ate up space in an already cramped room. The desk had plugs on the side; these had been pulled out of the desk and were hanging from it. The lighting was dark. To see the view of Chicago from the room, you had to first make your way through heavy draping on the windows, much of which was stained. The brown carpet was fitting of a college dorm room and was also stained. The walls were also thin -- we could hear the screaming baby in the room next to us for most of our stay. You can't blame a family for having a cranky baby; you can be annoyed that the walls of a hotel aren't thick enough to mute the sound. The bathroom was perhaps the worst. Thin robes. Threadbare towels. In the shower, the rub kept running when you turned on the shower head; this let the water build up in the tub so by the end of the shower you were sloshing around in a half-full tub. The bathroom was un-ventilated and also poorly lit. The only good thing to say about the bathroom is that the soap, shampoo, and lotion smelled nice. The service at the hotel did nothing to make up for the poor condition of the rooms and hallways. Check-in was slow; my Platinum status with Priority Club was not recognized at check-in and none of the benefits typically associated with that status were offered. The bell staff was awful. Upon our departure, we asked the bell staff to hold our bags. When we returned to pick the up, the gruff bellman took our tags, said \"it will be 10 minutes,\" and resumed reading his newspaper. When the bags finally did come, the other bellman carelessly threw them into the trunk of the cab. The hotel also has the typical charges of a luxury property: the glass-and-a-half bottle of red wine in the mini bar was $24; internet access was $15/daily (for a VERY SLOW connection; the higher speed connection was even more expensive); parking a car overnight is over $50; the bottle of water in the bathroom was $7, etc. etc. While you can expect those things in a large urban hotel, they are annoying when the basics that are supposed to come with your room aren't done well. A charge that is unnecessary at this hotel, and not typically incurred at other properties, was the $12/day charge to use the gym. Overall, this place is just not very nice. There are so many better options in Chicago -- places with nicer rooms, better service, and an equally great location. Another down point: it's not an \"oasis:\" the lobby was always over-crowded with crabby families; the Starbucks off the lobby always had a huge line, etc. I won't be back.", "Date": "December 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Location, Rooms, and Service!\u201d", "Author": "jjcoello", "ReviewID": "UR50711343", "Content": "The staff and management were so helpful and pleasant during our stay.

The hotel will not even discuss the situation with our Executive Offices. There is no doubt the theft occured here - our group has proof. This is a recurring problem with this hotel - information provided by local police. Cards were reproduced down to the card specific pictures on the front of the cards and codes on the back. One employee was out $2200 from their bank account. Fraudulant activity began within 2 weeks of our group's stay at the hotel and have continued as recent as last Friday.

If we had not started to talk to each other after I discovered my fraudulant charges we would not have been able to determine without a doubt Intercontinental Chicago is responsible for this theft. It is a shame they refuse to even discuss the situation much less offer to provide us with some sort of reassureance that they are working to protect to help us recitify the problem. There is no doubt Intercontinental is at fault and they are not even working with our credit card companies. The cost to our group of 100 managers keeps mounting in fraudulant charges and time we have to spend to canceling our cards and dealing with the credit card companies. Three of our employees were on vacation when this was discovered. My credit card company is launching a complaint and investigation into Intercontinental. I did not talk to them directly but those that have said the staff is totally disrecptful, unprofessional, and rude. There were several problems with the hotel when our group checked in.

It is so beautiful and in a great location. I visit Chicago yearly for a Leadership Summit and I stay here or the Embassy Suites depending on which is offered. First the bad, everything is extra here. Internet, fitness center and just about everything else. I never leave home without the laptop and work while I'm away but I did not purchase internet at the hotel. The headquarters hotel that the conference was at had free internet hot spots so I took my netbook there and worked between sessions and at the end of the day. I just can't see paying $12.95 a day when I'm only using it an hour or two. I did not get to tour the hotel this time even though I swore I would but I did check out the pool and it was beautiful. The security guard recommended that you go to the old section and start on the 8th floor and walk all the way down checking out each floor. Hopefully next year. This trip I did get to see rooms in both the old and new sections. My traveling partner was in the new section in room 1062. The room was small but beautiful and very clean. If they took the couch out it would feel like you had a lot more room. She was very happy with her room. I stayed in the historic section in room 2415. My room wasn't ready when we got there but we were early and they were very busy. It was ready about 1/2 hour after the promised time, about 4 pm. My room was large and had a very big bathroom with a separate shower. Again this hotel is very clean. Water was $6.95 a bottle and the mini bar was way overpriced even for a hotel. A stop at Walgreens fixed that. The bed was comfy and once I got to sleep I never woke up at night or heard any of the neighbors. The room was just plain wonderful. I had a king bed and there were 4 big fluffy pillows on the bed. My husband would have loved it. I need a firm pillow and always travel with my contour pillow. I had a semi-river view and it was pretty. There was a great old building across from my room that I had a view of and it was nice. Finally a hotel with good TV channels. I was so tired at the end of the day I couldn't even read so I enjoyed falling asleep to the TV. The person I traveled with this year kept me pretty busy and I got to see a little more of Chicago then I usually do. One item noted by myself and my friend was that even though we hung the towels up to reuse they replaced them. If you are not going to conserve water by letting the guests reuse towels then don't put the little cards in that say you will. Good selection of soap and shampoo and stuff. They offered both bar soap and bath gel. I hate when hotels cheap out and only offer bar soap. There is a blow drier there for those who like to know. I didn't use it so don't know how strong it is. There is also a coffee maker in the bathroom that makes the little pots of coffee. I did use this every morning before hitting Starbucks. All the hotel staff was helpful and friendly. Starbucks was not crowded in the morning this trip as in the past so we had a nice coffee on our walk to the conference. All in all if you want to stay in a beautiful hotel in Chicago whose prices are pretty much par with the rest, stay here.

Outside our room the floor was messy with remnants of someone else's room service for at least 24 hours. The beds were OK, nothing to get excited about as far as comfort is concerned. The duvet had some tears on it....not 4 star for sure. As for the hotel, it's really beautiful (we stayed in the historic wing which is lovely, the deluxe room truly large). We looked forward to the pool, as with the AG package it states to bring your swimsuit to enjoy the pool....but when we got there it was set up for lap swimming, there is a sign stating that it is for \"lap swimming only\" and a bit too deep for young children, and mine know how to swim. And it got crowded easily so young children who are in the pool tend to get overwhelmed by others there. Not child-friendly in the least and I wish the promo materials for the hotel would state that. And lastly, the street noise can be overwhelming if you're not used to it. The walls/windows are very thin - you can hear not only traffic, but bathroom and hallway noises very well.

Just could not get over the location - it was perfect. The rest of the hotel, eh. Some sites were giving it 4 1/2 stars, some 5, but it is AT MOST a 4 Star Hotel. When we checked in we were told the hotel was completely booked. We were assigned 2 double beds. I asked if we could get a king and the front desk said no, not unless we wanted to pay $75 a night for an upgrade. But if the hotel was full, how was I going to pay for an upgrade? Day 2, with a completely different staff, was much more accomodating and they moved us to a different room. They only misplaced our luggage for about an hour, but it was found so no worries. The rooms are smallish, gym nice, the pool is very historic looking and neat. We never could get the internet to work in our room (and yes, we're decently technology savy people) - when we talked to the front desk about issues, they simply gave us a briefcase size box of cords and modems and connectors. Even after all that, never could get the internet to work. Not a bad hotel, but not a great hotel either. If you're looking for luxury, stay someplace else.

I've read some somewhat critical reviews of this place, but we had a wonderful time. I'll give you my thoughts below: PROS: - Location - The location is really perfect for a downtown Chicago experience. The hotel is located on Michigan Ave., a about 100 yards north of the Chicago River. So it's smack dab right in the middle of the Magnificient Mile. You could walk most every place you wanted to go, or you could hop on a train to get to further flung locations. - Hotel - The Intercontinental was very well-appointed, and high-end, yet comfortable. The rooms had flat-screen HDTVs (but only had 2 HD channels), down comforter and pillows, the bathroom was modern and had quality toiletries. The design of the room was also modern, yet comfortable. There was obligitory $8 bottle of water and basket of $6 candy bars. Who actually buys this? - Service - The serviece at the hotel was great. We checked in a little early, and they had us in a room with 2 double beds. We asked for a king, and they told us that unfortunatley that they didn't have one ready, but took my number and would call me when it was ready. We went and had lunch, and then within an hour they gave me a call and told me it was ready. Throughout the rest of the stay, everyone from the front desk staff to the bell staff to the consierge was nothing but friendly and professional, without any of that big-city snobbery. - Ammenities - There was a very nice looking wine, cheese and chocolate specialty restaurant in the hotel that we didn't use, and the in-hotel bar was very nice. In addition, there is a Starbucks in the hotel, a nice way to get a light, cheap breakfast, thereby avoiding a high-cost breakfast. CONS: - Fitness Center - The only complaint I have is that the fitness center was like $25 a day to use for hotel guests, and the fitness center was only an OK hotel gym, not even on par for that much a day. The pool was free to hotel guests, and while I recommend that everyone take a look at it (it looks like a pool frozen in time during the 1920's), it is only for swimming laps, so unless you are a pretty hardcore swimmer, no pool for you. All in all, we had an absolutely wonderful time at the Intercontinental, and we will go back again if we have the chance.", "Date": "July 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "phila,pa", "Title": "\u201cGreat Property!\u201d", "Author": "phillytrippin", "ReviewID": "UR34880101", "Content": "The rooms are well appointed and plenty of room.

Upon arrival, discovered only one parking option exists... valet, which runs $53 per day. Ok, fine. Then, at check-in, lady told us room we were getting was great with spectacular views... lie. Come to find out, room was musty smelling, worn-looking (and I don't mean the decor) and very dark. Serious need for a remodeling/redecorating, at least for our room. As for the \"spectacular view\", one small window in the corner with a partial view of Chicago River and Michigan Ave; what a joke. Then discovered hot water fixture in sink was broken. Called to report it; all they could offer was that they'd send someone to take a look at it... no offer for room change, voucher, nada, not even a thank you for having reported it. Noise from hallway other room doors opening/closing was very apparent and annoying. Felt a bit like we were in a cruise ship, as the nickel-and-dime approach to a few of the amenities seems to be the other modus operandi at this hotel (following the trend of the big-chain hotel industry it would seem); $12.95/day for wireless, for example. Even though we booked through Hotwire (somewhat of a deal, relatively speaking), based on what we observed and experienced, this hotel does not deserve to be rated higher than 3.5 (4 maybe, but that's stretching it) EVEN at the price we paid (just under $200). Other than that, service was just \"okay\", nothing special. Hotels in this tier really need to take that extra step make you want to return or at least attempt to provide a memorable stay. In this regard, the Intercontinental just falls flat and is way out of its league... it simply offers nothing that to make it, or your stay, stand out. Take this together with the above-mentioned demerits, and I would have to recommend that you seriously consider staying elsewhere. Prospective travelers (and hotels, for that matter) can (and do) much better than this, especially in this area and price range. I'm somewhat disappointed with Hotwire as well...

That said, we had two experiences that were stunningly awful and totally unacceptable for a 4-5 star hotel. The first incident occurred at check in. It took over 1.5 hours to get our bags to the room. Worse still, we called down to the front desk 30 minutes after we were told our bags would be right up. After being placed on hold, presumably to find our what the delay was, we were told by the front desk that our bags were, \"on their way up.\" After an hour of waiting we called again and were told the exact same thing (i.e. \"on their way\"). Finally, after an hour and a half of waiting I went down to the lobby to demand my bags. The front desk person that checked me in literally went, \"I remember you. You checked in a while ago.\" I understand that sometimes the bellmen get backed up but don't lie to me about it and leave me sitting in a room for an hour and a half twiddling my fingers. The second incident occurred on the final night of our stay. A friend dropped us off after dinner and we wanted to invite them up to give them a gift we had brought for them. There were no valets out front and the front desk insisted that our friend would need to pay a $53 parking fee to leave their car out front for 15 minutes.

I explained to the front desk women that I had put a request in for 2 beds a few days prior - she one again informed me that there was no note on my reservation with that request. :( She then went on to tell me there were no double rooms available in the whole hotel (really?) - would the King Room be ok? Um ... I guess it has to be, right? I wasn't being mean about it, but she didn't even apologize for the mixup. After I told her we'd take the King Room because we had no choice, she let me know that \"they gave us an upgrade\" and that she'd make arrangements for a roll-away to be brought up at no charge.

(1) The room (two double beds) was very small. With two kids, it was sometimes a juggling act to get us moved around. We were in the \"new\" tower of the hotel. (2) The in-house restaurant was very expensive: $25 for breakfast buffet. But given the number of other restaurants around, that wasn't such a big deal.

We stayed in the Historic Tower King Room with a view of Michigan Avenue. The room was luxurious & romantic. It would have been nice to have a CD player in the room. And P.S. ladies- do not use the complimentary lotion, it smells very bad, like old playdough or something! But those are my only two very minor complaints. We didn't use the pool area but we checked it out- a very nice large pool but for lap swimming only. We didn't see a sauna or whirlpool, either. Every single staff member we encountered was extremely professional & courteous. They had 2 employees who worked right outside the door loading & unloading luggage, hailing cabs, & they even escorted me to the door under an umbrella the night we returned & it was raining! Now that's service! You must try the Passiontini at the bar by the entrance- $13 but the best drink of the weekend! Drinking is VERY expensive in Chicago- don't think you will find cheap drinks- we didn't & we went to lots of different style bars. The dining options are very limited for this being such a large hotel. We previewed the breakfast menu & they were charging $14 for 2 pancakes! Nothing with it, just 2 pancakes! We found a great diner right around the corner with unbelievable breakfast at a much better value (Mary's Cafe), pretty much every breakfast was $10.95, we had 4 different things & they were all super delicious! If you go right out of the hotel there is a set of stairs that takes you down under Michigan Avenue- keep walking straight from the bottom of the steps about 2 blocks, on the right is Mary's. You will pass the Reagle Beagle which has to be one of your nighttime stops- it ended up being our favorite bar. Very low keyed, great food, great atmosphere, great 80's decor & music. Not the songs that make you roll your eyes- the ones that make you say \"I've got to put this on my ipod!!\" You must try the Brady Brunch Punch, $10 each but soooo good! We had the boneless buffulo tenders one night with fries & they were great. Other than those 2 places near the hotel, nothing really stood out- you've got to walk further for more options. Couldn't ever find the popcorn shop that everyone raves about, but while we were looking we discovered that Hubbard Street would be a great afternoon bar hopping street. Someone else told me Rush Street has lots of bars, too.

The rooms themselves (we asked to see more than one) reminded me of the Times Square Sheraton: probably nice at one point but now past their prime and poorly maintained, I've added some photos but unfortunately the cell phone camera isn't very clear. The carpet was worn and stained in places, the baseboards were banged up, and all the furniture was dinged and scuffed,, In the bathroom the wallpaper was peeling and the counter had permanent stains. In the second room we saw there was also a bizarre brown stain in the middle of the wall -- and this was the room that was supposed to be an \"improvement.\" Since we were stuck here with a nonrefundable rate, we decided to make the best of it by getting a minibar drink and getting into the hotel bathrooms -- eeeeew, stained!

When we arrived Saturday afternoon the lobby was bustling with energy and there were many people floating in and out of the bar. We made our way to the front desk and were nicely greeted by a front desk attendant who was extremely friendly. I was carrying a bottle of wine that we had brought with us and she noticed it, jokingly commenting, \"Oh that was so nice of you to bring that for us!\" She then asked if we were there for a special occasion and I told her that we were celebrating our anniversary. A few clicks on the keyboard later she told us that she had applied several upgrades to our reservation. This is very uncommon given that we used a 3rd party source to book our stay. Our room, suite really, was in the Historic Tower on the 34th floor. There was a large bathroom with a tub set underneath a large window with an awesome view of the city and a separate glass enclosed shower. The bedroom was spacious with a king bed, desk, couch, and entertainment center. There were also two large windows in the bedroom. Overall we were very impressed with the room, given that we had only paid $110. My husband really liked the bed (very firm) but I found it to be a bit lumpy and uncomfortable. The tub beneath the window was nice but it was just a regular size and not large enough to really lay down and relax in. The maid service was very quick to bring extra towels when we needed them and there was a button system on the door to let them know when not to disturb. The decorative style in the room was a bit dated, but not too cheesy or old looking. Sunday when we checked out we were assisted by the front desk manager who was, again, extremely friendly and courteous. We grabbed a Starbucks (nicely located within the lobby area) and took our bags to the bell stand. The bell staff (working the desk) were by far the least helpful/most rude staff at the hotel. They didn't smile and seemed pretty annoyed that we wanted to store our bags for a few hours while we walked around downtown. The only real problem we had was retrieving our car from the valet (that was ridiculously priced at $50). We waited about 30 minutes and finally went back to the valet desk where we had paid to get our car out. The woman had forgotten to give one of the runners our keys and our car had never been sent for. Fortunately we weren't in a hurry and so they went to get our car and she immediately apologized, took responsibility, and took my husband with her to refund the $50 fee. We were thrilled with her response and professionalism. Overall the InterContinental is a nice place to stay in the city. Would we pay more than we did to stay there again, nah, too many other great places for the same great price.", "Date": "January 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cIntercontinental Chicago--* World Class!\u201d", "Author": "SherpaDave", "ReviewID": "UR23896968", "Content": "The Intercontinental Chicago is World Class--at amazingly low rates!

This hotel was very beautiful throughout most of the interior and exterior the adjoined restaurant/bar and Starbucks was enjoyable and convenient for day and night time city walkers like ourselves. The best aspect of the hotel is its location in my opinion. It's literally right on Michigan Avenue, head just one block North and you're dead in the middle of the Magnificent Mile, famous for fabulous shopping and boutiques. The lobby was ornate and gorgeous with some crowd issues during the night time, since it was not a very large lobby. Check in was rather easy. We had booked the room weeks in advance via Hotwire and recommend that method if possible, of course it's not feasible to know with 100% accuracy that you'll get the Intercontinental when booking through them, but if it's a 4 Star in the Loop you may be in luck. I believe we paid $130 a night. The history behind the hotel is rather extensive and unfortunately we did not have the time to check out all of what the hotel has to offer in terms of historical significance. Although I did wander lost in the the historic tower a bit after getting ice! The building and towers are a bit confusing in the L-shape turn hallways that lead into different sections of the hotel entirely without you noticing when you head up or down stairs. But the pool must be seen. It's one of the most beautiful indoor pools that I have seen. As for the room, it was extremely cozy and reminded me of the Palace Hotel in San Francisco a few weeks ago, so much so in fact that the Screen Saver on the plasma tv was exactly the same and playing the same hypnotic tune, on the neutral Hotel channel. The refrigerator was packed with overly priced alcohol and soft drinks. I'd rather have the space to store leftovers or my own alcohol from stores down the street to be honest. The room itself was much less spacious than the Palace, and in general was very tight. It had a Queen Size bed and a 3 cushion couch tucked near the window. Not much room to put any large luggage without it obstructing your walkway to and from the door and bathroom. The bed was comfortable and the TV was a pleasantly large HD flat screen. My particular view being on the 12th floor overlooked the backside of the neighboring buildings and street. So not a very awe-inspiring view, but then again it wasn't a special room in the historic tower nor a suite. The concierge were well informed and found information with extreme ease and speed. I recommend walking to Trump tower and if it isn't the winter time definitely check out the architecture tours down the Chicago River. Check out was very easy through Instant Service on your phone, simply leave the card keys in the room after they verify any additional charges and at 12:00PM. Overall, the Intercontinental is one of the prettier hotels in Chicago, but it's most attractive feature is its centralized location to the downtown shopping area. Some negatives are the unusually small lobby for such a nice hotel and small rooms with the small refrigerator stuffed with high-priced booze instead of leaving space for personal boissants. If you are into shopping and want to see the architecture and cultural center of the city this should be a definite place to stay for under $200 a night.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harrison Twp., MI", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay at the Intercontinental\u201d", "Author": "TwoTravelers045", "ReviewID": "UR22328000", "Content": "We came to Chicago for the Thanksgiving Holiday with other family members.

I chose the hotel purely on location and was not disappointed. In fact, the location exceeded my expectations. For a first time visitor to the city it was immense. Some impressive architechture and excellent shopping on your doorstep. It's also very close to the departure point of the Chicago Architechture Foundation river cruise which I would highly recommend. For a first timer, it was perfect. The hotel lobby is impressive and the much talked about pool is stunning and was not very busy when we went for a swim, so we were very happy with the hotel itself and the amenities, albeit if I was a gym user I would have been less pleased as the fitness facilities weren't great for a hotel of this class. The room rate, which I booked through a UK hotel website, was also reasonable compared to other hotels in the city, particularly considering the location. However, our room, which was in the modern part of the hotel, was just OK. We requested a king bed and received 2 doubles which wasn't an ideal start to our vacation but we were too tired to request a move. The cleanliness of the room could have been better and we had some issues with the electrics which we persevered with but should have reported. Overall, I was more than satisfied with my stay at the IC Chicago but that was primarily due to location and not the quality of the room itself. If I hadn't received such a cheap rate for the room then I would have definitely complained about the room we were allocated and requested to change.

The Kowloon and Grand are spectacular with outstanding service (the Kowloon has what is probably the best view of any hotel in Hong Kong - even better than the Peninsula, another fantastic hotel in Kowloon). The Chicago Intercontinental is mediocre at best, with some well-meaning but laughably poor service and a management team that is in deep denial regarding what is required to be a true first-class hotel (or even a middle tier business class hotel). It started at check in: I always request a quiet, king, non-smoking room. They gave me a room with two twin beds facing Michigan Avenue. Okay, fine - sometimes that's how it works out. But I don't expect any Intercontinental to have paper-thin walls allowing me to hear normal conversations in adjoining rooms, as one has here in Chicago. Then I called to have some clothes pressed for my meetings the next day. Three calls later they had yet to pick up my clothes, and kept telling me that I needed to fill out the laundry request form, refusing to hear that there was no such form, nor the normal laundry bags, in the closet. I finally had to leave the clothes on the bed in order to make it to the restaurant on time. I discovered on my return that the clothes had been picked up, but instead of simply being pressed, as I had requested, they had sent them out to be dry cleaned. Perhaps they are looking for additional revenue? (more on that below) We'll see if I get them back in time for my meetings in the morning - but my confidence is not high. Then comes the business center. They have one, but it doesn't have a copier, the printers don't work, and there is no one available to help fix them. The best they can do is suggest you try printing from all the PC's in the business center, where one is charged a minimum fee just to log in and discover that one is unable to print from any of them. As a result, they get to charge you to log in to all their computers, but then go back to the front desk where they charge you again for the privilege of making black and white copies of the deck you needed in color. Must be a great marginal money-maker for them, along the same lines as the airlines charging $10 for those disgusting appetite suppressants they call food in what has become nothing short of peasant class. Oh yes, and now it is close to midnight, and, despite trying to get 15 simple decks printed at 9:30 PM, I still don't have them. Finally, my patience at an end, I provide some feedback to the hotel management and get whiney excuse after excuse about why none of these things are their responsibility, in a tone that suggests they are doing me a favor by providing any service at all. A true first-class hotel will at least step up and own the facts, but not the Intercontinental Chicago - they are just hapless victims of a cruel landscape over which they have no control whatsoever.

Another direction, the historic Water Tower and other sightseeing. Of course, being right on the Mag Mile, shopping is close at hand -- with Nordstrom's directly across the street! I had gotten blisters from my sandals on my first day walking all over town and needed to buy more forgiving shoes for the rest of the trip, so having a mall so close was very convenient for me. Our room was small but very cozy. We didn't have much of a view, but that didn't really matter to me, as I spent most of my days out and about. The furnishings were rich and sumptuous, the bed extremely comfy and clean. A small sofa was situated against the window, and we had a fridge to use. We didn't get to use the pool in the hotel, but we checked it out and it's very nice. The hotel staff was very helpful whenever I stopped for recommendations or directions. We both became enamored with the city and will be back again, to explore some more -- four days is not enough! We'll probably see if we can get a room at the InterContinental again.

The hotel is in a great location you can walk to the lakefront, water tower and el stop. The rooms are slightly bigger than average and well appointed. The real dissapointment at the InterContinental is the service. At check in I was told that the fee for incedentals was $100.00 per night, not the $75.00 I was told when I booked the hotel. The Front desk clerk did not apologize for confusion, she simply carried in the transaction, I was not offered the upgrade to the historic tower, nor the bundles of services (telephone, internet, fitness center). The parking service was even worse, there was never a valet after about 11:00 pm I had to walk my keys into the reception desk. For $49.00 a day I wanted there to physically be a valet waiting for me! Housekeeping was efficent but forgetful, as part of the \"greening\" of this hotel you are given the option of reusing linens/towels during your stay. As someone who tries to be \"green\" when she can I noftifed my housekeeper that I would keep the same linens/ towels for my 3 night stay. Even so each day she would replace the linens/towels. When I returned home from my stay I noticed a $300.00 charge to my credit card, beacuse I had used no other hotel services other than valet I called to question. After 6 attempts (the accounts receiveable clerk was on vacation, transfered to dead end extentions and being placed on hold to die) I was finally able to speak to the manager on duty, who told be that there was no charge on my account (even though I was looking at the statement) and it was a problem with my bank. After being placed on hold, I was told that I had in fact been charged twice for the room and the charge would be reversed. With no real apology the phone call was ended. The InterContinental is a good hotel if you get it on fire sale, if I was paying the peak season rates of well over $200.00 a night I would have been greatly disappointed.

When we arrived we were offered an upgrade to the historic tower with a great view for an additional $50 a night. My first thought was, didn't I pay for the historic tower when I booked with Orbitz? The Front Desk couldn't tell us what we paid for. Oh well... Sure, give us the upgrade since we're here for a week. The room was on the 32nd floor overlooking the Tribune tower and the river. The view was fantastic and the room spacious. There was a couch, chair, very large desk, espresso machine (that didn't work the first few days), nice bed and decent bathroom. Until you try and flush the toilet. You have to hold the handle down for several seconds and then flush again. When pointed out, engineering was sent, but nothing really changed. Why not a euro toilet with extra flush for that extra flush moment? (Note: You get a courtesy VM on your hotel phone asking if everything is okay after a call is made). Day 3 - No toilet paper after maid cleaned room. The stem was bare. Checked the main closet outside of the bathroom (this is where they keep your extra roll) - no toilet paper. Called the help desk and two rolls delivered. Courtesy VM left minutes afterward. Day 4 - Sink clogged. Call engineering. Sink fixed along with courtesy VM. Day 5 - Sink clogged again. I just pulled out the plug and it resolved the issue. Almost daily issue - The room we had on the 32nd floor was near to a conference room that serves both morning and evening events. What this means is that there is banging of tables and chairs (or something) in the hallway outside of the room starting at 6 am for set-up and sometimes until midnight for take down. We didn't complain about this, but keep note of this if you're tempted to stay on this floor for any reason. Another cleaning mistake: A hair from a previous guest was on the shower wall our whole visit. The lobby bar was very nice and the bartender was very personable. We didn't dine at the restaurant or the wine/chocolate/cheese bar. Workout rooms (although we didn't use) look very nice with an assortment of equipment, nice locker room, sauna and towels. The pool area is really cool, like you're stepping back in time about 50 years (with lighting a bit dim). Beware though - it is not a play/wade/splash around pool. It's a lap pool, so bring your goggles. I wasn't impressed with the Concierge desk as others have noted. Short, quick, stern answers after waiting in line. We won't stay again. I really appreciated the view that we had and the room itself was very nice for an extended stay.

BE POLITE TO THE STAFF. They process hundreds of people each day and you'd be surprised how wonderful they are when you walk up with a smile and a hearty hello. I stay at the ICH Chicago a few times a year and I had always paid to upgrade to the historic tower. Always. It's a $50 upgrade, but well worth it, especially if you paid only $100 or so on priceline. When you buy the upgrade, try to get to the hotel right at check-in time and ask to pay for the upgrade. Don't ask for it for free... they never do it. Be very polite and ask for a corner room with a view of the river. However, if you go to chicago more than a twice a year, ask about the Intercontinent Ambassador program. I never join hotel programs, but one of the phone clerks told me it seemed to be a good fit for me. It's $150, but you get the following: 1. Automatically get all your rooms upgraded to the historic tower. I used to pay $50 a night for this 2. Early check-in. Usually they get me in at noon. 3. Fruit, chocolate truffles, and Evian waiting in your room. 4. Late check-out 4pm. Automatically. I love this. 5. You get a FREE weekend night with the purchase of a FRI or SAT night stay. Let me explain how this worked on my first trip when i used it. I bought the program for $150. I booked Memorial Day weekend in Chicago. The city was booked solid, so my cheap room was $229 at the ICH Chicago. But I get upgraded to a $280 room and I got a second night free. Not to mention all the added perks, I saved $330 on my first trip for the $150 program. Plus I'll use it for upgrades throughout the year. Such a good deal if you visit even once or twice a year. Valet Parking is expensive ($50 per day) but the service is impeccable. Internet is also expensive ($15 per day if i remember right)...

We arrived at the hotel at about 10:30 in the morning fully expected to have to wait a few hours to check in, but were able to check in promptly. The only problem was that they were going to put us in a room with two double beds. I explained to the man that we supposed to have a king bed, and we would be more than happy to wait. He got a little agitated and told me that I could upgrade, and that if I book online, I am not guaranteed any certain room. I quickly explained that I had called to check my reservation two days prior and a certain girl with reservations had confirmed that I was guaranteed a king bed under my name and that we wouldn't mind waiting until a regular king came available. As soon as I said that, a king \"room\" popped up and we were in our room in a flash. Other than that, we had no problems with the hotel. Our room was on the 20th floor in the regular tower. It was small as some other reviewers noted, but there was plenty of space for the two of us. I liked the room because it had the feel of a European boutique hotel. The location of this hotel is probably the best hotel for shopping because everything is just right there in front of the IC and you can just head down the mile.

When we drove up, no one came to the car to offer assistance with bags, parking, etc. The 3 of us staggered through the lobby doors with all our bags, while the hotel staff stood and watched. No one tried to even assist with the doors. The lobby is not particularly impressive, low ceilings, nothing distinctive. There were 3 chairs, yes, 3 in the lobby. The front desk person first tried to sell us a more expensive room, when she saw there were 3 people on our reservation. For $50-150 more per night, we could indeed get a nicer room. I wanted to stay with the $130 I was already paying. She said she was giving us a \"nice, larger, corner room, with a particial view of the lake.\" When we opened the door into the room we were shocked at how small it was. There was not even adaquate space to access both sides of the bed. Both beds had about 8 inches of wall clearance. One of us had to crawl in and out from the foot of the bed that night. There was no view of the lake, only the side of highrise condos, nothing but concrete in sight. There is room for ONE suitcase in the room, that is it. If you use the space available for the one, you also forfeit access to the window, as it blocks the narrow passage on that side of the room. The closet is approximately 40 inches wide by 14 inches deep, so very little storage there. We were climbing over our 3 suitcases and several smaller bags the entire time we were there. The bathroom is very small and poorly designed, complete with the type of industrial toilet found in a sports stadium. The toilet was dirty with brown grime around the base and lid. The shower was clean, except for the black mold in spots along the grout. I contacted the front desk to see if a mistake had been made, since this was not the \"spacious corner room with a lake view\" that I was told of. They would not acknowledge that a mistake had been made, and I was given the same speech on \"upgrading\" for a fee of $50-$150 if I desired a \"nicer room.\" I tried a third time, a little later, to resolve this issue, but by then I was convinced I was talking to a robot. The same speech on handing over more money if I wanted a decent room for my family. The star rating of 4.5 or 5, depending on which website you are on, is inappropriate for this property. 75% of said \"amenities\" are not included in the price of your room, therefore they are not true amenities, and must be purchased at additional cost. The final insult were the condoms that are available for purchase in the basket of snacks on top of the mini fridge. My child discovered these along side the $4 Snickers bar and the $6 mini can of Pringles. The Intercontinental rivals Motel 6 for level of service, inadaquate facilities and overall tackiness.

We opted for this after an exhausting 31-hour journey from home, and were very glad to do so - 2 large bathrooms, a living room and a huge comfy king-size bed. Our area was very quiet, and the room was quite dark with the heavy curtains drawn - almost causing our downfall the next day, as we slept solidly until 11am (due to jetlag) and my wife's showtime was 1pm (my fault - I should have set alarm).

The bed in room 1842 was comfy; the heat was \"responsive\" on chilly nights; the bathroom is good but not luxurious, although there was a nice range of toiletries and counter space to spread out. Exellent housekeeping. There were all the other things you expect of a good business-class hotel, e.g. in-room safe, coffee maker, etc. Since we were at leisure on a short stay, we did not test the internet connections or the fitness center (lots of power shopping and museums instead.) There is a $48/night parking charge, which is very typical for this area of Chicago. There are in/out privileges. I don't understand the complaint of another Tripadvisor poster re: having to wait in a cold garage -- the car was quickly brought around to the front when we wanted it. There are various restaurants and a Starbuck's on-site. We only used the Starbuck's and the cafe for breakfast since we were in the mood for eggs, panakes, etc. The latter was fine, and service excellent, although they should improve the coffee (can I bring in a Starbuck's?) There is also a more lavish breakfast buffet, but we generally don't go that route. The Eno wine/cheese/chocolate bar looked nice, but we were busy with other things. My usual complaint about these places: the music was grating Euro-techno-loud something, not conducive to sipping wine. I would have asked them to turn it down (or off) had we stayed for a while. The other complaint is minor and happens: we had difficulty checking in when the desk could not find our reservation, and this was one of the few times when I had the confirmation number buried somewhere. 'Can't say whether it was their fault or the cedit card tgravel agency we booked with (we used bill-back miles, using a good room rate) but even after checking both my husband's and names, there was still a no-go. We booked a spare room, and then settled it with out CC company and the hotel afterwards. For some reason, we were booked using my husband's first name as the last name. Someone should have thought about this possibility. The room in general was quiet, but it faces North Michigan Avenue to the north. The holiday lights were ablaze, but we could also hear the occasional siren going by. Still, the room was ready, and we could check in early. Everyone was very nice and polite.

First of all, there are many little issues with the way this place was remodeled. It looks like the construction guys were a little sloppy. The curtains in my room were coming off the roof, some lids on the floor were a little offset recovering dark nasty holes, door frames were obviously repainted by a non-professional handyman etc. These are little things, but aren't the little things what you fork the extra dollars for? I just hate that when you pay $200 plus for your room, they have the guts to rob $10 for a wireless internet. The worst part was, it didn't even work. I complained and didn't need to pay for that which is the least they can do. I think they should add some access points to strengthen the signal and make the access free like so many of the 3 star -type of places have (Hampton Inn, Garden Inn, Fairfield Inn, you name it). I wanted to go to the fitness center after a long drive to drain some sweat. Guess what, guests have to pay for it! Breakfast was nice, and it needs to be when it costs as much as a good dinner. To top it off, they made me wait 15 minutes in the cold garage to get my car. Is this why I paid a $100 for valet parking for two nights? There was nothing wrong with the attitude of the staff and the receptionist was courteous and nice when I said I didn't want to pay for the internet.

The price I entered was $90.00, I figured this was a long shot. My request came back immediately, and i was booked into the Intercontinental for just 90 bucks. I then emailed the hotel directly and requested a non-smoking room, (priceline can't guarantee you a non-smoking room, FYI) on a high floor with a nice view. We packed up the family and headed to Chicago with our fingers crossed. I couldn't have been happier with a hotel, even if we had paid full price, it still would have been great. What's good about it? The location. Right downtown on Michigan Ave. next to the tribune building, near the river, walking distance to Navy Pier (By walking distance, I mean our two kids, 7 & 8, walked without complaining). The hotel itself is very nice, there are two restaurants downstairs, Zest and Eno. One fancy, the other really fancy. and a bar. There's also a Starbucks attached to the lobby. There's probably two more across the street, but who's counting? I can only review the room we stayed in here, but it was awesome, lots of open space, large plasma TV, large marble tiled bathroom, comfortable beds, very clean. The room actually felt new. The view from the window as you're going to sleep was of the Tribune tower, the Wrigley building and the Sears tower, among the other building which I don't know the name of. Beautiful at night, the kids loved it (It was room 2317, if you're curious). The downside? The extras are expensive. Parking was $48.00 a day, which I think is outrageous even for downtown Chicago. I probably could've found a cheaper lot, but driving around Chicago is stressful if you don't know where you're going. So we just took it on the chin for parking. $9.95 a day for internet access. There are so many place offering free wifi, it just doesn't seem right to find a place that still charges. The restaurants and bar are pricey. OK, so I only went to the bar, but $6 for a bottle of Goose Island? And $10 for a gin & tonic? One last note on the pool, it seems to be part of a larger members only fitness club, and although it's amazing, it was a little awkward bringing little kids there to swim, something they had been looking forward to the whole trip. You enter through the fitness center doors where you're directed to a locker room and told to shower before entering the pool area, and as the host eyes the kids she tells us that there's a strict no jumping or diving or splashing rule. At the pool there are lane dividers and signs on the wall that say \"lap swimming only.\" In the pool, there are a few old people with swimming caps and goggles on, doing laps. The pool is very nice, but not for families with kids, and for us that's a pretty big deal. because if the kids can't enjoy the pool, we can't enjoy the pool. All in all, great place to stay.

I called and asked again, it finally arrived at 5pm, only because the room he was bringing it to had not checked in yet. Gee thanks!!! I noticed on the desk what appeared to be the schedule for a conference of the prior guest along with the 1/2 gone $5.95 bottle of water he must have had. This was not just a piece of paper, it was several pieces and a large binder left behind on the desk which was cleaned???? We pretty much let that go and decided to take the kids to the pool. It was beautiful. The ladders going in and out are kind of scary but the place is beautiful!! Our 1 & 5 yr old had fun but it is a huge pool and deep so you have to stay right with your kids, no kiddie area here. That's OK though it was really a neat pool. Our teenager loved it. Then I took the little ones back up to the suite to have a bath before dinner. That's when I noticed the black hairs that were all over the tub area. I thought at the time I would just put the kids in the shower(which is separate) until I saw there was a used soap left in there. I was disgusted, I couldn't even bathe my children and I paid extra for this!! It took several phone calls and 1 hr 10 minutes later we finally had a clean bathroom. The instant line they have for you to call had said they would were going to send the manager of housekeeping up, it was 45min before she showed up. I in the mean time had called back and said forget the housekeeping manager, I wanted to talk to the manager. After our bathroom was finally useable the housekeeping manager showed up while I was giving the girls a bath so I did not have time to speak to her. She told my son that the room must have been not quite ready yet but they let us check-in. Well the front desk clerk phoned housekeeping twice before letting us have the room so that doesn't fly with me. The fact that I had asked to speak to the manager seemed to have been forgotton until I walked down to the front desk myself and complained when we were leaving for dinner. We got an apology and 4 free breakfast coupons, yeah thanks. No manager to speak with I guess. Then when we went out the front door to get a taxi we had to get it ourselves, the bellman ignored us and went to the car that just pulled up to help with their luggage. Not that getting a cab was a big deal but I have never had to do so at any of the other 4 star and even 3 star hotels I have stayed in in Chicago. The front desk did say they were very busy.

To be clear, I didn't have a bad stay; it just wasn't as nice as I would expect given the price I paid ($239 per night). I was there for five nights, so I was able to see a good cross-section of service standards. What is good: -The location. Fantastic. Can't be beat. You are right across the street from the Nordstrom's on Michigan Avenue. -The pool is a beautiful junior Olympic-size pool. Very nice and not too crowded when I was there. -Extremely pleasant and helpful bell staff. -Quiet room. There was a fairly long (albeit dark) hallway in my room between the bedroom and the front door. That meant that I couldn't hear any noise from the hallway at all. -Big desk area. I was in Chicago on business and had to do a lot of work in my room and the big desk was very useful for this. Why, though, do they have a fax machine on it? -The wine bar on the ground floor. Nice wine list, good cheese selection, very nice staff. -Comfy bed. Good linens, good pillows, good mattress. I would have slept like the dead if it wasn't for the problematic climate control (see below) What they need to work on: -The gym. It is cramped, poorly ventilated, and not very well equipped. Either improve the facilities or don't charge for them. -Pricey wifi. US$10 per day. -The rooms need to be redecorated. Mine was looking a bit tired. One of the hinges on the TV cabinet was broken, they still had a massive CRT TV in the room, not a nice, compact LCD TV. The bathroom was a bit tired (why is there no place to hang a hand towel near the sink?), though the lighting was o.k. The doorbell for my room was broken, so it was hard to hear a knock at the door. -Inconsistent housekeeping staff. Some days, it was great. Other days, they didn't replenish the toiletries, give me any fresh wash cloths, or restock the minibar. In fact, my minibar wasn't restocked at all during my 5-day stay! -Climate control in the room. It was extremely warm for much of my stay and I just couldn't get the air conditioning to cool down the room. -The breakfast buffet. Expensive, the food wasn't great, and the waitstaff were slow and not very responsive to guests' needs. I also have to agree with people who have commented that they felt like the Intercontinental wanted to find any excuse to get more money from you. It starts with the gym and wifi. The minibar prices are really extortionate. What finally pushed me over the edge was being asked to pay $35 for a late checkout--at 2pm! I completely understand if you want to check out at 4pm that some sort of charge is reasonable, but 2pm?!? When you've spent over $1500 in the hotel already?!? Very cheeky. I wasn't impressed.

It wasn't terrible in a general sense, but it certainly did not fit my personality. The good aspects of it included that it was clean and appealing in its decor. And the people working there were not unpleasant. However, several things irritated me throughout my stay. The first was the lighting, which was much too dim for my taste. I don't mind romantic lighting sometimes, but it was grey and dreary outside when I arrived, and I didn't like having to be in a dim room too. I consoled myself with the hope that the dim lighting meant that they were conserving energy, and so, I hope, it was for a good cause. Then there was the issue of the lobby areas. I had a lot of work to get done on my trip and yet did not want to spend all my time in my room. I found it quite difficult to find comfortable lobby areas to just sit and relax. Most areas were just for the restaurant and bar customers, or too close to the incoming and outgoing traffic of people checking in and out. More attractive and quieter spaces were usually full. I usually ended up going back to my too dimly-lit room to work. The most irritating things, however, were the many small costs, many of which were not transparent to me at the outset. True, I don't travel a lot, so part of it is my lack of saavy. The water bottles lying about were clearly marked with $6 price tags, so at least I was clear on their costs. But I still found it very irritating, especially when I could get a bottle of socially conscious water right across the street at Starbucks for less that $1.50. It felt like the hotel was taking extreme advantage of weary travelers by charging so much for a lousy bottle of water. Then there was the issue of the exercise room. When I came in, I was informed that I had to pay $12 if I wanted to exercise that day--or $16 if I wanted to exercise multiple days. I was disgusted by this because if I'd had stayed at a cheaper hotel, it would have been free. I realize that they had a fancier exercise area than most hotels--though I wouldn't know anything about that because no one offered to let me go in and look around--and I was so flabbergasted by the charge to exercise that I didn't think to ask. Upon complaining about this to some of my traveling companions, they said that they had heard that parts of the exercise facilities (the pool perhaps??) could be used free of charge. \"Why then didn't the person at the desk let me know this?\" I wondered. Why did he/she allow me to leave stunned and annoyed that, on top of an expensive per night fee, I was going to have to pay an unreasonable price just to exercise. Then there was the phone issue. I guess I'd mostly stayed at lower hotels before now -- where internet, breakfast, and 1-800-number calls were all included in the price of the room. Still, I was saavy enough to understand upon arriving that internet would cost $10 a day (too high, but at least I could prepare myself by knowing ahead of time), and I knew that breakfast wasn't included. But I was unprepared for the charge to use my calling card. In my previous stays elsewhere I had been charged for local calls, but never for 1-800-number calls. Again, if it had been obvious (like the cost of the internet or the cost of the water in the room) I would have been very irritated, but not outright offended. But there was nothing in the room by the phone to let me know that they'd be charging for that. So I didn't find out about it until I called the desk to find out what it cost for a local call (because I knew that local calls would cost and so knew that I needed to call to find out the charge if I didn't want to be surprised). It was then that they informed me that I'd already been charged with $15 worth of calls. Furthermore, when I let them know (indignantly) that I had no idea that there would be a charge for 1-800-number calls, they did not politely offer to remove the calls. I had to get quite angry before they even offered to remove 1/2 the charges. I was most angry because if I'd known about the unreasonably high charges, of course I would have used a cell phone or even my internet connection (which I'd already paid for) to make my calls--I didnt even need their phone!! I was using it only because of lack of information, which they should have posted in the room somewhere. I could afford the Intercontinental--that wasn't the problem. My company was helping with the charges too. I didnt rate the hotel as terrible, because of course some of my dissatisfaction is due to my own characteristics. I was being lazy and time pressured (without much time to research hotels for my trip)--I had hoped that by paying more for a hotel I would get more. But in fact, by paying more I got less, and everything I wanted/needed was \"extra\" in a really unreasonably high-priced way. I suppose I'm the kind of person who would like to pay once and then enjoy my stay without worrying what sorts of charges I might accidentally and unexpectedly be racking up. I left feeling like the luxury of that hotel was extremely selfish, \"charge-happy,\" and wasteful -- taking advantage of tired people who'd be willing to pay for every little thing simply because they had the money to do so and were too tired to look for other options -- NOT because it was worth the cost. Really, the hotel wasn't that much more beautiful than any other cheaper hotel that I could have stayed at -- and which I will stay at in the future. I should be grateful, I suppose. To have learned this lesson with most expenses paid by my company, rather than to have had to learn it when I was footing the bill. Still, I left very irritated. I don't care how rich I eventually get, I will avoid the Intercontinental and hotels that remind me of it in the future.", "Date": "April 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cExceeded expectations\u201d", "Author": "C5LS1", "ReviewID": "UR7300764", "Content": "We enjoyed our four day stay at the Intercontinental.

Who knew pickles and tomato on a hot dog could be so good? After that we walked to the Art Institute which is a must see and very walkable from the hotel even though it was a bit nippy. Do yourself a favor and go to Flatwater on North Clark right on the Chicago River after the museum for the amazing $2 appetizers from 5-7pm. You could make a meal out of these alone but we saved some space for Giordano's pizza which was worth the wait. We did not eat at Zest in the Intercontinental as we heard it was overpriced and not that great. The doorman recommended the West Egg Cafe for breakfast on Sat morning which was a short walk from the hotel. What an amazing breakfast for a great price. Do yourself a favor though and get there early as the locals line up starting a little after 9am. A short cab ride away is the Museum of Science and Industry which is definitely worth the price of the cab fare. Check out Body Works 2 if it's there or in your city! After the museum definitely go have a cocktail at the Signature Room on the 95th/96th floor of the Hancock Building. The views are great even if the cocktails are all $11 each. Again, it's a quick walk back to the hotel from the Hancock. Another short walk from the hotel on Ontario is the Chicago Chop House where we had the most amazing and tender steaks (prime rib and filet) and lobster tails. Amy was a great waitress and did us right by recommending the warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream for dessert. On your way back to the hotel stop in at Redhead Piano Bar and get there a little early (about 7:30pm) for a seat around the piano. We had the best time singing along with Dave the piano man who sounds almost exactly like Randy Newman. Their cocktail list is long and imaginative and we can vouche for the Y-Spot and Queen's Kiss cocktails. Excalibur for dancing afterwards was a fun (if not somewhat late way) to end the evening. The taxi ride from the hotel to O'Hare is about $50 including gratuity but the cabs were lined up outside even at our early departure time of 5am. You can also get to the hotel from the airport by taking the Blue Line CTA train to the Clark/Lake stop (which is only $2) and then take a cab to the hotel for about $8 including tip. This is a cheap and convenient way to come into the city esp if you want to avoid the morning rush hour traffic.

The valet staff courteously explained the parking/luggage process (something we are used to doing ourselves), and the front desk staff were efficient if not overly friendly. However, housekeeping ignored our Do Not Disturb sign and rang our doorbell promptly at 9 AM to see if they could make up our room. Also, the light bulb was burned out in the small entry hallway in our room, making it hard to see in the hallway closet. The bellhop that brought up our luggage said he would contact maintenance to get it fixed, but nothing ever happened. Another word of caution: parking is $41, not the $10 to $25 estimate listed on the Hotwire website.

So we had to do the luggage storage thing while we went to dinner, which cost us a couple of extra tips. When we checked in after dinner at Ditka's, the drapery sheer was torn loose and hanging sideways from the curtain rod, the carpet in the entry way was soaking wet, and the bed was sunken in the middle like a hammock. It was late so we decided we'd deal with it the next day. The pillows on the bed were these awful feather pillows (are we the only people who don't like feather pillows??), so we requested foam pillows. The ones they sent up weren't much better. The next morning I was getting dressed for a business meeting, had my socks on, walked over to the closet, only to soak my socks on the still wet carpet - not happy! We asked to be switched to a different room that afternoon, and they accommodated us. We asked for foam pillows up front, and didn't get them, so we had to go thru the whole ask and wait scenario again. Pillows were a bit better this go-around. This room was better, but the problems of the first couple of days left a pretty bad memory for us. The location of the hotel is great - easy walking to many shops on Mich Ave. We had breakfast one morning in the hotel restaurant - Zest - and it was $57+ for the buffet for 2 people!! I have to admit it was very good, but it certainly should have been. If you like to have a cocktail at the hotel bar in the evening, forget it here.

I was nearly half an hour checking in the room and had to deal with the arrogant attitude of the manager on duty. They gave me a room in the \"modern\" tower, (built in the 60's) which was about 2/3 the size of a regular room at the Mark Hopkins (built in '29).

The closet door, if you are not careful, may break the full length mirror attached to the bathroom door. I was not provided with a key to the minibar and I called for turndown service, which never happened.

Everything about it looked fabulous on-line, but I was a little worried by some of the reviews. I actually had a wonderful stay. I was in room 1402 in the historic tower. I got to see a lot of the hotel, because we had events in various places. Overall, it is a wonderful hotel. My room was very large and beautifully furnished, but, because I like to review hotels I've stayed in and felt that I wasn't having the average experience, I started asking other conference attendees how their rooms were. The two people I asked separately were unenthusiastic and complained of small, \"O.K.\" rooms. The lowest conference rate those paying guests got was $209. The conference rate for the room I stayed in was $249. Depending on where in the country you are from, you may have very high expectations when spending that kind of money. My own room was very large and beautifully furnished. It had a king-sized bed, a lovely armoir that housed the television and mini-bar items, a desk and upholstered chair, an easy chair and ottoman, a small sofa, and an upholstered bench at the end of the bed. Everything was in perfect condition, the art was nice, and the room afforded that fabulous view down Michigan Avenue that another reviewer mentioned. There was a massaging shower head in the glass-enclosed shower in the lovely bathroom that also contained a tub. There were plenty of towels, and they were very nice and thick (so I thought the towel complaint in another review was curious). A scale and a hairdryer were provided, and there was lotion, shower gel, and ample Yardley soap. Toiletries were replenished daily. A complimentary newspaper was also delivered daily, and the in-room coffee was actually very good (I've never said this before.) Now, even though I seem to have had an exceptional room and loved the hotel, I do agree with one of the reviews I read before my trip that said this is in no way a 5-star hotel. Here's why. First, the toiletries were not very nice. I usually bring my own shampoo, but decided that since I wouldn't be there too long and there was sure to be complimentary shampoo, I wouldn't bother -- big mistake. There was a combination shampoo/conditioner that was not good. Second, there was no make-up mirror, and I defy anyone to apply make-up with the available lighting. I also defy anyone to read using the lighting available in the main room. Third, the robes provided were those spa-type waffle robes (which I actually discovered I like, but most luxury hotels provide thick, terry robes). Now, please don't get the idea that the bathroom was dirty. It wasn't. However, I could see stains at the back of the toilet bowl that extra attention with a brush would have eliminated. Next, the hairdryer was that same basic Andis wall-attached model that they have in even the most basic hotels. (Any woman would have to bring her own.) Finally, there was no turn-down service. In a 5-star hotel, one expects to return home in the evening to a turned down bed, robes laid out, chocolate on the pillow, and soft music playing on the radio. Guests staying in even the worst available room in a 5-star hotel should not be saying, \"It was O.K. but nothing special.\" Now, on to the pool. Although the pool is surrounded by patio-type furniture, this is neither the sort of pool that you'd relax around or a suitable playground for kids. There is nothing romantic about it. The pool and room have historical interest. The pool is long and divided into several lanes. This is a pool to swim laps in -- nothing more. If you are a swimmer, however, everything I just wrote will be hugely appealing. There was little competition for a lane in this pool at 6:30 a.m., and at other times, I never saw anyone in it.", "Date": "May 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baton Rouge, LA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel - Don't believe the bad reviews\u201d", "Author": "Southern_RN", "ReviewID": "UR4993063", "Content": "We also stayed over Easter weekend, 2 adults and 1 teenager.

It is beautiful, full of historic charm and peaceful. If you are looking for a place that really is in the middle of everything on the Mag Mile this is it. Our room was fantastic. We opted for the historic tower king bedroom with a city view. My wife and I loved the interior of the room. It was clean and tastefully decorated. Our bed was extremely comfortable, making it hard to escape from in the morning! Best of all the view was amazing. We had a great view of the Wrigely and Tribune buildings. We were also able to see the river and lake Michigan. Now, the reason I give this hotel an above average...Zest. The Intercontinental should start from scratch on this one. At first glance the decor is very cool. On closer inspection you realize the furnishings are sub-par. They could have done better buying everything at IKEA. The food is average and overpriced. We opted for a breakfast included package on our room. However I think I would have felt like I got ripped off if I paid full price for it. $50 for eggs and OJ! The second day we went there we opted for the buffet which was insane. During our stay there was a business conference and a couple of weddings at the hotel. This meant a full house and Zest was not prepared. We waited in line for about 20 minutes to get bacon and eggs only to get to the eggs and have them taken away for a refill that never came! I could go on and on but the best piece of advice would be to skip it. There are a lot of great places for breakfast and other meals in the area. Billy Goat offers breakfast for under $5 and it's worth the classic Chicago experience. To sum it up stay at the Intercontinental and skip Zest.

The InterContinental Chicago is just average at best. Maybe it was just the room. Maybe it was our last stop on our 5-city tour. Whatever it was, InterContinental Chicago was our family's least favorite stop. My boys are 14, 13, and 6 and they all thought this hotel was the worst in comparison to the Westin NY, Embassy Suites Niagara Falls, Wyndham Cleveland and Hyatt Detroit Southfield. The room was smaller than average size (even the New York room was larger) but the A/C unit was not the right fit for it. It ran constantly and was very loud in spurts. It was loud enough to hamper a good night's rest. The water pressure in the hotel was faulty as well. The sink ran as if the water had been recently turned off in the hotel. The shower sputtered the same way with a serious variance in water temperature. I alerted the hotel staff and management on duty the following morning. She promised to hava an engineer look. We returned to find everything the same, except for the wonderful job from the room staff. I instantly went to tell the manager on duty who was so swamped that I could not wait to see him, so I left a note. Since nothing was done, the last manager we spoke with tried to make everything better. That helped the stay tremendously, but my boys still gave it the worst rating. The pool is magnificent on the 12th floor. The elevators are quick. The staff is friendly. Don't get me wrong. The hotel is clean for sure. It is definitely a nice hotel, but when you see 4 and 5-star, you expect a certain level of excellence. The valet is slow and awkward. Don't lose your valet tag with number or you might lose your vehicle. At one point when we returned, we had to leave our car doubled parked in the middle of Michigan Ave in the middle of Chicago. The awkward part is that you have to go to the hot basement to retrieve your vehicle and you have NO idea where you are and which way you are facing. It was a little unsettling. My wife asks if she is wrong in thinking that if we pay $41 for valet that they should bring the car back close to where you left it and not in some smelly basement? Or is that just in Texas? The view was atrocious. We were in the main building facing the other building. Needless to say, we kept the curtains drawn all day. The in-room safe was a tad bit small for my Dell 15\" screen laptop. There are 2 phones in the room-one is in the bathroom (neat!!!) The beds were hard and uncomfortable. Nothing compares to the Heavenly Beds at the Westin. We will NOT go back to the InterContinental Chicago. It received the coveted \"Ah BOO!\" accreditation from our family. I had intended on posting pictures of the view but we neglected to take any because of how bad it was. I did take a cell phone shot of the pool and a night view of the front.

The location is good and our room was very nice, so no complaints there. However, the staff were dreadful. In fact, the hotel seemed to be understaffed to us and because it was a holiday weekend and there was an England/USA soccer match the place was packed. On three of the four mornings there was no hot water for a shower. We complained, but nothing was done to remedy the situation. A guy with a wrench turned up the final morning and told us that the water was fine. Great - I'd taken 3 cold showers by this point and seemed to be being told I was imagining it! Then, on the Saturday night, I broke a glass in the bathroom and needed help clearing it up. We waited an hour for housekeeping to either turn up or call us and let us know they were on their way - nothing. I cleared the glass as best I could with my bare hands so we could use the basin to clean our teeth. Two hours later a new shift of staff came on duty and we were called to see if the glass had been taken care of. It was gone midnight and we were asleep so the call woke us. I told them I'd dealt with it. For a five star hotel with prices to match this was not the kind of service we expected. We were unimpressed, to say the least.", "Date": "July 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and excellent location\u201d", "Author": "wt88", "ReviewID": "UR3687844", "Content": "Recently stay at this hotel during the hottest days in Chicago.

A second thermostat was installed and the fan worked properly for an hour, finally cooling off the room, when it promptly died yet again. A hot, sticky, muggy room at $229 per night plus tax is unacceptable. They offered to give us a half rate on the last night but my husband was so perturbed at that point that he decided to fly home and dispute charges with our credit card company. This from a wonderfully mellow fellow (and local incoming Rotary president) who rarely ever becomes angry about anything.

It seems to be smack dab in the middle of all the touristy sites just at the southern end of the Magnificent Mile, great for you shoppers, and just north of Millenium Park, the Art Institute and the other museums. It is also about the same distance from Navy Pier. I could not think of a hotel with a better location. I stayed in a room in the historic building with a view of the Chicago Tribune building, the NBC building, The Wrigley Building and, ahem some less thrilling views of air conditioners on a smaller building, but nothing is perfect, right? The hotel's service was very good in that they made every accomodation I requested. However, there were a few things that I was supposed to receive as an ambassador member that I had to ask for, which should have been automatic. The business center is also expensive (minuimum 7 dollars for 15 min) and was closed for the holiday, which I thought was strangely inconvenient. Other than that, the rooms were nice, clean, well-sized and quiet. I can't speak for the main-bulding rooms though. I am giving the hotel an \"Excellent\" rating, although it is more 4.5 star.

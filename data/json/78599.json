The rooms adjoin by door, so you can hear everything if you have noisy neighbors. We were \"blessed\" to have a room full of kids next door with the parents across the hall, so they would put the latch so the door would be cracked and would run across the hall and each time the door would SLAM. This went on until midnight. I should've just had them move us, and we might've had a better experience, but who wants to change rooms once you're in your Pjs? The bed was clean and comfortable, and there was a nice big TV. The bathroom did not appear to be renovated like the rest of the room and the tub was discolored. The continental breakfast was appreciated but the room was filled with people barefoot and in their pajamas and screaming babies. I find this the case most anywhere with a continental breakfast.

The soda machine was broken the whole week we were there, and didn't look like there was any intention of fixing it. The front desk has some beverages for sale, but they can't seem to stock a bottle of water? Isn't hospitality the name of the game?? Breakfast is crowded, and as hard as the girls work, they can't keep up with the fact that there was never enough seating, and not enough recources to properly serve breakfast. There is ONE waffle machine. For at least thirty people a morning. And guess what- there isn't much else served as far as being filling, so naturally, everyone flocks to the waffle machine. Do the math, if you're standing in a line that's seven people long, and each waffle takes at least 2 minutes to cook and a lot of people make two, you're standing in line for over 20 minutes.

Based on his great presentation/overview, we decided to use the Ivy Hotel as our primary accommodations for over 50 family and guests. Jeff and his staff were fantastic to deal with as our YES RSVPs came in and arrival/departure plans were made. Needless to say, we were a bit worried about this hotel since they had just opened a month or so earlier, so we held our breath as the guests started arriving on Thursday AM in mid-May 2011. We were thrilled when every single wedding party guest was not only satisfied with their accommodations but also with the staff at the Ivy. They liked the breakfast in the AM, they liked the modernistic rooms, they liked the rates (we paid for a lot of our families directly). I heard only a few complaints that the floors/walls are a bit thin so you can hear people walking in the halls at night/morning. So. Why only 3 stars, then? Sadly, we've had little/no luck in getting Jeff Perry back on the phone/Email since our wedding weekend ended to discuss the bill. We believe - in the checkout confusion - that our personal credit card was overcharged for some guest room nights. We're not sure, but we THINK this is accurate based on our spreadsheet calculations. No amount of phone calls or Emails to Jeff or his staff seems to warrant a call-back or acknowledgement that they will help us work this out so we don't feel overcharged. We're bummed that this experience ended so negatively as everything else went so darn well. So - I'll say this - great renovation. Great location if you want easy access to wineries. Great staff. Don't count on them helping you at all if something goes wrong with your bill. :-(", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "camarillo, ca", "Title": "\u201cWhat a great find!\u201d", "Author": "miznina", "ReviewID": "UR116723982", "Content": "This was a family stay, with 2 kids (ages 12 and 14). I am pleased to say that, with all the remodeling, you still get a large room with 2 queen beds (I've noticed that sometimes when hotels remodel, they put in double beds to make the room seem larger). Everything did seem brand, sparkling new and I have nothing but positive comments to make. The layout of the bedroom is such that the sink is outside the bathroom, and there's an extra large space next to it for placing all the toiletries (much appreciated; I wish all hotels would think of this). There's only 1 strange quirk to the room (or our room) which may be a result of the remodeling: the first hallway light switch you need when you go in the room is INSIDE THE CLOSET. Once you find it, you'll notice there's actually a little cutout on the closet door to flip the switch. Breakfast was included, and the breakfast was substantial, the attendants working full speed all morning to satisfy all the tourists who need lots of food to sustain them through the day's wine tastings. We were also really impressed with the front desk, both in the evening when we checked in quite late and in the morning when we asked for local directions. Also, housekeeping came to our aid almost immediately even though it was very late in the evening. As a previous reviewer has said, don't be disuaded by the Best Western name.

The patio is a lovely place to have wine and cheese. Upon check-in, I asked to be switched to a room that wasn't at the top of the stairs and they couldn't or wouldn't accomodate that request. Also they were confused about how to credit my stay to the Southwest Airlines rapid rewards so I decided to drop that and pursue it later. The elevator was out of service the entire time we were there (5 nights). The top step was oddly taller than the rest and is a fall risk. Our room had been remodeled or was in the process. The wall paper was new but had many tears and holes. There was sheetrock dust, the counters and the towels rack were not installed properly. The bathroom pocket door didn't work. The other bathroom door stuck, the toilet has a slow leak, the lights in the bath and hall flickered. The frig never got cold, even on the lowest setting.

We had to ask repeatedly for toiletries and enough towels. The pictures posted by the hotel show three computers in the business center but there's only one, if that's an issue for your stay.

They just didn't stay on top of the demand--had to ask for napkins,plates, more coffee, tea bags, or something every day. I asked if they had more bagels and the woman said no, so we ate some dry muffins and as we were leaving, voila, bagels magically appear. Every morning people were complaining.

We were thoroughly disappointed in the first 11 hotels but then we came to the Ivy Hotel in Napa and we were both pleasantly surprised. You won't be disappointed. Ignore the low customer ratings that you may see on this hotel because those are carry over from the prior owner and prior hotel prior to renovation. There wasn't another hotel even close to this hotel in a similar price range. The other hotels smelled or were just old and out dated.

Comfortable bed, flat screen TV, the works. The room images on the site look exactly like the rooms.

They are in the process of remodeling, and they must have been behind schedule because they rented out rooms that were not yet complete. First, we arrived at 3:00 and had to wait until 4:00 for our room to be ready. Once inside the room, we discovered we did not have hand towels. I stepped outside the room and asked the maid for some and she said she'd have them delivered. Instead of waiting around, we went wine tasting and to dinner. When we returned five hours later, we had no towels. I wanted to call and request some, but we didn't have a phone. We also didn't have an alarm clock. The room felt a bit stuffy, so I went to adjust the air conditioner, but it didn't have any knobs on it. Frustrated, we went to bed, but the sheets were scratchy and my husband had trouble sleeping.

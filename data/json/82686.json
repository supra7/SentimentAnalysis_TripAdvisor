In town to meet with a client at the nearby Warner Center Towers, I chose to stay at the Hilton because I am a Diamond member and as such have a few extra perks and benefits that I wouldn't get at another hotel. Overall, my stay was very pleasant. The entire staff is friendly and helpful. As a Diamond my preference is set for a king bed and upon check in the gentleman informed me that he didn't have any king beds available but could upgrade me to a junior suite. I agreed that was fine and didn't think much of it. Later I realized that he must have been talking about there not being any king beds available on the executive floor which is where I was expecting to be placed. As it turns out, I was placed on the 5th floor (this hotel has 15 floors) which is not one of the executive floors. Not a huge deal, the room was spacious but I think I would have preferred a room on one of the executive floors with upgraded amenities. I will definitely be back and will know to ask for next time. Overall the room was nice. It was plenty spacious but there were a few things that could be improved. The heating/cooling system in the room is really loud. I didn't need to use it much since the temperature was consistently comfortable but I imagine that in the summer this might be a bit of an issue, especially when trying to sleep. Another issue is with the hot water in the morning. My first day the water temperature was lukewarm at best. I prefer a hot shower in the morning to help wake me up and I assume because everyone else in the hotel was taking a shower at the same time the water barely made it to tolerable. I imagine this is because it is an older hotel. Additionally the water stream from the shower head is very narrow which makes it even more difficult to enjoy the shower when the water is barely warm. The second day was a bit better but I think this is because I got a later start to my day and not as many people were showering at the same time. The hairdryer in the room is a small travel sized one with no nozzle for air control. That was a huge disappointment and inconvenience that I hope/assume is remedied by having a room on one the executive floors. The wi-fi was reliable and strong and as a Diamond member it was free which was a great bonus. The hotel shuttle is very convenient. As long as you are within three miles they will take you where you need to go. This morning I asked to stop by the Starbucks first and he was more than happy to do it. There are plenty of dining choices nearby. The Cheesecake Factory is right next door which is very convenient. A few blocks down is an El Torito and on the other side is a BJ's Pizza. As a Diamond I had access to the Concierge Lounge on the 14th floor. As \"club\" lounges go, this one was nothing to write home about. Breakfast was Continental style and the espresso machine wasn't working on the second day. It was free so my expectations were low anyway but I have had better club lounge experiences at Starwood and Intercontinental. Overall, I had a pleasant stay. I will definitely be back and now know for next time to ask for an upgrade to an Executive floor room regardless of available bed size.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "McLean, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cFirst Choice in Hotels in Woodland Hills\u201d", "Author": "Stewartia", "ReviewID": "UR126841025", "Content": "The Hilton continues to be my first choice in hotels in Woodland Hills.

First, the rooms were great. Very clean, nicely decorated with a flat screen TV with lots of HD channels. However, they gave me a room on the 3rd floor which also has a meeting room and my room was located pretty close to it. There was a seminar going on so it was pretty crowded and noisy during the day on the floor. Also, for some reason the walls in my room must have been pretty thin. I can hear my neighbors on both sides and their TV. Normally I would complain, but they weren't being loud and I think it was just cuz of the thin walls. Again, the other reviews stated that noise was not a factor so I think I was just placed in a bad room. Furthermore, there was no ice machine on my floor, so I had to travel to a different level for ice. The front desk did not notify me of this during check in. Second, the parking was an issue. They charge $9.00. It always irks me when a non-airport, non-convention center hotel charges for parking. The structure is located behind the hotel and it's not just a hotel structure. It is used by the surrounding businesses and companies. So, it could get very crowded and it's very compact so sometimes it was very congested. There are in and out privileges but you have to get your ticket validated at the front desk every time you come back and a new ticket is issued. Again, this is something that the front desk did not tell me at check in. Lastly, the reviews about the A/C and the doors are absolutely true. The A/C is very loud but luckily it was a cool day so I hardly had to use it, but watch out during the summers. Also, they have to do something about the doors. You hear hundreds of door slams throughout the day. They really need to install the device where the doors shuts slowly. Another thing. Their gift shop closes at 8PM. 8PM!!!!! I had to go outside the premise to get some incidentals. 8PM is a little early no? Even with my complaints, this is a nice hotel. If I would have been given a room on a different floor and if the front desk properly told me about the above mentioned issues, this could easily be a 4-star review. So, maybe it was just a case of bad luck?", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat\u201d", "Author": "SKim323", "ReviewID": "UR125131185", "Content": "I am one of the \"frequent\" guests at this hotel and I like it very much. However, I understand that everyone has different reasons why they like a hotel so I will break my review into different sections. Rooms: The size of the rooms is very good. They are kept clean and they \"feel\" clean. The only downsize is that the closet is pretty small but I don't remember ever thinking of closets as being generous at any hotel. There are a lot of lamps in the room so light is not a concern if you need to work late at night. Concierge Lounge: I like the concierge lounge at this hotel. Rosie, the evening staff, is very friendly and helpful. Sometimes while traveling it is very nice to be able to have a little talk with someone about something besides business. Front Desk: They have always been helpful with my requests. They are quick to remember you if you stay a few times and will go out of their way to accommodate you. Room Service: Food is decent and quick to arrive. Gym: The gym is small but usually empty so there is no fighting for equipment. I wish the gym was a little bigger but it has all the basics. The equipment is clean well maintained. If you have a LA Fitness membership, it is next door. Location: Within a couple of blocks you have restaurants that can cater to different tastes (The Cheesecake Factory, BJ's, Gaucho Grill, Starbucks, etc). Basically, you won't starve. Also, there is Best Buy, Nordstroms, Nordstroms Rack, a mall, and many more stores. Also, within a couple of minutes from the 101 Freeway (except when there is traffic). Engineering/Maintenance: I am very picky about the quality of the rooms when it comes to maintenance. I am happy that they are very prompt to fix whatever I find wrong in the room. No room at any hotel (W, Four Seasons, Marriott, and others) that I have ever stayed at has been perfect in my eyes. However, this hotel ranks pretty well compared to others. TV: One of the features I like best is the in room DVR. TV programming is lacking since they recently changed the line up. I was disappointed to find out the new programming. Internet: The in room internet speed is quite decent and connections are solid. Things I would like fixed: One thing that I always think about is that the room doors need adjusting. They slam quite loudly and they seem to shake my room if my next room's door closes. Also, some type of crowd control would be nice when there are events. Some of the event guests tend to stand in the drive way.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cA Pleasant, Non Descript Hotel\u201d", "Author": "microsciences", "ReviewID": "UR125028119", "Content": "The Hilton, located at the Warner Center in the San Fernando Valley is a pleasant, clean, hotel, that fades into the background and holds no surprises good or bad. My only comment on the room was the location of the A/C system and the noise it makes each time it starts up - its like standing next to jet engine. Since i spend little time in a room, and only to sleep and clean up,it was not important enough to get a room change The restaurant served a good breakfast and the menu for the lunch and dinner was reasonable should you need to stay in for meals. My major complaint with Hilton, and most other hotels of this class is the charge for access to the internet. Its no longer a perk or special service, but a requirement of life. They do supply the Financial Times and USA Today but that's a legacy solution; I get them both on my phone. Cheap motels in the middle of nowhere can supply it for free, why can't Hilton find a way to do it? Charging for parking ($14.00/ night) also bothers me, but real estate is expensive and space is at a premium. A comment on my part regarding the all the member rewards programs and the like As a frequent traveler, and a Hilton Rewards member I am growing weary of the games played by hotels, airlines, car rental companies et al. to join and receive points for rewards. I think that day is past - I will get my own rewards, thank you; give me your lowest price, make my experience a good one, and remember my preferences when I show up again....

I will break down the review in sections. Hotel Staff - We could tell this staff has had excellent customer service training. They call you by name. They always ask about your stay. Front desk is very efficient and gets you on your way quickly. Very obvious everyone has the customer at the center of their focus. We had a problem with one of the TVs in the suite and within a matter of minutes they were there to repair and apologized that we even had a problem. Rooms - I have seen complaints that the rooms are dated. However I think the rooms are more a provincial style which may not appeal to everyone. For us the rooms were great because the bed was very comfortable, the water was hot, towels were bright white and the rooms were exceptionally clean. I can't ask or more than that. Room Service/Restaurant - Food was very good. The breakfast buffet was good and had a great mixture of cold and hot foods. Food was ever dried out and was constantly being restocked. Location - We were there to visit our son. The hotel was very convient for our visit. For those who like to shop the hotel is surrounded by high end stores, Nordstrom's, Niemen Marcus, etc. for those looking or bargains you will find a Nordstrom Rack, Ross, TJ Maxx, etc. Also great great restaurants near by like Cheesecake Factory. Bottom line - Don't be turned off by the provincial furniture. You are not in your room all day any way. This is a great hotel with great customer service. Be advised you do pay for parking and Internet. Like all other Marriotts, Hyatts, and Westins unless you have a promotional package.

Can't say I've stayed in too many Hiltons over the years but the whole wedding party ended up staying here so I was curious to see how the hotel was. LOCATION: It's not far from the freeway which is nice for the out of towner to not have to GPS a bazillion different streets. It's also nicely situated next to some good resturants such as the Cheesecake Factory and a brewery called BJ's. BJ's is a nice lodge like atmosphere where I watched some football at. Well worth the effort. Lettuce wraps were quite good but be careful of the spicy mustard. It will get your attention! There's a strip mall across the street but once you get away from the immediate area, the neighborhood seemed to decline a bit travelling down Canoga away from the freeway/Hilton. PARKING: Uses a public structure so I remind you all to bring your ticket to the initial check in because I didn't and was forced to run back to the car just to leave without paying double. It seemed secure and always had an open spot on the weekend. CHECKIN: Painless and with virtually no lineup at 2pm on a Friday. Not bad. Elevators were always quick to respond. ROOMS: The room was modern and updated with a nice view from the 11th floor. Bed was big, cozy and plenty of pillows which I'm always a big fan of. Nice business table however finding outlets to plug in portables was quite difficult and almost seemed intentionally hidden to avoid using their electricity or something! ; ) The one major hiccup though was the AC. It was cold but it certainly made a lot of noise kicking on and would startle us repeatedly in the middle of the night. Not sure if it's a particular issue with room 1122 or just the AC generally speaking. Other than that, the rooms seemed pretty quiet. We liked having the ice and beverage machine outside our door until someone else used it in the middle of the night! LOUD. It would have been nice to have a mini fridge and perhaps they offer it but we were a block of rooms associated with the wedding so maybe they just didn't reserve that type of room. GENERAL DECOR: Lobby is nicely decorated and the hallway floors were heavily carpeted to reduce noise which is nice. RESTURANTS: We didn't partake but they appeared busy. FITNESS AREA: I enjoyed the elipitical with the buit in TV monitor and the free weights were nice. It would have been nice to have some sort of chest/bench machine though. That's seems like a pretty basic ingredient to a work out area. I guess the limited space won't allow for more though so I get it. CONCLUSION: It's a quality hotel and worth the stay. Most places have their little quirks so nothing to worry about here.

The hostess, Bridget was always friendly and greeted us with a huge smile and made us feel right at home. 3. Fitness Center. The fitness center is very clean, modern and cold.

I'm not sure why, but the maids never left new soap in our room. We had plenty of shampoo or conditioner, but never any soap. We ended up just buying some from the store. 2. Overpriced Parking.

It also explains why I was able to book such a nice rate, I'm sure. The big downside to this hotel is the ridiculous cost for parking. I had to $15.40 ($14/night plus tax) to park in the parking garage. Ironically, I found out later that I could have parked nearby somewhere else for free and only walked about 1-2 minutes farther than the trek to the parking garage. The front office staff was kind, though the young man who checked me in forgot to remind me that he had to validate my parking stub, which caused a slight annoyance, though nothing horrible. The room itself was nice. The ergonomic office chair and the king size bed were really comfortable. The bathroom, though, looked like it had seen better days. It wasn't dirty, just a bit worn and considering the usual rates at this hotel (and that it's a Hilton), really didn't live up to the standards I would have expected to see. However, as I said...

This time we were sent to the Hilton Woodland Hills. As usual we call the hotel immediately to make our specific reservations for bed selections. This call is made 2 WEEKS before we are to arrive. When I called the Hilton they REFUSED to talk to me. I explained that doing this is recommended by Priceline and that I have done this dozens of times. I requested a room with 2 queen beds. She refused to discuss and told me that I would have to wait until I arrived at the hotel to make these arrangements. We are driving from Oregon to Los Angeles and after getting a late start and hitting traffic in Sacramento and having a 7pm appointment to meet I decide to call again and try to make arrangements so that we can go right to our room and get to our appointment on time. This time, for the first time, I am told that they have NO QUEEN BEDS in the entire hotel. WHAT??? It's me, my wife and teenage daughter and the choice is 2 doubles or a king. OK, I'll pay to upgrade to a suite. What? The sofa is not a sofa bed? Do you think the people on the phone with me would try to be helpful? Boy would you be wrong. No help and no suggestions. Just tough sh!t that's the way it is. When we arrive I explain the situation again. Nothing....just blank stares. I ask for a roll-a-way bed for our teenager and they will check \"to see\" if any are available. Maybe the person on the phone could have suggested this and made SURE they had one? We read online that a lot of people mentioned a free breakfast and went down in the morning \"assuming\" that the very small buffet was for guests. Guess again, the crappy breakfast for 3 came to $40!!!!! So we are at check out and I know the manager of this Hilton likes to read and reply on Tripadvisor so as the gentleman at the desk is telling me the total on my bill.....I say, \"aren't you going to ask me how my stay was?\" Blank stares. This guy could care less. I mention the bed situation, the phone calls, the hassles....but nicely and quietly so as to not have other guests that were checking in hear me.....I was not trying to embarrass anyone. Nothing. Blank stares. So I say, \"I saw online that many people did not have to pay $40 for the pretty skimpy breakfast. I was surprised to pay?\" He looked at me and said in a monotone, \"Not included in your package.\" No free breakfast. No free internet. No free parking. No pool. No caring employees. Wow, Mr. Manager, write anything you want in response. Tell me how sorry you are for the lousy time I had at your establishment. I know you do not care. Your employees are proof. Not one person I spoke to had any interest in making my 2 day stay at your hotel anything close to a pleasant experience. Talk is cheap. This is the worst review I've ever had to write about any hotel or restaurant. It's one thing when things \"just go wrong\", but in this case your employees had no interest in me or my family.

I booked the Woodland Hills Hilton off of Priceline for 65 dollars a night which wasnt bad for the area. We arrived around 530pm after fighting several hours of traffic. The drive was a very hard to maneuver with a large SUV which made the very pleasant and helpful Valet guy an awesome person to know. The inside lobby was like a desert, hot and stuffy yet empty. The lone receptionist checked us in quickly. When we turned to head for the elevators, my assistant nearly tripped over a garbage can (yes, a trash can...with trash in it even!!) sitting in the middle of the walk way. After further curiousity, we noticed that the garbage can was sitting there catching a drip from somewhere in the ceiling. We made out way down the dark and dreary hallway to our room which was nothing spectacular. Two full sized beds, ugly dirty carpet, a beat up desk and the bathroom resembled the one from the original Psycho. I began to work on some stuff for my meeting and she turned on the television that we believe was purchased from the Smithsonian. A few hours into our stay, I decided to get take-out from the BJs Brewery located directly next door. I stood in front of the elevator for 10 minutes. Nothing. So, I used the little courtesy telephone to call the front desk to inform them that the elevators were not working. The problem: The lady placed me on hold before I was even able to tell her something was wrong. So, I stood there for another 10 minutes waiting on hold and for the elevator, whichever came first. The same issue happened on the way back, though other guests were not nearly as nice about it as I. On the day of check out and my meeting, I had arranged for a wake up call. The call never came and I found myself rushing to get there on time. In the process, I left a bottle of my favorite perfume. Realizing my mistake, I called the hotel directly after my meeting, while i was relatively close to the hotel. The gentleman responsible for the lost and found was rude and told me that nothing had been found. I went through all of my luggage and my assistant went through her's just in case and nothing. Nada. Zip. So, I called back and his exact words were \"I dont know what to tell ya.\" WHAT?! I was angry and called the Hotel Manager who coincidentally had been able to locate my perfume which was not registered into the lost and found.

The rest of the staff goes about their duties with the enthusiam comperable of preparing to go in for a root canal. This hotel knows they do quite a solid business with the Warner Center nearby. The location provides people who will stay regardless of the lack of service. They have no incentive to improve. The Rooms: Are nice. The bedding is comfortable and nice pillows. I never saw bed bugs indicated in some of the other reviews and I looked for signs of them everytime. I did however have an alleric reaaction to something in the sheets on occasion. Detergent perhaps? The air conditioners need work. I'm not sure how old they were, but I called maintenance often and there is really not much they could do. Housekeeping often turns them off to save energy, which is great, but on sunny days those rooms heat up. Housekeeping: A joke. the only thing consistent in their cleaning is their inconsistency. I wouldn't touch the glassware, I've found everything from lipstick to coffee on/in the mugs. They do well on the towels, but replacing soap/shampoo/etc leaves much to be desired. I don't think the vacum daily. Internet: Well because it's a hilton and a \"Little\" more up scale they do charge for it. Not a big deal, but the system speed is different everytime I stayed. I'm not sure if that's due to bandwith of the number of hotel guests users or it's just different between the floors. Workout Facility: Nice, better than most. Water dispenser doesn't always work, but thats really about it. Lifetime fitness will let you workout for $15 and is right next door if you're a serious workout seeker. Executive floor: Nothing really special. The rooms are pretty much like the other rooms, they have slighly nicer bathrooms. The lounge provides a continental breakfast and PM snack. Alcohol is only served in the bar, and if you have status you can get drink coupons.

We heard of a winning priceline bid for this hotel for the same date we were staying and booked the room through priceline at a great rate. Having used priceline before, I am aware that you don't necessarily get your choice of smoking/non-smoking or king/double/single. But, I always believe it is absolutely foolish for a hotel to offer rooms on priceline then treat winning bidders rudely --- which is exactly what this hotel went out of their way to do. First, the hotel must have been vacant. We booked last minute for $55. Everywhere else in LA was considerably more. Our friends booked rooms the traditional way the night before. When we called in advance to ask if we could possibly check in early, Rita (the front desk receptionist) looked up our reservation and said --- come to the hotel and we'll see. By the time we got to the hotel at 1:30pm, some of our friends (who did not book on priceline) had already checked in. Rita told us we had been preassigned to a room and that it would not be ready for an hour or two. While she is telling us this --- other people are checking in with the other front desk receptionist. I told Rita that we have to get ready for a wedding and any room will do --- we are not picky. She said that there are absolutely no rooms available. At this time our friends returned from their rooms and told us the maids have just cleaned the rooms near them. Rita told us that all rooms are preassigned and we were assigned a specific room. I asked her to switch and she said it was impossible. Rita was genuinely going out of her way to be rude to us and sincerely did not want allow us to check-in or wanted to ensure we got a bad room. After expressing shock that they would not allow us a room, but allowed four groups of our friends to check in (and knowing that the hotel is not sold-out) and after Rita continuously telling us there is no way --- I asked to speak to a manager. Rita then spent 5 minutes browsing her computer and 10 minutes in the back room before she returned and said there was a room available. The room we received was not a special room --- on floor 9 (out of 15) right next to the ice machine. It was two double beds --- although we told her we preferred a king --- we were fine and didn't complain. I was shocked that she was holding this room back and didn't offer to us when we asked --- it wasn't an upgraded room. As Rita gave us the keys --- it was as if she had been defeated. She was quick and rude about it. If the Hilton Woodland Hills doesn't want Priceline guests --- they shouldn't put their rooms on Priceline. I didn't care where I stayed. The only thing that Rita's treatment did was to ensure that when I have to pick a particular hotel and book traditionally, I will not return to this hotel.

The room, hotel, amenities, etc seemed ok. Slightly dingy, but otherwise not bad. After the first night, I noticed a rash on my body that seemed like an alergic reaction to something. It got worse each day. I thought I was either allergic to the soap, shampoo or the laundry detergent used on the sheets or towels, but this had never happened to me before. I bought new soap and shampoo (brands I normally use). The rash was worse in the mornings, and appeared to be be in rows of several inches on various parts of my body (legs, abdomen, back, chest, etc). I started to research what it could be, and all signs seemed to indicated bed bugs. I finally stripped off my sheets and mattress and found a single bed bug (a flat brown bug about the size of a tick) crawling around between the mattress and box spring. I didn't bother looking for more. I immediately called the front desk. They sent a security manager with a camera. He was sympathetic, but neither confirmed nor denied anything. He photographed my rashes, took the bug, and offered me a new room on the executive floor. My main concern was to not track these home with me. They offered to dry clean all of my clothes, which I took them up on. I also asked them to spray down my suitcase with pesticide. As it was getting late on a Fri evening, the best they could do was to produce a can of pesticide, and I sprayed all my bags down myself. Overall, I think the hotel responded reasonably well. They should have offered to pick up the hotel tab, but didn't, and didn't provide any other compensation. I would have protested more, but I was being reimbursed by my company for the trip. The second room was clean of bed bugs, but I kept waking up at night and checking under the covers. While the hotel seems relatively clean, it was a very disapointing stay. I will not return.

The bed was very comfortable. The Internet costs $10/day for room access, but it might be free in the lobby (which is the same deal at the Marriott). Parking costs about the same as it does at the Marriott ($12?). We ate at the hotel restaurant twice, once on Christmas day and once for breakfast. We were actually staying at the Marriott on Christmas, but their brunch was sold out and we needed a place to eat. The Marriott's concierge recommended some alternatives for eating out on Christmas, but most places were really booked up with reservations and we wouldn't be able to eat until 7 p.m. or later. Then we thought of the Hilton (which the Marriott concierge didn't mention). We made reservations and ended up being about the only diners there on Christmas afternoon. The food was good. Prices were about $15-28 per plate. For breakfast you can order from the menu or get the buffet for $10. The buffet has standard fruit, pastries, muffins, yogurt, bacon, eggs, etc. The Marriott's breakfast buffet offers an omelet bar, which I don't care about, but my in-laws wouldn't eat breakfast with us at the Hilton because it doesn't offer the same option. I got vanilla custard french toast for $8, and it was very good and filling. Drinks are included in the buffet price, but are extra if you order from the menu. I liked the Marriott's lobby better than the Hilton's, and the Marriott's elevators were more reliable (and there were more of them).

The deal was that if I did six stays in a specified amount of time, I would get upgraded to a Hilton Honors Gold card. I had been a gold card holder a few years back, then after 9-11 my business travel got cut back a bit, so I slipped down to silver. I always missed my gold card, because it includes free room upgrades when available, and access to the VIP lounge. So, my wife and I set out to do six local stays. One of the hotels we chose was the Hilton Woodland Hills & Towers. Of all the hotels we tried, this was our favorite, and we made a mental note to return again. This weekend, our daughter went to go stay with Grandma, and we decided to go back to the Hilton at Woodland Hills. I don't know what happened in the few months between now and our last stay, but things really seem to have gone downhill in terms of customer service at this property. It started from the moment we pulled up. The valet parking was jammed with cars, and nobody seemed to be doing very much about it. When I was able to pull up closer to the hotel, I unloaded my own luggage. A Valet finally walked by, and asked me if I needed anything. It told him that I would like for someone to park my car. He asked if I was checking in. Apparently, pulling up to a hotel and unloading suitcases isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a clear enough indicator. When I explained that I was indeed checking in, he informed me that we would be charged $14.00 per day for the parking. We went inside the door to the front desk. He told us we had a king room in the towers. We went up to the 14th floor. The elevator opened across from an impressive double-door, with big gold lettering at the top that said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Concierge Lounge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In Hilton speak, this means a nice lounge with free drinks and snacks for the towers guests. The last time we stayed at this property, we weren't yet even gold card members and we received an oversized room with a living room and separate bedroom. We hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reserved a suite, so I thought that perhaps all the rooms at this property were like that. This time we had a room that wasn't any larger or nicer than an average Best Western. We were disappointed, but in fairness, the upgrades are based on availability. At least we were on the towers level and knew where to find the Concierge Lounge. We unpacked, and I set up my laptop. I connected it to the RJ14 cable provided in the room for Internet service. It didn't work. I traced the cable to behind the TV. It was connected. Then I pulled out my own cable and connected that, and it worked fine. Later, I found another cable back behind the TV that wasn't connected to anything, which is probably used when someone complains that the Internet doesn't work, instead of just fixing the cable that is connected at the desk. Next, we decided to check out the Concierge lounge. We went to the huge double doors by the elevator, and our key didn't work. There are two towers levels, so I thought maybe they had closed the one on our floor, so we went up one floor and tried that one. Still nothing. We went back to the room and called the front desk. I was informed that they no longer had a towers lounge. I asked the clerk exactly what benefit we had received by being on the Towers level. He replied, \"A better view\". The name Woodland Hills sounds like it might be a scenic place, but it's really not. The view was of some office buildings across the street. I told him that the last time we came, we had received a much larger room. He informed me that this was the best room they had available. I told him that I was very disappointed, and had selected this hotel based on our last experience, and so far it was like a different universe. He told me there was nothing he could do except to offer us free breakfast coupons. Then I remembered, that we had paid a higher rate to get breakfast included, and they had failed to give them to us when we checked in. I thought perhaps he would offer to knock down our rate, but it was apparent that he could care less that we were unhappy. We considered just checking out and going home. But, instead thought we would try to make the best of it. Perhaps going down to the hotel bar and having a few drinks would put a different spin on the situation. We passed by the front desk, and I asked for my free breakfast coupons. The clerk handed them over. The bar was totally empty, and we could see the bartender talking to what looked like other hotel employees. We sat down at a table near the bar. There was no acknowledgement that we had even come in. They all just kept talking. I began to wonder if the bar was closed. Finally the bartender came up and asked if we would like something. My wife ordered wine. I ordered a Tom Collins. He asked what kind of gin. I said, \"what do you have\". He cocked his head toward the bar. I smiled and said, \"Oh, you've got a lot of 'em\". He snapped back, \"No, all those bottles and the mirrors behind them are just an optical illusion\". I wasn't sure if he was trying to be funny, or was just rude. I told him to surprise me. He came back a while later with the drinks and a bill. No offer to run a tab. We sat and drank our drinks, and nobody ever came back to ask if we wanted another drink. I finally just signed the ticket and we walked out. We spent the rest of the night in the room, which was clean and nicely decorated. The Television had a good selection of current movies, and the Internet worked after I wired in my own cable. We ordered some desert from room service, which was good and came in a reasonable amount of time. For having been told that all the other rooms were taken, it was interesting that we never really saw anybody else on our floor. In the morning, we went to have our free breakfast. When we arrived we were seated in a corner, in a small table jammed in with strangers on all sides. It was odd, because other than this one corner the restaurant was empty. I've noticed a trend lately where they try to get you to take the breakfast buffet. I prefer to order off the menu, figuring that if I wanted to get my own food, I'd do that at home for free. The waitress made a last ditch attempt to get us to take the buffet by informing us that with the free breakfast coupon, we were limited to only $9.00 each off the menu. It didn't say that on the coupon, and most things on the menu were $9.00 or more. We ordered off the menu anyway. When we returned to the room, I tried the video check-out. After telling me to wait several minutes, it notified me that it wasn't working and I should try again later. We went down to the front desk to check out. It was the same guy who checked us in, and took my phone call the afternoon before. He asked if we enjoyed our stay. I indicated that it could have been better. He didn't ask why, or what was wrong, and didn't seem to care. We went outside to the valet parking area, and stood for a long time with our luggage and nobody came up to take the ticket. I walked down the way a bit and found three of the valet parkers standing around just talking to each other. I stood there and they didn't even look at me. I finally held up the ticket and one of them took it, and went and got the car. I walked around the back with my luggage, and he got out without opening the back. So, I walked around to hit the button and he said, \"Oh, it isn't open?\". So, from start to finish, the visit was below expectations. Don't get me wrong; the hotel is clean and comfortable. I just think that the staff people we were exposed to had a poor attitude, and seemed to be doing as little as possible to get through their shift. This property, in two stays went from a place I definitely wanted to go back to, to a place I never want to go back to. In Southern California, we have so many choices of places to go and relax, that there is just no reason to pick a place that doesn't appear to want to work to earn the business. The hotel isn't located near any sort of attraction; so really, they have to make it up in service.

My second mistake was to use Hotwire, which does not allow you to easily verify what hotel you are staying at before you commit, and then once you do, you can't cancel or get a refund. After making the reservations, I consulted TripAdvisor to read some sobering reviews of this hotel, and they turned out to be pretty accurate. Too bad I couldn't cancel out. I had high hopes for this hotel because of Hilton's reputation. I had stayed at the Hilton near the Burbank Airport and had a great suite and great meals at that hotel's restaurant - one of the excellent Daily Grill franchises. For some strange reason, I thought that the Hilton in Woodland Hills would be comparable. No such luck! First thing, as another TripAdvisor member said, there's the nasty $10-$12 daily hotel parking fee (can't remember the exact amount). With that factored in, I didn't save all that much by using Hotwire. The rooms were not particularly outstanding, and not what I would expect from a four-star hotel. Next complaint -- my grade-school children are really fanatics about swimming, so a nice pool was really a requirement. When we asked where the hotel pool was, I was shocked to learn that there wasn't a hotel pool. But all was not lost -- turns out they have a courtesy arrangement with the fitness center next door, and the hotel front desk gave us a pile of towels and a pass. Our kids were amused by all the sweaty bodies as we filed through the fitness center on our way to the lap pool. We had a plesant enough time, considering that the pool is shaded on all sides by the parking garage and hotel. We had to make room for a water aerobics class in the pool, so that was our cue to leave. All in all, the kids had fun at the pool, so I can't say it was an entire failure. But certainly not convenient to check in at the hotel's front desk every time you want to take a swim. We ate breakfast in the hotel's cafe. It was expensive, and nothing special.

We reserved the hotel through Hotwire and thus received a very good price on the room. The hotel itself has nice facilities. The rooms are clean and modern with wonderful massaging showerheads and comfy pillowtop mattresses. The staff was helpful and friendly - we had a small maintenance issue during our stay and it was remedied in a very quick and friendly manner. The parking for the hotel is in an adjacent parking structure - it is not cheap at $13 per day, but it is reasonably convenient and secure. There are also quite a few restaurants (cheesecake factory, sports bar/brewery) and shopping locations (mall, fry's electronics, etc.) nearby. The only small complaint that we had about the hotel is that the cleaning staff was occasionaly loud. Our room was near the service area on the floor, so we could sometimes hear them talking (loudly) to one another in the hallway. Otherwise, it was a nice place with friendly service, a good location, and a great price!", "Date": "December 19, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, AZ", "Title": "\u201cHotwire weekend rate\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2458483", "Content": "My wife, son and I were visiting family in Santa Monica and decided to check out some Hotwire deals. Their package price for this location on a weekend was $270 for two nights, PLUS a mid size rental from Hertz. Taxes, etc. included. The hotel was about 20 minutes from where we wanted to be, which for LA is nothing. Very clean, very quiet, top quality. Busy place for weekends with receptions, lots going on in the lounge. Breakfast was ok, even if it was served slow, but with top quality service and caring staff. Cheesecake factory is next door, which is where we ate dinner or went for desert. I was expecting it to be a \"dead\" location in an office complex but it obviously draws a lot of locals and is pretty lively. Honestly, if you are staying in the area I don't know how you can do any better for LA/Valley prices at this quality level. They put us on the 12th floor, great views, absolutely no complaints what so ever. You could do so much worse and pay so much more any where else in LA, Hollywood, and the Valley.", "Date": "August 18, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane Australia", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "Executivetravel", "ReviewID": "UR2379073", "Content": "Great hotel, except the reception staff, very rude and dont seem to care unless you are booking a suite or are a pilot checking in.

The pool is a joke. The hotel has an agreement to use the LA Fitness pool next door. You have to get a pass at the front desk and then sign-in at the club. I asked for towels and they said you had to get them at the hotel. Went to the front desk again and they said you had to get them from your room! It would have been nice for them to tell you this when you get the passes. The pool is a lap pool and has a very small deck area. We had mixed staff help. Some were very helpful but others didn't seem to care about you.

I paid a reduced rate for being part of a group but even that was pricey (109per) for what you get. Its just a regular room at a regular hotel. Nothing fancy. I would avoid the breakfast they offer. Its $15 per person and its basically eggs, bacon, and fruit. there is a place across the street (roseys diner or something like that) that has fantastic breakfast stuff for 1/2 the cost. Or there is a supdnuts doughnuts near by (much tastier). also keep in mind they charge you an extra $13 a day to park in their garage. Another tip is be wary of the bar. A member of the party ended up with a $1000 bar tab because he was ordering \"doubles\" at a cost of $25 each. A normal mixed drink was $12 (and described as a tiny glass). Best thing about the hotel was the outside pool / lounge area.

I was a guest here one week earlier and got no sleep because of a college group convention that was up at all hours of the night. Now I am here again after being assured at checkout that I would get a quieter room. Last night I heard LOUD band music at 11pm and called down and was told it was a restaurant across the street. They offered me a room change and told me there would only be music again on the upcoming Saturday night. And here I am at 11:49 pm with music blaring in my room from across the street. And it's only Friday....had I known this would be a nightly occurrence I would have switched rooms but now here I am again wide awake listening to some bad bad music. This is really not a place to stay if you want to sleep. It's an old hotel with nothing going for it except location - and with the music across the way that plus is even gone.

The good things: location seems to be excellent, with a mall right across the street, it makes getting around easy; there are a wide range of chain dining options, the staff is great and pleasant; and the workout and pool facility is a great plus. But overall, I have been disappointed when I stay here as it doesn't suit my needs and expectations. For my overnight experience, my rate was high - but I assume most comparable chain hotels are in the same ballpark. My biggest hangup was that because I was on a work trip, I needed access to the internet - I could not get the service to work on my laptop or iPad at all during my stay. Phone coverage was also poor to non-existent, although I would say I had some luck in my room, but for any place else on the property, getting access to a network was a bust. Attending a few meetings there, I could not get consistent coverage in the lobby, the conference rooms, or even outside in the pool area. Others in my meeting could also get no coverage through Verizon or AT&T. Once in a while, it seemed like you'd get a burst of access and you're email would download to the phone, or you'd get a text message, but when you went to reply or call someone, there would be no service. There was one sweet spot in the lobby where I was finally able to get access for about 30 minutes, but having had to be there for almost 24 hours, I was woefully behind in email and returning phone calls that I had to make up for it later the next evening. I can't say that the access issues is the hotel or the phone carrier, but it just seemed like there was a spell cast over the hotel to prevent access to the outside world.

I wasn't travelling on a holiday, nor was I travelling during a peak season and when I searched for the hotel, it was around $260 per night. In addition, there is free parking. My one night stay costed me $30 in parking fee. In addition, the internet (wi-fi) was ridiculously expensive.

She barely took notice, dismissed this request, and told me that I had room only. When I asked that we contact priceline about the discrepancy, she stated that there was nothing she could do unless I could \"prove it\" and simply kept typing. It took a few moments to pull the info from my iphone, however, a few minutes later, I was able to pull up the priceline page with the inclusions. When I returned to the front desk, the representative stated that these were not communicated with them, and that they could only provide room and tax at this rate. The lady also shared with me that there had been another similiar recent problem with a priceline reservation at the hotel, but they couldn't help the other party either. I asked for the manager. After several moments, the front desk manager, Anthony Elsisi comes out. He tells me that my rate did not include any extras (room only). He said that in order to give me anything, he would require proof in writing. He was not willing to even look at the webpage, pulled up on my telephone, as he stated that I could have \"pulled that from anywhere\". I told him that this was the only method I had with which to \"prove it\". I even shared with him that I didn't really need internet (I have mobile) or free breakfast (I would likely sleep through it), but I wished he could at least cover the parking. Basically, I was asking for a $13 per night ($26 total) comp--something I would have thought fairly minimal. I shared with him that by this point, it was about principle, and I felt as though it was the very least that they could do based upon my reservation. Mr. Elsisi became irritated, then he responded to me that his time was very valuable and he would not speak further with me or help me with this issue. I have to say, this is not about $26. It is fully about being demeaned and berated, called a liar by the front desk manager, Mr. Anthony Elsisi. The funny thing was that the lady said I was not the first person with this issue, I reiterated to them that when multiple people complain about the same issue, they should probably take notice and do something about it. What I find now, after reading through the tripadvisor reviews, is that the real problem is not with priceline reservations, it is truly about a management staff who is not willing to properly care for its customers. Sad, but in this day and age, we have far too many choices to be stuck with such poor customer service. And when I see the managers response to the reviews, I see a bunch of excuses, but I have yet to see any offers of resolution--there's always a reason that they \"can't do anything about it\". Well, if that's how I handled my customer complaints, I wouldn't have many customers. I'll give you one more funny part. After I was incensed by the front desk staff, I searched and found street parking (being of principle, I was not going to pay them). For the next 2 days, I also refused to patronize the bar, gift shop, restaurant, store, or starbucks in the hotel. This would have cost them much more in profit than the $26 for parking. And when I checked out, you'll never guess, but they had placed the parking charge on my bill despite the fact that I clearly shared with them I would not be parking in the garage. Fortunately, someone there removed the charge. And, I did ask for a zero balance receipt just in the case that Mr. Elsisi needs me to \"prove it\". Properly handled, this issue may have cost the hotel $26 cash. Instead, because of the way staff handled this, it has cost Marriott a customer.

I normally stay at Hilton properties for business travel, but I had enough Marriott Rewards points to burn up to stay here for free (other than the $19 per day for valet parking). I'm sorry that I made this call. First of all, I have a hard time believing the $200+ a night that this hotel charges. There's nothing to justify such a high price. The indoor pool was closed, as were the workout facilities. Although this was obviously a planned renovation, nothing was communicated to convention attendees. If I had known of the renovations, I would have stayed elsewhere. Secondly, the hotel provided a shuttle service to the convention at Cal State-Northridge, which was about 20 minutes away. They had a schedule printed and distributed to convention guests. This shuttle was horribly unreliable. Frequently, it did not show up at all, and when it did, it was either late (by as much as 90 minutes) and/or replaced by a nine-person van-not at all suitable for the 1,600 attendees of the conference. My wife and I were stranded for over an hour not once but twice. When I called the hotel to complain, the manager on duty apologized and promised to call me back. To his credit, he did call back, but it was twenty minutes later and after the shuttle had (finally) arrived. When I asked what compensation would be made to make up for the habitual tardiness, he said that the shuttle was being provided as a \"courtesy,\" but he would ask the GM to contact me. The GM never did. As a result, we ended up driving our rental car to the conference and paying for parking every day for the remainder of the conference. Third, when I asked for more towels one evening, I had an extremely grumpy man deliver them to my door. When I said, \"Thank you,\" he simply turned around and walked away. Even more frustrating was the fact that I could see the nearby Hilton hotel out of my window, almost mocking me for staying there.

Here are some updated info for visitors, I will not include Amy descriptions of rooms,etc as it has already been written in the reviews below. For gold and platinum members: Internet in room is free even though you have to click on the $12.95 charge. The receptionist will adjust your bill at the end. This is typical. Executive lounge is on 12th floor and can also be accessed on the 14th floor. Views are ok it's not spectacular. There isn't a 13th floor. Lounge is small and you have to pay for alcoholic drinks on an honor system. Veggie sticks, cheese, crackers, chicken wings, sodas, tea, coffee and bottled water is free. There is a computer with printer for your use. Buffet breakfast is available on the lobby floor in the weekends but you have to settle for the exec lounge on the weekdays. Exec lounge opens at 0630 and closes at 2200. No indications that you get free parking as exec member...but will update if I get comped upon checkout. For other guests: Parking is $12.95 per day. There is a parking structure behind the hotel and is easily accessible. From the lobby to your car, it will take you at least 5 minutes to walk there and you will have to climb stairs or use the elevator. There is a valet available for additional cost. You can probably park for free across the street at the mall, it's about a 5 min walk but you will need to cross a small intersection. Business lounge on the first floor charges $5.95 for 15mins of computer use. Xerox is $1 per page. There is a star bucks on the lobby floor and many restaurants within easy walking distance in the vicinity. There are also many mobile taco stands on Sherman way between winnetka and Tampa where you can get authentic Mexican tacos fr a $1 each. Sketchy at night but highly reccommended if you are taco deprived. Bathroom amenities include: mouthwash, bath and body works lotion shampoo and conditioner. Cotton swabs and cotton balls and soaps. Room has a small fridge, safe and digital 32\" tv. Tea, coffee maker and hair dryer in room. Room has a small ledge that you can walk out to and it's great to get fresh air. Room temp is adjustable, however 82 degrees felt more like 75 degrees. Hotel is very easily accessible to the 101 and about 40 minutes to little Tokyo going east. Going west, it's about 40 minutes to Oxnard. 2small free water bottle in room daily. Newspaper free in lobby (delivered to room for gold+ members). I would come again.

Firstly they were running a special deal involving \"book 4 nights get one night free\" basically. This was a rather up market establishment with the most attentative and helpfull staff I've ever encountered. That said, I though the young lads that jump on you as soon as you drive up to reception were a bit too keen. On most occasions I hadn't had time to switch the engine off by the time a figuare was at my door. ! HINT: Self Parking is a doddle by the way, just in a multi-storey next door. They DO charge for parking but hey...who doesn't in LA ? The rooms are extremely roomy and clean but if you like to sleep with the sliding doors open like we do for fresh air, pick your room carefully. Initially we were facing the front where we got hit by quite a bit of road noise. They helpfully moved us to the back but were then hit by \"air conditioner\" noises but not to the point where it disturbed our sleep. With the doors slid shut you couldn't hear a dicky bird...nothing where-ever you were situated. The pool area was great, especially at night, very relaxing. Woodland Hills, to us, appeared to be an extremely safe place to be, with a large park and Mall near by. Denny's is a short walk away also for a \"cheaper\" breakfast. My STRONGEST recommendation though, when travelling in towards Universal Studios, Hollywood and LA proper is DON'T use the freeways between 7am and 10am or say 3pm to 7pm. they are a nightmare. Ventura Blvd travels paralell to Ventura Freeway, just South of the Marriott and although it took about 45 mins to get to Universal, between several million stop lights, it was well worth it over getting stuck in traffic for hours on the freeway....plus ALL sorts of life is seen on the Blvd...makes for an interest drive ?? The ONLY negative as far as we were concerned is why a large Hotel chain, of this quality, have the gall to charge for Internet access. In fairness the \"Business Centre\" isn't actually run by the Marriott, they just supply the room for a 3rd party to set up and charge guests but for our familly we were extremely disappointed, not least that the 3rd party charge so much ie: 15 mins was about $5.00 PLUS the connection was often quite slow.

I was really disappointed. I thought they would serve better food considering this was a large event with a lot of people.

(We stayed at the Woodland Hills Hilton on Dec 25th and 26th; see my review on Tripadvisor for it.) The hotel overall makes for a good place to stay. Location was decent, as it's located across the street from a small mall and movie theater. Parking costs about $12/day (I think). I thought their valet service was generally very good. Whenever we pulled up out front, someone in uniform was always there to get our doors and help us into the hotel if needed. The most negative thing about the hotel, in my opinion, is that the rooms are smaller than other hotels. I know that when we went to the Hilton for two nights, when we walked in the room there it was like, Wow, this is a much larger room. In reality, the Hilton's rooms might just be standard sized, but compared to the Marriott, the room seemed much more spacious. However, the Marriott does have a balcony (small, only room for standing), whereas the Hilton does not. Be sure to get a room without adjoining doors if you don't know the folks next to you. We found ourselves in that situation and had to change rooms the next day, because we could hear literally everything happening next door. We even could tell we were watching the same movie on television and knew the names of their kids. Once we switched rooms we had no sound problems at all. The best part of the Marriott, in my opinion, is their pool, hot tub, and exercise area. They have an outdoor pool (which no one used while we were there) and an indoor one. The indoor one is heated, and although I've stayed at many hotels where they SAY the pool is heated, this one really is. It was quite comortable. Steps lead down into about 3-foot depth, and it goes up to 5 feet. The hot tub was large and clean and very relaxing. I also really liked that they have a men's and women's locker room right there where you can change (there are lockers; provide your own lock), use the bathroom, even shower (there's one shower, large enough to be wheelchair accessible). And each locker room has a sauna. I would have liked to use the sauna with my husband, but I guess other people prefer it being for men only or women only. I like to exercise when on vacation, so I was pleased with the amount of equipment available. There were four or five treadmills, several bikes and elliptical trainers, plus free weights and some other weight equipment. They provide sanitary wipes so you can wipe down the equipment before you use it if you want. They also have a bowl of complimentary apples if you need a quick pick-me-up. Two complaints about the exercise area: 1) There are three TVs but only one of them seemed to work. And I could never get the remote control (when it could be found) to work. 2) The only mirrors are behind you when you're on any of the cardio machines. So when you're working out you're facing the pool (and the TVs). Overall we really enjoyed the stay. The bed is comfy and the shower was hot and water was plentiful. We only had a piece of cheesecake from the restaurant, but it was dang good (double chocolate). The restaurant seemed a little expensive (the cheesecake was $6.50). The room price was about $119-129/night, but I know you can get in on Priceline for closer to $55, depending on the time of year.

I usually gauge hotel stays based on full-service Marriotts, because they are very middle of the road for the business traveler. The Woodland Hills Marriott is just slightly better than average. The rooms match to Marriott standards exactly, right down to the wooden nightstands, the L-shaped desk and famous Marriott green desk chair. Most rooms will also have a comfortable easy chair and armoire with TV. All rooms meet the new Marriott bedding standard as well as down pillows and down comforter. It put it on par with your average Westin bed and I can say that I never had any problems sleeping and always found it comfortable. Bathrooms again are average with granite countertops and a single sink. I never had an oversized tubs - all appeared to be standard sized. For the most part all room amenities are up to date. There are larger rooms and suites on the 17th floor. May be worth asking for a 17th floor room when you check in. Room service at this Marriott was very good. Most orders were delivered within 30 minutes and they took good care to make sure that the order was filled out correctly. I did wish that the menu had a greater variety of appetizers, otherwise it's what you'd expect from a full service hotel - there should be something on there for everyone and they did have a small kids menu. The hotel does have a self-serve laundry facility onsite in the form of 2 washers and dryers - bring lots of quarters or you can get them from the front desk. They do have full laundry service that was, of course, priced high but within the range that you would expect from hotel laundry. As far as the staff goes, I only interacted with the bell, front desk and room service and they were all very friendly and competent. The lobby area of the hotel is nice and up to date including the bar. Most evenings it was full without being overcrowded or obnoxious. Despite all my nights there, I never did partake of the restaurant. One nice feature is the Starbucks in the lobby - it's a full service and is a popular stop for the business crowd on weekday mornings. There is an executive / concierge lounge on the 12th floor which can also be accessed from the 14th. This lounge was above average as Marriott's go. Good space and a good spread. Breakfast had the standard fruit, pastries / breads and cereal fare that you find at all lounges, but also had hot trays of eggs, bacon and sausages. In the evenings there was a hot appetizer early along with crackers and cheese as well as cookies later in the evening. Sodas are free and there was a stocked cash bar. Getting lounge access was pretty difficult and it was obvious that the front desk staff was trained to be pretty strong about limiting access. Even after my 4th week in a row I couldn't get in. Finally, I was checked in by the assistant manager one evening who helped me with the remainder of my stays until I hit Gold status in the Marriott Rewards program. Across the street is the mall (what else would you expect for the Valley?) There is an AMC movie theater and a couple of chain restaurants (P.F. Chang's and the type.) It's all within walking distance, so that's nice. So overall, an adequate Marriott for the business traveler. I had no major problems during my stays, but also never had them go the extra mile to do anything particularly special. In other words another middle-of-the-road Marriott from the chain that owns \"middle-of-the-road\".

Room at Loews was twice the price and had a connecting (locked) door to the room next to us. We heard EVERYTHING, including showering and loud conversation at 5 a.m.!! Management did not offer anything other than another room at same exorbitant price after losing two nights' sleep!! Went back to Marriott for last night, even though it was a big hassle to pack and move. Should have stayed for entire week at Marriott!!!", "Date": "April 27, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Service, Great Staff\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR994566", "Content": "Stayed here for the week, everyone from the bellman, to the front desk staff, to the people in the restaurant were incredibly helpful and friendly.

Having recently purchased some points in the new Vacation Club program, we decided to stop by Maui on the way to our Kauai week to see what this resort (which is rated higher and costs more than our Kauai location) was like. Sad to say, we were disappointed. Starting with the \"good\" news. the accommodations (like those in the Kauai Beach Club) consist of two adjacent former hotel rooms, one fitted out as a bedroom and the other containing a limited kitchen facility with a sink, fridge and microwave but no range. The rooms were nice enough and in generally good shape. Not much difference here. The people on the reception desk and in the drive-up areas were friendly and helpful. We had a very nice chat with, and got some useful information from, the young lady who signed us up for the obligatory sales tour. The common areas, however, were depressing. Most of the shop spaces were empty and those that were occupied were unappealing both visually and in terms of content. They are located in a long atrium area that extends back from the reception desk and looks (and largely is) abandoned. If you disregard the actual reception area and the lavish spaces devoted to selling you participations in the Marriott Vacation Club, the common areas were basically a ghost town. Since we had to walk through this area to get to our rooms, we could not avoid it. The pool area is crowded and overgrown with small areas of pool snaking around through the underbrush more or less at random. There is nowhere in the area itself where the view opens out or where it is possible to swim for more than 10 feet in a straight line. In one corner of this jungle is a hokey looking pirate ship, which may be just the thing for 10-year-olds but is not up to the aesthetic standard of a first class resort. Finally, the amenities were pathetic. There is one actual restaurant (Longboards) which is open only for lunch and dinner. We did not eat there but walking by it and looking at the menu did not suggest that there was any good reason to do so. Breakfast facilities consisted of a kind of \"7-11\" type arrangement that you could walk into and buy prepackaged offerings, none of which looked very appetizing. There were two or three really small tables but the ambiance strongly suggested that the best alternative was to take the swill back to the room. Needless to say, we did not eat at the Marriott at all, hiking next door in both directions to the Hyatt Regency and the Westin, both of which were clearly several notches in quality above where we were staying. All in all, we had the feeling of staying at a C- or D-tier property in Las Vegas rather than a four star facility in Hawaii. The notion that this facility is rated more highly than the Kauai Beach Club (which we absolutely love) leads us to conclude that either we or the folks at Marriott are missing several screws. If we thought that this was what we had bought into in investing in the Vacation Club, we would be looking to sell our points for whatever we could get for them. So far, this facility seems aberrational in the Vacation Club portfolio but it makes us nervous for the future.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntsville, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cGreat and Beautiful hotel\u201d", "Author": "Paula H", "ReviewID": "UR126130315", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here with our friends and it's just beautiful, lots of amenities, very nice hotel. a piece of heaven. views were breathe taking.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Celebration Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and Accomodations\u201d", "Author": "Bubba3040", "ReviewID": "UR125853144", "Content": "The location was perfect with walking distance to great restaurants and shopping.

PLUS the ocean is right there! Although it was pretty crowded at times, I never felt like I was squeezed in somewhere. I love the open air feel of the resort. The restaraunts were a little pricey, but we just went grocery shopping instead for meals. I loved that Whaler's Village was just a short walk away.

Great, genuinely friendly staff and good accommodations. My only surprise is that the rooms (at least in the Molokai Tower) still do not have WiFi. There are wired internet cables but if you brought your ipad, you're out of luck unless you head out to the lobby. Honestly, though, I barely consider that to be a big issue when you compare it to the service and quality of views from the ocean front rooms. Sometimes resorts play games with view categories and \"ocean front\" is not exactly \"ocean front.\" Well, in the Molokai tower (one of the older towers, so less of the kitchenette amenities), the ocean front room is right up against the ocean. I've really never been so close to the actual ocean in an ocean front room anywhere and it's amazing, in my opinion. I stayed here under my timeshare privileges so I can't speak to the price. Lots of plumeria trees on the property which gives it that wonderful \"Hawaiian scent\" that wafts all around you.

I know Maui very well so I picked the Marriott for price and location. There are two faces to this resort, one for timeshare members and one for guests like a hotel. There are also different room types. The two older towers serve as the main entrance and surround the super pool. These rooms are typically 1 bedroos and are converted old hotel rooms with kitchenettes. No stove or formal dining area in these but the bedrooms are very spacious and you get two or more bathrooms! The other towers are custom built for timeshares and are 2-3 bedroom with full modern kitchens. Still more The grounds are beautiful along with the pools. Ample number of chairs around the pool or on the lawn. It was especially nice to have some large lawn areas for the kids to run or just play a game. Not many resorts have this much open space. Biggest complaint might be about the dining selections. Forget the marketplace unless you're desperate and don't have anything in the room to eat. Too much money for the food you get. Longboards looked decent and not that expensive for ocean-front dining. My favorite is still Hula's at the Whaler's Shopping Village just a 5 minute walk away. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay. Rooms were comfortable with large lanais. As of December 2011, the rooms had undergone a full interior renovation. We stayed in one of the older rooms but they should all be fully renovated by now!

We stayed in the Molokini tower in a newly refurbished 2-bedroom with oceanfront view for 6 days. I will try to break this review down in parts for easy reading. Location: It cannot be beat if you are staying in West Maui. We went to three different beaches to snorkel and the best snorkel spot was smack in front of our hotel. Just walk out from the pool on the path past the food/area and bam - best snorkel spot for turtles. My husband and friends encountered HUGE turtles (3 to be exact) about 20 ft from the beach. It was amazing. Watch out for early morning surfers! There are not many restaurants at the hotel but we ate at the pool a few times and thought it was good. There are lots of restaurants within walking distance from the hotel (Whaler's Village) or a short car ride away (Front St.). Room: Yes - the new couches and pillows are hard and uncomfortable but were not in Maui to sit on couches but when we used the couches for the pull out beds...oh my, these pull out bed mattresses are far better than what I slept on growing up and are similar to the expensive memory foam type beds. Our room view was amazing. The living room and one of the bedrooms had full ocean view and the 2nd bedroom had a view of the pool and ocean. We spent a lot of time out on the lanai enjoying the view then in the actual room during sunrise and sunset. We did have 3 bathrooms which we utilized to the fullest extent since the water pressure to one of the shower heads in one of the rooms was weak. The bathrooms had plenty of towels and extra towels can be found in the cabinets underneath the sink. The mini-kitchen was okay - wish there was a stove but we got by okay considering we had 4 kids with us. Pool: Plenty of space, variety, hardly packed, fast fun water-slide, lots of hot tubs, and fun for the kids. My small complaint is that they use gravel in the pirate area which wasn't fun to walk on especially for small tender kiddo feet. I suggest that they replace the gravel with sand or take it out all together. Construction/Parking: I saw construction people but did not see the actual construction or hear or was bothered by any of it. I guess we were very lucky. As for parking, I am just happy I wasn't the one driving. The parking spaces were tight...you've been warned. Overall: Huge thumbs up for this resort for families with kids.

When we were checking in, the staff would not allow us to use the luggage carts at the reception (for \"insurance reasons\"). Instead, we had to valet our luggage and then park at the far end of the resort and wait on our luggage to be delivered. This service took a long time, and cost us as well. The 2nd day of our stay, while we were out, a whole slew of items were delivered to our room (cot, blankets, pillows) that were not requested and were likely intended for another guest due to arrive in another room. When I called the front desk to have someone come and remove these items, we waited about 15 minutes for a staff member to arrive. When he did, he asked me if I was sure if I had not asked for these (are you kdding me - do you see a baby in the room?), and then told me it was housekeeping's fault and then proceeded to call housekeeping from our room and tell them to come and get these items. I was ready to put everything out on the floor in the hallway myself at that point. Staying in a 4 star hotel, we expected that while there can be mistakes, that service would have been polished and professional.

The BBQ area is small, crowded and stuck in the back adjacent to the parking garage. The pool for the Lahaina tower is small, and has limited shaded lounges so reserve your spot early! The bigger pool is at the old original timeshare. It too is packed. Lunch is limited to the little takeout spot, no ambiance and just basic eats. There isn't a real nighttime bar long either. This place is huge given the two newer 12 story towers, and the food is limited. Longboards is only open for dinner, and is ok. It seems like all of the good hotel area is taken up by the sales roaches. Trust me....they are trying to sell you timeshare deals, points anything, and constantly. They call you before you arrive, they email you, they welcome packet and call your room. They greet you when you walk down the path. It feels like one big sales effort 24/7. It's a shame because the property is nice. They could use more services like a lunch restaurant, another dinner option, a nice place for a drink etc. But they would have to give up the sales pavillions so I guess that won't happen Lastly, the gym is good...modern bright and clean. Walk down to Tropica or Hula grill for a good dinner. Keep your towel cards, no card no towel.

The rooms are very nicely appointed with a full kitchen, 6 top dining room table, couch, two chairs, etc. There was four of us in a 1 bedroom suite, so we utilized the pull out bed from the couch. As far as pull-outs go, it was pretty good. No huge bars or anything, but it's noisy and not nearly as comfortable as the actual bed - but that is definitely to be expected - so no knocks there!! As nice as the room is, the real luxury is just the ground itself. There are hammocks strewn about all over the property, which seem to get the most use early in the morning. Plenty of lounge chairs to go around too. Didn't have any problems finding places to sit, but we also were off property most of the day exploring Maui. Food at Longboards was fantastic and the live music gave a really great ambiance. Food at the marketplace was ok. Only had one breakfast there and the food came out just warm, not hot. Very simply prepared, but what can you really expect from eggs and bacon?? My only complaint is the beach. It's probably due to the way the breaks hit the beach, but there is virtually no beach to speak of. At most, it was about 5 to 10 feet wide, and the real issue is that to try to get into the water you have to fight massive amounts of rocks. Down where the surf lessons take place they've cleared those rocks away, but why not the rest of the property? Some of the other hotels / timeshares along the same stretch of beach essentially created their own beach areas by putting sand where the Ocean Club has grass & some hammocks. It's a trade off as you are equally close to the water, but at Ocean Club you feel decidedly separate from it despite how close you are. Of course, this is Maui and just a short drive away we were snorkeling and swimming in some of the most spectacular water I've ever seen - but it was disappointing to have such a lack of summable beach at the resort.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Petaluma, CA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful ocean front experience\u201d", "Author": "PetalumaTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR119767122", "Content": "We are owners in the older building and traded through Interval International for one of the newer buildings. We had a very early flight out of Oakland and arrived at the hotel around 11 am. We had requested early check-in, but didn't expect the room to be ready. This is the fifth year in a row we have come here and this is the first time I really have any kind of complaint. The front desk people were a tad unfriendly. When I asked for a \"ball park\" time our room might be ready, we were told it was guaranted for 4:00 pm and they could not give us an earlier estimate. I asked if they could just tell us if housekeeping had started to clean the room and they refused. We went down to Lahaina for breakfast (Lulus) and came back. We got our bathing suits out of our luggage and went to the pool area. I finally called back at 2:30 and got the same robot response of no room guarateed before 4:00 pm. I was getting a bit frustrated and probably exhausted by this time, but they called us back at 3:00 to say the room was ready. And what a room! It was an ocean front on the 4th floor of the Lahaina building. Just spectacular. It was a 2 bedroom that could be a 3 bedroom if you included the lock off. The view was amazing and the room was so worth the wait. We feel like we are coming home when we come here, so it is totally relaxing. We had drinks and fish tacos at the Hyatt and watched the sunset. Drinks at dinner at Leilani's at Whaler's Village. Dinner at Pacifico in Lahaina. (First time there; it was very good). A very pricey lunch at Mama's (what can I say? It was delicious, but too much money). Brunch at the Plantation. Lunch at Cheesburger in Paradise. We love the location of this resort.

There were lots of grills around the pools but you had to go from your room to the grill and remember to take everything with you, so it was not great. The place itself is being updated and I believe that they are installing kitchens in the updated rooms, hopefully this will improve the rooms considerably. Also the furnishings are out dated and worn, the towels are very worn and I hope they are changing these when they update the rooms. I also hope that they address the light switches, they are in some odd places, one near the door, fair enough, but then the one for the main room is hidden behind a pillar close to the lock off door, took some finding that one!!

It's absolutely the lovliest property in the area. Take a walk along the Beach Path - sidewalk - to your left is a Hyatt and to the right, , past a Westin and several others and the Whaler's Village and on to the Sheraton and you'll find Ocean Club has the very best piece of property. 3 pools, the largest one is where more kids go but I had no problem swimming there & loved that I could swim under a couple of bridges and go quite a ways before I had to turn around. Since I went later in the day, after 3pm, I had no problem finding chairs. Everybody working at the Marriott is very nice, always very helpful. We were in the Molokai Tower, where we'd been 3 years ago, and had the same wonderful sunset view. I like sitting on my balcony - we were on the 7th floor - having my coffee in the morning or wine in the evening, watching people walking along the path, or swimming in that pool, or exercising on the lawn, or just enjoying the vast view of the ocean. They were working on complete remodles of the rooms and we were in a brand new place. Unfortunately it still smelled from the new furniture etc., but a couple of nights with the windows open solved that allergy problem. The brand new bed was a bit hard, but that's okay, seeing as how it needs to last a while. Great pillows, soft, feathery for me, an assortment. Not those awful hard ones so many places are going for. Even the mattress in the living room sofa bed was nice and firm. We had friends visit who were staying at another resort and they were very, very impressed with our view. Ditto the view of the pool and ocean as they stepped out of the parking garage. We had a suite. The kitchenette has a mini fridge and microwave plus dishwasher. Coffee maker, dishes and glasses. There were 2 complete bathrooms. Free internet in the room. Bring your computer. To note: parking garage is Free for us time-share owners anyway. Valet was $12.00 a day, which is handy to use the first night. For eating, there's Tropica at the Westin, which we decided was too expensive this time around, but there are 3 restaurants in Whaler's Village. We went to Cane & Taro, as they had a special - on a Wed. evening - if you order before 6pm, it's half price. And my filet mignon was pretty good. And we could see the ocean. Also for breakfast, there's a McDonald's at the Village, as well as a couple of other fast food places. One night we got Chinese take-out. The Marriott has a place where you can get breakfast or lunch take-out, expensive, or sit at a table and look at the ocean. Longboards is dinner where we ate our last night, because we had a $20.00 gift cert. for signing up to listen to a time-share deal. It's not great but it's okay. And you're right on the ocean.

We had a 2 bedroom mountain view apt. The apt was beautiful, a full kitchen, with everything you need to do your own cooking. The furniture was beautiful, the bedrooms comfortable. The spa bath in the master bedroom was wonderful, very relaxing. I used it twice. The only problem was the lanai. It is off the master bedroom and living room. The door from the living room opens out towards the small lanai, making it impossible to enter from the living area. ( a design flaw) We went through the bedroom sliding glass doors to get to the lanai. It had 4 large chairs and a round table. We ate many dinners and breakfasts on this lanai. The lanai furniture is too large for the size of the lanai. Other than that, I can't fault this condo. The second bedroom is a studio lock off, with a smaller lanai, 2 chairs and a small table. There is a pull out sofa bed along with the king bed in this room. 4 family members could sleep here comfortably. The studio has a mini fridge and microwave, dishes, coffee maker. The pool at Napili Towers is small and winding, it is great for the people who have the ground floor rooms. you can step outside and take a dip in the pool. There are a few people who I saw get up at 6:30 am and place towels on 5 loungers to save them for the day. they must be families, as there were many people with young children at the complex. Grandparents, parents, and kids. The Napili pool was a great pool for kids and people who want to soak a bit. We only went in this pool once. The main pool has a kids area, as well as lots of room for everyone. Granted, we were there in September after school started, it was not as crowded at it was when we were there in August a few years ago. (I wouldn't recommend this in the summer, been there, done that, not my cup of tea) We loved the slide in the pool, not crowded, and loads of fun! There are BBQs around the property. We made sure to BBQ at least 4 times while we were there. The staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful. From the front desk to the bartenders. All with amazing aloha spirit. Our 8th night was spent in one of the hotel conversions in the Molokai Tower. We had a remodeled ocean view room. It was also beautiful, with a mini kitchenette, separate bedroom and bath, living area with a dining table and comfortable sleeper sofa! The lanais in this older buildings are designed with more a feeling of spaciousness, running the length of the rooms, both sleeping area and living area.

We loved having a condo with full kitchen, washer and dryer plus lanai. However, we didn't like that we never knew how the condo would look and whether its furnishings, bathroom and kitchen would be up to date. We feel the view, Whaler's Village, and area of the beach in front of the west side of the Marriott and the Ali'i is the best that Maui has to offer. Three years ago while staying at the Ali'i, we saw the new construction of the Napali Tower at Marriott. Our friends who were renting at the Ali'i with us decided to go on the timeshare tour. They loved what they saw. They said that the 2 bedroom units were as nice as any of the Ali'i rooms if not better. The new towers have 2 and 3 bedroom units with a full kitchen, lanai, washer and dryer. Our friends showed us the brochures they got. My husband and I talked after we went home and decided to purchase a 2 bedroom oceanfront timeshare in the Marriott's new towers. We knew we could never afford actually buying a condo in the Alii (don't have $2-3 million just hanging around). But owning a timeshare in the Lahaina/Napali Towers at the Marriott is the next best thing. I know some reviewers (not owners) have complained about costs of ownership, but buying this timeshare is really just pre-paying for your vacation and saving on inflation costs. Maintenance fees could seem high to someone who doesn't visit this island regularly, but a room of the same size with the same amenities usually rents for $600-$900 a day (check rental costs of Ali'i 1 & 2 bedroom oceanfront and Westin timeshare rooms at North Kaanapali, if you don't believe me). When we arrived for our first stay in the Napali Tower, I called our friends and thanked them for all the info they gave us that led to us buying our timeshare. The rooms were great and very up to date. The view is wonderful. You can see and hear the ocean from the room. We found the staff and the pool area to be excellent. We have stayed at this property 3 times and love it. We usually go during summer for each visit and never felt that the property was overflowing with guests. We use the grills at least 3 times per visit and have only had to wait to use them once (20 minutes). We can't wait for our next visit. Having a full kitchen and a place to wash clothes makes the vacation. We can spend the whole day on the beach and come back to the room for lunch. Again one of the best purchases we made. Great property! We are enjoying the Marriott more than the Ali'i. We know that we are guaranteed a great vacation, great room and great treatment by the staff. When we had a problem with our ceiling fan, a technician was there to fix it in 15 minutes. Then the front desk call in 30 minutes to confirm that the fan was fixed. When I asked for extra towels, I got a follow up call to confirm delivery of those too. I noticed that some reviewers don't like the property because they weren't treated like royalty because of their Marriott Rewards status. The majority of people who own at this property are Silver or above in the Marriott Rewards system, so don't expect extra special treatment --the majority of people staying there are just like you. Also, this property has a high occupancy rate, so late check-out or early check-in is usually something they can't offer. Some comment about a lack of a convenience store, I think they just didn't know where to look. There is a gift shop/convenience store on the left when you immediately enter the main lobby. We eat once a stay at Longboard's, Marriott's restaurant, the local food (fresh fish) is as good as any you can get at a restaurant at Whaler's Village.

Average facility and services. Typical timeshare.\u201d", "Author": "PDXStocks", "ReviewID": "UR118455676", "Content": "I cannot think of a nicer more beautiful beach than Kaanapali. A stunning location. The rooms here are furnished with average quality furniture. It's a time share after all. The beds were ok, towels in the rooms were ready to be replaced/thrown away. They were nearly threadbare. Seat cushions on the furniture were overly stiff and hard. It may be to hold up over time with all the overweight people. Whatever the reason, the furniture in the room was incredibly uncomfortable. Amenities in the bathroom were cheap generic, not of normal Marriott hotel quality. And certainly not of the quality of the hotels in the area such as the Hyatt, Sheraton or Westin. We had a two bedroom with living room, spacious, full kitchen and oceanfront balcony. Marriott charges a massive weekly fee for each year of the time share. In this case, two one bedrooms were traded for a two bedroom unit. So for nearly $300 a day just in the timeshare annual owners fee paid to Marriott, what do you get? Don't expect daily maid service, don't expect any bottled water if you're used to hotel programs, but at least a stack of local papers is left in the elevator lobbies. And that doesn't even consider the $70,000 buy in the owners paid for uh...shall we say this privilege. The lobby and public areas are as plain as they come. Cheap cheap cheap. The two largest areas inside the hotel are dedicated to whatelse? Timeshare sales. Isn't that great. These poor midwest boobs that spend thousands of dollars to buy a time share and then pay Marriott in excess of $1000+ dollars annual maintenance fees each year for the smallest and cheapest units, finance the ongoing timeshare sales AND pay for the space they are using to sell more units. That space could easily be used for restaurants, lounge space etc....but no, this place is a timeshare sales machine. As you walk through the property there is booth after booth manned by agents ready and willing to sign you up for yet another tour! In case you miss a booth, the new towers have an agent by the elevators to \"welcome\" you and solicit you for another tour. The pools and lawn areas are the best reason and only reason in my mind to stay here. There are 8 b'bque grills next to the Napili tower where we stayed. Those are in demand and people run down around 4 pm or so and throw towels and books on the chairs at the tables to \"reserve\" the grills. So get there early folks. This property has something like 750 rooms and when full it's crazy. There are signs posted all over the place to not save seats, but no one seems to care and the staff looks the other way. They do the same thing in the morning when people run down, get towels, throw them on all the premium chairs poolside and then come back hours later. Just for kicks I wanted to go collect towels and turn them into the front desk, but I never did it, because it would have been as tacky as the behavior we witnessed. If you want to guarantee yourself a private seat near the beach, rent a cabana for two. $70/day. You'll guarantee yourself space and you can order drinks/food from the staff. The hotel is currently updating the original hotel rooms with a new rededsign. Thankfully, occupancy was low or we would have totally been fighting for pool chairs. As it was, it wasn't pleasant trying to position ourselves when we wanted to lay out, but it would have been chaos had the hotel been full. The property sells a plastic mug for $34.95 that can be refilled over and over again with soda or coffee during your stay. For some this is a great value given what individual drinks cost. We simply kept our soda and cocktails upstairs in the refridgerator and refilled during the day as we saw fit. For four of us, we would have paid $140 to the Marriott for drink mugs and we certainly didn't go through that during our stay by refilling our glasses in the room. And I doubt it takes any longer to ride the elevator up to the room than it takes to walk to the self serve area of the pool. The televisions have an incredible array of stations and music to choose from. Internet is free. Self parking was in limited supply and considering the occupancy with the construction going on, I would hate to be there with full occupancy. We used valet two different days because when we got home in the evening from eating out, the parking was all taken. The workout facility has a lot of machines. It's not fancy, but the machines all work and they're newer. No complaints here. We used it four different days and it was never busy except in the morning. We did not eat on property, because the self serve pool restaurant is like any other cafeteria and their restaurant Longboards, while a decent price point, seemed like any other plain beach cafe you might run into. We would much rather walk down the sidewalk along the beach to Hula's or Leilanis and they both have excellent happy hours. Sonz at the Hyatt is an excellent choice for upscale dining and the Hyatt has a great sushi restaurant also. I'm guessing the Marriott puts no money into their food service at this location because the crowd won't pay for it. They've already paid thosands in buy in fees that they will never be able to recoup (just check out the timeshare resale market) and they also annual pay fees of at least $150 PER day or more just to keep their unit...and as I said before that doesn't even buy you daily maid service. Marriott has one of the best things going ever with timeshares. They guarantee themselves 100% occupancy once a project is sold out with phenomenal yearly revenue and lesser services and lower quality surroundings than are provided in competing hotel properties. If you're taking a dozen people with you and don't care about average quality, this might be a great place, but for two or four people, we didn't think the value was anywhere near what it ought to be.

We were told they would \"rush\" our room, and took my cell # to call when the room was ready. Check-in time is at 4, and I received a call at 3:55 saying our room was ready. Wow, thanks for expediting that. Hard to believe that with a 10am check out time, they didn't have a single room available before 4? I'm not used to that happening. The room itself is ok. It's a huge property, so tons of walking to get anywhere. The room was clean. I hated the shower. The shower head is mounted so high that by the time the water hit me, it wasn't strong enough to really get the shampoo out of my hair easily. I had to stay in the shower forever as the water dribbled over me. There was no way to adjust the spray. I was also very disappointed by the hot tub at the Napili tower. Maybe I should call it a lukewarm tub, because we went in at 9pm (we were told hot tubs are open till 11), and it was not hot at all. I was actually shivering in there. What a letdown. And lastly, the lobby is pretty disappointing. Hardly any shops? Not even a convenience store. There is a little shop all the way down by the pool that sells snacks and drinks, but they close at 7. No little shop with magazines, toiletries, snacks and drinks in the main lobby. Weird.

What we liked: the size of the bedroom & bathrooms, the separate living space with mini-kitchen (I mean MINI - just a small sink, coffee maker, toaster, dishwasher, utensils - but definitely enough to do prep and make breakfast/lunch -- no stove) and two balconies, the multiple pool areas and the multiple BBQs which we made great use of. The rooms were clean, the furniture look high-end. There's nothing like BBQing some fresh fish and then eating it on your balcony with those amazing views. What could have been better: I'm not sure why the unit had 2 bathrooms -- really odd. I would rather have had a full kitchen and it would make more sense. My husband thought they may have a problem with drainage lines for a real sink with disposal, so that may have been the issue there.

Watched the sunset at Black Rock. It was a great vacation. The hotel location, their programs, the facility and staff was ideal. How perfect is it to have the kids swimming near by, husband grilling dinner and I'm on the hammock reading a book. Then have dinner while watching the sunset. We will be back Marriott.

The rates were steeper than what we paid even for a 1 bedroom at the Trump tower in Waikiki but the contrast was stark. Having never been to Maui before, we didn't realise that this part of Maui is purely resorts - think 8 story high strip of resorts and nothing else but excluding the atmosphere that such an environment conjures up in Waikiki. So that part was my fault for not doing enough research on the area and I want to warn others. If you're after some beautiful beaches and to steer clear of Timeshare sales people and masses of holiday makers conjuring around pools and average restaurants, stay away from K'aanapali beach and the towns just north of there. Instead, head to the north side and stay somewhere along the road to Hana or alternatively, if you want seriously upmarket, around Waimea is nice (in a Truman show kind of way). About the Marriott though - the pool is great and had a fantastic pirate ship with slides for our 3 year old as well as a larger slide and lots of room for the masses of people so you never felt too crowded in. The room however was terrible. For that much money I expect something better than old green carpet and horrid furniture. There was a side view of the beach (apparently a 'full beach view') from the bedroom and it was perfectly clean but all in all, not somewhere that I'd recommend. The staff were however very helpful (excluding the guy who was part of the 'welcome pack' committee who didn't seem to have the time to tell me anything about local activities, the area or directions). All in all, happy with the service and the pool, disappointed with the room and the resort area.

Not enough. 4) there are no lounge chairs on the beach.

First let me say I love the Marriott PROPERTIES and the services I receive while on them; HOWEVER, the new point system (a spin off company piggybacking on Marriott's name), while claiming to be better has NOT endeared me and with my conversion of points, showed me the LACK of customer care that the old program was famous for. Let me give you my story. I own 5 properties, 3 in Maui, 1 in Ko'Olina, and 1 in MountainSide Park City. I love Maui. Ko'Olina is for trading and Mountainside, well let's just say this is the property that cost my loyalty, as I have never been able to use the system the way it was intended to get to stay there. I have had to buy my way in, scream, or complain and beg to get a any time for skiing and I own the ski weeks. So here is the point. Marriott decided on the point values. They assigned to me 12875 points (125 shy of the Premium Elite Status and its advantages). After much talk, and pleading I was denied the rights to buy 125 points, BUT was told for a mere $20,200 additional dollars I could buy into the new system and get 2000 points in the new system thereby allowing me the advantages of the new system (i.e. 13 months reservations and access to the new up and coming properties). My 15 years of loyalty to the Marriott Hotel system (Platinum Elite) and 5 properties was LOST all over this requirement to spend $20,000 MORE. From what I read above, many of you have similar issues where your were told you had to BUY MORE to get equivalent status and access to NEW programs and property. How sad! This is a spin off company that does not Understand about the loyalty that the Marriott HOTEL SYSTEM is famous for. I will always love Marriott PROPERTIES (still owned by Marriott) but have no love for the MVC spin off company. I STRONGLY urge you to study your situation before investing more in this spin off program. I may be wrong in my perception and am open to them talk again but after three appeals I am the end of my patience. I will continue to voice my opinion of the issues on all sites and try to get Marriott to intervene and understand how many of us feel but until then, I recommend you not give in and BUY more.

There are three pool areas, with the center area being reasonably large and complete. The smaller pool areas are on either side of the resort, and are also nice and a little less crowded. We were in an older building (there are older buildings and newer buildings on the resort), but it was still a very modern and well appointed room. I can imagine the newer buildings are even more spectacular. The pool bar was very good with great staff, but the two restaurants were mediocre at best. That said, there are lots of great restaurants a short walk up the beach. At Whalers Cove, we liked Cane and Taro. Parking is good, and at $8 a night, a Ka'anapali bargain. It is a timeshare property that you can rent (we did), and you do get a voice message to ask you if you want a timeshare presentation. We politely declined, and they didn't ask again. The resort staff are very nice, very professional, and are a real treat. I don't know how they maintain their calm, with these jerks they have to deal with as guests - but they keep smiling and doing their jobs. Some examples - as with any hotel, there are not enough pool chairs for everyone in the hotel at the same time - so they have signs posted indicating that if a chair is reserved with a towel and unoccupied for 90 minutes, they remove the towels and open up the chairs for other guests. We were sitting in some chairs at the pool for some time, and someone came up to us and told us that we were in his chairs - he had reserved them some four hours earlier (when we sat in them, they were clear of towels). A pool worker stepped in, and dealt with him, but he still huffed and puffed at the hotel worker, and then came back to stand over \"his chairs\" for the next hour, but eventually gave up when we didn't move. I thought that this guest was just a \"one-off\" until I saw similar confrontations a few more times over the next few days. We had our children's shovels stolen off the beach. We had our Marriott beach bag (a nice welcome gift) stolen from the laundry room. Some \"guests\" kinda made you feel like you weren't in a nice resort, but more so a cheap motel. We mentioned this to a Marriott staff member, and he replaced the beach bag, apologized for the minor thefts and for the beach chair issue, but did say that it is challenging as some of the guests are very difficult when it comes to their rights to own those beach chairs. So, in short, a great place, great staff, but try to go when there are not too many \"guests\" to ruin the experience for you.

The resort property is nicely landscaped with lots of pools and a cool \"shipwreck\" pool for kids but you hardly noticed the kids and the noise was minimal, which was great. I love kids, but sometimes all of the kids' club activities and music can make noise a nightmare at the beach and pool, especially at Caribbean properties. (although, maybe there were just fewer kids since they might have all left the resort on Jan. 2 and 3 to go back to school). Anyway, the staff were very helpful and friendly, free laundry is available if in a studio unit (but you need to buy the detergent) and the property has a beach walk that provides access to neighboring properties for outside-the-resort dining like the Westin (good dining) and Whaler's Village. It's also within walking distance to the Ka'anapali golf courses (Kai and Royal). It is a decent ride from the airport and a cab will coast about $80-100 but a company called SpeedyShuttle will take you in a rideshare van for about $55. The outside hallway carpeting in the older, Molokai tower needs to be replaced but the rooms are great, so it wasn't really a drawback from enjoying the resort. The beach has some rocky sections in the water but if you walk along the shore, you will find that there are some areas where there aren't any rocks in the water and you can float around nicely. During whale season, you can view a lot of whale activity from all over the resort. The beachside cabana massages were great and Emiko was a fantastic masseuse! The on-site restaurant, Longboards, was pretty good for a reasonable price (although, living in NYC, I am used to paying a lot so maybe it would seem less-reasonable to others). They made a shockingly good Mai Tai at Longboards as well. The internet reception in our room was really bad, though. Apparently they have plug-in internet in the 1-bedroom suites but the studio suites rely on a weak wireless signal. I had to go out to the reception to really get any usable wireless signal.

We definitely think that our stay at the Marriott Maui Ocean Club had a lot to do with it. We had an oceanfront villa in the Lahaina Towers and it was absolutely amazing. There is a full kitchen, large dining room table, living room with flat screen TV and pull out couch, patio facing the ocean, bedroom that opens onto the patio, Jacuzzi tub, full bathroom and extra sink, and washer/dryer. The villa was very big and spacious, much more than I was expecting. Our bedroom/view was literally less than 200 feet from the ocean. The bed was really comfortable and we loved falling asleep to the sound of the waves crashing outside. It is amazing how beautiful the sunrises are right outside your window, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss them! There were a few things I was concerned about based on other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reviews, such as people reserving chairs and the parking being really far away. Both of these were non-issues for us. There are signs that say not to reserve chairs with towels and this was never a problem for us, although we mostly lounged at the pool/grass area outside the Lahaina towers which was never too crowded (then again, we do believe we visited in the off-season, or low tourist season). As for the parking, we were going to do valet everyday based on other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reviews. However, the parking structure is literally adjacent to the Lahaina towers where we were staying so we just self-parked. It would have been more inconvenient to valet park because we would have had to walk all the way back to the front desk. But anyway, yes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true, the parking structure does get filled up all the way at night and you will probably have to park at the top. The only bad experience I had was with a towel attendant who had an attitude and closed his station early and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exchange my towels for me. Kind of an jerk, yes, but I reported him to the front desk. The hotel property itself is amazing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c everything really is at your fingertips! The Marriott Resort shares the same beachline with a number of other hotels such as the Hyatt Regency, Westin, etc. and you can walk to all these hotels really easily along the Kaanapali Beach Walk. You can swim and snorkel right out in front of the Marriott, but the best snorkeling on Kaanapali is Black Rock \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we saw so many fish, manorays, and turtles! We were shocked to see so much right outside our hotel. There is also Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village, an outdoor shopping mall which has a lot of the stores located on Front Street in Lahaina. We went shopping on Front Street one night, but went back to Whalers Village to pick up anything else we needed. It was also nice how convenient the pool, lounge chairs, and towels were. We would leave the property in the morning and come back around 3pm or 4pm, and it was nice just to lounge for those remaining few hours of daylight, not to mention easy and effortless.

Every year, we invite family and friends to join us...sharing our little piece of paradise. Every year, it just gets better. Whether you are staying in the original or newer towers, there are benefits to both. Newer Towers: (Lahaina or Napili) have beautiful full kitchens with granite counter tops, stainless, full-size appliances and stacked washer and dryer. The kitchen is fully stocked with plates, silverware, bakeware, cooking utensils, serving and storage containers, blender, toaster, coffee-maker, plus hand towels, potholders, paper towels, dishwashing soap, liquid dish soap, and new cleaning sponges. If you have a 2 bedroom unit, the additional (lock-out) bedroom also has its own kitchenette area with a small fridge, microwave, sink, dishware, utensils and more. This makes a perfect \"private\" room for guests to have their own snacks and drinks handy any time of the day or night. The kitchen, dining room (table seats 6 comfortably) and living room areas look out a full-wall window of breathtaking views. Ceiling fans in each room, a large jacuzzi tub plus two separate sink \"rooms\" in the master bedroom suite, and table and chairs on the lanai (balcony) complete these bright and cheery, tropical vacation homes. Original towers (Molokai or Lanai): The original towers have the benefit of 3 full baths in a 2 bedroom unit that sleeps 8 (2 full baths are in a 1 BR unit that sleeps 4) and a full-length, large lanai -- especially in units from the 4th floor and below. The main living/dining area is very spacious. The full-wall kitchenette has a dishwasher, microwave, small fridge, toaster, coffeemaker, blender and the necessary eating, serving and food storage supplies. The above (newer tower) cleaning products are also included. Large, stainless barbeque grills are located throughout the property to cook lunches/dinners and save vacation dollars. Stop at Costco as you leave the Kahului (OGG) airport, or drop in Safeway just down the road, to pick up seafood, pork chops, chicken, steaks, veggies and fruits (grilled, carmelized pineapple is the best). Hint: a small roll of aluminim foil is a must to line, wrap & grill everything from veggies and fruit to pizzas! If you are in the original towers, you still have free laundry facilities. The Marriott has converted the pay laundry area into free use of washers and dryers. Grab a lounge chair near the pool area closest to the lobby (near waterfalls, koi, giant pool slide area) and it is easy to check on your laundry while enjoying the sun and fun. ALL Towers: Give you access to one of the largest, most awesome pool areas in all of Hawaii, literally, steps from the beach. Free, high speed internet. The new, large fitness area has the latest exercise equipment. The famous Ka'anapali Beach Walk (sidewalk) runs through the property up to Whaler's Village for upscale to fun shopping (even an ABC store) and restaurants from the new Cane & Taro (great early bird 50% off dinner specials), the sand-\"floor\" Hula Grill to McDonald's. Continue up the Beach Walk to a snorkler's dream, the historic Black Rock, where a torch-lighting and cliff dive take place just before sunset each day. A Car: A must on Maui unless you want to shuttle from the airport and stay in the Ka'anapali/Lahaina area during your visit. There is so much to see and do on Maui; a lifetime of visits would never cover all Maui has to offer. Winter Stays (the best: Jan. - March): Our favorite, when the whales are there! From your room or even the pool/beach area, watch Mama whales teach their new baby calves how to breach, pectoral fin-slap, spy-hop, fluke (tail) dive and slap. Awesome!

We got on the waitlist through Interval in August 2009 and were confirmed in March and April 2010. We were both celebrating our 40th wedding anniversaries. We were at the pool each day right near the walkway that runs from Black Rock to the Hyatt. This way we could try out the ocean and the pool. The pool was fun and better than the ocean, but water gets warm from the sun. The ocean in cooler but the rocks and the undertow can be challenging. Snorkeling at Black Rock was the best and only a 10 minute walk. Saw a turtle and lots of tropical fish. Go out around the rocks for best sights. We tried other locations, but the weather was cloudy and the sea was too rough. Best time to snorkle is in the morning. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Concierge staff is execellent. You can call aheard and make all kinds of reservations. We reserved a private car for the Road to Hana and had a great guide/driver. Well worth the extra money. Also saw Warren and Annebelle show. Never laughed so much and so hard. Eat at Longboards. Expensive but very good. Try the appetizers. Service staff needs more experience. Units were tired and worn. Our unit has a strong bug-spray smell when we arrived. Also, the dressers draws smelled musty. We accepted it. When the little red bugs showed up on Tuesday around the kitchen counter and bath room sink my wife had a meltdown. We asked for a new unit.

It was my finance, mother and friend of the family. This was a great time of year to go. It was not crowded but still \"Happening.\" It was not overloaded with children. The service was fast and convienent. The weather was absolutly gorgeous, mid-high 80's, no rain, and perfect breeze. It was never to hot or cold. The rooms were immaculate. We stayed in the one room guest suite, which was a little tight for 4 people with only one king size bed and a pull out couch and no kitchen. Which made eating difficult. The grills were always available in the evening most of the time with a short wait (10-20 mins max) as you had to share with other guests. My favorite part was having access to the beach walk and walking any store, restaraunt or beach we wanted, or whalers village. It was a nice feeling knowing we never had to leave the resort. It litterally had everything we needed, besides a grocery store. There was gift shops, beaches pools, restaurants for breakfast lunch and dinner, shopping, snorkeling, surfing, grilling, shaved ice, ice cream cones, waterfalls. The only downfall of the stay was pricing. It was extremely expensive. Food, snacks, gifts, entertainment, it seemed like everything was overpriced!! It felt like we were being ripped off because we'd go into town and get something for way cheaper. Honestly, that would not stop us from staying there though. The resort was just absolutly beautiful. We didn't get board for the whole week were there because there was so much to do. I would recommend going at this time of year (september) because that is when the resort is least crowded and the weather is the best. Another plus about the location on the island is that it is located on least windy side and it is almost always sunny and warm as opposed to other sides that see more wind and moisture.

We are not owners there but decided to rent someone else's timeshare week and are so glad that we did. We absolutely loved this property and location! We stayed in the Lanai tower, 9th floor, 2 bedroom ocean view, and the view is truly remarkable. We overlooked the gorgeous pool and grounds, out over the pacific ocean and over to the Island of Lanai. I would say pay no attention to some of the ridiculous negative reviews on here, I can honestly say I have no idea where they are coming from. All I can say is perhaps those that are leaving poor reviews are expecting to receive Four Seasons or Ritz-Carlton luxury while staying at a Marriott. Also, remember this property was a hotel (now a timeshare resort) that was originally opened in December of 1981! Of course there have been numerous renovations over the years, but nevertheless still sometimes shows it age. Couple that with the intense tropical heat and humidity and properties tend to age faster than in other locations. So when I noticed some paint coming off of the bottom of the bathroom door, did I really care? Heck no, it's Hawaii, and things like that will happen in the tropics. What I DID notice was how nicely the rooms have been renovated with nice furniture and large flatscreen TV's in all rooms, though seriously if you come to Maui to sit in your room and watch TV then you are probably destined to write a poor review. You just have to know what to expect, again this is a Marriott, not a Four Seasons, but we couldn't have been happier with our stay. The Staff was very friendly and any request we had was quickly addressed and take care of. On property we ate at Longboards twice and liked it very much, and two times we ordered dinner to go from Beachwalk and ate in our rooms (after long days of driving around Maui, Road to Hana :). The grilled Mahi Mahi with fried rice and vegatables from Beachwalk was actually very good for the money, recommended. Otherwise, like probably so many others we made the stop at Costco (literally right next to the airport) and at the Lahaina safeway and had breakfast and lunches in our rooms. While the older Ocean Club doesn't have a \"full\" kitchen (like the newer Lahaina and Napili Towers), we found the kitchen adequate and really would have never used a stove anyway. The microwave, coffee maker, toaster, blender, refrigerator, sink and dishwasher was more than adequate for our needs. Only complaint I might have, and this is probably a complaint about resorts in general and not specific to Marriott or the Ocean Club, is the pool chair situation. It seems it is becoming customary at resorts now that many people are placing their towels and a book or magazine on pool chairs at 6:30 a.m. because they might want to come back and use it at 1 or 2 pm. This is a joke and needs to be addressed at all resort properties not just at Marriott Ocean Club. Luckily, we were there in September low season (kids back in school) so finding decent poolside chairs wasn't too big of a problem, but I can only imagine what it's like in the high summer or winter season. Plenty of times we saw four chairs in a row with a towel and book on each one with absolutely no activity for hours. Marriott, and all resorts for that matter, need to do a better job with this situation. But really this was a minor complaint for us since we were always able to find chairs no problem, and with a 16-month old, we could only use the pool for and hour or so at a time anyway before nap times and feedings so it worked out for us just fine. Other nice amenities included free laundry machines (so you don't have to pack as much clothes, and very nice when traveling with toddlers), unlimited use of beach towels (each person gets a towel card which can be traded for two towels which you can return and get fresh dry towels whenever you want.), plenty of gas BBQ grills (we didn't use but saw plenty of people using them and enjoying it), free ample parking in 12-story garage next to Lanai tower. We spent much of our time OUT of the room either by the pool, the beach, snorkeling at Black Rock or Napili Point, driving around the entire West side of Maui, or driving to Hana and back, or walking around Lahaina or Whalers Village.

I dropped off my family and any bags we had and then went and parked.

Every morning we would go snorkling down by the Black Rocks. I've snorkled in a few different places in Maui, even Molokini, and this is one of the best places. I even cancelled a snorkel trip to see the turtles, because we could see all we wanted at the rocks. We swam with 3 different turtles, stingrays, and plenty of fish almost every day. The beach is nice, but a little rocky once in the water. It gets better if you walk down towards Whalers Village to swim. We are somewhat conservative spenders so we bought most of our food at Safeway in Lahaina, and just ate dinners out in Lahaina or Whalers Village. I did order the Moonfish from Longboards one night to go and it was expensive but great. We rented our snorkeling gear from a local place which was much cheaper for the week, bought inexpensive boogie boards at Safeway and gave them away when we left, and went to a timeshare presentation to get free tickets to a show and it was the lowest pressured presentation I've ever sat through and only took about 45 minutes. To keep it real, the only things I didn't care for were that you have to pay for internet service in their computer room (unless you brought something with wireless), and that you have to rent beach chairs, boogie boards, etc. Just seems like they nickel and dime you a little bit with all the small stuff.

The Napili Tower has all those appliances, plus easier and nicer entrances. The beds are very comfortable and the units are spacious, although not as spacious as in the older MOC. We were hoping that the pool in front of the Napili Tower would be more quiet with less kids as in the main pool, but not such luck. The jacuzzi was always filled with splashing kids, it was not very inviting. Luckily, the lawn area between the pool and beach was ideal for reading and napping, a place to catch some peace and quiet. There was quite a bit of sand in the Napili Pool because the rinse off showers were placed in the far corners of the pool, people didn't want to bother walking that far, so in they went from sandy beach into pool. Someone didn't plan the showers very well. There should be one at each entrance, at least a foot rinse. Back to the unit - 2 small balconies with heavy iron furniture. 2 chairs and small table on 1balcony, the 2nd one barely fit 4 chairs and a eating table. It was a struggle to open the door and squeeze around, we ended up using the slider from the bedroom rather than the door which swung open the wrong way from the living room. The outdoor furniture is way too heavy, hard and too large for the size of the balcony. Cold to sit on too. We ended up taking the living sofa pillows and putting them on the chairs for comfort. Again that wasn't thought out well. Should have just stuck with the same MOC balcony furniture. But the worst is the parking situation for Napili Tower guests. Extremely limited because it is mostly used by valets. The design is poor as well, once you're in, there's no way out except backing out. The parking structure over at the Lahaina Towers is a hike, was totally unacceptable. Self parking is complimentary for owners, but valet isn't until we complained and ended up getting comped for the valet as well. At least they acknowledged the problem and accommodated us. There is also little, if no control of who does park in the 2 story structure, even people that use the beach. No parking sticker, no gate, anyone can basically park there. There are a few other annoyances with the units at the Napili Towers, but we learned to live with them for a week. And yes, people put their towels on the chairs by 6:30-7am and didn't use them for hours. No staff member came by to control the towel reserving of chairs which is something that they could have done a better job of. Housekeeping came in for the 'mid-week tidy' even though we had paid for a full clean. Apparently wasn't on their sheet. If we hadn't been in the unit at the time to be able to ask the maid, we probably wouldn't have gotten it yet paid for it. Came back again the following day for a full clean even though we only had 2 nights left. Other than that, we love the location and enjoy Maui. Especially Mama's Fish House, watching the windsurfers, the Slackkey concert at Naplili Kai, Cirque Polynesia was entertaining, snorkeling at Honolua Bay, Slaughterhouse and N. Kaanapali Beach, breakfast and lunch at the Sea House and the casual, right off the beach, Castaways. The drive up to Julia's Banana Bread stand in Kahakuloa was quite the white knuckle experience, worth every scary mile. Kids even hiked down to the Olivine Pools for a swim , but not good if wearing flimsy flips.

Then there's the part we stayed in - the \"conversion\" hotel, which is a purchased hotel that Marriott did a very poor job of semi-renovating. We ended up in this part by accident using the awful Interval International exchange company to book the trip where they stated it was equivalent to the normal MVC properties. The grounds themselves are beautiful, the pools are great and the staff is friendly. The beach is not \"all that\". Its rather small, about 15-30 feet of it before hitting the water, then lots of rocks. To get to a decent beach is a good hike either north or south of the hotel. When you stay here, you are paying a premium for the location and the facilities, but the rooms are far overpriced for what they are. About the rooms in the conversion hotel: upon checkin there were ants in our bathroom. Then the tub drains were clogged with human hair and other gunk - disgusting. Stains on the furniture and carpets. The manager moved us to another room. The frig was in poor condition, wouldn't keep our stuff cold enough - the engineer said \"that's just how it is\". Eventually got a brand new frig in the room and it worked properly. Onsite dining is the same mediocrity I've come to expect from a MVC property. Every meal is about $50-$75. We ate poolside, it was decent. \"Longboards\" is their high-end restaurant, overpriced and underwhelming. One meal for example, the Opa with coconut lime sauce was great, but my wife's beef was way overcooked, my son's Grilled cheese was burned and my daughter's burger came out fine. There are plenty of great places to eat in nearby Lahaina and having a frig helps with the high-priced breakfast and lunches. The grills were almost always in use. To sum it up - great location near Lahaina, lots of nearby activities, terrific facilities, friendly staff and dumpy hotel rooms in the conversion part (only book the newer towers).

We could not have been happier with our stay at the Marriott Maui Ocean Club. The place in terrific in all aspects; the pool is unbelievable, the grounds are immaculate, and the people who work there are very friendly and helpful. Our room was very clean and super big, way to big for only 4 people, we could easily have 6 or 8 people in the room. The hotel was very attentive to your needs, if you called down for anything they were knocking on your door within 10 minutes. The pool area is really great, it has waterfalls, volleyball, a basketball hoop and slides, lots of fun for people of all ages. The pool is only about 30 yards from the ocean so you have ocean view from most of the lounge chairs. There is also excellent bar and food service at the pool area, someone came by frequently to see if you needed anything. Right next to the pool is the pool bar which had afternoon happy hour specials. Between the pool and the ocean was a nice walking path that winds its way along the ocean in front of all the hotels. About a 5 minute walk down the path is Whalers village which is a great place for shopping, eating, and drinking, it has quite a few outdoor bars and restaurants. They have several outdoor grills which are very popular but not difficult to get. We cooked out 3 nights and it worked out great. By the way, the grills are spotless as they must clean them everyday. We rented an ocean front cabana for $40 and it was worth every penny, we had a great time as the other people we were with rented them the same day so we had four in a row. Couple of other things: Plenty of free parking, free high speed internet thoughout the hotel and pool area, and a great fitness center. Overall we had a great time and would stay there in again. The only negative thing I would say is that it is difficult to get a lounge chair if you are not an early riser. You need to be down at the pool by 5:45am to get the best locations, 6:30am will get you good locations, generally if you're not down by say 8:15 your pretty much out of luck.", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central coast of California", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful grounds/excellent service!\u201d", "Author": "firsttimerstomaui", "ReviewID": "UR71145056", "Content": "We recently returned from a week at the Marriott Ocean Club.

Super pool was excellent and my 6 & 9 y.o. daughters loved it. Pool lounges were nearly impossible to find, however. Guests were saving lounges with towels by 6 a.m. and I am not exaggerating in any way! This was frustrating, since hotel staff did not remove unattended belonging, though they were clearly not being used for hours at a time. Chairs became available around 4pm. Beach/snorkeling directly in front of hotel was okay, though water is very shallow over reef. Just next door, in front of the Alii Resort, is an excellent sandy-bottom beach with calm waters that my kids loved. On-site Longboards' restaurant was excellent, as was the service. Pool service was acceptable, though the bartender had about as much personality as a wet sock. Maybe he was having a bad week?? Self-parking was easy, but a moderate walk from the rooms. Grounds and buildings are immaculate. We used the grills to bbq and noticed they were cleaned every morning by staff. Beachwalk Market was over-priced and had limited selection, so we shopped at Safeway at Cannery Mall. Weekly activities were numerous, but we did our own thing. Overall, an excellent property and we would stay again. Our trip was July 3-10 and the only thing I would change is not to stay on the 4th.

I am currently staying at the Marriott Ocean Club in Maui and it hurts me to say that this facility is not keeping up with other Marriott properties and certainly not with the competition. Let me give you a few examples: 1. Peeling on the ceiling of the guest room 2. Bathroom doors that are warping and peeling 3. Couches that are stained and gray from too much wear. According to Trip Advisor, this ranks #6 in Lahaina...I'm quite frankly surprised, as there's a number of properties nearby that are superior. Also, what's with Marriott not taking any accountability for putting us in room without a full Kitchen, as we had booked and paid for. Essentially, they told us, there's nothing they can do about it. Also, be aware of the neighboring property that puts on a loud concert 5 nights a week. If you want a restful, relaxing vacation, think twice as you get loud music and drums booming across the entire property. Okay, it typically goes until 9:00PM, but still, I come on vacation to relax, not to get stressed out by loud music events next door. Especially when you arrive from the US mainland, where your bodyclock is 3-6 hours behind Hawaii time; 9:00PM local time is midnight-3:00AM for most folks from the mainland. All in all, we've had much better stays elsewhere. While it has a great view of the ocean, we expect alot more from Marriott. They're really dropping the ball.

The employees were very, very nice. The clothing shop operaters were great too, except for the snack shop in the lobby - she was a little grumpy every time I was in there.

On a downer note, the lady at the concierge desk was a little snobby and short tempered when we asked about activities. We got some amazing time share deal which included taking a time share presentation. The morning of our presentation the dishwasher/sink flooded while we were out and soaked the entire counter where some groceries were, kitchenette, and a few feet of carpet in the main area. We came back to the room to get ready for the presentation and saw the huge wet mess. We called the front desk and asked if we could cancel the presentation, the front desk said we could.

We researched hotels for months and found a good rate of $275 night at this location if we PRE-PAYED IN FULL. We were told there were NO CHANGES or cancellations allowed with this rate. We agreed and pre-payed over $2,000 in July. When we checked-in I verified that this was a pre-payed room and they agreed. However, they wanted my Visa for any incidental room charges. This is standard practice, so I agreed. We had a nice stay. Great location, but the air conditioning did not work in our room so we were a little hot all week. However, when we checked out... we were informed that they were charging us an addtional $2,000 because we had stayed in a room with an \"upgraded view\" that cost over $500 per night (not the $275 room we had already pre-payed for). Why would they change a pre-payed rate that didn't allow changes? We had no idea we were in an upgraded room, did not ask for the upgrade, nor did we authorize an upgrade. And now Visa says we can't dispute the charge because we did stay in the room and the burden of proof is on us to prove we didn't ask for an upgrade! How can you prove that? The Marriott does not have to provide our signature or a recording of our voice authorizing the upgrade (of which they have neither). Basically, Maui Marriott is a time-share (sales driven) business. They can upgrade anyone at any time without authority (and the salesperson probably gets merit pay for these upgrades) because they know you can't prove that you didn't ask for it! RIP OFF! Everyone we've encountered at the Marriott corporation who we've contacted to resolve this matter has been horribly rude and unhelpful. Please, if you choose to stay here, watch your wallet closely and document everything. Also, read all of the MANY emails Marriott will send you confirming your reservation.

Was in the new towers for 2 days - they are beautiful! The bedrooms are smaller but you get a lot of space in the living area. Must have hit it at the perfect time, there were no crowds at the pool, beach or anywhere. The super pool is out of this world. The other two pools are very nice also. So close to the ocean and the beach was very soft. There are lots of rocks so bring the surf shoes. Walk about 1/2 mile to the Sherton and you almost sure to see see turtles. That was amazing! Can borrow sand toys and some floats from the kids club. We left ours there when we left so others could use them, there seems to be plenty. The staff and resort couldn't be better. Highly recommend. Old Lahania has lots of places to eat, get off the main drag a few blocks to find more price friendly ones. Penne Pasta has the most amazing meatballs and very well priced. What we did... The Maui Tropical Plantation is definitely the one to go to with kids. The hike at the Ioa State Park a few miles past it is a wonderful! Waterfalls, paved path, rocks to climb, beautiful. Haleakala was wonderful also, we went up for sunrise and hiked for a while - take jackets. Road to Hana is quite a trek. We did it but you have to be really committed to it if you take kids. They definitely get board. The walking tour offered free from the property was a little interesting - would do it if just adults, with young kids would skip it. Royal Lahaina Luau I think is the one for people with families. The kids are free with a paying adult. The show is showy and corny at times but the dancers are great and keep everyone's attention. Having kids food (hots, chicken nuggets, mac and cheese) is a god send to those with picky eaters. My son and daughter still talk about the fire dancers, which hardly any of the others had.

This room would be considered an ocean view almost anywhere. The Lahaina tower is just a few years old and it is really beautiful. It has a full kitchen, so we ate our breakfast and lunch in almost every day, and we had dinner in a few nights also. It's also nice to have a washer/dryer in the room. Very convenient. The beds are very comfortable and it was very quiet at night. This was our third stay at the Ocean Club, but the first time in a new tower. We love this property because of it's location. We drive there for about a half hour from the airport and then hardly use the car. My husband golfed twice at the Kaanapali golf course. I would go down to the Lahaina Cannery Mall for coffee in the a.m. or to Safeway for food. Other than a trip to Kapalu to the Plantation House for brunch, we did not use the car. You can walk to Whaler's Village for dining and shopping (there is a great ABC store there). We love Lelaini's and the Hula Grill. Both have fun bars and good food. We did go into Lahaina one night and ate at the Lahaina Girll. Excellent food, but very pricey. The best part of this property to us, is the location. We have been to Maui six times now and just want to go and relax. This place is perfect for that. We did not hear good things about Longboards, the restaurant on site. You can get much better food at Whaler's Village or in Lahaina for a similair price. Walk down to the Hyatt Regency and sit at their outdoor bar and watch the sunset. Beautiful! The only downside was the timeshare presentation. We were talked into going because my husband could get 2 rounds of golf, which is worth almost $400. We were honest going in that we already had 2 timeshares and weren't in a position to buy another week.

Let me just say this Napali tower is amazing. Everything is brand new and beautiful within the unit. They did an excellent job of decorating and decking it out with the top of the line appliances. The Napili tower has only ocean front views or island views. The Lahaina Tower has partial oceanview rooms also. We have an ocean front and it is amazing. There is a huge grassy area in front of the tower and then there is the beach. They have situated the living and kitchen area so you can see straight out onto the ocean and the view is breathtaking. The kitchen has everything you need to cook in and is a good size. The dining room table can comfortably seat 6 people and 8 if necessary. The living room is a good size and the entire space feels very open. The entire living/dining room and kitchen are tile with a rug in the living room. The bedroom is nice, but on the small/tight side (the rooms in the older part of the Maui Ocean club are much bigger). There isn't much room to walk around in the bedroom and not much room to store stuff other than the small closet. Teh bedroom is carpeted which is nice. The bathroom area itself is also pretty tight with a toilet and shower. There is a very large soaking tub that is between the bathroom and the bedroom.

Our ocean front villa was nicely appointed with a full kitchen, washer and dryer, refrigerator, microwave and stove and the most amazing view. These villas have only been opened since early 09 so they are in great condition. The Napili tower and the Lahaina tower both have their own pool with the Napili tower also having a bar next to the pool. Since there isn't drink service at these pools it was nice to at least have a bar close by to get those cool tropical drinks. You need a room key to access the elevator which adds a bit more security to the building. We have daily housekeeping since we booked with points. If you book through Marriott you should check to see how frequently housekeeping comes if that is a concern. My only complaint with these new villas is that the balcony is super small compared to the balconies at the older section of the resort. There was para-sailing and surfing on the beach and you could rent covered lounges there also. There was a lot of beach this August, more than in previous years but the beach size changes seasonally so you never know how big or small it will be. The main pool was super crowded and people were up before sunrise plopping down towels to reserve their chairs so it was nice that there are smaller pools next to the new towers that are not crowded. The main pool is the only one with drink and food service so you miss that at the smaller pools but the bar at the Napili tower does take food orders also. Marriott either needs to extend drink and food service too ALL pools, or enforce the 45 minute towel rule during the busy summer months. The new Napili tower ocean front rooms will be the perfect place to whale watch come whale season. Bring your binoculars! I've been coming to this resort since it was just a Marriott hotel with a small pool. It is nice to see how it has grown into a destination resort. If you have a family this is the place for you. The childrens pool is fantastic with a pirate ship and sand, and the main pool is huge with a water slide. If you stay in the Napili or Lahaini villas you'll have a full kitchen and can get up to a 3 bedroom villa that will easily sleep 10 people. They claim it will sleep 12 but that would be a squeeze! Both new towers also have barbecue stations complete with tables so you can come down barbecue and sit and enjoy your meal. What a great idea! Parking is a hassle the spaces are small and the main parking structure is next to the Lahania villas. There is a small parking structure next to the Napili villas but it filled up fast and valet take up a lot of spaces. But parking is a hassle at every resort so either valet or plan on walking a bit. Of course remember you are in Maui! The best food on Maui is at the Lahainia Grill (not to be confused with David Paul's Island Grill - old owner, new restaurant). You will not be disappointed. There is no view but the meal more than makes up for it. We stopped at Costco near the airport and bought food for breakfast and lunch so we could save some money since restaurant prices are pretty high in Maui and all of the islands. The grounds are beautiful and the new towers have their own pool, the Napili tower also has a bar near the pool. Since the main pool was always super crowded it was nice to grab a spot by the Napili pool that was way more peaceful than the main pool.", "Date": "September 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Resort\u201d", "Author": "basketballtraveler11", "ReviewID": "UR40606862", "Content": "We stayed here for 5 nights after staying at the Marriott Vacation Club on Oauhu.

I was not confident in my decision to do so since I had never stayed in time share accomadations before. We were all very happy. We were assigned rooms 1408 and 1409 (ocean front). The time share was a lock-out (2 bedrooms, a den with a kitchenette and 3 bathrooms). I brought an electric skillet since I knew there was no stove or oven, only a microwave. Actually, there were 2 micowaves and 2 mini-refrigerators which had larger that usual freezers for their size. All kitchen ware was provided (can openers, dishes, silverware, bowls, etc.). A couple of coffee packets, filters and sugar was provided. You can purchase more at the Beach Walk Market next to the pool or bring your own. We asked for condimates whenever we went to a fast food place so that we could have some for when we grilled . The grills were busy around 6:30-7:30 PM but the wait was not too long. We ate breakfast in the room , fast food during the day and dinner was either grilled or we went out. We had Mia Tias and onion rings at Longboards. My husband said the onion rings were the best he has ever had (I don't eat onion so I can not comment). We walked down to Whalers' Village and ate at Leilani's- upstairs (casual dining down and more upscale up). I had Ono which I never had before. Excellent. My son's friend had a teryaki steak which was the best he had ever eaten. We did not go to Costco when we arrived because it was to late. We did visit it on our way to the airport when we were going home. Just like other Costcos, the food at their restaurant is cheap. One man my husband talked to had eaten there 5 out of 7 days. Our hotel was too far to do that. Definitley go there for your groceries. Wat cheaper than the groceriy stores. We shopped at Safeway and Foodland (got grocery cards for both). Saeway had pinaepple on sale. Bought one and it was great. Went back and bought 2 more. Now all of the pineapple back home (Texas) tastes so blah!. We stopped at a roadside produce stand. One pineapple was $7.00! I don't think so! We paid around $3.00 at Safeway (they sell fruit and veggies by the pound). Snorkeled at Black Rock (at the end of Kanapali Beach) and saw 2 turtles. Went to Big Beach. It is a drive but when the South swells are up it is a blast. The waves are shore brake so it could be dangerous but there are lifeguards. They are really funny when they make announcements. The highlite was the surfing lessons. We took them from Goofy Foot. Very good instructors. You can pre-purchase a photo CD of the entire classes surfing skills ($20.00). The 2 boys got up every time. My husband and I, not so much. All I can tell you, several months before taking lessons, practice standing up. Begin on your knees , push with your arms and legs to a surfing stance. My arms were so tired from paddling out and my legs turned to spaghetti after trying to stand up several times. I still had a ball. One last tip; Hilo Hattie's in Lahaina has free parking for 2 hours with a purchase. They sell .99 calendars. You can park and walk to some of the stores.

One night we did go to B.J's Pizza on Front street to have a more less expensive dinner. It was great. We heard Cool Cats was also good for less expensive food. The best part of this whole place is the grounds. We stayed out at the main pool most every day. Yes, we had to get up early but we are early risers. There is a 45 minute time limit on saving chairs, which I think is a great idea. We dislike when travelers place their items down and leave for half the day.

The new Lahaina 2 bedroom villa has a full kitchen (stove/oven, microwave, refrigerator, dishwasher, blender, toaster and coffee maker), granite counters, ample utensils, plates, cups, bowls, etc, also has stacked washer/dryer. Has a dining area and a living room with a pull-out couch that transform to a queen bed. The living has a huge glass window that overlooks the beach. The master bedroom has king bed, large jet-tub and vanity, separate bathroom and shower. Also a sliding door that leads to a porch which also overlooks the beach and the resort grounds. The guest room (which can also be lock-out unit) has a king bed, a pull-out couch/queen bed, sitting area, sliding door with porch overlooking the beach, a mini-bar with microwave and mini-fridge, coffee maker, vanity, bath and shower/tub. The 2 bedrooms and the living room all have flat panel TV with dvd players. Just below the Lahaina tower is a pretty good sized pool with waterfalls and jacuzzi. This pool is always less crowded than the main pool. Though the main pool is a lot bigger with slides, a pirate ship (which kids really like) and a number of water falls. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also another pool below the Napili tower which is also less crowded most of the time. Besides the Lahaina pool is a play structure for kids which is right next to the Lahaina parking structure adjacent to a tennis court. The resort grounds are really gorgeous and well maintained. There are barbecue grills all over the place, however, securing one of them can be challenging during late afternoon hour when everybody wants to have barbecue for dinner. Longsboards restaurant is just right next to the main pool and they serve descent foods. They played live bands and had arts and crafts exhibits by the main pool on the 4th July while we were there. Whalers Village is about 10 mins. walk along the Beachwalk from the resort. It has shops, more restaurants plus the Whalers Museum. Lahaina Cannery mall is about 5 minutes drive where there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a grocery store that you can buy food to cook meals at your villa. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for more shops drive down a couple more minutes to Lahaina town and there you will find a lot. Back to the resort. Never had any problem with any of the resort staff, they were all friendly and willing to help anytime. One thing you should remember is that this is a time share resort, therefore, housekeeping is only done once a week. Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say much about the rooms on the Main tower (as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never seen the inside of the rooms) but the rooms at Napili tower are pretty much the same to what I described above. Another thing to note is that parking garage for Lahaina tower is just right next to the villas. I heard people complain that parking for the Main and Napili towers are quite a walk away from their villas. Other things to do: Drive up to Haleakala Crater - breathtaking view up there (half a day trip). Drive the road to Hana and be blown away by the scenery (whole day trip for us). Snorkel at Molokini Crater \u00e2\u20ac\u201c great experience. Honolua Bay is also a great snorkeling site just a few minutes from the resort. Google Honolua Bay for more info.

It was a little difficult staying while the main pool was under construction, but surprisingly the other pools were not as crowded as you would think, it seems quite a few people prefer the beach, where if you have children, you can rent umbrellas for shade on the beach and make a day of it. There are quite a few daily activities going on every day on the property for guests which you can participate in, Bocce Ball tournaments, fishing with the staff off the shore, surf lessons, yoga in the A.M. near the pool. The only real complaint I have is the cleanliness of the kitchen and bathroom in the room we had which was a 1 bedroom suite with the kitchenette. It was dirty, the cupboards are NOT wiped down, the handles were grimy, dishes had been put away dirty by previous guests, the coffee maker was cracked. The bathroom was just marginally clean, light switches were disgustingly filthy, so was the blow dryer handle and the door handles. In fact, I got so grossed out I went to the local Safeway market and got a tub of Lysol wipes and went back and wiped everything down, it was that bad. The beds were clean and comfortable, the sofa and side chairs were on the newer side and seemed clean enough, the carpet seemed clean. The outside grounds are beautiful, the lobby and interior is maintained very nicely, the pool was always clean and sparkly, the wait staff poolside is very friendly and attentive, in fact all the staff are really nice and friendly. We ate in both restaurants on the grounds and the food was good and fresh. If you have small children book a lower floor room, it's a huge property, and getting from point A to point B can be exhausting, so minimize dragging kids, pool toys and towels by staying close to the pool in a lower floor if you can.

Our one bedroom, two bath unit was very roomy. It was two large hotel rooms connected by a walk through. The huge doorwalls led to two separate balconies. The living room had a small kitchenette with small refrigerator, microwave, and dishwasher. There were dishes, glassware, and flatware. Along with the pullout sofa in the living room we also requested a rollaway. At night time with the sofa pulled out and the rollaway down, it was a tight squeeze, but still room to walk around. During the day the rollaway was easily put out of the way by putting it on it's side. The bedroom had a very comfortable king size bed, chair, and desk and there was still a lot of room. A rollaway could even be put in the bedroom with there still being a lot of room left. It was a very peaceful stay. Never heard any loud noises outside of the room to disturb or wake us. The grounds were beautiful and well kept. The pool was fantastic! Very large with waterfalls and slides. The only problem by the pool was that by 8am most of the pool chairs were reserved with towels. We did eat lunch on property one day, but the menus at the restaurants weren't very appealing to us, so we didn't eat on property more. The Beach Walk Market & Pantry had limited breakfast and lunch items. It was also a place to purchase miscellaneous items (milk, fruit, ice cream bars, etc). The beach was very nice, but not really swimmable. Within 6 feet from the shore there was a lot of coral. There were some people snorkling, but no one swimming.

I do think it's a perfect place for a select group -- families who want to be able to have some of the comforts and convenience of home while away on vacation. Is NOT the place for a romantic getaway, quiet and peaceful break, or for those who like full-service pampering when on vacation. There are 2 older towers in the middle of the resort (where we stayed), where 2 prior hotel rooms have been converted into a single unit, with a king bed, sleeper sofa, 2 full baths, and a kitchenette (sink, dishwasher, small fridge - no freezer, toaster, coffeemaker, and basic kitchen supplies). There is free wireless access. Laundry is also free on the lower level of one of the towers ($1 for Tide). We were happy with our accomodations, although it definitely was not as nice as the brand spanking new facilities in the 2 newer towers. The advantage of the older towers is that you're much closer to the central pools, where most kids and families hang out. Also is very convenient to the parking garage. Pools, pools, pools. This is the highlight of staying at the hotel. Is a great place for families with young kids. Expect it to be crowded. Easy access to beach also. Loved the location along the Kanapali boardwalk, as it was nice to go for walks everyday. Easy walking distance to Whaler's Vilg for shopping. (The nice thing about this place, is you have a kitchen to sometimes eat in or store snacks and drinks... a plus with little kids, or those who purchase alcohol.) The food place is just adjacent to the pool and the boardwalk... burger or sandwich costs about $10. Breakfast will prob cost about $10 pp also. Beer at the pool bar is $6-7, drinks were $8/9. (If you plan to drink coffee or soda on a daily basis, conside purchasing their Marriott Mug for $30 --it gives you unlimited refills for the duration of your stay.) Although our room didn't have a stove, there are gas grills scattered around the property, and I never had any trouble finding one to use.

The balconies are nice sized and really allowed for some great whale watching while on the patio. The beds are really comfortable like all of the newer Marriott timeshare properties.

We never had 1 instance where I thought the staff was less that great. Even when I took my keys with me from the valet and they had to call me in my room, they were very nice. Grounds: The grounds are very nice and there are many pools to explore. One thing I will note is that the pools in the original section are packed, whereas the pools by the Lahaina towers and Napili Villas are much less full. There are Gas Grills placed all over the property to use and we actually used them twice and they worked great. The property is quite large and there can be some walking. There is a parking garage right next to the Lahaina towers and another one right next to Napili Villas so I didn't experience the parking problems some have reported.

We learned quickly that although the Napili Towers have only oceanfront and mountain view categories, there are rooms on the curve of the tower that face another tower and should be considered more \"ocean view\" not oceanfront. If you are sitting on your balcony facing forward you look directly into the other tower and fellow vacationers on their balconies. You have to turn to your right to see the ocean. We figure we got a lousy view since we were staying using points (although our reservation was for \"oceanfront\". We asked to move and they kept saying they had nothing else. Since the tower was almost empty we pushed and they finally moved us to a room on the 3rd floor that was truly oceanfront. The one bedroom units in these towers are wonderful. These units should not be confused with the main building which is converted hotel rooms. The Napili & Lahaina towers have full kitchens. And the living rooms are HUGE. We stayed one night down at the Westin Villas in a one bedroom and they were half the size of the Marriott's one bedroom. The kitchens are wonderful with granite countertops, stainless steel appliances including a full stove, microwave, refrigerator and dishwasher. We picked up a pizza at Costco one night and it was great to be able to cook it in the room. The villa is well stocked, with everything you could need for your stay. The only disappointment was the bowls. There were little tiny bowls, which were not a good size for cereal. We did haul all our stuff downstairs for a cookout one night. We had another guest mention they had tools for cooking outside at the grills, but my husband went to 3 different places and nobody knew where to find them. Our biggest problem was parking. It is a 10-15 minute walk from the parking garage to the Napili villas. My husband would drop us off at the front by our tower and it took him at least 15 minutes to find a spot and walk all the way back to the room. If you have a choice of staying in either the Lahaina or Napili Tower,.. especially if you have an oceanfront view, I would pick the Lahaina tower. The tower itself is closer to the ocean. The Napili Tower is set further back and has a large lawn and pool area in front. You get more noise coming up to your room from people in the pool and playing in the grassy area. You also see more of the surrounding hotels because you are set back farther from the ocean. Not to mention the VERY long walk to your room. The parking garage is attached to to the Lahaina tower which makes it more convenient. We went the first week in February and it seemed ok as far as crowds.

They arrived quickly and fixed the issue with the electronic lock. Yes it was an inconvenience but they were prompt and got is resolved. As I said this was the only issue all week. The condo is basically two hotel rooms converted into a timeshare. The front room has a tv, couch (pull out bed), kitchenette, desk and patio. The second room is a bedroom that also has a patio. Both rooms have their own bathrooms. For 2 adults this was plenty of room. You could probably have 2 kids as well and it would be fine, but 4 adults would be crowded. If you are used to staying in hotel rooms with flat screen TV's and modern furniture that looks like it is from Ikea, then yes the furniture is outdated. Honestly we spent so little time in the room it didn't matter. The bed is big and comfortable. The kitchen includes a small refrigerator (but it is bigger than your standard dorm room fridge). We went to the grocery store and bought breakfast food (cereal, milk) , sandwich stuff for lunch, beer and wine. We were able to put everything in the fridge that needed to go and had plenty of room. There is a coffee maker so get coffee. Also included is a toaster, a microwave and a dish washer. The kitchen was fine for the basic essentials.

We loved this resort. Usually we don't like larger resorts because they are crowded, it was not. It certainly helped that it was off season. There were a few kids and games in the main pool, we swam in the smaller pool by the new Lahaina tower and had no issues. Our room(s) were in the older part of the building, Lanai tower, top floor. We had a great view back to the mountains. This provided us with lovely sunrises and many rainbows to watch. It was great that each section (master bedroom, living room, and guest lock off) had its own balcony. The staff at the resort was always friendly and accomodating. The prices in the resort beachwalk market were outrageous, but we stocked up on necessities at the Safeway and Star Markets. One downside to the older rooms, there is no full size fridge or stove. We did have two microwaves and two half size fridges. It's true that there is very little sandy beach directly in front of the main section of the resort, that starts in front of the new (unfinished) Napili towers on north side of the property. Anyone who complains about this is just too lazy to walk a few extra feet to get to the wider part of the beach. We loved the chairs on the grass, its much cleaner and the grass is great to walk on! We holed up every day in the corner edge of the chairs furthest away from the center of the resort and felt like we are almost alone. Whalers Village for shopping and eating is a short 10 min walk down the beach walk and a little further you can snorkel around the Black Rock. The best thing of all, The sunsets.

Staff was very polite, friendly, helpful. Facilities were clean, well maintained. However there were a few problems that interfered significantly with our vacation experience. First of all, all areas of all swimming pools were plagued with people-both kids and adults-throwing balls, playing catch, water volleyball, water basketball, etc. There was literally no place you could swim peacefully without having to worry about being hit in the head with a thrown ball. There should have been some designated swimming pool areas for \"no ball playing\", but there were not. Second of all, this problem extended to the extensive grassy areas in front of the hotel where most of the sun bathing lounges are set up. Again, ball playing of all sorts in all areas, no designated \"no ball playing\" zones, definitely a problem when some of the guests began behaving as though they were in a state park playing touch football through the lounge areas. On several occasions I had to engage in unpleasant interchanges with some of the ballplayers to insure my family was not going to be injured accidentally. Third, almost no beach. The surf comes all the way back to a steep vertical cliff-like formation several feet high-and ocean floor out from there is rocky and inhospitable. Almost impossible to swim in ocean at this resort, necessary to walk several hundred feet north, to get to a decent beach. Finally, no acceptable beach access; necessary instead to climb over a rope fence, and then climb down the cliff. This in contrast to the resort just south of this property, which has the same sort of beach problem but nevertheless has built easy access points to the ocean, stairs, ramps, etc. It's a stretch to say that the resort is on Kaanapali Beach at all, it's really on the point of land that separates Kaanapali from Lahaina, an inferior location for beach quality. It's a decent resort if you are not primarily interested in ocean access, and if you bring a helmet to deflect thrown balls. However if you have the typical romantic image of relaxing on a nice beach with your spouse or significant other, swimming in beautiful ocean waters, I would not recommend this resort.", "Date": "August 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "slc ut", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location on Kaanapali Beach\u201d", "Author": "vacationsamany", "ReviewID": "UR19355562", "Content": "Great location right on Kaanapali Beach.

On arrival we were given a lower floor facing the construction of the new tower and the digging around the new pool. The first room was very dark and looked directly at the new building. I couldn't believe it. I went to the front desk and spoke with a guest service lady, who was very sweet and filled with Aloha spirit. She did her best to find us a room closer to the ocean. She succeeded, and moved us 2 rooms closer, we still looked straight out at the construction site, but also had a view of the ocean. This was lovely for sunset watching, the only time we enjoyed the balcony. The construction noise starts at 7am, with hammering, it gets very loud at 8am with heavy trucks beep-beeping all day long, except for lunch break, noon to 1. You can still hear the trucks with the doors closed and the aircon going. The racket stops around 5pm. You are spared the noise on the weekend. We have been to Maui many times, we have seen all the sights, gone snorkeling, the road to Hana, Annabelle and Warrens, the volcano, the winery, etc. When we go on vacation, we like to sit on our balcony and enjoy the peace and quiet. We had none, except when the workers went home at 5. If you expect a quiet place to read, meditate, forget it. The large pool is very crowded and packed with children enjoying the slide, playing ball in the water, etc. There are lawn chairs on the grassy area in front of the new pool, this is the place to enjoy a book, as well as look out at the ocean. There are palm trees to help with the shade. We had to stay away from our room all day....just to relax! The Marriott staff members get 5 stars from me as well as the sunsets.... There are 2 places to get food at the Maui Marriott. One is a small grocery store, where you can order pizza, hot specials, sandwiches and salads. You can eat outside on tables, or take the food and go to your room. Longboards is the only sit down restaurant. It is open at 5 for cocktails and 5:30 for dinner. The food is delicious, fresh, tasty and well prepared. The Whaler's village is a short walk, you will find good restaurants there, our favorite is Hula Grill. The rooms in the converted hotel don't have a way to cook your meals, but there are barbeques all over the property and a microwave to heat food. There are 3 kinds of rooms here, new lovely villas with full kitchens, converted hotel rooms with no kitchens, no noise or dirt from construction and the third kind of room, where we stayed. I would stay away from this Marriott until it finishes the construction, expected to be completed early 2009.

Provided you don't arrive in the late evening expect to be greeted with an orchid lei and a cool bottle of water. When we arrive the well trained valets leap to attention and rush over to assist us with our vehicle and our luggage. As a matter of fact they are so eager about it . One day my husband and I were going out to do a bit of sightseeing and he went to the parking garage to pick up the car while I waited at the front of the hotel. No sooner had he driven up when one of the young valets rushed over to the car ahead of me to open the door for me. I joked as we drove off that I thought he was going for a ride with my husband instead of me! They hold areception every Monday night for the timeshare guests on the triangle of lawn overlooking the ocean. Free drinks flow; there are appetizers, music and a raffle for free visors, spa robes, tickets to shows etc. The only time that I felt that the staff was perhaps run ragged was the year we went in August so both of our school/college aged children could accompany us. We were told by a staff member that the resort was at 99% capacity. The months that we found it less hectic were September and March. And in early March the whales are still there. Try the Trilogy Lanai Daylong Sunset Cruise during whale season. Words cannot describe it. And if you are lucky enough to have Captain Owen as your tour leader all the more memorable. Don't miss the Garden of Eden(fee) on the Road to Hana. Also the black sand beach at the State Park(name?). Ho'okepa Beach is a sight to see when the windsurfers are out in full force. And for a fun place to shop in Paia try Jaggers. The nice ladies who work in the shop are very willing to help. Also, I love beading and if you do too don't miss Aloha Bead Company in Paia. Oh and to eat: Hula Grill and Lelani's and Kimo's all owned by the same company. The macadamia crusted Mahi Mahi is outstanding at the Hula Grill and the fish tacos are wonderful both at Lelani's and Kimos. And don't forget to have a huge piece of Hula Pie either at Leilani's or Kimos. You can get Hula Pie flavored coffee beans at Sir Wilfreds in the Whalers Village. The dessert at the Tiki Terrace at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel is out of this world. Try the Caramel Macadamia Nut Eruption.....Macadamia Nut Ice Cream piled on top of a moist brownie with Caramel Syrup and whipped cream and chopped Macadamia Nuts. It won an award at the Taste of Lahaina. Also the weekend that falls in the middle of September is when they have the Taste of Lahaina and Island Music. Three times we have scheduled our holidays around that weekend. See the website from the Lahaina Town Action Committee for more info on when it will be this year. For cheap but good eats and a fabulous view check out Aloha Mixed Plate on Front Street behind the Lahaina Cannery Mall(right behind Safeway). Oh, and Pacific O at the opposite end of Front Street....you can see the owner James MacDonald buying fish right from the fishermen in the early afternoon. It is a wonderful restaurant...veranda style on the beach. Heading back towards the Airport; perhaps on the way to your plane(remember the food is either non-existent or not what it once was on the 5 hour plus flight back to the west coast) so you may want to stock up before you get to the airport. Marco's Grill and Bar is a very nice place for that last meal on Maui. And it's right on the way to the airport as well. Think anything from sandwiches to wonderful pasta dishes with a definite Italian flavor. On your day in Paia you can get very fresh and reasonable priced fish dishes at Paia Fish Market. Be prepared to share a long picnic style table with strangers. It's a very popular place. For dessert with a view stop at Mama's Fish House. It no doubt has the most wonderful view on all of Maui. We had dessert and freshly brewed Maui grown coffee in their lounge. Tried lunching there one time and came to the sad conclusion that both dinnerand lunch are pretty steeply priced for what you get and the waitresses seem to have been especially trained in how to act haughty towards their guests. Now I know people defend the steep prices by saying the fish has been caught that very day and all the ingredients are so fresh but really, everyone ,you can get freshly caught fish almost everywhere on Maui anytime you want to! Well, all this makes me want to be on Maui right now...sigh. Have to wait till April. Hope the fares go down some by then...it's a bit crazy now! PS I suppose if you are used to having a washer and dryer in your home resort then it might seem a bit inconvenient to take your laundry from your suite and down the elevator to the pool level to use the laundry room but we have always done one evening of laundry about half way thru our stay and combined it with a nice long soak in the hot tub gazing at the stars.

Alot has been written about this location and will only comment on things not mentioned by others. First, this is a long trip from the East Coast, went Via Phila, to Phoenix, Maui via US Airways. To my surprise no problems with flights or connections. Leave 1-2 days early 7-10 days to give yourself time to adjust to time schedule if possible. Traded my three bed unit in the Carribean for a 2Bed/3bath unit, with limited kitchenette in the Lahaina Tower Mountain View, although the check in desk called it a \"Garden View\". Frankly, if you get a high up Mountain view I think it is as nice as an Ocean View/ because the Western Maui Mountains with the changing cloud patterns are truly beautiful, so don't despair.To clarify what these older units are like: which I had trouble figuring out from the trade. They are hotel rooms linked together i.e lock off type arrangements. Our three rooms were large and the 3 full baths werea plus. On the downside , I am used to a Full Kitchen/Laundry, etc at my home resort, so the limited kitchen was a minus for us. However, we did have two mini-refrigerators, one in the main \"living room\" and another small kitchen in the master Bedroom\", so we definately used both. There is a slit space for the\"freezer\" but we made do. There are ample plates, cooking utensils, microwave, dishwasher, blender, toaster with some start up supplieswhen you arrive. Three TVs for the kids and DVD. The feel is more like a \"Very Big Hotel\". However, the two newer towers one completed, and one under construction are far better, and I would insist on this for a trade if I am to return. The unit looked like it had been newly redecorated. Check-in was so so, room not ready until 5:00PM, There is a distance to walk from the self park garrage to your tower which is bit of an inconvenience, but you can pay for valet parking $12.00/day. No greetings with Lais when we arrived on Sunday but looks like they only do this on Saturday arrivals, so my kids were a little dissapointed. The pool system of slides, caves, etc is really nice for the kids. The lounge chairs fill up quickly and it got a little crowded. The beach was a big dissapointment. The surf was strong and there was very little sand to stretch out on between the grass and the water. We are used to the much wider beaches in Jersey and frankly, the beaches, snorkeling, calmness, clarity of the water are far better in the carribean.But if you are a surfer, this is the place to be. They said the beach frontage varies depends on the time of the year. I used the outdoor gas grills to cook on, which alot of other familes who go there every year seemed to have down to a science I like the idea of the famiily that took their portable George Forman grill to cook on in their room. It was a bit of a pain to haul your food, utensils, and felt like college days?? etc up and down the elevators to your room, but you will meet friendly people at the grill who will share the space with you. For the size of the complex, they should at least have another laundry room or so in each tower. I felt a little strange walking through the lobby with my laundry basket, but again I am used to a washer and dryer in my prior Marriott Units, but everyone does this, so you will feel right at home. The plusses: There is so much to do and see for families, and with a car we went to little towns like Pai for dinner, \"Milagros Food company\"-Mexican/ Spanish cuisine was fabulous. So venture out from the Kanappali area. If you eat at the hotels or in the surrounding area it is expensive, but Lahaina Farms, and Safeway were a convenient short drive for breakfast and lunch groceries if you choose to eat out for dinner. We took Valley Isle Excursions to Hana- Definately first class, and Trilogy Day/Sunset Cruise to Lanai- take it for the sail boat ride, chance to Snorkel on Lania, but again the surf was a big issue if you are used to snorkeling in calm waters. Their dinner was quite good, and the sunset return was a highlight. I would definately return to Maui again in 3-5 years and would definately want an equivalent trade in one of the newer full Kitchen 2-3 bedroom units in the newer towers especially if you have kids with you, but the beauty of the island made up for some of the negatives.", "Date": "July 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corona, CA", "Title": "\u201cNice property, could use some sprucing\u201d", "Author": "loriv247", "ReviewID": "UR17380136", "Content": "We stayed at the Maui Ocean club from 6/22-6/27.

The fridge was small but worked out. I brought my portable electric griddle because I knew there was no stove. This allowed me to cook eggs, bacon, pancakes and french toast for breakfast. Then grilled cheese, chicken, steak for lunch. I highly recommend bringing one if you plan to cook. They need more lighting in the kitchen area, its a little dark. We had a nice wraparound lanai because we had a corner unit. We had a view of the construction but also a partial ocean view so that was nice. The construction noise was minimal. We were never bothered by it.The BBQ's on the property are few and far between. We always had to stand in line for one. When we first arrived, the bellmen ignored us. We weren't used to that,as we've always had prompt service at any other hotel we've stayed at. We had a few other rude instances with the bellman at this resort, but a few good experiences as well. The front desk staff were always pleasant. The bar and poolside servers were understaffed. We practically had to tackle one to get some service. Also, the drinks were awful. Barely any alcohol and overpriced. Bring your own booze and make your own drinks in your room (they have blenders). Marriott also offers a refillable souvenier mug for $26 that gives you unlimited sodas and ice tea refills during your stay. We chose to forego since we bought 12 packs of soda and kept those in our room. The nearby Safeway has good deals as well as the Costco near the airport. As for the room itself, great size, comfy bed, small bathrooms (but you get two with showers so that's a plus). The exterior is dated. They need to replace the doors and paint the outside. They also need to replace the machines in the laundry room. They are really noisy and old looking. The pool was very nice and the kids and adults alike loved the waterslide. Be prepared to reserve your chairs before 6:00 a.m. if you want shade. Marriott discourages this, but I never saw them enforcing their own \"45 min. rule\". As for shopping, they had a few different stores to choose from, but Whaler's village is just a 1/4 mile walk down (take the pathway along the beach). Its so pleasant that you don't mind the distance. The timeshare presentation was very little pressure and it was actually enjoyable. We did not buy one yet but are strongly considering it now. The new 2 bedroom units are goregeous, albeit pricey! The beach was unswimmable because of all the rocks and the reef so close to the shore. Even if you are a snorkel enthusiast, its hard to get out there without scraping your knees or feet. Some of our best beach experiences were on the Wailea side of the island. As for parking, be prepared to walk a ways if you choose to self-park. The charge is $6 a day for non-owners. Valet is $15. Given our experience with the valet/bellmen, I'd recommend self-park.

It was clean and comfortable and big. The only downside was the Lanai's. There were 2 but they were dirty and didn't have a table so were not ideal to sit out at...but the view of the ocean and the sound of the ocean was fantastic. We were all the way in the back away from the elevators so had to walk the stairs but we were close to the self parking. The pool at this hotel is the NICEST pool area ever! I never swim but went in everyday and under the water falls. The entire pool experience was great and it was nice to walk to Whaler's village for lunch and to other hotels. Kaanapali beach is paradise! Some favorite things : The Hammock in the shade by the ocean at the Marriott....true relaxation....Banana Bread at Keneau Peninsula on the way to Hana...I always end here. The view is breathtaking..you need to drive all the way down to the very small town. It's worth the trip to go half way up and not all of the way to Hana....Mama's Fishhouse was pricey but really delicious for lunch...... Kimo's lunch salad..it was a teriyaki chicken over salad with an amazing papaya dressing. Yum.....Plantation House had an amazing view..food was pretty good although I didn't love my fish. Sansai the early bird (25 percent off)or the after 10pm 50 percent off and Karaoke is fun....The crab and mango roll and butter fish were amazing. The Gazebo is really good for breakfast and the line moves fast. Best pancakes!! Longboards...the Buffet prime rib dinner was surprisingly good but in general there are better restaurants.

The resort has an option of purchasing a coffee mug w/ lid for 24.95 (26.95 by the time we left) which gives you unlimited drinks for the duration of your stay. The resort itself was wonderful. I have no complaints they even had a complimentary room available for people who had later flights and wanted to still lay out by the pool. Big room w/ common area and private bathrooms w/ showers....but because of my inablity to tell time we missed our flight and had to stay another night. Marriott gave no discount on any of there rooms for an additional night so we drove over to the south side, Kihei. WE LOVE THAT AREA!!!!!!!!

We booked a 4 night rewards stay, and added another pre-night all oceanfront. I was under the impression we would be in the same room for the 5 nights, but on arrival, they told us we would have to move the next day. The desk agent looked for quite a while to try and accommodate us, but was unable to do so. There was no reason to get all upset-they can't create rooms. We were givin room 7208 for one night. It was gorgeous, with a perfect oceanview. Room: looked brand new, with full kitchen with stainless steel and granite counters. Dining table for 6, bedroom with king bed. Full sofabed in living room and we were ablt to gell a rollaway. The Bathroom has a shower, sink, toilet, and the bedroom has a separate sink and jetted tub. Changed to 4210 for the next 4 nights. It looked a bit more worn, and did not have floor to ceiling windows, but still had a nice view. Our things were stored and delivered to the room when it was ready--we did not have to wait around. Parking: Spaces were tight, but I never had a problem parking my minivan. The Lahaina tower is right next to the parking garage, and the Adult pool is just outside the entrance. Food: Beachwalker just OK. Bring your own, or go to Whaler's Village(a 10 minute walk). They had 6 grills ouside our building, and they were always busy, but the people I talked to never had a problem getting a grill. Safeway is 2 miles away. Round Table Pizza is very close by and had good pizza. Location: Convenient to Lahaina and Whaler's Village. Driving to Hana was long. We left at 8:15AM and got home at 7. We didn't do any hikes as we had our 80 year old parents, but did stop for pictures and walked along the Black Sand Beach. Had lunch in Hana at the little stand on the bay. I think it took 3 1/2 hours to get back, but I could be delirious. Time share: We had absolutely no pressure. We picked up a packat with discounts on arrival, and in it was info on the time share, but that was it. No other mention. We'd recommend it. It worked very well for our parents and the 2 of us.

Of all the places we've traveled, Maui is really the only place I'd want to come back to. #1 the weather is PERFECT. You are never hot or cold, which makes for a great vacation and there are just no bugs at the resort. We find that wherever we go (Caribbean, Mexico, Florida) you are ALWAYS sweating because of the horrible heat or humidity. We could actually shower here and feel clean all day long. Nice!! #2 the scenery was amazing. From the beautiful ocean water to the humpback whales jumping while you watch from your deck to the gorgeous sunsets...AHH! #3 the GREAT food. What I loved about this resort is you are within walking distance of some fun shops and wonderful restaurants right along the beach. Be prepared to spend a lot on food though if you go out. If you are like us and like a drink with lobster, you will easily spend over $100 at night #4 the awesome snorkeling at Molokini Crater and Turtle Town. The staff at the Lahaina Princess Boat was great. I would recommend going with them on your whale watch or snorkeling tour. They take you out early in the morning, serve you muffins, coffee, etc. and you snorkel for a while and then they serve you lunch on the grill. Just a lot of fun and you will see whales on the way. Avoid the half hour drive to the bay for those tours. They are all the same and this boat holds less people which gives you more of a private snorkel tour. #5 the town of Lahaina was so convenient and really cool. It was minutes from the resort and had tons of shopping and restaurants. Starbucks is everywhere too, including at the resort, which made it nice for a morning latte on the deck. #6 the staff was friendly, the resort was clean, the pool and grounds were super nice and I loved the privacy of where the resort was located. I love that the concierge will help you with anything. The timeshare representatives were quick and to the point too with no pressure to buy...very nice. #7: I would recommend the trip up to Mt. Haleakala...talk about being on top of the world. It is an amazing drive that puts you above the clouds once you reach the top. I loved it!! Pack a sweatshirt or coat...very cold up there. 49 degrees when we went Negatives: The road to Hana was VERY beautiful but took FOREVER to do from the west side. I felt very unsafe once we reached the narrow part of the road. The locals drove like 50mph on this road which is insane. The curves and one lane bridges certainly is a bit fearful especially when you know people are going that fast. Once we got there, I just wasn't really impressed with what I saw. There wasn't really a huge amount of things to do and we just basically said \"This is it?\" and turned around and went home. Again though, an AMAZING scenic drive. Just be prepared to be tired from it. I would recommend staying in Hana and making a two day trip out of it. I was also disappointed with the beach. It is a law that you can't have lounge chairs out on the beach and the water is full of coral so you can't use it. That was a major letdown so consequently, we never laid out the entire week. I was also disappointed with the rooms somewhat. They were super clean and nice but they were staged rather boring and the decks featured two chairs and a mini table. The chairs were so short you couldn't see past or above the deck bar which blocked your view of everything and the table was so small that you couldn't really eat out there comfortably. As loaded as Marriott is, I'd just invest in some type of an actual table that you can sit at. I was also unimpressed with the restaurants on-site. They featured a small menu and high prices. I LOVED the Beachwalk though. Very handy for coffee, breakfast, a pizza, or any type of snack or drink you can think of. (You can purchase a mug onsite and fill up on all you can drink coffee or pop...I would recommend this!!) Other than that, GREAT place to vacation.

The M.O.C. is a time-share resort, located near the south end of Kaanapali Beach and a short drive from the historic town of Lahaina. The resort has all the services/amenities expected of a luxury resort: 24-hour front desk, concierge, valet parking(optional), fitness center, gift & other shops, children's playground, restaurant, pool-side market and bar. We own/stay in a 1-BR/2-BA oceanview villa. These units can accommodate a family of four or two couples, with relative privacy. The 1-BR villas have a limited kitchen (the 2-BR units have full kitchens); furnished with microwave oven, small refrigerator, dishwasher, basic small appliances (toaster, blender, coffee-maker, etc.) and kitchen ware. The bedroom is spacious; with a sitting area, private bathroom and lanai. All villas have been recently remodeled. The main swimming pool, IMO, is one of the best on the island; multi-tiered with waterfalls and a large water slide. There are several Jacuzzis and a children's section, complete with sandy beach and a pirate ship to play on. The resort supposedly has a \"no lounge chair-saving policy (towels to be removed from un-occupied lounges after 30 minutes)\" but it did not appear this was being enforced (lounge chairs around the pool are at a premium). A recently built, smaller and less crowded swimming pool is located between the Lanai Tower and the recently opened Lahaina Villas building. Since our visit last year, the two on-site restaurants (Nalu Sushi and Va Bene) have been closed and replaced by Longboards. We did not eat at Longboards but heard it was receiving good reviews. The pool-side Marketplace serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, along with snack and dessert items. For a nominal fee, the resort sells a coffee/drink mug which includes unlimited refills of soda and Starbuck's coffee for the duration of your stay. Construction continues at the resort. The Lahaina Villas building, located next to the Lanai Tower, is now open. We did not tour the new two and three bedroom villas in the Lahaina Tower but the photos we saw were very impressive. Construction of the Napili Villas, located next to the Molokai Tower, is due to be completed early in 2009. We stayed in the Molokai tower and construction noise was not an issue; however our room was on the opposite side of where the construction was taking place (if you stay in the Molokai Tower before construction is complete, I'd recommend requesting a room with balcony overlooking the swimming pool). The beach in front of the Maui Ocean Club is not the best for swimming, due to sharp rocks in shallow water. Decent swimming conditions can be found a short walk to the west, in front of the neighboring Kaanapali Alii. Good snorkeling can be found at Black Rock, at the west end of Kaanapali Beach (15 to 20 minute walk). Whaler's Village is about a 10 minute walk from the resort. The Maui Ocean Club is well-maintained and the service is typical Marriott (very good). As a guest at this resort, you will be invited to tour the new villas but there is no pressure to do so. Should you take the tour, the sales presentations are also no pressure. We have been coming to this resort since we purchased in 2002 and have enjoyed our stays each and every year.

Poor maintenance during the recent storm in December 2007 and poor resort design are the reasons. The outside of the property is lovely but the poor attitude of the staff during the storm was detrimental. Our room had pre-existing water damage stains on the ceiling and when the rains hit, the room flooded terribly. Our baggage, computer, and shopping items were sitting in water that was so deep it covered our shoes. The flooding ranged from the lanai door all the way across the room to the entrance door. The management failed to communicate effectively. Return calls were not received and they denied poor maintenance. We had to constantly present ourselves at the front desk to get the problem addressed. They ignored our observations of the pre-existing water damage and seemed to not listen. There was no way we could stay in this room. If you climbed on the bed, it was like a ship in water! It was not healthy. They finally found us a slightly smaller room. They had little in the way of resort activities during this whole week due to the storm. The welcome cocktail reception was cancelled and not re-scheduled. The outside aquatic classes were not available (extra charges for these). There is no spa on premises. The 2 restaurants are open to air and wind and blowing rain. It was chilly and not comfortable to eat this way. Open air lobby left us walking in water constantly. Our original room had an incredible view but this room flooded and we had to leave. The new room was slightly smaller and not really an upgrade to us. There rooms are really nothing too special. There have just got to be better places in Maui to stay and we certainly wish we had chosen another. We did follow up with Marriott and got the distinct impression that customer service and satisfaction were not of the utmost importance due to the excuses we received. Either they did not believe us or just didn't care.

On a recent stay, a friend and I were provided with what must be their smallest room in the complex. While it was in a nice location -- the newly-built Lahaina Tower -- the room was big enough for a bed and not much more. There was a nice view from the lanai, looking out over the pool and to the ocean beyond. From what we saw and heard from other guests, our room was half the size with fewer amenities, yet, we paid about $400 a night. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was a good size, with the same toiletries you get any any Marriott around the world. One positive at this Marriott -- there was no extra charge for Internet access in the room. Why most other Marriotts charge for this service I will never understand. OK, I do understand. It's another way to squeeze $12.95 a day from their guests. There is not much of a beach -- a very narrow strip of sand. The pools were great. There was a smaller pool with waterfall near our tower, and a very large pool with water slide a short walk away. I did not like the hawking done by the attendant handing out towels. He kept trying to get me to buy sunglasses, sunscreen, and other sundries. He told me he didn't like my sunglasses, which I found very offensive, especially since they were not cheap, and were a gift from my partner, and thus, meant something special to me. We only ate one full meal on site, the breakfast buffet, which was standard Marriott fare. Food offered in the bar area was very limited. There is also a deli near the bar with wrapped food -- sandwiches, salads, fruit. Fortunately, there are many places nearby to dine, from a strip mall deli with a great breakfast right up the road from this property, to Sansei for great sushi, to Roy's Kahana Grill -- a near perfect dining experience -- or Plantation House in Kapalua for a delicious breakfast with a view. I had a decent massage, although it could not compare to the treatment at the spa at the Hana Hotel Maui. There was a nice fitness facility. The staff at check-in/check out were very nice and efficient.

Lauderdale property - sadly, we decided to leave early as the rest of the week was going to be terribly stormy week. We had reserved a 1 Br unit - and were assigned a large, 1 Br unit in the Molokai tower - overlooking the pool area and ocean. The unit was large, and had new furniture. However, it had only a partial kitchen - which was a bit of pain as we had a 3 year old with us - and would like to have cooked on occassion. (I made a mistake while accepting the exchange by not insisting on a unit with a full kitchen). Also, unlike in the new tower they have built recently, the TVs were old style - but not a big deal. The beds (including the sofabed - surprise) was comfortable. The bathrooms, however, were a bit substandard. The amenities provided in the bathroom were poor, the towels very substandard, and the lack of a jacuzzi in a resort of this standing was a bit of a surprise. The entrance to the resort was a bit sparse - the reception area wasn't up to Marriott standards, or for that matter a high quality tropical resort standards - a bit let down I thought. However, the rest of the resort was very good, and well maintained. The staff was friendly and helpful. in some ways, the set of up the resort and the facilities available felt a bit like a cruise ship. However, I think they could/would actually do a lot better by picking up some pointers in terms of how to 'entertain' guests from cruise ship management styles. We didn't visit any of the restaurants on the property as they weren't rated particularly highly. In terms of water activities - the pool areas are good - well maintained with nice, lush greenery. The beach right in front of the hotel not so much. One has to walk a bit towards the Westin to get access to a decent part of the beach. With bad weather in Maui, the resort didn't have much to offer/suggest in terms of other things to do either at the resort or other parts of the island. Most of the other guests had come from cold places, and preferred to stay in Maui - even with the stormy conditions. In our case, it being about 75 degrees in Houston, we decided to return early and enjoy the good weather we have for much of the year. :) Overall, would recommend this resort - but would suggest focusing on the newer tower.

Be sure to get there before 9am as the line can be very long. Cascades at the Hyatt we had a romantic ocean view dinner for two, sushi was yummy and so was the corn soup, it was pricey but worth it.

Staff goes around all morning checking for inactivity. If belongings are left unattended on a chair for more than 45 minutes, they're removed.

Construction? What construction? Our room was in the Molokai Tower facing north and honestly we would have never known there was anything going on. Now, that's not to say that very shortly (but summer's end) that will all change and the North Side of the Molokai should be avoided at all cost. You'd think that a conglomerate like Marriott would have the decency to not book those rooms...whatever. More more bad thing and then on to the good. They need to seriously get in touch with what is going on at their pool with all of the inconsiderate people coming down literally at the crack of dawn to scope out the best chairs. Supposedly the staff was to be watching and any unoccupied chair after 45 minutes would be cleared. Didn't happen. I was almost accosted by a gentleman whom I watched, timed and knew he and his family were gone much longer than 45 minutes. When they returned after, what they said was, lunch they were very rude and just plopped all of their stuff down on top of ours. It was very upsetting. Nuf sed. Okay. Everything else great! Bed/pillows: unbelievable. View: superb. Weather: fantastic -- 82 with no humidity and constant tradewinds with 8 straight days of sunshine. Food: Longboard's/great, Beachwalk/typical beach food. Staff: so, so friendly - couldn't do enough for you. Oh, but the pool..... Some suggestions: The Ulalena Show must not be missed. It is in Lahaina at the Maui Theater. Book the show and make dinner reservations at Longhi's (about three doors down) for 8:15pm. You won't be sorry. Oh yes, and you must almost get to Longhi's one morning for breakfast for their awesome macadamia nut pancakes. The Feast at LeLe. This is a show for those poor souls who did not have the foresight to book the Old Lahaina Luau way in advance. This was developed by the same folks. Much nicer than a tradional luau! It's as if you are at a gourmet restaurant having the Chef's tasting menu with some very tasteful Polynesian entertainment in between courses. Mama's Fish House/Road to Hana. Mama's is about 10 minutes from the airport in Kahului. We did this on our first day in Maui after having just arrived at 8:00pm the night before from the East Coast. Naturally we were wide awake by 6am and thought since we could not check in at the Marriott until 3, why not take the Road to Hana? Perfect. Although we didn't stop much -- we were just enjoying the drive so much. We turned around and got back to Mama's just in fine for a late lunch, which then put us at the MMOC just in time for Happy Hour. Vino, tapas/wine bar in Kapalua. (Can you tell we're foodies?) Really nice atmosphere, excellent service and great food. What's nice here is that you can order 2oz. pours of most all their wines. I got a flight of whites, my husband the reds and we shared some really nice wine for about $25. Tapas' yummy. Try the chopped salad. Sansei/Kapalua -- nice but nothing out of the ordinary. Nice sushi place though. Last but certainly not least: Chez Paul. You will find this \"in the middle of nowhere\" as they put it, right on Hwy 30 about 15 minutes south of Lahaina. Probably the best meal we had. We did this on our way to the airport on our last night. Perfect timing to have a 5:30 reservation and get to your flight in time. Service was impeccable (Sasha), lovely champagne, very nice meal and creme brulee to die for served in half of a pineapple. We even got to meet the owner/chef. All in all, we had a really great time. The pool scene was very aggrevating though. It's much nicer to be on the beach anyway...I can sit at my own pool at home in Florida ;) I really wish Marriott would do something about it.

Grandma has a Marriott timeshare from another state but hosted us in Maui via Interval trade. This was our first ever stay at the Maui Marriott OC . Check-in was a breeze, we requested ahead of time and got an ocean front room on the 7th floor of the Lanai tower. The 2 bedroom villa was fine, although not as nice as other Vacation Club villas that are new, I would imagine the new Lahaina tower villas will be like the others we've experienced. Biggest difference was no stove, no full sized refrigerator, and no washer/dryer. Only microwaves, coffee makers, toasters, and mini-fridges. We never heard any construction noise in our room and the views of Lanai and Molokai and sunsets from our room were spectacular. We stocked up on breakfast cereals and milk and stuff for our own in room continental breakfasts, Safeway in Lahaina is only about 5 minutes away by car. There were plenty of lounge chairs around the pool and grounds for sunbathing, but we did notice that many of the \"regulars\" had a system of taking pool towels up with them to their rooms, and then sending someone down very early in the morning to stake out the best lounging locations closest to the pool, under the umbrella's, etc., by putting the towels out before the towel station was open. While annoying, we had no problems getting lounge chairs. Our kids loved the water slide and the basketball hoop in the pool, my 6 yr old and 9 year old enjoyed the Pirate ship pool area too. Contrary to several reviews, there were two restaurants open during our stay on property, the Beachwalk near the pool serving breakfast, lunch, dinner, and also sells other sundry food items, and Longboards/LaBene which was open for dinner. We ate at Beachwalk several times and it was pretty good but expensive for pizza, hot dogs, burgers and fries, ribs, fish, etc. It was worth it for the convenience though. We ate dinner at Longboards twice, it was good, the filet was the best entree. The beachwalk was nice for taking walks down to the Whalers Village shops and restaurants. We ate at Leilani's twice, loved the wedge salad and hula pie. We also loved Bubba Gumps in Lahaina, great location, spectacular views, try the bucket of garlic butter shrimp. Best sightseeing was the Iao Needle, Maui Ocean Center, Honolua Bay Beach, Ho'okipa Beach. Best show was Ulalena in Lahaina at the Maui Theater. Don't waste your time or money with the Drums of the Pacific luau at the Hyatt, the host of the show was very lounge lizardy, and the whole experience can't even compare with the luau at the Polynesian Cultural Center on Oahu. We've heard the Old Lahaina Luau was good, but for the money, the Hyatt luau was not worth it. We enjoyed our stay at the MMOC and would stay there again.

The restaurant at the hotel was very good and the Beach Walk is great for lunch with salads, sandwiches, and hot food to order. The older time shares only have a microwave and fridge but we were able to eat most breakfasts and lunches in the room to save some money. One recommendation would be to get to the pool early. Many people go down and just put their towels on the chairs and don't come back for a couple hours. The staff seemed to be better this year about taking towels off chairs that had not been occupied for 45 minutes.

On the website for the Marriott, it looks like the Pirate Ship play area was bigger than it is. That play area is for toddlers...not for any children over the age of 6. (That what my daughter thought anyways) The grounds were gorgeous, and there were plenty of empty lounge chairs. We really enjoyed this time of year....we could sit on the cabana lounge chairs on the beach and actually see whales playing in the ocean. Amazing. The staff was wonderful....and very courteous.

The condo was clean with comfortable beds and the view, despite the construction, was great. The pool is spacious and not too crowded and even though there were plenty of people there we were able to find chairs. They do have a 45 min rule for chairs which means that those that came down early and put towels on chairs and then failed to show for sometime lost their chairs. This seems fair to me. We generally found chairs closer to the ocean. Take advantage of cabana rental, a most relaxing way to spend the day. The little market was very convienent for coffee, and a lunch if desired and we had a good meal at the pool bar. We generally prepared breakfast and lunch in the condo with supplies from Safeway and Foodland. It was great to be able to walk to Whaler's village for dinner and Lahaina is a short drive.

We needed only one night because we had a reservation at the Westin Villas starting 11-4-06 but our week at the Embassy ended on 11-3-06, however I booked 2 nights so we would have a place to stay between Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s check out time of 10:00 AM and Westin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s check in time at 4:00 PM. We enjoyed our stay so much we ended up staying both nights and into the late afternoon on the 5th! (Got the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153keys\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the Westin around 1:00PM on the 4th but never stayed there that first night) At first I was disappointed when we were given a unit on the 2nd floor until I opened the door. Our unit was in the Molokini tower one unit away from being ocean front with a beautiful view of the pool and ocean. I could have thrown a rock and hit a wave! The unit was just refurbished and we were the first people to use it. Mike the bellman went out of his way to get us checked in early and we had a lot of stuff (food, drink etc.) because we had just come from a week at the Embassy. Everything was new. The colors were bold and tropical on the walls and the furniture had a tropical theme as well. The lanai was deeper than some due to our location on the 2nd floor and we really enjoyed listening to the crashing waves when we were out there. They installed radius shower rods so you have a little more room in the tub/shower combo in the bathrooms and they now have a very large round shower head as well. To only real negative in the bathroom is no fan. The bathrooms are compact but the slab granite vanity top is wall to wall so there is a lot of counter space. We had a new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Revive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (sp) bed but it was too hard for both my husband and me. In 2004 the bed was perfect. The kitchenette has a sink, dishwasher, microwave and small refrigerator. I really thought the Westin did a much better job with their kitchenettes (on the studio side) than the Marriott but it was a non issue for us. We never had any trouble getting chairs and the pool was fantastic and we had LOTS of fun in the pool. My husband played water volleyball and had a great time and met some really nice people. Everyone we met there was very nice, from the staff to the guests. One of the women working at the Beach walk caf\u00c3\u00a9 even remembered my M-I-L from our last visit in 2004. We ate at all the restaurants, Beach walk for breakfast, Va Bene for dinner and appetizer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and cocktails at Nalu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The prime rib buffet on Friday night was very good. My husband and our son had the buffet and my M-I-L and I both ordered the small plate of linguini with basil and tomatoes and a salad and it was very good and not small at all, except the price of $6.00 for the pasta dish and $6.00 for the salad. My son could not believe the chocolate fountain at the dessert station. You have never seen a kid eat dinner so fast! The breakfast at the Beach walk caf\u00c3\u00a9 though not fancy was just fine. Except for my husband we all ordered kids breakfasts and ate at the tables there next to the beach. My husband and I had appetizers and cocktails at the sushi bar Nulu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and it was very good. They had an entertainer there playing music and the sunset that night was amazing! You could see the construction from Nulu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s but everyone was done for the day and it was very quiet. I never heard any construction noise so it was not an issue for us. I imagine it would be an issue if your unit was overlooking the construction. We walked along the beach path each evening, laid in the hammocks listened to the ocean and just drank everything in. We hated to leave and wished we could have spent the rest of our vacation there. The feel and location of this resort suits our family and any future vacations to Maui will be at the Marriott.", "Date": "November 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cDon't Stay Here Unless You are an Owner\u201d", "Author": "kimlovestraveling", "ReviewID": "UR6181731", "Content": "We stayed at the MOC on a Marketing Preview Package from November 23-28. They put us in the Island View rooms which is right above the front desk and faces the parking lot. When we checked in, we were given room 2027 which has a view of propane tanks so needless to say, the view is horrible. It's near the loading dock so every morning around 5am, you will hear the beeps of the trucks backing in. This noise woke me up for the first two mornings around 5 and 6 am. Then I found a roach in the bathroom drawer and a bee in the bathroom. So I went downstairs to the front desk and requested to be moved to another room. They told me that the assistant office manager, Cassie Cockett will not be in until 7am. I went to the beach and came back after 7am to talk to her. She listened to my complaint and said that there are only two other rooms available in the whole hotel and they are both only a few doors down from 2027. I requested if we could move to a room anywhere besides the ones overlooking the parking lot and she said that this is where the rooms on the Marketing Preview Packages are and since this is no longer a hotel room but a Vacation Club, the owners have first priority and they are given the rooms that they purchased so guest who stay here have no flexibility to change rooms. She did give me a $50 credit for our inconvenience. We were given options to move to 2023 which is right above the check-in lobby or 2032 which faces the construction. I opted for 2023 since I thought it was further away from the construction. Boy was that a bad idea!!!!! The room was very noisy because it sits directly above the front desk and you could hear the doors closing all day and night. I was awaken at 4am that morning. I came down and requested that we be moved and since it's a Sunday, Cassie had the day off. They referred me to the office manager who was not very accomodating. She said that since I am on a marketing package, there is no where she could move me and also that the hotel is 100 percent full that day. She did not offer much else and was not very helpful. So we sucked it up for the night since we only have two more nights remaining. I used ear plugs that night to help with the noise from down stairs and it helped a little bit. As for our marketing package preview, we went on the timeshare presentation and Hugh our rep was very nice and non pressured. He showed us a 1 bedroom ocean view and a 2 bedroom ocean front that we loved. The were in the newly renovated Molakai tower. The cost of bedroom ocean view every other year is $19,380 and the two bedroom ocean front every other year is $35,100. I think that if you are an owner in the ocean view and ocean front rooms that you will probably get great accomodations. However, based on the service level that we received as a guest on the marketing preview package, were were hesitant in buying. So if you want to rent here, make sure you rent an ocean view or ocean front room. Of course, you will be paying $350-450/night. The rooms in the Molakai tower are newly renovated and are very nice. I would recommend requesting this tower. The ocean front rooms are amazing especially the ones on the higher floors. The facility is very nice and the pools are beautiful. My daughter loves the kids pool and I loved the slides. The beach is very nice but not great for snorkeling. I was told that Black Rock by the Sheraton is great. We went to Kapalua Bay it was very nice but parking is limited. The best snorkeling is in Ulua Beach by the Wailea Marriott. i highly recommend the Terralini Sunset or Dinner Cruise. It boards directly on the beach in front of the Whaler. The crew on the Terralani 2 are so nice especially Jessica who is new and just moved to Maui from St. John. It's a beautiful boat and is clean. The food on the dinner cruise is good and although we didn't see any whales, we did see dolphins and there were only 14 people on our cruise which made it very private. I highly recommend this cruise. Much more nice and intimate than the Princess dinner cruise which is over crowded. Thanks to the Marriott Wailea for recommending this cruise to us. Kimo's is the best view for dinner in Lanai. The fish is so fresh. We go there every time we come back to Maui. The Old Lahaina Laua was very nice and the roast pig was excellent and so were the desserts. I highly recommend the luau. As for the Marriott Vacation Club, it's a nice facility but the staff is not as nice as the Marriott Wailea although the Marriott Wailea facilities and rooms are not as nice. The one nice thing about the Marriott Ocean Club is free internet and local phone calls. The villa rooms are nice and big and the bed is very comfortable. Overall, I would stay here is I was an owner or if I booked an ocean front or ocean view room and requested the Molakai or Lanai tower. Beware of the island view rooms over the parking lot. Some of the tower rooms will have construction views since they are building two additional towers. TIPS: Go on Ebay and purchase the MOC mug that you can get free refills for drinks. They sell for $24.95 at the market store by the pool. I didn't know this until I was reading some reviews. Valet parking is $10/night but be prepared to pay at least $5-6 in tips per day. Go get drinks and breakfast at Safeway and put it in the refrigerator. Go to the timeshare presentation and get $150 in free certificates for restaurants. Ask for Hugh Durham. He is very nice and non pressured. You may end up buying but make sure you analyze to see if it's right for you. Maui is great and definitely do the Terralani Cruise.", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cOur Island Home Away from Home\u201d", "Author": "lmg66", "ReviewID": "UR6048924", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Marriott Maui Ocean Club from September 1-8 this year before spending an additional two nights at the Marriott Wailea (review to come). Although our first day turned into a nightmare, the rest of the trip was wonderful. Upon landing at Kahalui in the early afternoon, we learned of the major brushfire that eventually destroyed nearly 5,000 acres on the island over the course of the week. Since early that Friday morning the main road from Kahalui to Lahaina had been closed and arriving visitors had already been waiting at the airport for hours before we landed. We originally had made a reservation on the SpeediShuttle (the only one at the airport, which I do NOT recommend using) to get us to the property, but with the backup they couldn't guarantee we'd get to Lahaina that night. We asked for a refund as we'd pre-paid online and were told \"no problem\" by the airport representative and that my credit card would be credited the next morning. As it turned out, I had to make several calls over many days and argue with a very rude woman to receive the promised credit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is why I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend the service. We decided to rent a car instead and take our chances, going with Alamo (another one I'd avoid in the future) because we already had a reservation with them for two days later. The person at the desk near the baggage area told me my future reso would be honored and I could pick up a car at that time for the same rate. After waiting in the rental line for nearly two hours with all the other stranded passengers, I was told that they would not honor my original reservation and that I had to pay the \"walk-up\" rate, which was nearly double what I'd reserved. I spoke to the manager and they finally compromised with a discounted rate close to what I'd reserved but gave me the lowest category car they had, which was not the cleanest, either. Considering our predicament and the fact that it had already been six hours since landing that we'd been at the airport - for our first day of vacation - we were happy to have wheels and to hear that the road had just opened. Upon hitting the road at 8pm, we were almost immediately stuck in traffic with hundreds of other cars trying to get to Lahaina. In the end, we didn't arrive at the Marriott Maui until well after midnight, a full 8+ hours after landing and more than 24 hours since departing Chicago. That being said, the hotel staff was wonderful, anticipating that their guests had gone through a trying time to say the least. Four staffers were waiting at the valet area to immediately take our car, hand us our key and escort us directly to our room, saying we could stop by the next morning to officially check-in and get our full welcome packet. They had ice cold water, fruit and leis to greet us, all of which were very much appreciated, especially considering the wee hours. The only disappointment, being owners staying on the property for the first time since buying in 2005, is that no one is immune from being put in a building with a construction view. Even though I had reserved 7-8 months in advance and requested the Molokai wing, we were put in the Lanai tower overlooking the construction site. I had even followed their advice of calling 2 weeks prior to arrival (when rooms are assigned) to verify my request and then again a few days before check-in. It was at that time I was told that owners who have booked (the maximum time) in advance, 12-13 months depending on ownership level, are given their first choice of room location and then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s booked from there first-come, first-serve. Despite the disappointment, I was very happy with the room itself and the property as a whole. Though the view caused me to steer clear of sitting on the lanai (which we would normally do quite a bit), we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t experience any problem with construction noise, as we are generally up and out fairly early and not back until after 5pm anyway. The only other negative was that our air conditioning broke on about the third day and the motor had to be completely replaced. However, it was promptly fixed with one phone call to the front desk and it caused no inconvenience (we were at the pool!). All in all, based on the vast amount of research I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d done and reviews I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d read, my expectations were not only exceeded, but I felt we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d made a great decision in buying at this property and really like what the MVC has to offer. We thought about trading away our Maui week in \u00e2\u20ac\u212207 to try something different \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this was our second trip to Maui \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but are so anxious to go back and see the new addition (including the new adults-only pool being added) and updated rooms that we went ahead and booked a full 12 months in advance for the same week next year. Maybe we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll even get our preferred tower this time! As for area do\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ts, I highly recommend Blue Hawaiian helicopter tours. We did the West Mountain/Molokai tour and it was spectacular. Also rented from Aloha Toy Store (a 2006 Corvette Convertible) for three days, which was fabulous and was used to drive to the top of Haleakala and to Tadeschi Winery, both of which were lots of fun. Spent my birthday at Ruth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris for dinner (fabulous) and then went to Warren & Annabelle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for the second time, which is always great. Also recommend Zui Hao, the new upscale Chinese place, from the executive chef of P.F. Chang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (next to Warren & Annabelle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Front Street), David Paul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lahaina Grill, and both Hula Grill and Leilani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village. All are excellent. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d eaten at Cheeseburger in Paradise in Lahaina last year and it was fun with good burgers, too. Finally, Maui Ocean Center was fun, with a nice lunch overlooking the ocean and harbor. If you have an opportunity to visit Maui, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitate! We really do feel like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our island home away from home.

The staff was extremely wonderful! Adam and Joel at the valet/bell desk, made us feel welcomed and Joel upon our arrival made us feel safe after a terrible experience leaving our other hotel/condo.

Also, on Maui, go with Hertz or Avis, avoid Alamo. The cars are completely filthy. We tried five different cars and they were all in the same condition.

Despite repeated requests to the desk for a possibility to move, we were told the property is fully booked. We, too, thought that was a crock since the facilities do not seem to suggest a full house.

We have no intention of paying this since it was not advertised, and there used to be free parking before the construction began. We'll dispute it on our credit card if we don't get it corrected before we leave in a few days. Our guess is as soon as the second new tower (not even started yet) is completed in late 2009, they'll knock this existing hotel conversion property down and build something similar to what is going on next door now. this would likely mean that this facility will be in various phases of heavy, noisy construction will into 2012.

You can tell the interior designer's hands were tied behind their backs because it wasn't built to be a timeshare. The slow elevators and prison-esque inside balcony/walkways are the first clue this is a less-then-hoped-for experience. They are void of any interest. They need some color... maybe hibiscus murals or something. You can easily imagine the doors as prison cell doors and convicts throwing down toilet paper from the walkways.

We personally hated it, but one thing we all can agree on is the lack of a washer/dryer in the room is unforgiveable in a big name hotel timeshare these days. Luckily, we only use the kitchen for storing cold milk, breakfast cereal and making popcorn at night. If you expect anything more, you're going to be dissapointed. In the pool area, there are simply not enough lounge chairs for the guests and no room to add more. They desparately need a system to stop people from laying claim to a chair in the early hours of the morning and never releasing it. More than half the chairs were empty for extended periods of time. The only way to get a chair is to remove someone's property and hope you're picking one of the offender's chairs and not someone that just went to the bathroom. The pool police are constantly asking people if they belong there. G-d forbid you go down into the pool without proper ID. This was mildly irritating because they should have been more discrete. Nothing blows the mood than overhearing people talk in official tones to other people. It became aggravating after we befriended a family from another resort and invited them to come by for some drinks and let the kids play together. Their kids were unwelcome in the pool and our new friends were unwelcome in the lounge chair area. Never mind that my family were guests and they were our friends. Never mind that more than half the chairs are empty (well... let's call them unoccupied). Management didn't care... our friends HAD TO GO. The awful part was the tone they used with us and our guests. Marriott was not gracious at all. A polite explaination would have sufficed. Instead, we were made to feel like criminals. For Pete's sake, the kids weren't stealing the pool, they were simply trying to enjoy it. We all packed up and followed them back to their resort on the other end of Ka'anapali where we were made to feel like welcomed guests. What a difference some class makes! The Marriott Vacation Club people bug the heck out of you to take their timeshare tour. They catch you inside as well as out on the boardwalk. I suggest you walk fast and look the other way when approaching these kiosks. We finally gave in for 15000 points. During the presenation they repeatedly announced the current building was not \"purpose built\" for timeshare and leaves a lot of guests wanting. The new buildings sound much better, but rather than focus on what the new buildings would offer, they spent all their time ripping down all the other timeshare properties on the island. Bad form and incredibly unprofessional. Sorry for being so blunt, but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone I liked. I wouldn't even call this a Marriott. I know Marriotts. I've stayed at Marriotts. I'm silver with Marriott (used to be platinum before I became semi-retired). In any case, this is no Marriott. We won't be vacationing here again.

This was our 2nd trip to the Marriott Ocean Club (1st one was w/o kids). We had a 2bed/3bath Oceanview villa in the Lanai Tower. Each of the 1bedroom and studio sections have a small refrigerator and microwave. It was enough to have most breakfasts and lunches from food purchased at Safeway in Lahaina (join the Safeway Club - which is free, to get reduced prices on groceries). There is no oven, so we had to stick to microwave items and cold cuts. Although the $25 Marriott mug (good for drinks from the Beach House by the pool) seems reasonable, it's much cheaper to buy cases of soda and water and store them in the room. Check-in/out was smooth. Car valets and bellmen were gracious and helpful. Upon check-in, they had everything ready for us, giving us our flower leis and a packet of material and ushered us straight from the car to the room. However, they never swiped a credit card which complicated things the first time I tried to charge a purchase to the room (a minor inconvenience). The rooms were comfortable and we had an outstanding view of the pool and beach. Each of the rooms (3 former hotel rooms converted into a 2bed villa) has it's own private balcony which made for a great location for breakfast each morning. We heard no construction noise the week we were there. The resort is beautiful, with several koi ponds, marine life statues, open air lobby, and of course, the pool. The pool is wonderful. It was never crowded, there were plenty of lounge chairs, and the staff is very hospitable. The waterfalls, the slides, and the kids area make the pool the highlight of the resort. The pool, and the resort overall, is very much kid-friendly, but it still can be enjoyed as a couple. As an aside, if you're looking for a quiet, adults only vacation in Hawaii, you're on the wrong island - in broad strokes, Kauai is for couples as Maui is for families. Besides the pool, there are other great activities as well. My wife enjoyed the new spa, the babysitter loved the workout facilities, and the kids had fun taking a break from the sun to do some of the special children's activities like flower lei making. The beach was great in that there actually was one in June as opposed to December when we had to walk a ways to see much of a sandy area to enjoy. On the ocean side of the resort, there is a walking path that extends the length of the beach from the Hyatt (one resort to the south) to the Sheraton (5 resorts to the north) where Black Rock is located for great snorkeling. Black Rock was about a 20-25 minute walk with 4 kids. Just 10 minutes (2 resorts) to the north is Whaler's Village. All 3 restaurants (Hula Grill, Rusty Harpoon, & Leilani's) are similar and have very good food and great views, especially of the sunset. Kid's would do fine at any of the restaurants, but it can get expensive with a large family. Whaler's Village is a good place to pick up t-shirts and there's an ABC store for various sundry items. We drove from the resort only a couple of times - to Roy's in Kahana (10 minutes) for dinner (excellent service and food, but there's no view of the ocean) and to Front Street in Lahiana. The Marriott activities desk was very helpful in making restaurant & excursion reservations. We did a Trilogy catamaran sail from the beach (about a 15-20 minute walk to the departure point) as well as Aqua Adventures (30 minute drive to Ma'alea Harbor). Aqua Adventures is power boat ride to Molokini crater for phenomenal snorkeling and SNUBA diving (great for those who have never done SCUBA diving, it's diving down about 20 feet with an air line attached to a tank floating on the surface). The crew was fantastic - they helped my 8 year old with the SNUBA and he loved it! I went SCUBA diving for the first time, then proceded to do it 3 more times later in the week - it's incredible what's underneath the water! The turtles, fish, and coral are breathtaking - something not to be missed! Island Scuba staffs the towel hut at the pool where you can sign up to do various activities, including taking intro SCUBA lessons and do a dive right off the beach in front of the resort. Both Vic & Rachel were my instructors and they would be great for any beginners or novices. My family loves the Marriott Maui Ocean Club and we look forward to returning many more times!

If you have children in the 2-4 year old range, the pirate ship in the pool section will keep them entertained all day long. The personnel service (car valet, registration area, pool staff, etc.) were excellent and friendly; no negative memories. For drinks, suggest getting the hot/cold drink cup which is good for the week at the Marriott Beach House and can be refilled often as you like during your stay. Fast food at the Beach House is quite good and reasonable in comparison to the rest of the island. Marriott's restaurant Va Bene was moderatey expensive and food was OK. A must is the buffet breakfast and the Hyatt Regency which is next door; it was terrific and offered every day. For fine dining, tried IO, in Lahaina; was pricey, but well worth the cost. Right on the beach at sunset, a mild breeze and wonderful music from the luau next door plus excellent food and wonderful presentation made it a dining experience. If you have a car, suggest that you utilize it for some of the tourist attractions, instead of automatically signing up for a tour.

Unfortunately this past trip we had the horrible experience of staying in a room directly facing the construction of their new south wing. What I came to learn after my desperate pleas for a new room, was that unless you actually own at the Maui Ocean Club, you are limited to the lowest garden-view room category. This even goes for Marriott Vacation Club owners from others resorts - even high demand resorts! Therefore you have better than a 50/50 chance of being stuck facing a huge construction site for a week. When I pleaded with the front desk for a new room, I was politely told that they were 100% booked which was a total crock based on the number of people around the resort and the fact that we never once bumped into somebody on our side of our entire floor the whole week! How Marriott can even allow people in these rooms is beyond reason. Construction starts no later than 8 am Monday through Saturday and doesn't let up until 5:30. And we're not talking just some hammer and nails. We're talking huge machinery driving enormous steel pilings into the earth. You could feel the impact from the pilings all through the resort. The noise level was utterly ridiculous. Granted it got us out of the room each day at an early hour, but it wasn't always by choice. Also, they're working on the elevators which regularly took more than 5 minutes to arrive on any given floor but were almost always empty (go figure).

That being said I read some reviews on this resort before going to maui and was a little nervous from some of the posting but once I got there and checked in I realized what some think is nice others think is a dump so read all of these with a grain of salt.

My husband and I went here for our honeymoon. We got it cheap by agreeing to a timeshare presentation. I was a little worried that they might be pushy but at least the guy we had was not at all. We told him staright up we were just looking and could not buy into a timeshare right now but wanted to know the information. With the timeshare presentaion we got a free car rental ( which we could not use since we were not 25 ) and a 50.00 voucher to use anywhere in the hotel. After we booked our hotel we put in a request for a room upgrade since it was our honeymoon. They said they could not guarentee it but we could request it. Upon arriving to the hotel the guy at the desk and was friendly and congratualed us and gave us a room upgrade. We had a hotel room and not a timeshare room. Our room was just normal size, why would you need a big room when your not in all day anyways? Our view was awsome. It was right in the middle and faced the pool and ocean. There was obstucted views because of all the palm trees but we have amazing pictures from our balcony. After we arrived we went to check out the grounds and when reuturning to our room there a bucket of ice with champaign and beautiful hawaiian flowers in it. We were kinda shocked since we didnt ask for anything like that! Our room service was just fine and no one tried bug us or kick us out when the room was ready to be cleaned. The grounds are absolutly beautiful and although we did not eat at the restuarant we did eat at the little snack shack thing they had which had pizza hut and all other snacks like sandwhiches, coffee, etc.. Someone in the reviews compained about the price, what do you expect, your in hawaii. They tell you to plan 100.00 a day just for food if you do not have in room cooking abilities. Another complanint was that someone judged then and asked them for their hotel room because they thought they didnt stay there, they ask EVERYONE! They do this because there pool is so huge and awsome(waterfalls, slides,etc..) they do not want other hotel guest using it. They asked us for our room # and gave us a red rist band. Also someone said they could not get room service because it is converting to a timeshare. If you want or expect room service do not stay at a timeshare hotel. It would be different if you did not know the hotel was a timeshare. The last complaint i read what about the construction. When we were there, there was no construction going on but travelers should know that you should ALWAYS call a hotel and ask if there is construction and if there is, is there a possibility you may be put in a room that is near it. If they say yes, and you still want to stay, pay extra for a room that is not near construction! Our stay was awsome. You can not beat the location, there is bus that leave like every 30 mintues that takes you to Lahina Town for a very small fee. You would need a car if you did not want to go sight seeing. Lahina town has everything from shopping to all kinda of restuarants. My only slight concern one would have is the crowdedness of the pool. By noon almost all the chairs were taken up. We would just find one chair, throw our stuff on it and go swimming. If you want to lay out ALL day you would need to go early to make sure you could find a spot. We also went prime time so it may be less crowded at other times. One of the most awsome parts of this hotel is that you can get a massage under a cabana infront of the hotel, overlooking the water-priceless! Another positive is that you can walk to alot of activites such as jet skiing. If you do stay at this hotel, there is a great restuarant about 5-10 minutes walking distance called Leilanis on the Beach.

We exchanged a week of his timeshare's lockout in FL for a lockout here. His FL property is oceanfront, we were given partial ocean view and told that they cannot guarantee views on exchanges. OK, fine. Then, as we looked out at the view, we looked down to see not only the parking structure, but also all the materials for the construction going on in our wing. Now, we knew there was construction, but they put us on the floor directly above it! It started with the trucks below our window beeping and being filled at 7:30am. Then, there was constant pounding and drilling directly below us for the whole day - aside from the lunch break 12-1. I don't believe the place was all that booked, as the entire week we saw one other couple get off on our floor - which had to have a good 50 rooms on it, so why they put guests there I don't know. Unfortunately, we got all unpacked and settled before I thought about asking to be changed, so for that I can only blame myself. We just thought they had the attitude that since we were an \"exchange\" (read person who already owns a property elsewhere so isn't going to spend any money buying here) they didn't need to take care of us. Unfortunately for them, that gave us the impression that they do not really care about their property owners, so we will not pursue timeshare options with Mariott.

The Marriott does an awesome job of blending the amenities of a 5 star resort with the friendly familiar feeling of home. We've stayed on Maui several times now and enjoyed the Hyatt Regency (awesome for couples/honeymoon) and visited the Grand Wailea with its incredible pools, but for us this resort, the location, the pool, the room, and the staff all add up to our favorite place to stay. Although the staffing is a little down as this transitions to an ownership resort, you are still met by a smiling friendly valet, bellman and given a lei greeting. The staff in all areas are extremely friendly and helpful, most having been there now for years. The resort itself consists of 2 main towers, Moloki and Lanai. We prefer the Molokai tower as even a garden room potentially gives you a peek-a boo view of the Ocean. We had a pool view/ocean view and it was awesome. The rooms come in 3 flavors: 2bd/3bth villa (sleeps 8), 1bd/2bth villa (easily accommodates 6) and the 1Bdr/1Bth lock-off or efficiency which sleeps 4, although we requested a rollaway and easily had room for all 5 of us. The small unit has a microwave, bar refrigerator, toaster, coffeemaker and dishes, but no dishwasher. The room was clean and the bed was comfy with a plethora of great pillows \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a big plus for us. As an ownership resort, they offer a free \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctidy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 service once a week, and daily garbage removal. You can pay a small amount and have daily maid service as well. The crown jewel of the resort is the fantastic rock/grotto and waterfall pool complex consisting of a 2 level pool, with waterfalls into the lower level, and a small slide or stairs as a connector. The upper pool boasts a large Grotto cave with swim through waterfalls at either end. There is a pretty good \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclarge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 waterslide that all three of my kids can enjoy, 11, 9 & 6. There is a in water basketball hoop and 2 Jacuzzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next to the pool bar. The lower pool has a large area with shallow baja type steps that are about 6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to 2\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deep and very big (10x 30) for the little ones to play in. In addition there is a kids \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPirate Ship\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that rests in about a foot of water with water cannons, slides, turtles, dolphins and lots of sand for the younger kids \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my kids still love it and spent \u00c2\u00be of their time there still. The beach right in front of the resort is beautiful but not great for boogey boarding or body surfing as even though it is a sandy beach, it has some rocks in it out in the water. Venture up the beach a bit towards black rock and it is nice and sandy and less of a shore break. The beach is pretty safe, with waves pretty mellow and a pretty gentle current, but there are no lifeguards so watch the kids (and yourself) if you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t familiar with the ocean. If you want to snorkel or dive, many people head straight out in front of the resort, or head down to black rock \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an easy walk up the concrete lighted beach path. There are showers along the beachwalk after you get out of the ocean, usually in front of the different resorts. There are 3 onsite restaurants; adjacent to the lower pool is the Beach Walk pool grill \u00e2\u20ac\u201c great for breakfast, lunch, snacks, drinks and even dinner. A note of advice\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 buy the bottomless Marriott cups for $15 the first day and you can refill for the duration of your stay (soda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, tea.. basically cold drinks, or $25 if you want to have the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mug for Starbucks coffee, etc.) Va Benne is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 restaurant, which serves up a fantastic, though expensive, breakfast buffet; made to order omelets, eggs, waffles plus breakfast meats, local fruit, cereals, the works. Be aware the 5 of us, (3 kids) were $70. Note the last time I was here my room included \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 breakfast for 2 and they were running a promo that kids ate free with an adult. Look for that when booking your room as it is a very nice thing to have. They also serve a nice dinner. Finally there is Nalu, a sushi bar/restaurant, that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never been to so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on. You can also order food from the poolside bar. The other great thing about the Marriott is its location. Nestled right on Kaanapali beach, it is a short walk from Whalers Village and its shops and restaurants. The entire stretch of the beach from the Hyatt on the south end, up to the Sheraton at Black Rock has a lighted, concrete walking path. Be sure to go to Barefoot Bar at Hula Grill at sunset; tables in the sand, palappas overhead, the beautiful Maui sunset, steps from the Ocean, the Black Rock torch ceremony and cliff dive and great, reasonably priced food. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s casual and a total joy, especially on Sun & Wed evening when some locals entertain with great music \u00e2\u20ac\u201cjazz and local blend\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 electric Ukulele. The resort is also an easy 5-10 minute drive into Lahaina were front street is full of shops, restaurants and galleries of all kinds. Hit Kimo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for their famous Hula Pie and Bubba Gumps for GREAT fish & chips, coconut shrimp, and clam chowder. Drive into Lahaina 1 morning, take a left at Pizza Hut and there is a great local bakery back in the industrial area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hard to find, but some great bread, cinnamon rolls,etc. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been in August several times \u00e2\u20ac\u201c first weekend is the Maui Onion Festival and Whalers Village has some great festivities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c incredible onion rings. We went in April this time and had low-mid 80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weather, a breeze a couple days, and 1 day with some drizzle. The restaurants and shops weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t crowded, there were still even a few straggler whales to be seen, the resort was not crowded and the weather was really perfect. Although this is an ownership resort now, you can still log on to Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vacation Club website and rent villa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Keep an eye out as there are sometimes pretty great specials \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m looking at an ad for a 1 Bdr villa right now for $186/night. This is such an awesome resort that everyone should give it a try. If you are heading to Hawaii, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend Maui, and if in Maui, the Marriott Ocean Club is great. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already booked my room for next year, so if you are there in April, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be the family that looks like were home, because that is what we consider the Maui Ocean Club \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our home in paradise.", "Date": "May 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Niles, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cVery poor luau presentation\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3439694", "Content": "The luau presentation was very deceptive, courtesy of their Master of Ceremonies.

Since we were offered a very nice 5 days, 6 nights package from Marriott that included a rental car and some benefits, we decided to take them up on it since we love Maui. We were not disappointed in most areas. We asked for and got a higher floor room, of course, with a mountain view and with the parking lot below. However, the mountains are very beautiful and it was just fine with the view. We were very happy with the friendly staff and the service. The pool area is very nice although crowded. Here are some things that need to be aware of: - We were told that by the end of April, the entire hotel will become time share with new interiors. There will be no normal hotel bookings in the future. - The current hotel rooms are nice, but the bathrooms are old, but clean with not bathroom smells. Again, we were told that the new time share rooms will be taking 2 - 3 of these rooms and completely redo the interiors. - The hotel and the new time share is really geared for families with kids and so if your are a couple, honeymoon or mature and do not want to be bothered with kids yelling, running and jumping in the jaccuzi with you, then this is not the place for you. If you have kids, this is a great place for the kids. - Food is pricey at the hotel, but with Safeways, K-Mart and Costco on the island, there is not reason not to take advantage of the in-room refigerators. - Parking is at a premium and they charge you $9.00 per day, but just use the valet parking and gave them a $2.00 tip when picking up your car and there is not a problem. Just a point on time-shares on Maui. Many of the major hotels in Kanapali and other points in Maui are moving away from normal hotel services to time-shares. These plans can be very profitable to these facilities since they are offering only 1 - 2 weeks a year of use for 10s - 30s thousands of Dollars, and they add a maintenance fee to this. I am sorry to see many of our favorite places leaving the hotel business for these plans.

They were packed on the lawn by the pool and you couldnt see any bare grass. You have to rent chairs on the beach days in advance, and it is difficult to relax. This would be a good place if you have kids and are on a budget. They have a neat pirate ship in the pool and it looks fun.

I was using Marriott Rewards points for the room. In a nutshell, the time share portion of the resort seems very nice, but based on our experience, the few remaining hotel rooms show their age. The grounds and restaurants were very nice. We arrived a little before the documented 3:00 check-in and as expected, based on reading reviews here, we had a wait. They gave us a pager, we drove around a little while, and bought some ice cream for the kids (5 and 9 year olds). We never got a page and I figured the pager only worked at the resort. When we arrived back at the hotel, the room they were planning to put us in still wasn't ready but they did find us a room. BTW, they said the pagers work any where on the island. The first thing that hit me when I walked in the room was the musty, moldy smell to the room. This doesn't bother me too much but my wife and daughter have mold allergies. I figured we wouldn't get anything better since we were on an island and it's humid everywhere. (Based on our experience at the Kauai Marriot and Beach club later, I was wrong. The rooms there were fresh and clean.) We just popped the antihistimines and stuck it out the 4 nights we were there. I do commend the Marriott for replacing the bed spreads and curtains when I asked them the next day. It helped a little but what the room needed was to have the carpet, couch, beds, and wall paper replaced as well. They did their best to resolve the issue and I didn't push the issue any further. Other than the smell, the room was larger than I expected. Also as expected the hotel room overlooked the golf course, hotel maintenance areas, and garbage bins. We got the smell and heat from the dryers in the laundry area every afternoon so we really couldn't use the lanai very much. Now the good stuff. The pool is amazing. My son and I spent a lot of time playing basketball. The nice slide was not as big a draw to the kids as I expected but I did enjoy it. My daughter loved the pirate ship and the kids area at the pool. The wind was about the only problem making a warm day feel cold when you got out of the pool. We didn't use them but there didn't seem to be very many hot tubs. I'm not sure how much of a problem they have with non-hotel guests using the pool but the security and the wrist bands at the pool seemed a little extreme. The food at Va Bene was very good. We went to the Friday night prime rib buffett. Kids 5 and under are free and 6 to 12 (?) are 1/2 price. I found all the buffet items very good and fresh. The deserts were especially good. :) The Beachwalk Cafe while not 5 star did provide good quality food at decent \"Maui\" prices. We ate most breakfasts and one dinner there.

There is a Safeway a few miles down the road so no need to worry about stocking up on food. The food prices at the hotel were reasonable but for 6 of us Safeway was the better option. I did take my son (the seafood die-hard) to the all-you-can-eat buffet at the Marriott one night and he dreamed of crab legs for the next few weeks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was awesome! The first day walking around the property was awesome! My kids (11, 9, 4 and 20 months) were in heaven! The pirate ship for the little ones, the water slides, the in-pool basketball, 2 hot tubs, the beach close by, etc. We walked around 4-5 other hotel properties while we were in Maui and this was by far the most family friendly of all of them. I would recommend stopping at Wal-Mart on your first day (near the airport) and buy stuff like floaties, boogie boards, sunscreen, etc. The prices for rental are ridiculous!!! You'll save yourself a ton of cash with this advice. We spend maybe $100 at Wal-Mart for all the fun amenities and the kids were good to go. You can rent all of your snorkeling gear near Safeway at the Maui Dive Shop. This is one instance where rental saves money over purchase. You can walk about 30 minutes north towards the Sheraton property and go snorkeling at Black Rock \u00e2\u20ac\u201c WOW!!! Or head down south a mile or so and snorkel at some of the public parks. We even had church one Sunday at the Calvary Chapel Maui \u00e2\u20ac\u201c right on the beach!!! How cool is that!? It was a bit difficult to pay attention to the sermon when there were sea turtles playing in the background. You have to go to Lahaina one night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Front Street. What a great place \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only a few miles from the hotel. There are a million little shops and great restaurants. Beware of the dent it might put in your wallet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not expensive but many purchasing options! However, we found that Wal-Mart has the absolute best prices for your take home souvenirs such as the chocolate-covered Macadamia nuts, Kona coffee, etc. We waited till the day of departure, brought huge duffle bag, and stuffed it with goodies! My wife and I also attended a timeshare presentation at the Marriott to earn 15,000 Marriott points and were impressed by how \"non-salesie\" the pitch was - I recommend it! All-in-all, this was the best family vacation we have ever had. I may be a little biased because the entire 10 days were free but this is one of the best resorts our family has ever stayed at. I am not sure if I would pick this hotel for a romantic getaway with the wife but it can't be beat for the response you'll get from your kids!", "Date": "February 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "LR , Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cStill as good as always\u201d", "Author": "divot", "ReviewID": "UR3090155", "Content": "We stayed here for the week of New Years and it was great.

After staying at the HHV on Oahu we were sooooo disappointed. We got there before 3 pm. This is a definite no no. You can't get into a room before then. And they leave your luggage right out in the open, anyone could come by and take a small bag. The girl at the desk before 3 pm was not a happy camper and very strick about the rules. When we got to our room it had stains on the rug, it smelled dirty and the toilet didn't flush properly. I didn't even want to touch anything. Also, our view was of the parking lot. We were thinking of trying to switch hotels, but after a long walk on the beach, we went to the desk (new girl behind the counter) and explained the problem about our room and she moved us to a cleaner room with a better view. Same interior, just cleaner. We understood that we were there on a time share special, but I would think if they were trying to get us to buy something we would be in a room that would make us want to stay. The exterior of the hotel (motel type room entrance) was very nice. The beach was not easily accessible from the Marriott, but if you walked a bit you could get on the beach. Once on the beach it was nice in front of the other hotels. Dispite the disappointment in our room we had a great time away from our hotel, which was most of the time. My husband rented clubs and played golf. He was unimpressed with the care they gave the clubs. They had not been cleaned. We went to Whalers Village which is easy to walk to for shopping and restaurants. They also have an ABC store to pick up water and goodies. And it felt safe at night walking. Also, we went into Lahiana and ate at Bubba Gump's and Longhi's. We liked both, especially Bubba's. We went to the Warren and Annabell show in Lahiana which was great. Lahiana is about a 20 minute ride. This was our favorite island. Stay in this area, very nice. Next time we will try the Westin, which looked nice from the outside. But I will read the reviews first. The timeshare was not aggressive at all, which was good. Before we went to the talk we were thinking of buying, but it was high priced and our room was so unimpressive that it was a no.

We are current time share owners at Desert Springs and traded into the Maui Marriott. We traded a one bedroom for a one bedroom so we were unsure what to think the Maui room would be like but I would have to say out of all of the Marriotts we have stayed in this was by far the worst room we have had. From a location stand point it is Number One but for the room it was below average compared to other vacation club timeshares we have stayed in. Basically the two rooms are two hotel rooms with a door connecting them. The breakfast bar is a small fridge, a microwave, and a dishwasher. Every Marriott timeshare we have stayed in has had a full kitchen so not having one was different. We knew going in that this was the case so for Marriott owners who trade in understand that you will not be able to cook in the room. With all that being said we did have a great view of the pool and did have a ocean view from the third floor. For the pool it is by far the most impressive pool I have ever seen. With the water slides and the waterfalls it is a childs paradise and I do mean childs because there is more kids at this place than I have ever seen. If you are traveling on a honeymoon or looking for a relaxing spot away from children this is not the place. Granted we were here during vacation week but there were alot of families and all of the kids were having a great time in the pool. I know that everyone has said that everything is expensive here and they are right for a family of four to go eat just about anywhere on the island is 75-80.00. Kids meals are 6.00 for just about all entrees with fries but does not include a drink so plan on spending 16-18.00 on feeding two kids off of the kids menu. Every resturant we went to pretty much had the same prices. We ate alot of our meals at the Whalers Village at Leilanis and the Hula Grill. Both spots are great and very casual. Try to get there before 7 or you will have an hour wait. We did not do the Marriott Maui because we thought it was too expensive. Our quote for two adults and two kids was 220.00. It seemed way to high for what you received. For excursions we did Trilogy snorkeling with a trip to Molokini for 350.00 which was two adults and two children. You go out on a catamaran and it's alot of fun. We saw whales on the way to Molokini and once there we snorkeled for about 45 minutes and then went to Turtle town and swam with sea turtles. While there the crew made us a great lunch and then we headed back to the harbor. If you do one thing on your trip go onto a trilogy excursion. It was by far the best thing we did. Our 5 and 6 year old children loved the boat and the crew.

I agree with many of the reviews regarding this hotel. It is right on the water, the beach is VERY narrow (15-20 feet MAX), and the rooms are well appointed. I did not find it very expensive, however. At least not as Hawaii resorts go. The American breakfast at the walk-up beachwalk (20 feet from the sand max.) was $8.95 and the breakfast buffet at the sit-down Italian restaurant was $19.95 kids free. Lunch is similar. There are specials as well, happy hour, Weds night sushi. The great thing about this resort is that it is part timeshare part hotel (we are staying in the hotel this week and the timeshare next week) which means you can bring your own provisions to the pool. I recommend you stock-up at the walmart, big-K, or Costco near the airport. This will save you TONS OF MONEY! I bought a smoothie (non-alcoholic) by the pool and it was $7 with tip. The pool is terrific for kids and even adults can avoid the children in certain sections of the behemoth structure. overall, it is pretty nice, especially for families. It is NOT a quiet spot for lovers (honeymooners). It is also located in a very touristy location. If you are looking to get away to a tropical escape, I really don't think this is it.

We were lucky as I had Marriott points so we stayed 4 nights for free and paid for 2. I was hoping as a Marriott rewards member that they would upgrade us since we were there for anniversary but did not happen. We splurged and spent some extra points for an ocean view room and it was well worth it. Beautiful view of the pool and ocean. Everyone there was very nice and helpful.The room was clean and functional, nothing extraordinary, but what you come to expect from a Marriott. The room had a small refrigerator as well which came in handy. When you arrive in Maui, make sure you stop at the KMart 1 mile from airport. You can stock up on snacks, beer, soda's , water for much cheaper than the ABC stores in Lahaina. We were on a tight budget so we also stopped in town at Safeway and got a safeway shopper card which helped as well. The refrigerator is big enough to hold several waters, soda, beer , lunch meat etc... Dining in Maui is expensive so we did our own breakfast and lunch in the room. At sunset, we would sit on the balcony and have beer/wine and snacks. Very beautiful and then we would splurge on dinner. Hula grill is nice. Note to football fans, Sunday Ticket is available at Rusty Harpoon in Whaler's Village beginning at 8am Maui time! Nice because you have all the games on and turn your head and the beautiful ocean is right in front of you. If you want to eat on the cheap, there are coupons in some of the local travel guides. We walked to Johnny's Burger Joint, just down the main road, Kanaapali Parkway. They had a coupon for burger, fries and a beer $7.99 Also, good pizza place above it. Across the street from them is the golf course and their restaurant is called Mango Grill. They have happy hour from 3-6 with some good beer specials and appetizers. There is a shuttle at the bottom of the hill of the Marriott property, $1 each way takes you into Lahaina and you don't have to worry about parking. We ate at both Cheeseburger in Paradise and Hard Rock Cafe just to say we did it. As far as activities, we had a surfing lesson at the Marriott which was alot of fun, the instructor was great and we were the only 2 students so nice, personalized attention. We drove the road north of Kanaapali, thru Kapalua and beyond and it was beautiful but curvey and somewhat nerve racking. A preview of the road to Hana I believe, we didnt make it there this time but definetly will next time.

Although we were staying at the Embassy Suites, we liked the layout of the Marriott better. We found the developer's timeshare prices to be very high; however, there is a great secondary market for timeshares on Maui. It is possible to save a great deal of money by making your purchase directly from an individual who purchased their timeshare from the developer. Obviously the developer's representative will try to tell you that you are really loosing out if you don't make your purchase from them. It is true that you will not be able to use the Marriott points conversion if you don't purchase from Marriott, but you will still be able to enroll in Interval and have the same trading ability. We are not making our purchase for trading purposes because we intend to visit this property every year. If you look into making your timeshare purchase on the secondary market, you will discover that you can save 30 to 35 percent on the more upscale rooms. We are purchasing an ocean front room from the original purchaser. The Marriott Ocean Club appears to hold its value better than the Embassy Suites because you can save almost 50 percent if you purchase an Embassy timeshare, but I looked for a long time and could not duplicate that savings. I believe that the location of the Marriott is far superior to the Embassy. We have a friend that has actually purchased a total of eight weeks at the Marriott. He made his original purchases from Marriott, but he is now making his purchases in the secondary market. There are usually several Marriott listings on E-Bay, but I don't know how much protection you would have if you purchase from a seller at auction.

Cons: Hotel allows semi trucks to park sideways thus taking up 8 spots each. With 2 trucks one night, we had to park precariously behind one of them. No vehicle damage thank goodness. Chair and mini ottoman are dated/worn. Beds appear older and did not provide the most comfortable night's rest. Breakfast was plain so we never ate at hotel.

The hotel attended to every last detail, from welcome amenities in the room that included football cookies, a \"Welcome to Indiana\" candy bar, and a pamphlet with maps, shopping, restaurants, and all the Super Bowl parties. The hotel is clean, the rooms are nice sized, the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating, and the location is great. 10 minutes straight north on US 31 to downtown Indy, and 5 minutes south to any chain restaurant you could want (Cheesecake Factory, Chili's, Ruby Tuesday's, Hooters, City Barbecue, etc.), as well as a Simon mall. There is also a CVS right on the corner and the location is a few hundred yards south of the highway. I actually had a prepaid reservation at a similar category hotel by the airport, but the place was dirty, noisy, and totally unacceptable to the point where I couldn't stay there. All the downtown hotels were sold out (naturally) - Luckily I checked on TripAdvisor and found this HIE - when I called I was totally surprised that they had a room available. Myra at the front desk was extremely helpful - she described the hotel in detail and gave me a very fair rate considering the demand for the weekend. Once I arrived I knew it was the best decision I made the whole weekend, and it greatly contributed to the incredible time we had.

The hotel interior is quite attractive, and check-in was quick. Our room was large, with two full-sized beds, an upholstered chair, a desk with nice chair, a small microwave, and a fairly large refrigerator (larger than dorm size but smaller than full size). My wife appreciated the full-length mirror in the room. The flat screen TV appeared to be about 40 inches. They offer free WiFi in the room, but you need to get a username and password from the front desk. The bed was perfect--neither too soft nor too firm. They provided both firm and soft pillows to choose from. The bathroom has a long counter with a single sink. The tub/shower area was clean and inviting. There was a bit of a problem with the shower--when you try to have the water come out of the shower, most of it still comes out at the bottom (to the tub) and the shower stream isn't strong. We reported that problem the next morning, and it was fixed within 30 minutes. The breakfast selections included scrambled eggs (instant, I think), sausage patties, some nice warm cinnamon rolls, biscuits with sausage gravy, and a number of cold selections (rolls, bread, fruit). There was a machine that apparently could be used to make pancakes, but we didn't try that. There were several sections for coffee and tea, as well as three juices (orange, apple, and one I can't recall). Pretty nice overall. There is a fairly large pool and a fitness room (but we didn't visit the latter). The public areas and the room were all clean and well maintained and the people who work here are quite friendly.

The entire place smells a little musty, the pool area is a little dirty in those ways that you can't really clean easily, and the exercise room smells very weird. The carpet in the huge, nicely decorated lobby is stained pretty badly. But you can tell the daily cleaning maids do a fantastic job. They just need to update and replace quite a few things. Our specific problem: we were in Indy for a con, and the people in charge stupidly waited until the day before to book a room. So we got a two double bed handicap room, which they admit, they never use. Well, you can tell. Dust accumulation in not obvious places, the shower curtain was just gone from the very oddly designed bathroom. I've stayed in a handicap room before, this one was weird. And slippery when showering, cause that makes total sense. But the kicker was the AC unit. It was leaking all over the floor, probably had been for a while. The room smelled moldy, the air itself was damp. We complained and they said they'd send maintenance in the morning. So we spent a night in that room and all woke up with funny feeling throats. Later that day when we asked is when they admitted no one uses that room, that they'd probably have to rip out the carpet and replace the AC unit completely. So they moved us next door, which was much nicer, but still a little.... eh. I'm just thankful they had a room for us. They had sold out the first night, which is why we got stuck in the bad room for the night. Two big pros for this hotels: 1) The breakfast is huge for a hotel's and awesome. 2) The shower is to die for. Just, you know, not the one in the handicap room, cause then I'd mean that literally.

The rude front desk person (short girl dark hair) said they are behind in cleaning rooms. Then when I mentioned my appt. & wanted to get things in my room, she said it will be another 30 minutes at least but she can put me in another room. Thought it may be an upgrade, not...it was a downgrade. Later that night my friend & I looked forward to the hot tub, went in & the water wasn't warm (the pool was warmer). We told the front desk which the maintenance guy looked & said he re-set the heater & give it about 20 minutes. After 30 minutes went to front & maintenance was talking to front desk clerk & asked him. He came in to look & said they'll have to call out to have it fixed. He asked if he can talk them into getting us a jacuzzi suite if that would be ok, said sure. Came back & told me that the manager said no because we only had 2 hours left (which technically was 4) & they wouldn't do it (good customer service...NOT!) So we went back to room to watch tv, what an outdated tv & the channels didn't even come in & were all static. The next morning I asked for a refund to Hotwire & the new front desk clerk (blonde & also very rude) said they can't refund which I know for a fact is not true they just won't do it. Then asked for the manager & he said the hot tub is not listed as an amenity so if it's not working it's not their fault. Whatever, he said they'll call to get it looked at, I said hopefully today because I'd like to go in it later. I immediately called Hotwire for them to note this & Hotwire called the manager & somehow he already called for service within the 2 minutes since I talked to him...liar! The hot tub was working later that night but isn't relaxing at all, the air holes are at head level & so loud, sounds like you've got your ear next to a loud car exhaust. Then as we got out & dried off noticed the bubbles...GROSS, black dirt all on top of the bubbles.

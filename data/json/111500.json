We arrived following a long flight and took a train to a station I can't remember then took a taxi from the station to the hotel. Check in was flawless and we were given a room on the 18th floor. All of the rooms in the hotel are suites. Our room was a standard suite. It was spotlessly clean and had a separate sitting room with two chairs and a coffee table. There was also a table with two chairs where someone could eat. The bed was big and very comfortable. There was plenty of wardrobe space for clothes and shoes. There was an iron and ironing board in the room. There was a large safe in the wardrobe. The shower was a shower head in the bath. There was plenty of toiletries left by staff each day if they were used. There was also a turn down service each night. We have stayed at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington previously and had joined the reward program so we got complimentary drinks of our choice each morning and a newspaper, I think the turn down service could have been part of the reward program also. We did not eat at the hotel so I can't comment on the food. The concierge helped us with a shopping trip to the outlet centre. The location is fantastic, right off Michigan Ave. The doormen were a little hit and miss, if seemed that if they felt there was someone more 'important' or dressed more expensively that they rushed to open the door for them first. This is not important in itself and I am well used to opening doors for myself but I don't consider that I am more important than anyone else or anyone else is more important than me. We never ordered from the room service as we felt that it was too expensive. One night we ordered in from Gino's East pizzeria. We ate also at TGI Fridays which was just around the corner. On saying all of this, I would definitely stay at the Omni Chicago again. I find the hotels in this chain warm and inviting with pleasant staff.

The only problem is that there are a lot of very nice hotels in Chicago. We booked a corner room, and it was nice. It had a window above the headboard of the bead, which was kind of neat. The room was small, but omni was upfront about that by telling you the sq ft on their websitie(I think 400sqft). It is called a suite, but it is no bigger than most other hotel rooms. What makes it a suite is just that instead of leaving it as one normal size room, they have made it into 2 separate small rooms separated by french doors. It does have 2 TVs, but the one in the bedroom is a rather small tube tv. We requested an upper floor twice, but only received the 11th, I think the hotel has 25 or more floors. We did not notice any areas of concern in cleanliness. The bed was decent. The fitness room was large and had a lot of equipment. The hotel does have a small pool. Having a pool is more rare than you might expect in downtown Chicago. The hot tub was broken when we were there, but the pool was warm. The hotel has 24 hour room service, which did come in handy for us. The location is great if you want to do shopping, but it's not the best area for nightlife. We paid 249 for a corner suite that included parking and $50 in breakfast food credit. That price put it at the upper end of hotels in it's class for these dates. The rooms don't seal very well from the hall. Noise and conversation can be heard in your room, though, overall the halls were quiet. Bottom Line. There are a lot of nice hotels in Chicago, this is one of them.

The person I credit with articulating the issues and having them resolved so quickly is Ms. Jackie (The Operator).

I needed a refrigerator for my food and she was able to get me one to the room by the time I came back from Walgreens. The engineer was Bryan. I didn't believe he was the engineer because he looked so young, but he took care of my issue within few minutes and I was able to get to bed at a reasonable time in warmth. One final person I will applaud for excellent service is Alice, Front Desk. She was the first person I encountered and my check-in was done with care and flawless. When I got to my room and unpacked, I realized that I did not bring my laptop power cord. I went to the desk and she told me that she would look in to helping me and get back with me. I asked for information on a couple of clothing stores, because I did not pack a white shirt for my interview and she was exceptional in both names of discount stores and their exact location. The resounding theme of these three associates is their uncanny level of professionalism and can-do attitude. I travel over 80% of the year and this was my first stay at your hotel but I can guarantee that it will not be the last.

I traveled with my girlfriend for a 5 night stay & we both agreed this was an all around great hotel. The attentive service was definitely a highlight - from booking to chekcout they made everything a quick & efficient breeze & did it with a smile. The concierge was polite and was happy to make suggestions and then call for the reservations (which we ended up loving!). Room service was so quick - order drinks, they'll be at your door in 5 minutes, no joke. We would always make a mess of the room in the evening/night & returning from breakfast to an impeccable turned down room was pretty cool, they'll even fold the clothes you leave out. Accidentally left $78 cash on the table the first day & it was still there on the last day. Even the valets were great - they would run, like literally sprint, to make sure you never had to open a door for yourself hahah. Valets, front desk, concierge, room service, all great & personable service. Wifi is a bit pricy ($14 I think?), but very fast Other positives on the the stay would be the big bathrooms, comfy beds, 676 restaurant (tasty!) - really great cheese & salted meats and shockingly one of the best burgers of my life, adequate workout facility (needs bigger dumbells), and nice deck outside the pool. If I had to nitpick, there are a FEW minor issues that I would like to see improved. 1) unfortunately the hot tub was closed during our stay (1/5/12-1/10/12) I think the intake valves weren't up to city code or something.. bummer. 2) the business center has some slightly ridiculous prices. It cost me $10 to log on & print tickets for the Shedd. 3) The view wasn't spectacular for my room - we were blocked by he newly erected Ritz-Carlton residences. Oh well, the obstructed view was still pretty nice. 4) They need a better bottle selection for the room service For the people complaining about the 2 elevators, STOP WHINING! It takes a whole extra 30 seconds to switch elevators and this way you don't have god knows who wandering up to your floor as they have to pass hotel staff 3 times before getting to the rooms. Once again, so pleased with our stay. Recommend it 110%. We loved it as a couple, but it seems great for families as well. I did one of those mystery hotels on last minute travel - Omni Hotel in a suite for $90/night. So keep in mind my review MIGHT the biased by paying like 60% off hahah As a side note, places we recommend Restaurants: -Everest ($$$$$$) fine french food 40 stories above chicago. SO expensive, but if you're determined to be luxurious, I would go for it. It's an experience for certain. Bring a sportcoat - formal dining room -Roka Akor: great sushi and contemporary asian. Do a sake flight -Grand Luxe Cafe: biggest. restaurant. ever. So much selection. I think we said we wished we ordered that to everything that came out of the kitchen -Signature Room & Lounge: dinner & drinks at the 95th & 96th floor of the hancock building. Absoulutely humbling awesome 360 degree view. Kind of pricey but 100% worth it. You can go & get drinks for the same price as the skydeck and its a better view. Hennesy martini - 'nuff said -Billy Goat Tavern: you'll never get a better burger in your life. Chicago classic. Lunch for $5 -Gino's/Giordano's/Lou Malnati's - all great chicago style pizza. Yes, we tried all 3 -676: as lame as it sounds to recommend the hotel's restaurant, it was one of the better meals we had & its not tooo pricey. Get the cheeses and meaths - very good. Hit up the shedd & art musuem. Navy pier isn't as cool as everyone makes it out to be, but go by at night and ride the ferris wheel. We went to a show at the Shakespeare theatre on the pier. Very intimate theatre & excellent performance. Skating at the rink in millenium park is cute, but go on a weekday or it will be packed with tweens trying to skate their stuff. The big metal bean in the park is fun too. Walk michigan ave - cool buildings, shops, and food. You can have fun their without even spending money Enjoy!", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cHoliday Break\u201d", "Author": "Boybee", "ReviewID": "UR122589718", "Content": "We recently spent Dec. 30 and 31st at the Omni to celebrate the holidays.

The location is great since it's on the main strip with a fleet of other hotels. However, the exact cross street that this hotel is on was very tricky to find and navigate. I got lost multiple times with my rental finding the hotel, it was quite frustrating as it's huge and very visible from the street. I was upgraded to a suite when I checked in but found the suite to be a bit outdated. The cable television was the worst quality I have ever seen in a hotel or motel. It's as if the signal was coming from the basement and had been split 405 times to feed into every room. And yes, when I travel for leisure I do sometimes zone out in front of the hotel TV to relax. I had the requisite extra charges and mistakes on my bill upon checking out for items I supposedly took from the minibar. This is a frequent complaint for this hotel if you check on other hotel review websites. My friend who is a Chicago native said that the Omni is very impressive when it comes to their conferences rooms and catering but I didn't see any of that. During my stay the service was just okay and very uneven but not befitting the reputation of the Omni. The first woman checking me in was professional, the bellboy seemed a little green but earnest, and everyone else that I spoke with on the phone had an attitude and didn't seem to want to be of help. Not 4.5 star service at all. The lobby of the hotel is grand but also very nondescript. The entire hotel seems to be painted with a forgettable, universal 'big hotel' circa 2000 paint brush.

At the least this is awkward but the elevators are reasonably fast and I never had a long wait for a car. The room(s) are good size. The suite has a separate bedroom with doors and a large bathroom. There is a TV in the main living area as well as the bedroom although there is a mediocre selection of channels. Pay per view is available at EXORBITANT prices. There was a wet bar in the room setup with a coffee maker. The mini-fridge was locked but I assume any items there would have been reasonably priced like the $7.50 bottle of water on the counter. I had breakfast and dinner at the hotel restaurant on the fourth floor. The dinner was quite good although the menu was rather limited. Breakfast offered a buffet or menu items. While the meal was OK (how hard is it to fry a couple eggs?), $20 for a buffet just seems wrong to me. The staff was always helpful and courteous. The hotel location on N.

We called ahead to make sure that dogs were allowed, and got \"clearance\" to bring a dog that weighed over their 25lb max. We were very happy about this. However, once we got to the hotel, there were many dogs that were over 25lbs, we probably saw at least 5. Not sure why I had to get special clearance, given this, but it does not matter as we were happy. Also called ahead to request a pull-out sofa and a rollaway bed. Also requested, by phone and email, a quiet room, on a high floor, with a wonderful view. When we checked in, we were in a tiny room, with no view, on a low floor, and no room whatsoever for a rollaway. When I called in advance of our stay, Rosie at the front desk told me that it would be no problem to accomodate both a rollaway and a pull-out sofa. So, had to call front desk a few times once we got there, spoke to Emmie, who was somewhat helpful and somewhat condescending, and we were moved to a room that was about a hair bigger. No upgrades were offered, even though I inquired about the \"executive suite\" advertised on the website, and the Governor's Suite (empty) next door to us. Emmie told me it would be $150 more a night to move next door to the bigger suite. I declined. Our rate was to include both parking and a $25 dining voucher for each night. However, when I looked at our paperwork, I noticed we were being charged for parking. So, down to the front desk I went. I showed Emmie my confirmation email which clearly showed \"free parking and $25 dining certificate each night\". She did not seem convinced, as she said they \"get a list\" and that parking was not on \"the list\". Again, I showed her the confirmation, and she shrugged and said \"OK, I guess I'll give you free parking\". Interestingly, a family moved into the Governor's Suite next door to us, the one I inquired about, and they told me that they had been upgraded for free. Go figure. We are members of the Select Guest program which means we are supposed to receive turn-down service at night with free water. This did not happen either of the two nights. We also did not receive any housekeeping services the whole stay, despite the fact that I called about it. Good: location, price, Rosie who I spoke to on the phone who works at the front desk, 676 Restaurant, Miriam, the doorman, who was excellent and very friendly. all housekeepers that you ran into in the halls were very friendly. bathroom was nice, but small. shampoo etc and towels all nice. bed reasonably comfy but not as nice as a Heavenly Bed or equivalents out there. Mediocre: front desk staff, and concierge staff during our stay. hot tub was not working b/c drain did not comply with state laws. Rooms very small and dated. Lack of housekeeping. corner suite too small for a family of 4 who needs a rollaway and has a dog. We also did not receive the Omni kids backpacks, which my kids saw other kids with. Also, the doors are VERY LOUD DOORS. They can only slam. Not \"soft doors\". Every time a door closes in your hall, it wakes you up. Need quieter doors or more insulation.

This hotel has two separate elevators, one from the ground floor to the lobby, and the other from the lobby floor to room floors. Elevator capacity was often insufficient to meet demand for elevators, which meant that we at times had a long wait for one or both elevators.

You simply could not ask for a better location. You're across from the 700 N Michigan \"mall\" and next to Ralph Lauren, 900 N. Michigan is a two-block walk, Navy Pier is right around the corner and Water Tower Place is also easy walking distance (not to mention the rest of the Magnificent Mile). Service is where the hotel lost its fifth star. I had requested a King-size bed over the phone and been told it \"shouldn't be a problem\" though it was acknowledged it wouldn't be guaranteed. The clerk, when I arrived, seemed flummoxed by the request, and had to \"secretly converse\" (believe me, this looked as odd as it sounded) with another, apparently more experienced (or higher-ranking) front desk individual to see if \"a room was available.\" Look, it's either there or it's not. It was obviously there, and they were making the decision as to whether to give it to me. The answer was \"no\". But, wait, the clerk saw a money-making opportunity! For a \"small fee\" (it was small about $30 plus tax), they could upgrade me to a corner room with a King bed. Since I was already paying such a low rate, I didn't mind paying the extra $30, though I was incredibly annoyed at the behavior of the front desk person. She did somewhat redeem herself by getting me and my wife free cold water (I was extremely dehydrated from a very long walk at UIC). The room was nice, though I found it a bit odd to have a flat-screen TV in the \"living room\" (which FELT cramped and small; still it was a suite - plenty large enough for me) and a very old CRT TV in the bedroom. I was there for both business and pleasure and got personal wake-up calls (very early) on time. A cab was promptly hailed by the ever-present bellhops/concierges/etc. For a suite, I was surprised there was no microwave or refrigerator (beyond the wet bar). The room was clean and the bathroom area was large. The coffee was, I believe, Wolfgang Puck, and was also good. I DID end up with a $9.99 charge from the mini-bar (I hadn't taken anything), but this was VERY promptly resolved (without any issues) with one simple phone call. I also left my glasses in the room, which were mailed to me at my charge (again, promptly, after just one call). I have no problem with being charged for my own carelessness. So, all in all, a great value, a great location, but some service issues still to work out.

The hotel itself is clean and modern and is in a superb location for exploring the central parts of the city including the Loop and the Magnificent Mile/State Street area. Our room on the 21st floor was a good size and the staff even provided us with a mini fridge. Buffet breakfast included options to suit all tastes and we found that we really didn't need to eat again until evening. The restaurant is really very good. Free wi-fi is available in the lobby and it would be nice if this was extended to the whole hotel. Chicago is a very friendly city and people readily offered help any time we looked lost. The public transport system is excellent, frequent and easy to follow. We bought a travel pass for just $23 that gave unlimited journeys on the buses and elevated railway and we made much use of the system. We enjoyed a baseball game at iconic Wrigley Field and we were lucky enough to attend the opening football game of the season at Soldier Field, which was on the 10th anniversary of 9/11, and the pre-game commemoration was quite emotional. All in all, we loved our visit and we'd highly recommend Chicago as a destination for Brits and other Europeans thinking of visiting the States.

For me, the front desk check in experience was distinctive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Briana truly could not have gone more out of her way to find me a suitable room (away from elevators, with a view) and this is something that I have experienced very rarely; a great example of an employee taking initiative and going beyond the call of duty. It turned out that Briana had just transferred three weeks previously from another Omni property in the south-east; great to see a company like Omni offering their employees the opportunity to move around their myriad of properties. As many reviewers have commented, you cannot get better located than the Omni, in the middle of the Miracle Mile, with a beach about 10 minutes walk away, lakeside walk/bike path 10 minutes, the nearest L stop 5 minutes and the Navy pier, Art Museum and Loop areas about 15 minutes. All the designer/big brand name stores are within 2 to 10 minutes walk. By my reckoning, you should be able to see the lake from about floor 22 upwards for those rooms facing north (2301, 2303, 2305, 2309 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the same on floors 24 and 25). But rooms on the front right (eg 04,06) will be looking straight into the new Ritz Carlton residences being built next door (so close it seems as though you could almost touch them). I liked the suite-approach of the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c probably very few hotels will offer an all-suite proposition in downtown Chicago. There is a fridge (albeit stocked to the hilt with the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fully priced beverages), coffee machine, etc. An unusual room item was a can of spray starch. The safe was about half a foot off the ground, which meant crouching down to access it (but it was large enough to hold a laptop). The room is a bit on the gloomy side \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is because the small-ish windows have darkened glass, plus no ceiling/wall lights (just a couple of table lamps). You can switch lifts on either floor 3 (reception) or floor 4 (bar/restaurant level). Virtually all hotels in Chicago have their main lobby on an elevated level (I quite like this \u00e2\u20ac\u201c makes it more private somehow). There is an out-door deck on level 5 (go through the gym to access it), although because of all the other skyscrapers the sun is blocked for a fair amount of the day. The nearest supermarket is Whole Foods (just three blocks to the west); fantastic food at not such fantastic prices. For more basic items, go to Walgreens. Starbucks is everywhere. The CTA train to the airport (O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare) is about 1 hour 15 minutes door-to-door but very straightforward, even with luggage; the blue line to/from O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare does stop at an awful lot of train stations. The transfer at Jackson to the red line is easy. Consider buying a pass eg 7 days unlimited CTA travel is just $23. Two areas of Chicago I particularly enjoyed were the Old Town Triangle plus Damen/Wicker Park. A picture of the Omni from the top of the Willis Tower is attached. It is the building with the curved roof, to the front right of the Hancock Tower \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the other side of the Magnificant Mile from the signed Allerton hotel.

It was nice but I didn't get that WOW factor when I entered the hotel or my room. It was clean, a little on the smaller side for a suite but it sufficed, no fridge or microwave (though we did request and got a fridge even though it was late Friday nite). Service was great. Whatever the request, it was granted quickly which is impressive considering that the hotel was fully booked. Ordered room service for lunch and loved the chicken wings with the Asian chile sauce! Portion size was very generous for everything ordered and they were quick. Definitely join their loyalty rewards program for the free wifi, ironing, and morning beverage delivery. Doormen were very helpful and friendly. Oh one weird thing about the room design was TV placement. We were watching tv in the living room and the channels start changing randomly. One of our travel companions inadvertently changed the channels of our television in the living room even though she was in the bedroom with the french doors closed. We had a good laugh once we realized what was happening.

All of the rooms are suites and very spacious. We had a king bed and a sofa bed for our kids which was ok. The suite we were moved into was the same, but seemed cleaner and the carpet was in better condition. We were so surprised at the condition of the carpet for an Omni! We know you pay for the location and it gets a lot of traffic, but it really is time for some updating. Anyways... The location, the staff, the bed, the plasma t.v.s, lounge/restaurant, and views all made up for it. Many more positives than negatives. We will stay there again when we go back.

Having lived in Chicago for 15 years, we wanted a hotel close to Michigan Ave and Near North for our kids, knowing they would love this area. The Omni's location really was perfect...Water Tower, Hancock, Navy Pier, Millenium Park, great food, museums, shopping, river, loop, etc. all located within walking distance. Upon checking in, the kids were given these cute little backpacks filled with activities and treats. They thought this was great and wore them for the next 2 days. At the check-in desk, I asked about a room with a view. There wasn't one ready (and I didn't pay for one) but the clerk said it would be about an hour if I wanted to wait. He took my cell phone number to call me when it was ready. So we stored our luggage and walked down to Navy Pier for a boatride. Sure enough, within about 55 min the hotel called to let me know we could check in. The room was quite spacious for a downtown, city hotel room. A small living area with a sofa and tv, desk and bar area made up the first part. Through a set of double doors was a bedroom, also a decent size, with two double beds. The bathroom was nice as well and the closet had a lot of room. Went down to the pool, which was a bit of a dissapointment. It is a little small, but being a city hotel I can understand that. The three main issues I had were: 1) the temperature of the pool area was freezing! Everyone in there (I'd say 12-15 adults/kids) were either in the pool, which was warmer than the air, or wrapped up in the pool towels for warmth. It was very uncomfortable and not enjoyable at all. 2) the hot tub wasn't on and wasn't filled. Considerng the temp of the air, this was even a bigger disappointment. At least 6 people came down to use the hot tub while we were there, only to be disappointed by its emptiness. 3) the pook deck itself is made of tile and is incredibly slippery when wet. Why in the world this kind of tile was chosen for the pool area is beyond me. Three people, including myself, almost wiped out. I was really worried the kids would fall and hit their heads. It really was poorly designed. When we got back from dinner, housekeeping had turned down our bed, replaced all of our towels (which we had used when we got back from the pool) and left milk and cookies. The kids were so thrilled with this little gesture. The last thing I'll report about is leaving something in our room. Unfortunately, after we checked out and were driving out of the city, we realized that our 4 year old's favorite stuffed animal had been left in the room. I called the hotel and was connected with Chris in security. He took my name and number and promised to call me back after looking for the stuffed animal. Within 10 minutes he had found the bunny, called me back and offered to FedEx it, on Omni's dime, to our home. It arrived today. I was very impressed with the Omni and will definitely return on our next visit.

Upon our arrival, we were greeted by the doorman and the bell hop and within seconds our van was unloaded and we were inside the lower level. The car was taken to valet for $52 a day. In the lower lobby they offered 3 different refreshments - lemonade, water and strawberry mint water. They also offered us umbrellas as needed and bottled water for each of us upon departure. We ascended the elevator to floor 3 and checked into the room in under 1 minute. We were assigned room 1107 and it was 2 double bed in a separate room and a pull out couch for the girls. There was 1 bathroom with a bar and sink. The room was clean and spacious. Hotel Packages..We had 2 girls and so we booked a one night American Girl Doll package for 2. It included their own American girl doll bed with bedding and changes of clothes as well at turndown they received 2 cookies and a carton of milk and a tray of assorted pink/red chewy candy like licorice and gummy bears etc. The girls felt like Queens. The other 2 nights we took the $50 restaurant coupon for $100.00 in all. Now for the rest of the hotel. In order to get to our hotel room from the street you had to take 2 different elevators - no real big deal. The concierge was absolutely wonderful and extremely helpful. The pool was the biggest let down as it seemed like an afterthought. The hot tub was not working either. The fitness center was well equiped and everything seemed to be functional. Our only issue was in the restuarnt where my wife had an overcooked steak and sent it back. It took 35 min to get it sent out again and by that time we were all done and the kids basically had it for the night. Her dinner was free that night. The restaurant was also very nicely decorated and was very nice to sit in during the night time hours. I would have rated this hotel a 5star if the my wifes dinner was cooked properly and if the pool had been updated.

Hotwire has this place for very cheap... around $120. However, for those of you who don't know , hotwire requires that you book without knowing the name of the hotel you are booking. In exchange you get an incredible deal. The only details they give is the approximate location and features. Now the secret.... There is a site called better bidding that will help you figure out what hotels you are actually looking at on hotwire.

We've stayed at other Omni properties, but didn't select them because they were an Omni, just because it was the best deal for the best place at the time. I'll now start looking for Omni's first. We had booked reservations at another hotel when a very good deal appeared on TravelZoo which included Valet Parking and $25.00 per day food or beverage credit (turned out to be $27 per day). In addition Select Guest members (Omni's loyalty membership club) get their choice of 2 beverages delivered to their room daily, plus free internet which costs other guests about $11.00. In my estimation, this makes The Select Guest membership program one of the best around. I can just see the reaction I'd get at Hilton or Marriott if I asked for free internet or daily beverage service. Incidentally, I'm a long time member of both those guest programs. Now for the hotel itself. I've read other reviews which indicate that the guest rooms need updating, they were concerned with coffee tables in the room, the tub was too small etc . In my opinion, the suite was perfectly layed out with room for flat screen TV, a fairly large desk and 2 easy chairs, plus a sink with mini-bar. A seperate bath with tub/shower combination and a seperate bedroom with closet and another TV. Incidentally, in our room the coffee table had been removed, but a seperate upholstered ottoman remains.. Would it be a great room for a family with kids, I don't know, but how many of them really are? We ate lunch at the 676 restaurant. Food was pretty good, but the descriptions of the entrees on the menu made me chuckle. I mean \"Phil's cage free eggs\" and Caesar Salad with spiced nature source farm beef tip or on the breakfast menu humanely raised bacon. Some of you may be snickering at me, but I get off on overly pretentious descriptions which try to justify really outrageous prices ie. $15 for a burger. I forgot to mention that the Select Guest membership also gets you nightly turndown service which we didn't use because the turn-down lady said that it didn't inclu de a piece of chocalate on your pillow. Finally, as mentioned by numerous other reviewers, the property is located smack dab in the middle of the Miracle Mile close to just about everything including public transportation.

The idea that a \"studio suite,\" i.e. a regular room exists at an \"all suites\" hotel is baffling. In fact, the idea of a \"studio suite\" itself is entirely counterintuitive. And the thought that the front desk would give that terrible room to a loyalty member who had a wedding and brought 50 people to an omni property less than 6 month ago is absurd. I trudged back to the front desk after seeing this terrible room and asked for an actual suite - and was given a beat up, dirty, crappy room. Maybe that is how all the rooms are but it was not for me. We had booked using credit card points and since it wasn't costing us out of pocket, we almost just left. I wish we would have. The hote was the height of mediocirty. The staff was rude - I asked for new pillows and got a lecture on how there should be some in a musty bag in my closet. There were, they were feather and I had already checked. I was so disapointed that I had to take a walk late that first night. The only bright spot were the guys at the front door - we asked for directions and they were friendly and we needed cabs and they hailed them. Nothing special or personal but not incompetent like the rest of the hotel. Little victories. Maybe if i was in chicago on business and i had meetings from early morning until late at night, staying here wouldn't be the most depressing thing in the world. but coming for pleasure, stay anywhere but here.

The hotel is very nice, right on Michigan Avenue near Water Tower, John Hancock, Crate and Barrel. Rooms are all suites, which was great for us with 2 younger kids. Our suite was one of the basic ones -- clean, nice beds, comfy pillows, a little cramped, but comfortable. And we were on the 20th floor with great views of MI ave and the John Hancock Tower. But what really made our stay great was the service. You wouldn't necessarily think this would be a kid-friendly hotel, based on the appearance and clientele, but from the moment we stepped out of our car, staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable, from the way they remembered our names, to the doorman's greeting my 5-year-old son with a high five each time he saw him. Both kids were given a backpack with toys on arrival, and there were other special touches like milk and cookies at bedtime. We are members of the 'select guest' program (free), so there were nice perks that came with that as well (free wireless, morning beverages delivered to the room).

We both agreed that you just can't beat the location. The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance to just about anywhere you want to go, i.e. high end stores, an upscale mall and fabulous restaurants. Make sure to stop by the Purple Pig to have some wine and cheese for lunch or a wonderful dinner. The customer service was great. Everyone from the concierge and the front desk to the housekeeping staff were very nice, accommodating and friendly. Anything and everything was taken care of promptly and smoothly. For example, there was a lightbulb out in the closet, and they fixed it right away. The concierge was always available and very helpful for show tickets, reservations and great recommendations. It was quite easy to get into a cab quickly. The Valets worked very hard to hail a cab and were very nice. Let's face it, even the top hotels can and do have poor customer service. So, the fact that the staff at this hotel was so helpful and friendly was a huge plus! Now, let's talk about the interior of the hotel rooms. This is an all suites hotel and I can only vouch for the room that we stayed in but I think that the suites are all similar. So, the square footage of the room is quite large for a Chicago hotel and especially at the reasonable price that we paid. But, by dividing the room into a sitting room and a bedroom, this creates two small cramped rooms. The sitting area is nice, but we didn't spend much time there and so it was a big waste. Also, the sitting room had a great flat screen TV that was useless. The bedroom had a small old school TV and every night I wished I could have swapped it for the one in the sitting area. The bedroom also hardly had any room to walk around the bed. I kept tripping on the bed cover every night while going around the bed to get to the bathroom. Each day, I couldn't wait to get out of that bedroom. It was such a shame because the room is really a spacious room without the division. They should have taken out the division, lost the Suite title, had only one Flat screen TV and the room would have had a much more spacious inviting feeling. Also, the interior could use some updating and modernizing. Make sure to sign up online for the Select Guest Program through the hotel website before you make the reservation. First of all, it's totally free and there could be some special room rates or specials. You accumulate points towards free stays. The best part of all is that you get a ton of free benefits during your stay. First of all, you will get free Coffee/Tea, water and Juice delivered fresh to your door every morning at the time that you specify. Also, you have free shoe shine and pressing, free WiFi and a select guest representative assigned to you if you should have any concerns or issues. \u00c2\u00a0 The gym is pretty good and a decent size. Don't come to this hotel for the Pool and jacuzzi. We went there several nights and the Chlorine was so high in the pool but especially in the jacuzzi that we had to get out. This was the case every single time we were there and my eyes were burning so badly for an hour afterwards. It was as if they just opened up a bottle of Chlorine and just poured galloons of it in there. Trust me It Was Bad!! We didn't try the restaurant for dinner or drinks but my husband picked up a sandwich to go for lunch one day and it was delicious but pricey. We did try room service for dinner once and it was great and prompt.\u00c2\u00a0 If you are allergic to pets, make sure to request a non Pet room and have them do a special cleaning of that room before your arrival just in case. Also, we were not facing Michigan Avenue and overall our room was pretty quiet. I would imagine that a room facing Michigan Avenue would be much noisier. Also, if you are allergic to down feathers, you can request all foam for your room in advance. For a $10/day rental fee, you can request a mini refrigerator for your room. We did and found it very useful. There is a Trader Joes within walking distance and a Whole Foods nearby if you want to get some snacks and food for the room. As a side note, make sure to see the main stage show at Second City, eat at Gibson's, Sushi Samba and take a Boat River tour but only if it's a nice day out. All in all, we liked this hotel and would probably stay again because of the location, the friendly and helpful staff and especially if the price was right again.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo, NY", "Title": "\u201cHard not to like this place\u201d", "Author": "WNYer", "ReviewID": "UR88028585", "Content": "The city of Chicago is fabulous which makes a trip memorable on its own, but having a good hotel experience is just as important.

I do have a couple of comments regarding housekeeping, but they will not sway my decision to choose the Omni again on a return trip. Our bathroom could have used a better cleaning. I'm obsessed with germs so I quickly found a cleaning cart to swipe the disenfectant and began with the tv remotes, light switches, door knobs, and of course the tub and toilet....I know it's vacation, but since I forgot my clorox wipes, it made me feel more comfortable in the room. I'd would do this anywhere. Also, the top comforter was a tad soiled which is not unusual since I know they don't clean these every day. I called housekeeping and within minutes a clean one was delivered (although not as nice). Also, The doors of the hotel are so loud. They seem to slam shut and one night we turned in a bit early and slam, slam, slam...ugh. With this said, overall, I would stay there again.

Very disappointing. It had water damage around the pillar (on the ceiling) and stained carpet around the perimeter of the room. It also smelled very musty. This was not the first impression we were expecting. We called and asked to switch rooms, explaining the problem. Christina at the front desk apologized and switched our rooms without any hassle. Room #2- 1118. It looked good- we felt we could go & explore Chicago. After a few hours we returned to the room for a rest prior to meeting friends. When I pulled back the bed cover & sheets, there were 5 dried blood stains on the white sheets. (Along with small holes in the sheets). This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel? I called the desk and asked for a room without blood stained sheets or a musty, water damaged room. Christina apologized and said she would send up the housekeeping supervisor. A gentleman entered the room and told me the blood stains were \"rust due to the washing machine\". Completely insulting.... you could see the imprint of the blood. Why would rust stains be on sheets and why would they put them on a bed in a hotel room? Especially with the hype about bed bugs at this time. I was not impressed by this man at all.... Christina then moved us to room 2518. It was finally clean..... The rooms are poorly laid out. (Closet in the bathroom) I would not rate this hotel 4 stars.

Navy Pier is approx 15-20mins walk and well worth the walk - its a fantastic place to spend the afternoon and our bonus was the air show was on that weekend - fabulous. We also took in the Blue Man group show, tickets to which the concierge at the Omni arranged for us. Concierge service there is second to none and will do bookings or check timetables - any info you want they will get for you.

We loved the turndown service each evening - so welcoming to come back to after a long day sightseeing or shopping. We joined the select guest service and got free newspaper and selection of 2 drinks per guest each morning delivered to the room. Nice pool and gym although pool is a little on the small side.

Add to that the wireless internet didn't work. And finally the hotels own music starts playing outside the hotel at 5am and you can clearly hear it in the room. Why would a hotel who has guests staying for seven nights put them in such a bad room? Of course we were going to complain - they must have known that? So guess what I am now telling the world to avoid the 5th floor at this hotel at all costs. The next morning we did complain about the room. The receptionist said she could do nothing about it until we had spoken to the manager. Whilst they offered to phone us we felt it would be too easy for them to reject our request for a move over the phone. After waiting an hour in the lobby we approached the desk again. This time the other receptionist said that she could authorise the request to move. Why the first receptionist hadn't asked the second is anyone's guess? It's a great example how one poor or poorly trained member of staff can affect the reputation of the entire hotel. When we were moved (to the 20th floor) the room was fine. On departure there was an item on the bill from the room bar that we hadn't used. This was removed without fuss but shouldn't have been on the bill in the first place. Also on checkout the receptionist on duty mentioned that if we joined the loyalty program we could get our internet for free. Since one of the reasons for wanting to move rooms was the Internet why had none of the other staff mentioned this. We signed up and the charge was credited to our account.

The free Select Guest program got us 2 drinks per morning per person of our choosing delivered to our room, along with free wifi and 2 shirt pressings. It's a nice perk to have, especially the beverages in the morning. The restaurant is overpriced, but it's to be expected for the location. Instead of using our vouchers in the restaurant, we ordered the Express Breakfast (I think that was what it was called)and chose pastries that were delivered with our free drinks. The rooms are small but functional. The chairs that face the TV in the living area are not comfortable, and a couch/loveseat would be so much better! The beds are nice. I would definitely stay at the Omni again.

A reasonable deal in that useful place to base - the part of town on North Michigan where all the usual bland upscale stuff are the neighbours: Nordstrom and so on. To enter the hotel you take an elevator from ground level to floor three where there is check-in. Right from the off it was the good Omni service thing: polite and friendly people who keep their individuality - they seem to select people for who they are rather than turn them into customer-fearing smiling robots. And I like that. I asked for and got a slight upgrade to a corner room. Join their Select Guest programme and all this stuff is easy to sort out - and it also gets you free wifi and an item of clothing pressed for free as well as a daily bland morning juice (from concentrate) and a newspaper. Except the no-point-to-it-watered-juice it's all very useful. The place is all suites. And the first impression of the room was good - clean, well-appointed (coffee/tea-maker, DVD player, two TVs, desk, sofa-bed, CD-playing alarm clock) but it felt like the bed was in the wrong place. And the ceiling felt low. I felt a bit like I was in a garage. A comfortable garage though. Nice fabrics, clean, comfortable bed, decent linens, all the usual stuff - marble bathroom and nice lighting throughout. Anyway I got to like the suite with its separating doors between the 'bedroom' and study/sofa/mini-kitchen area as I was there for a week.. My only two reservations: firstly I could hear the conversation in neighbouring rooms absolutely clearly through the walls and adjoining doors. The way to fix that was to close all the doors to the bedroom and the noise levels were much better. Secondly the layout feels dated. Not the fabrics, but subtle things like the doors and the layout. But then, hand in hand with the architectural layout being dated, the great thing is that the windows open. And to me that is a mega-bonus. The chance to clear out the room-cleaning chemicals as well as get a breeze was perfect. So you cannot have everything. The Omni was perfect for my needs which was to be in the room quite a lot working on the laptop and heading out a lot by cab into different neighbourhoods in the day and evening. And so the location is ideal (but then all the big ones there are ideal too) as it is half an hour south to Hyde Park and the Southside and all that and more or less equidistant to Lakeview to the bars and stuff like Kingston Mines, to the Theaters like Steppenwolf and all that. I visited the gym on floor 5 twice. And like the rooms the place is just looking as if it is a tiny tiny bit tired and ready for renovation. It's nothing serious. There were enough running and cross-training machines for everyone while I was there and there are also a couple of balls, some freeweights. I didn't use the pool or the restaurant but had room service dinner one evening which was an OK chicken casear salad. Nothing extraordinary. Nearby you have deep-dish pizza restaurants (a lot of them) and I tried Giordano's and it was fine. There is also a Trader Joe's and a useful Whole Foods with buffet salads, pizza slices and other bits a few blocks away on the same street. And it's five minutes walk to the Hanckock building with it's fantastic view. And there's a Cheesecake Factory at the base of the same building so that's a bonus of sorts.", "Date": "November 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sonoma County, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat for young & old\u201d", "Author": "chef2rn", "ReviewID": "UR49022434", "Content": "We spent 4 nights at the Omni to celebrate my mother's birthday. We were traveling with our 2 year old & chose the Omni for it's family friendly reputation. We were very pleased. We got a great rate through the hotel's own website--less than $200/night for a primo Gold Coast location. Here's a point by point: Cleanliness--no problem here. The rooms were neat, clean & stocked with abundant linens & delightful bath salts (nice if you're a bath salt type). Location: Fantastic! About 1 mile to Millenium Park. We had beautiful weather & walked a lot. Rooms: The rooms are all suites, which is great if you have a toddler in a crib. Would have given a 5th star, but from our corner room on the 25th floor, we could hear the service elevator all night. We didn't notify the staff, so I really have no right to complain, but next time I'll request a room away from the elevators. Service: The Omni's real strength is the staff. Everyone we interacted with was warm, friendly, professional & dedicated. The concierge, Amiri, proved to be an invaluable resource for us Chicago newbies. The restaurant staff were professional and very knowledgeable about their products. Everyone doted on our two year old son & the Omni Kids gift pack (plastic toys) kept him well entertained. A woman in the lobby greeted my husband with a bottle of water when he returned from a morning run. I gave 5 stars because the staff was excellent, but not perfect. Cake and champagne the concierge graciously arranged for my mother was sent to our room instead (oops!). The front desk had me sign a form for a \"fit kit\" that was apparently delivered to my room & for which I would be charged $160 if I didn't return it. It turned out that it was never delivered. This situation was immediately and easily resolved with 1 phone call. Value: We felt we got a great deal. My mother & her husband were very happy & comfortable in their room. We loved having the restaurant, with it's variety of excellent, well-prepared fare right downstairs. We joined the \"select guest\" program & had complimentary \"good\" coffee delivered to our rooms in the morning (The Wolfgang Puck coffee pods provided in the room are swill). The \"select guest\" is well worth joining (free!) if you want to use Wi-Fi ($9.95/day if you aren't a member, free if you are) or have good beverages to wake up to.

Right across the street was The Apple Store, Garmin, Nike Town, down a block was American Girl Place, Neiman Marcus plus a million other stores. The other way was Nordstrom, Grand Luxe Cafe, H&M... a million more shops. We were there 6 days and I TRIED to get to all of them but couldn't do it! Maybe if I stayed a month?! Our room was nice and clean but the first morning I was awakened by heavy excavating equipment building a hotel next door. Be sure you ask for a room on the opposite side of the building! We were happily moved and all was right with the world. Everyone at the hotel was very nice. I used the fitness center a couple times. It has 3 treadmills, 2 bikes and 2 elypticals. I think there were some free weights and a couple weight machines. The indoor pool was cute but must be accessed through the fitness center bathrooms so there was a pretty steady stream of loud kids and people exploring. I LOVED the Loggia off of the fitness center! The weather was beautiful and they had a few loungers out there so you could relax and nap in the refreshing breeze. One of our best meals was a block away at Rosebuds on Rush. It was great Italian food, Huge portions, a great wait staff and a nice ambiance. The 2 elevators are not a problem. It never took more than a few seconds for an elevator to come. Check in (Hotel Desk) is on the 3rd floor. The restaurant is on 4. We had breakfast here each day and it was great! The breakfast buffet is the best value. If they don't have it set up tell them you want to order the buffet to the table and they will bring you all of the selections you want that is offered on their buffet! You don't have to get up, they just keep bringing what you ask for! PLUS we always sat by the window with a great view of Michigan Ave. Great \"people watching\" location. The rooms have a nice wet bar with a coffee maker. We ordered up a mini refrigerator for $10/day. Not bad if you need/want to store some food. There is a great Grocery Store (Trader Vic's) about 2 blocks away from the hotel. Lots of gourmet and organic selections. Be sure to get online and join the Omni's club! You will get free wireless internet everyday, 2 complimentary beverages delivered each morning with the newspaper of your choice plus several other perks!

When we arrived, the doorman immediately took our luggage/carseats/baby gear, which is substantial when you are on a 2-week trip with an 18-month old and a 4-year old. When we walked up to the front desk, the woman immediately greeted us by name! She gave each of our kids their own little backpack filled with toys and goodies for their trip. They were just thrilled. We ordered room service that night, and it was delicious -- we had the sausage pizza for only $18, and it was huge and delicious -- enough for dinner and leftovers for lunch the following day. Room service called an hour and a half later to make sure that the food was to our liking, and that our dishes had been picked up (WOW). The next morning my husband took the kids to speak with Melissa, the concierge on duty that morning...she was AMAZING! She not only was a wealth of information, but incredibly friendly. She also picked up that we were celebrating our anniversary, and when we returned from the Cubs game that day, a piece of flourless chocolate cake, four chocolate covered strawberries, and Evian water was waiting for us with a handwritten card from us. We were stunned! The hotel itself is on the best part of Michigan Avenue, and is truly steps to everything, including the subway and bus service, which is clean and easy. The rest of our stay was great. There were always employees around in case we needed any information, and everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. We could not be happier. There is a construction site right next to the hotel, but it wasn't noisy and our kids love to watch the excavator work every day. I had called ahead of our arrival to have the room baby-proofed, and housekeeping told me it would be taken care of us. Unfortunately it wasn't, but it didn't out to be an issue for us. The only other possible concerns I might convey about the hotel is the lack of a small fridge (we used the mini-bar) and microwave, and the proximity to the Northwestern campus hospital (we heard a lot of ambulances at night). Again, these didn't really turn out to be issues for us, and you're going to get noise anywhere you stay on the Magnificent Mile. Overall, we loved our stay and will definitely come back to the Omni. The rooms were exceptionally clean and well cared for during our stay. The staff could have been any better, and the location was perfect.

We planned & prepaid this trip 6-7 months ago, but it was years in the making. This was the 20th anniversary of my return to Chicago. I was moved away from my beloved home town at the age of 12 & was now returning for the 1st time in 20 years to celebrate my 32nd birthday. When we prepaid 6-7 months ago, I made sure to call the hotel directly to let them know that I was a Select Guest member, I had a voucher for a free room upgrade, & that this was a special occassion. I called 1 month prior & 1 week prior to arrival to confirm everything & I was assured that everything was set as well as me receiving a room upgrade. The plan was to have a corner room with views & possibly have a special in room dinner to enjoy the views. On our day of arrival, we had 4 bags & no one offered to help us. We had to haul everything into the hotel ourselves. We stood in the lobby w/ all our luggage for awhile waiting to check in only to be told check-in was on the 3rd floor - still no offer to help w/our bags. We get to check in & I gave the woman our room upgrade voucher & explained that we were Select Guest members & she said the hotel was sold out & could not upgrade us but assured us that we had an excellent room. As a Select Guest member, I had requested a room away from the elevator on a high floor. We get to our room & not only are we the closest room to the elevator, our room is right next to the ice machine room. The constant sound of people getting ice as early as 6am & as late as 2am was loud & annoying & right behind our heads as we tried to sleep. On our 2nd morning day there, I noticed we were still not recieving our morning beverages or newspaper. I called down to the front desk & a very rude man explained that I should have gotten vouchers for that service at check in & that there was nothing he could for us that morning. We had to wait until the following morning to receive what I had already prearranged. There were also a few times I called down to the front desk to cancel turn down service, get messages, etc only to be left on hold for 10 minutes & no one ever came back on the line. I guess I'll never know what messages I had. Since I wasnt able to get in touch w/ anyone to cancel the turndown service, I let housekeeping know when they arrived that it wouldnt be necessary for that evening only for them to return 3 more times & interrupt our evening. Suffice to stay, this hotel was very frustrating. The only positive about the hotel is that we were able to get a late check out, which I believe was the least they could do. Fortunately every aspect of our trip was excellent - everything we had preplanned/prepaid for went accordingly. Chicago is a fun city & we will be making this an annual trip. Unfortunately, I dont think the Omni will be any part of those. Compared to the other reviews here on TA, I feel like we were treated as though we were a nuisance than as guests. There are tons of hotels in this area of Chicago so I'm sure it won't be a problem. Plus with that huge construction site that is just starting next door, I doubt this will be a peaceful place to come back to relax to. We give our trip 5 stars, but our stay at the Omni 2 stars. We never did do our special in-room dinner since we did not receieve the room we requested.

It was such an unexpected and appreciated gesture, that I think it was the highlight of this Chicago weekend!! All staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Steve(n) was wonderful, and offered us a number of suggestions regarding neighborhoods to investigate (based on what we described as our interests) as well as the best way to get there and eateries en route. He was always right on target. We arrived at the hotel expecting to just check our bags until the room was ready due to the early arrival of our train. Instead, we were able to check-in immediately and were also granted a late check-out although we didn't need it after all upon departure.

It was well-equipped and we slept very well on the excellent mattress and pillows. My husband who usually begins his day at 5:30 a.m. at home, was able to sleep in until about 8:30 while I luxuriated in a heavenly hot mineral spa bath each morning! These are the things that will bring us back! The only reason I did not give high ratings on \"accuracy of bill\" was this: our printed bill that was settled with automated check-out did not match up with the funds that would have been charged to my bank. A charge of $8.50 was added after the fact for the minibar, which we did not even investigate, much less use. Also a charge for both nights was \"pending\" in my account, which alarmed me as we had received a special rate of, buy one get one night free. This wasn't explained at the time, resulting in my calling the Omni Chicago to straighten it out. The accounting staff was very friendly and helpful in explaining the situation to my satisfaction.

The staff were always pleasant and in a couple of cases were more than that, showing an enthusiasm for their work which is not always obvious with many in the 'hospitality' industry. In particular, one young woman working in the 676 Restaurant was a delight, sharing information about the dishes she served with an obvious passion for food and her work. 676, as noted in other reviews, is on the pricey side but it is downtown Chicago after all and the quality of the food makes it actually a good value. We had one dinner and two breakfasts, (one a la carte and one Sunday brunch) and they were both excellent. We also used the bar on several occasions as it was comfortable and convenient.

We received poor service immediately starting with check -in. We booked a corner room on hotels.com and were charged $50 extra for the room than a standard suite, but upon arrival we were told there was no way we had booked that room through a third party. We were forced to produce a receipt that said corner room and had to argue for several minutes. Then we were told, \"well, sorry we don't have any of those available right now.\" After more arguing, suddenly one was available, but only in a smoking when we had requested non. Walking through the hotel later, it became very apparent that there were several non-smoking corner rooms available. We were only staying for one night, so future bookings shouldn't have been an issue. Second, after getting up to our room, we realized that the bellman had not gotten all of our bags from the taxi or they had not made it to our room. After many, many conversations with the security team, we were allowed to watch security footage of the bags entering the hotel. The missing bag was not on the cart. All they had to say was as you can see it did not enter the hotel so we have no way of finding and returning your bag. I told them it was their responsibility whether it entered or not because their bellman had told us to go ahead and check-in while he made sure our bags arrived safely, which they didn't. When we left, there was no apology, just a comment about trying to get a hold of the taxi company, but that we should be working on it from our end as well. On top of that, the rooms are hideously decorated in a very 80's style. I had called ahead to ask about the decor because hotels.com showed 2 different styles online (the pics and virtual tour did not match). I was assured it was not the style it ended up being. The horrid coffee table was hard to avoid running into and had very sharp corners that did damage to both mine and my fiance's legs. The view was alright,but not spectacular.

Was told that would not be a problem. Arrived at hotel, and front desk told us they were full, and we would have a room w/ 2 chairs in it, and no sofa sleeper. Reminded the staff that I had called to verify the room type, and had two children who needed a place to sleep, but was repeatedly told \"we are full\". I ultimately insisted on the children having a place to sleep, so they said we could have 2 rollaway beds. The living room was so small these didn't really fit, and we had to choreograph the room quite creatively to get them in. For a 4-night stay this was tough! (I read in their hotel manual in the room that only one rollaway bed is allowed in the room, so this was technically against their own fire regulations!) Also, I kept checking on changing room to one w/ sleeper sofa (as I had been promised, and based on reservation w/ 4 persons). Each of 4 staff members at front desk always said, \"I'm sorry-we are full\" with no other assistance. Housekeeping was forgotten on one day, and after calling and was told they would be \"right up\", hadn't arrived an hour later, so went down to front desk to complain. They sent up housekeeping after another half-hour. Of note is that even though hotel says that the construction next door is mostly complete (the demolition), it was still VERY loud on our side of the hotel, as workers arrived with jackhammers early in the mornings on week days. Also, no night-time turn down service two nights as was described. Valet service was friendly, but expensive at $50/night. Swimming pool is small, and hot-tub is only for 3 people.

Right in the heart of it all. Great casual dining restaurant at Grand Lux two blocks away. We did eat at 676 in the hotel one night and wound up spending $90 for a kids meal, 3 burgers with fries and 4 sodas. Food was good, but not that good. The bellmen are fantastic. Very friendly and helpful with directions! Room was spacious enough for all of us. Was very nice we had doors that shut to our room so they could pull the bed out of the couch and watch tv in the living area while we watched tv in our bedroom. Wish there was a microwave, but again, not something I would base my decision on in the future. Pool was perfect size. Not too small, but not big. The hottub was great when it was working. The first night we got to enjoy it. The second night the water was freezing. The third night it was only 1/2 filled, so I called the front desk and someone came and filled it. Fitness room was REALLY nice. I like that they provide headphones to watch tv on the treadmills. The ice cold water with fresh lemons is a bonus too! The hotel was great and we will only stay here in the future. The reason we will be back is because of the service. Everyone that works there is ALWAYS smiling. We were greeted our first night with chocolates and Evian water (maybe because we are a loyalty member). We also received complimentary beverages every morning as a loyalty member and that was a GREAT thing! My kids LOVED waking to drinks at our door.

We don't live very far from Chicago so we took an early train in and arrived at the hotel around 10:30 AM. We were planning on just having our luggage stored so we could right away head out but the front desk rep asked if we were willing to wait just 5-10 minutes, we might be able to check in right away. We decided to wait and it was really worth it. We were given a 20th story king suite with a nice view. He even apologized that a room wasn't ready immediately....we never expected to have a room that early so already we our expectations were met! Room was very nice with a bedroom separate from the living area, wet bar and nice bathroom amenities. There was a coffee maker too but we are Omni Select members and they give you a request to complete for the morning and will bring coffee and juice to your room with a newspaper. We headed out and about and returned tired and ready to rest at the end of the day. So, decided to order room service pretty late....10 PM. The operator said it would take roughly 45 minutes for the food, we weren't really happy but thought....we are late so we will wait. Roughly 25 minutes later we had our food. It was good too. Burgers but with fresh made salads that they specially made since we didn't want the options given on the menu. I like that the food is served on a rolling table too so you don't have to sit eating off a coffee table. We had turn down service with Evian water delivered just prior to our room service. Bed was really comfortable and I had requested extra foam pillows and they were waiting at our arrival. The next day we had breakfast in the 676 Restaurant. We just decided on the buffet and it was very good. Fresh fruits that actually not only looked good but tasted good....strawberries, melon, pineapple, etc. Waffles, fresh made omelets, cereals, bagels, etc. Price wasn't bad for Chicago either and I loved their giant coffee cups since we are big coffee drinkers. Check out was easy...just dial a number and you are ready. We would most definitely stay at the Omni again. Service was great, hotel has a very nice design. Fitness center was small but had options of equipment. I liked that they have a sun deck with a very nice view of the city.

For starters on the days leading up to the reserved dates of our stay we received a number of emails from Omni which informed us of events happening in Chicago, predicted weather as well as restaurants nearby. Our arrival and check-in at the hotel, located just a few blocks south of the Hancock Tower on N. Michigan Ave. was a smooth and quick process. Our room, a suite on the 22nd Floor was fairly well appointed. We had our two kids with us so the two double beds and the pull out were put to good use. An armchair could have filled an empty corner in the Living Area and would have been useful to watch the large flat screen or even to rest your feet. The sofa bed sufficed. The beds were very comfortable, firm enough, but still comfy, there was an extra large safe, two TVs, a bar with sink, a large bathroom with two doors and even opening windows. Everything worked well and was very clean. We had signed up as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Select Guests\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which entitled us to morning juice or coffee brought to the room, at least 2 newspapers and free wireless internet (which would have cost $9.95/day otherwise). We also used the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Entertainment Rate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which brought it down to about $240US/night. Given the location, service and hotel class, it was great. We only used the gym facility that had about a dozen machines and an outdoor deck on the 5th Floor. It was clean, well maintained and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fee claustrophobic. I would stay there again, given the chance. As for our time spent in the Windy City, all of 3 days, we did a lot including Bobby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bike Hike (Northside/Gold Coast with Erin), the Architecture Foundation River Tour, a picnic lunch in Millennium Park, deep dish pizza at Giordano\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, a drink at the top of the Hancock at 6PM (no lines and great light and it beats paying for the observatory 2 floors below as you only pay for the drink), Magnificent Mile shopping and a wrap up dinner at Boka in Lincoln Park. If you are new to Chicago, I would highly recommend all of the above. We hit it just right with the weather, so that helps a lot. For the deep dish pizza, no matter where you go for at dinner time on the weekend (Uno, Due, Gino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s East or Giordano\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at a 2 hour wait, so go later, like 9:30PM. Boka is a fairly new cutting edge restaurant, maybe a couple years old or so. Chef is a Charlie Trotter prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 (C.T. is one of the handful of premier way up-scale restaurants in Chi-town with prices to match) and the menu at Boka is unlike most others. You will not be disappointed with he compilation of tastes and flavors the kitchen will put together, each dish is like a fine wine, complex and long.

Room service appeared when we asked it to and was absolutely delicious, and on a trolley that folds out to a full round table so you aren't stuck eating at the desk or the sofa.

Not a single member of the staff was ever too pre-occupied with his/her own work (and never chatter) to engage us as soon as we appeared and consistently went the extra mile even for the most simple requests.

We had complimentary robes and nice toilettries. The bar and bar staff were great. The only minor negative point was the mini bar was rather expensive but that really didn't matter.

The restaurant 676 has excellent breakfast buffet $19, but in this city, pretty standard. The bar is a nice holding spot on the way out of town. Geno's East deep dish was super (45 min to bake). Gene and Georgietti's also well worth it. We found The Chop House pricey and not as pleasing as G&G. The location is great if you like to shop. Amazing stores within a few blocks. The city was suprisingly VERY clean and beautiful. Back to the hotel. The turn-down service was a plus, the housekeeping staff was efficient. The only downside was the size of the rooms. The elevator system takes getting used to (switch at floor 3), but was comforting for safety. Would recommend the hotel, would stay again, love chicago.

The hotel is situated on Chicago's Magnificent Mile and is handy for the major shops and most of the museums are within 30 minutes walk.

With coffee, juice, bagels & cream cheese, our breakfast would have cost $15 each on the room service menu but cost us $3.50 per person as select guests. The fitness centre seems very nice compared to others I have seen, with complementary headphones and water. We just used the pool which was also nice, though not large. And it is open from 5am to 11pm which is another fabulous extra. With our package we had $25 per day dining credit in the bar, restaurant or room service. We used it on cocktails and appetizers one night before dinner. The food and service at the bar were great and the atmosphere was lovely.

Two large flat screen TVs, one in the bedroom, the other in the living room. Location on Michigan Ave is very nice. Easy to walk to shops and lots and lots of cabs. There's also a free downtown shuttle that you can pick up just down Michigan Ave, that takes you to Navy Pier and elsewhere. It's a nice walk down to Millennium Park. Why not five stars? Two reasons. First, our room was apparently near the \"service elevator\". All night long, we heard the relatively loud (to my ears) mechanical whirring of the elevator, up and down all night long. This kept me up for hours the first night, and I am not normally bothered by such things. I asked for a room switch in the morning, but they only had downgraded rooms. A woman named Cassandra was very pleasant and tried her best to be helpful under the circumstances. She even delivered earplugs to my room, which I used to block out the noise. Second, the hotel charges $49 / night to park your car. This is exorbitant for even downtown Chicago. Worse, the charge is not advertised or posted or signed anywhere, and no one tells you when you hand over your keys. You only find out when you get your final bill. I can understand up to $30, but $49 is very hard to swallow. I complained to the front desk upon check-out, but they just said \"sorry\". $147 for three nights. Later, I wrote an email to Omni, and got a personal email reply saying that the parking charge was a \"shock to many guests\" but that the front door staff is expected to \"explain the pricing and to offer alternatives\". Since this was not done in my case, they agreed to give me a partial refund, which I was happy with. As I said, the hotel was otherwise very nice, and I would stay there again (without my car) if I could get a room away from the elevator.", "Date": "November 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "southern Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel Ever\u201d", "Author": "tripletts", "ReviewID": "UR21388839", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Omni with several other people from my workplace.

The rooms are well-equipped with plenty of storage space. The rooms with two doubles have a double set of drawers. Some rooms have pullout couches in the sitting area so it's great if you want to share a room and still have a bit of privacy. The problem is with the service. I've never seen a decent hotel where the front desk is so underpopulated. When we arrived there were three groups in front of us and only one person at the desk. Several times I called the desk during the stay and got either no answer at all or an answer after well more than 10 rings. The people are nice and try to be helpful, but at one point we had arranged in advance to switch rooms and it took the desk clerk and the bell staff over an hour to find the record (which they did ultimately find) and get a bellman up to the room. This ruined an afternoon for us. Another time it took 15 minutes to get a cup of coffee to go at the restaurant because I wanted a muffin and they didn't haven any and instead of telling me they disappeared looking for one for 10 minutes. One other complaint is with the room service menu which is seriously fussy and overdone. For example, there is no club sandwich, but a club sandwich panini with herbed cream cheese. The caesar salad came with a whole poached egg sitting on top. I think with a small upgrade in staffing and organization, this could be a superb hotel. As it is it's just a good one.

The bed was very comfortable and they offered a choice of foam or feather pillows. The Select Guest program is a real treat. They give you a choice of two beverages and a newspaper and it's delivered at the time you indicate on the card. It was awesome to wake up and have fresh coffee, orange juice, and a USA Today delivered to your room and it was all complimentary. Every staff member I spoke to was polite and friendly. The people stationed at the entrance always said hello with a smile and I thought it was a nice touch when they said, \"Welcome back\" when you returned. I'm very particular about cleanliness in a hotel (especially if I'm there for more than one night) and I have to say that my suite was very clean. I didn't see any of the dustiness reported by other posters. My only complaint was that the hotel (and the others on that part of Michigan Avenue) are near the Northwestern Hospital and so, as others have pointed out, you might hear an ambulance with sirens blaring at any hour of the night.

The suite (it is an all-suite hotel) was nice and big and furnished nicely with double beds, sleeper couch, 2 tvs, etc. The bed was very comfy. The shower has adequate water pressure and the Omni provides bath salts so you can have a soak if you'd like. My one tiny complaint is that I wish they'd stuck the one full length mirror they provide someplace other than behind the door and directly across from the commode. It's odd placement (unless you like seeing yourself on the john) and inconvenient when someone else is occupying the bathroom and you're trying to dress. Service: Everyone was friendly.

To have one person handling checkouts at prime checkout time and NO backup is very regrettable.Single file, one at a time, please. No, it is inexcusable. At check out today there was no one at the supervisory level available, only one desk clerk who was not up to the job. Allegedly the others were \"in a meeting.\" The entrance to the hotel is poorly managed by the doorman with the result that guests are allowed to temporarily park hapazardly in the only entrance/exit for taxis and other transport. A good property manages their front door to the house better than this one. The amount of open space in front of the hotel is very limited, which makes managing the abandonment (even temporary) of vehicles in that space especially critical. The signage to get from ground level to checkin is miserable. One has no idea whether to go to floor 3 or floor 4 without spending time trying to figure it out because the brass plates on the elevator do not instantly identify which floor a new guest goes to. Hint: checkin is on 3. The restaurant is on 4, but the guest services director at the desk right in front of checkin on 3 does NOT have the menu for the day. \"You'll have to up a floor, sir, and ask the hostess for the menu.\" So, just to find out what the restaurant serves one waits for an elevator, goes up an entire floor and wastes time. Inexcusable bad service and poor property management because it can be fixed so easily with minor attention to detail. The area in the suite bathroom dedicated to the basin, mirror, etc is extraordinarly small, narrow and cramped. There are inadequate power outlets here. A mouse would feel hump-shouldered. There is a signficant deficiency of electrical outlets all over the entire guest room except at the writing desk, which has one extra outlet mounted on the edge. The room lamps appeared tohave three-way bulbs and many of the settings are burned out, making a guest think the entire lamp doesn't work until trying different combinations of the main switch at the entrance and repeatedly pushing the switch on the lamp to find the setting that is not burned out. Inefficient, maddening and poor maintenance. Room service menu is 24 hour but heavily weighted to breakfast and sandwiches. Room service prices are, of course, extremely expensive. The food quality was above-average and delivered in a reasonable time period. Room rates are steep for the quality delivered in the room.

The upside of the noise was that it provided unexpected entertainment--sitting on the toilet, with a vent directly above, it is possible to hear every single word of the conversations taking place in an adjacent room. An eavesdropper's delight! Aside from the noise, the hotel was dusty--everywhere. In my room; in the conference meetings room; the the bar; in the business center--in short, every facility I used at this hotel needed a thorough cleaning. When I checked into my room, I opened the curtain behind the bed, and to my disgust, it seemed as if every previous tenant of the room had left his or her hand, nose or lip print on the window. It was so gross I asked housekeeping to clean it up--which to their credit they did promptly. What others have said about the weird layout of the rooms was true for me, although it was not a major inconvenience or distraction.

After walking the Mag Mile we decided to stop back at the OMNI for lunch. The service was good and the luncheon menu was interesting. I had a salad that came wrapped in a little bowl which was actually a cucumber. My husband had lobster rolls. For Chicago, I thought the prices were reasonable.

When I compared the rate to the other upper end hotels in the area it seemed the best value for the money. After our stay July 14 - 18th, 2007, I think it was a wise choice. The Omni couldn't have a more convenient location. Huge choice of restaurants, stores, and transportation literally at your front door. I have to comment on some of the complaints as far as the lobby being on the third floor, and then the necessity to take a second elevator to the rooms. This arrangement to me made me feel much more safe and it also made it feel a bit more exclusive. I didn't find the arrangement to be at all inconvenient and actually preferred it. Entrance and lobby very elegant. Absolutely the most effortless check-in I've experienced. Nothing to sign, just accept the keys and go. I did register with the Omni Select Guest program which I recommend. I believe that expedited check-in. Bonus with Select Guest is complimentary morning beverage service delivered to your door with your choice of two beverages and newspaper. A+ to Omni for that perk! Our room, number 1910, was extremely spacious and comfortable. Very nice decor, furniture in very good condition. Great granite topped wet bar in the living room. Bedroom is not large, but certainly adequate. I appreciated the seperation of the rooms. Great if one of the travelers wants to rest while the other doesn't. Bed was very plush and comfortable. More drawer storage space than I could imagine anyone needing. Two robes in the bedroom closet were appreciated. The living room was very roomy with two chairs, an ottoman, wall mounted plasma TV, and work desk. Bathroom nicely done in marble and granite. Nice large and thick bathtowels. The Omni's rooms could actually be used as a temporary apartment, and are in fact larger than most studio apartments I've lived in in the past. I really liked the overall design and configuration of the room. Noise was not an issue although we were on the 19th floor which may have helped with lack of street noise. Windows can be opened a bit for fresh air. One suggestion is that two ottomans in the living room would be nice so that each chair has its own. Staff overall was excellent, professional and very well trained. With one exception (one of the doormen, tall guy with a bluetooth headset on & an attitude), everyone greeted us with a smile and hello. We ate breakfast in the dining room several times. As always in a hotel it was pricey but I would rather pay a bit more for the convenience of not having to wander around looking for food in the morning. The food itself was excellent as was the service. Terrific view overlooking Michigan Avenue from the table, too. The bar and restuarant were quite beautiful. Extra nice large and well equiped workout facilities with locker rooms. Pool area was large and clean. I used both the pool and spa, and enjoyed it. Note: there is no sauna as is advertised on several websites. There are also two spacious outdoor decks overlooking the city off the pool and workout areas. All in all was extremely pleased with the Omni Chicago, and would highly recommend it. Try booking directly with the hotel's website for the best deal.

Also, there is no small convenience store in the building (that I could find at least) so that you either had to walk several blocks to the walgreens or suffer the stiff prices of the mini bar if you wanted a drink or snack.

The room was very nice and clean we enjoyed having two televisions instead of one especially the plasma in the sitting room area. It would have been nice to have the plasma in the bedroom. The staff was great and very attentive to our needs and we also put out the do not disturb sign on our door.

The actual room did not disappoint. The room was very large and had plenty of space. The bathroom was large and very accomodating. There were good size windows in both the living area and bedroom. The bedroom has its own set of doors closing it off from the living area. The living area was okay, the flat screen on the wall was nice, but considering the actual sofa in the living area was uncomfortable and on the cheaper side, I think the flat screen would have been better served in the bedroom versus the TV that was in there; it was a regular TV inside of a wall unit with several drawers built into the wall. We chose to watch the TV in the bedroom versus the living area since it was much more comfortable. The king size bed was very comfortable and the bedding was nice, although they could have used a few more pillows for sleeping other than the many decorative pillows on the bed. The comforter was really nice and warm. The heating system in the room was excellent. The many ammenities in the room were very thoughtful; there was an umbrella in the closet, spray starch for ironing, etc. All the little things most places don't even think of. We had left the privacy sign on our door because we did not want housekeeping that day, but when we returned we found out that they had come in anyway, a big turn-off in my opinion. If you desire no housekeeping, make sure you tell the front desk in addition to leaving the sign on your door. We did not use the gym, pool or jacuzzi while we were there, but we found that they were very popular among the other guests. The pool and such are on the 5th floor. They seemed to be pretty clean and you could smell the strong odor of chlorine all throughout the 5th floor as soon as you stepped off the elevator, but not once you got into your room. My only complaint about the hotel, not a real big deal, but you have to use two elevators to get to your room. One takes you to the lobby area where you walk a bit around the corner and get on another elevator to get to your floor. Also, if you have your own car, be prepared to pay $43 a night for overnight parking. We took our chances and found free (after hours on weekend) street parking less than a half block from the hotel.

You are walking distance to pretty much everything downtown, or at most a $6 cab ride. Only one minor complaint about the room, which other reviewers have noted--the refrigerator seems to run very warm. I didn't utilize the mini-bar, but was going to try to put some leftover deep dish in there but didn't trust the temp. Got a styrofoam cooler around the corner at the Walgreens and filled it with ice instead for my refrigeration needs.

The bathroom was immaculately clean, bright and large. Their turndown service was especially sweet with individually wrapped chocolate and a color coded weather card (indicating the next day's weather and temperatue) on the pillow which are indicative of their attention to details. My stay also included the following amenities (no additional charge): - wireless internet in the room - access to gym (not big, but adaquate for a quick workout) as well as pool and jacuzzi - complimentary 'express' breakfast (allowing you to select from an limited menu offering choices of juice, bagels, and newspaper) delivered to your room at time specified by you - transport to downtown chicago where my office locates Not to mention perfect location, right off of michigan avenue for shopping and good restaurant. I did not try their in house restaurant since there are so many other choices near by... but i can't imagine it being too bad. My old \"not so perfect\" experience was that they mixed up my transporation reservation and about 1/2 hr before my scheduled time, they called me and indicated that the car wasn't available for me (as the person who made the resv for me has double-booked). However the concierge was apologetic got me a cab instead and insistied on paying for the ride. Omni would be my choice next time again in Chicago!", "Date": "August 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Omni, but watch out for the pool!!\u201d", "Author": "krosas", "ReviewID": "UR5716312", "Content": "My husband and I travel to Chicago between 3-4 times a year. We have stayed at various hotels in our stays, but we were very excited to stay at the Omni. The location looked great and we have heard nothing but rave reviews from friends and family that have stayed with the hotel in the past. We arrived early and our room was ready. The Omni met our every request - high floor and early check in. That was fantastic! Room - the room was more than what we imagined. We had read one review that warned travlers that it is much smaller than what is pictured. To us, it was absolutely perfect. The room was large enough for 4 adults if needed and it was nice how the restroom area could be blocked off from the front living space and the bedroom. (We booked a deluxe king suite). Problems: Let me say this, the staff was over the top outstanding, but we did encounter some areas of concern. First, our toilet leaked. We did let the front desk know, they told us someone would check it out. Second, on our last day of our stay, I made the mistake of walking the a/c unit controls to adjust it, and walked in only my socks. The entire floor near the controls was saturated with water. Since it was our last day, the front desk said they would have someone look at it after we left. Third, the housekeeping staff changed our sheets each night. On the second night of our visit, there were large reddish stains on the fitted sheet. I assumed they were blood stains, so we put a blanket down and we pulled the sheet off; they were changed the next day, but how gross is that? Main Problem - the pool area. It is very small and the pictures make it look larger than it is. Since we do travel a lot, my husband and I enjoy soaking in a nice hot tub or going for a swim. We were only able to use the facility once, the day before our departure. We sat in the small hot tub (only fits 3 people at a time) and then went for a swim. We each showered off after the swim because the chlorine was pretty stinky. The next morning, I noticed small, red bumps all over my chest area. We flew home and the bumps got worse. I went to our doctor who told me it was phalicilitus (sp??) which is a bacterial rash caused from the pools not being properly balanced with chemicals so the bacteria does not die. I was put on antibiotics and have a bunch of anti-itch creams. I contacted the Omni and have been referred to the Director of Security. (Not sure what he can do for me??). Overall, the trip was good, the room was nice and the location was outstanding. I have learned my lesson about public pools though! I would recommend staying at the Omni again, infact we probably would stay there too; we just won't be going in the pool!", "Date": "August 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location\u201d", "Author": "OceanLove3", "ReviewID": "UR5630494", "Content": "This hotel is awesome.

She had heard great things about the Omni, so we decided to stay there in November 2005. The Omni Chicago is located right on Michigan avenue, which was great, because we could just walk ouside the hotel and immediately enjoy walking the Magnificent Mile. From the moment we pulled our rental car up the hotel, the bell staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. Surprisingly, they were the ones that demonstrated what customer service should be. When we got inside the hotel to check in, we experienced the complete opposite. We patiently waited for someone to acknowledge us. No one else was standing in front of us. This lady behind the desk looked up at us, didn't say a word then continued what she was doing. She could have said, \"I'll be right with you.\" We didn't mind waiting, but some sort of acknowledgement would have been nice. Finally, she looks up, puts out her hand (as if to motion us to come) and still doesn't say a word. I'm surprised she didn't whistle and pet us once we approached the desk. No \"Welcome\" or \"Hello\" or anything! She was downright rude and made us feel like we didn't deserve to be there. (We're in our 20's, are young professionals who were raised with excellent manners, and came dressed nicely--not in anything inappropriate). I guess because we didn't look rich or established to her, we didn't deserve any bit of service. After she checked us in, she gave us our room keys, and again, didn't say a word. She never pointed out where the elevators were, so we had to search for them. That was the only bad experience. The room we had was very nice, chic and modern with warm colors. The view is typical of a city view...lots of buildings. There was a large bedroom, a sitting area with a desk and a moderate sized bathroom. The beds were very comfy. I really liked all the rooms except for the bathroom...it was dim and didn't seem to fit with the room, because it wasn't that nice and looked like any other bathroom at a Holiday Inn. The restaurant is average. However, the room service is excellent and the food delicious...definitely as if we were dining in an upscale restaurant. The desserts were also very good. In summary, it's a great place to stay if you want to be close to all the shops and restaurants on Michigan Avenue.

I chose the Omni for it's location and \"suite\" configuration. Over the past 20 years, I have stayed at every high end hotel in Chicago except The Peninsula. WIthout a doubt, I have never stayed anywhere -- Chicago or otherwise -- where the staff was more energized about customer satisfaction. I was left to want for NOTHING during my stay whether it was needing an umbrella (they have a zillion near the entrance doors) or extra cookies for the turn-down service. They even brought a high chair from the restaurant up to our room for us to use with my 11 month old for in-room dining throughout our entire 4 night stay. The doorman helped my wife, struggling with both kids and all their packages, out of a taxi on a very rainy afternoon then read the driver the riot act for not getting out of his warm dry seat and helping them himself. Even the hotel operator was overly friendly and would follow up to see that the appropriate person got back to us to address our needs. This is a group of top flight professionals. They make the staffs at the FS & RC look a little better than average and at half the cost. The room was fine -- plenty of room for the four of us with two queens in the BR and a sofa bed in the salon. The kids actually slept best when they slept on the floor (on extra comforters and blankets cheerfully and quickly delivered by the HK staff) instead of the provided crib and sofa bed. (By the way, friends got a room w/ a King and their salon had two chairs instead of the sofa bed.) The Salon has a wet bar, good desktop workspace and a big (42inch?) Panasonic plasma (the one in our friends' room had lots of problems but ours worked flawlessly). There is a smaller CRT TV in the bedroom. The bathrooms are above average size and the shower pumps out lots of hot, steamy water with fabulous water pressure. Free wireless internet access (w/ a very strong signal and fast connection speeds) was a nice bonus and the savings (usually $15/day) needs to be considered when comparing the Omni to other hotels. Free shoeshine service is another great perk and greatly appreciated when the nasty weather takes its toll on your dogs. If I had to cite any negatives, I would have to get really picky. I guess that I could whine that the room decor looked a little dated but the materials and finishes were of very good quality. And the pocket door between the bathroom and BR rattled whenever you opened the door from the salon to the bathroom. It is easy to understand why Oprah outs her guests up here. Very good value for money. The location can not be beat -- at the corner of Michigan & Huron -- makes for an easy walk to great dining, Water Tower, the Lakefront, Rush Street (aka the Viagra Triangle) and American Girl (anyone who has a young daughter knows why it is important to be close to this Shrine of American Merchandising Excess!!!). I agree with previous suggestions about joining the Special Guest (frequent visitor) program (gets you comp. beverage service and three newspapers every morning among other things) and requesting a high floor but disagree that the two elevator route to your room is a negative. I paid <$300 a night and feel that the value far exceeded this price. Similarly, the staff (and really, my entire stay) exceeded all expectations.

Upon arriving early Friday morning 9:30am at the hotel, we tried our luck with early check-in and was very pleased to find that the room we reserved was available and we were able to check-in right away. We were also upgraded to the executive suite on the 24th floor. (25th floor being the highest) The suite was very nice, you have your own wet bar, dining table, living room, and two plasma tv's (one in the living room and bedroom) We had a corner suite with a decent view of the city and of Mag. mile. The Omni is great for their complimentary morning drinks and paper. The concierge was very helpful in recommending good diners/cafes for great morning breakfast. Don't miss the West Egg cafe for breakfast. The concierge also gave good directions to where we wanted to go. The hotel location is great in getting around to most of the museums and Grant park, etc. It is just one or two buses away and you can catch the bus right on mag mile without waiting for more then 5mins top! I recommend getting the CTA vistors pass, its well worth it instead of taking a cab. It is also close to John Hancock and the Water Tower so walking is a good way of getting around as well. Many Chicagoans recommended us taking a walk along Lake Michigan, and we did and thought it was really beautiful. So I would like to recommend anyone who hasn't, to do so as well. We asked the concierge about boat tours of the city and we were recommened to Wendella boat tours. We opt for 90mins river and lake tour, it was the highlight of our trip as we caught the last tour at 7pm and saw the city light up at dusk. We were also given free passes to a few bar/lounge by our concierge when we asked where were the nice night spots. The only cons I have to say about the hotel would be that the suite did not have a full length mirror anywhere in the room, and the only mirror was in the bathroom. Also, a couple of times we wanted to take a swim in the hotel pool but everytime we went it was crowded with people or kids, and since the pool and hot tub is kind of on the small side, it just seemed really cramped. So we weren't able to take a dip. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay at the Omni. We had a choice between the Sofitel or the Omni, but choose the Omni because of a great price we were able to get and when we arrived we found that the Omni was still a better choice in terms of great location, great customer service, and superior room selection.

Despite renovations, the hotel is still in need of updating. We were placed in connecting rooms on the 12th floor. The toilet in one of the bathrooms flooded the floor every time we flushed. The service response was immediate, but the fix did not work and we had to call again. The Michigan Avenue traffic was extremely loud and nobody in my family slept the first night. They did move us to the 22nd floor which was much quieter. The doors are in need of replacement and do not have silencers which keep them from slamming. The doors were scratched and the hallway walls were damaged in many places. You have to take two elevators to get to the ground level, which some might find inconvenient. In response to our first night, they did provide us with a $50 breakfast voucher. We were supposed to have received care packages for each child, but they did not supply those when we checked in. We had to call down to the desk and have them sent up. The second day, after being away all day, we came back to rooms that had not been cleaned. We had to call around 4:00 and have the maid come up and clean. This was incredibly inconvenient, given we were traveling with three children and wanted the late afternoon to relax before we went to dinner. The air conditioning was freezing and unless you had it set on a low temperature, the humidity never escaped from the bathrooms which have no exhaust systems. The sliding doors to both bathrooms were broken, the mirror in one bathroom was rusted, and the coffee-maker was broken. The maids did not always replace the coffee. There was mold present in many places, including the bathtub and around the windows. There was rust around the pool. The picture of the pool online was nice, but it's actually representative of a high school gym from the 1970's. It was aluminum! The pool water was too hot (we heard several guests complaining) and the jacuzzi water was either scorching hot or freezing cold. The Concierge was never available when we called, although if we left a message they did return the call. The one time they did answer, they were not helpful. The service and experience was inconsistent all around. The only positive thing we remember was the Bell Captain. He was exceptional and great with our kids. However, we will not stay there again.", "Date": "July 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNot spectacular but nice little perks\u201d", "Author": "uschal", "ReviewID": "UR3687676", "Content": "First of all I think the renovations are complete so I did not have the problem of renovating noises. Even though the hotel is \"all suites\" I found it is no big deal as they are small suites. I can see how some people would find this not so attractive as each of the rooms are not that big ... they are not tiny but nothing spectacular. The rooms are nice decorated with Flat screen TV's on the wall and I did not have the problems that previous people complained about (the bed was great, nothing wrong with the curtains and windows, etc.). Again, the rooms are nice but nothing spectacular. The other thing that I find annoying is the 2 sets of elevators. You need to take a set of elevators up to lobby level and then change elevators to get up to the room. I found that bothersome, I know some of my friends find it \"secure\". One thing I was very impressed about is their Omni Select program. I have never seen so many perks with a program - I would recommend joining it even if you are only going to stay there once. The best perks of that program are: - Late checkout up to 5pm - 2 free beverages of your choice (in a glass) in the morning You also get free newspaper with that and exercise equipment in your room if you want but I don't see those as big deals ... Location-wise, Omni is great considering that it is just off Michigan Ave near all the shops. The Cielo resturant does have decent food and if you sit at the window you do get a spectacular view of Michigan Ave ... All in all, I had a very pleasant stay but I can get better hotels at lower prices ...", "Date": "July 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles, ca", "Title": "\u201cgreat location, service and view\u201d", "Author": "quickjaunt", "ReviewID": "UR3615572", "Content": "Stayed at the Omni for 5 nights in June 2005.

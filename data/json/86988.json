It is n very short walking distance to everything you want to see in Waikiki. The rooms were clean and everything was as expected and looked like the pictures you see on the hotel website. Continental breakfast was just enough as a previous writer said, but watch out for the lady who keeps it stocked, she will not acknowledge or move out of the way for you. In my opionion, she should not attend to the table every two minutes. All in all, the experience was good, the tub was great to soak in after hitting the beach and going shopping.

We booked an executive 1bdrm suite and I'd highly recommend doing the same. It was huge, nicely decorated and very comfortable with a kitchen. I also thought it was a nice touch that we received 2 free drink coupons for their on-site restaurant. It was quiet, pleasant, and the staff was friendly and helpful.

On 3 occasions before travelling I asked travel agent to check that it was a twin room not a double room we were to get we were assured even after our agent phoning United Vacations that we would be given a twin roomWhen we arrived after a 30hour journey we did not even get a foot in the hotel grounds when a porter came out and told us we were not being allowed in we had to go to another hotel. On querying as to why this was happening we were told we were being upgraded because we were 'so nice people'. This was said I hasten to add in a most facetious manner. I asked where we were to go and again why and was again told that we were being upgraded because we were so nice people. We were told to get complimentary drinks of our choice whilst they arranged transfers and would look after our luggage. Vouchers given were for non alcoholic drinks or coffee. Halfway through our drinks we were called - our transport was there - when we got to the front door there was no sign of our luggage or our transport. We were quite worried and upset as medication for the whole trip as well as our belongings to our tired minds were no where to be seen and we wondered if we had actually walked into a nightmare instead of paradise. Eventually a staff member came and said that they'd phoned the other hotel and our luggage was there. They then provided a limo to take us to this still unknown upgraded hotel - after travelling 30 hours a limo is not exactly the easiest mode of transport to get in and out of. When we arrived at the other hotel we found the rooms to be small double and stinking of urine and no lanais. We spoke to the reception who offered to show us a twin room but it was not the sort of hotel which attracted us. We were taken back to the 'Joy' after another wait for a taxi. Where they then said that we would be given rooms there. Apprehensively we went to see these rooms and although much better the bed in our room was still not twin. Our friends were okay with theirs but our room was still not what we requested via our agent. We accepted the room on the understanding that the room be sorted out the next day. After a lengthy discussion with the manager the next day in which he first off said no bedroom type are guaranteed only a request, then denied he had any twin roomsin the hotel I challenged this by sayig they were advertised on the net, then he suggested if we paid extra there would be a twin room, when we said we would not pay any more than we already had and said that he had overbooked his hotel and why didn't he upgrade us for free as he the night before had been willing to upgrade us in another hotel, then he stated he hadn't oversold his rooms - (to which we have had confirmation in a letter from United Vacations that the rooms were oversold.) and that the other hotel was of a same star rating not an upgrade as we'd been told the night before. I was suffering stress and the beginnings of a hypo when I eventually spoke to a rep via phone from United Vacations and we were offered to be put up in yet another hotel at the other side of the town from our friends.The hotel did eventually put a roll away bed in the room but it ended up sagging in the middle after 10 nights and gave my partner a sore back. Afterwards during our stay we then found if we approached reception we were not welcome this was also felt by our friends. We were being treated like lepers. Other British couples we spoke to had also suffered similar experiences of being told there was no rooms available and also were taken to this and another hotel but also found them to be awful. Signage round the pool area was also only in English and other nationalities were freely jumping in and out of the pool without showering after visiting the loos as well as tossing dirty surf boards in to clean them. We certainly wouldn't recommend staying at the Joy not unless you were prepared to do a long jaunt after your already long flights.", "Date": "Sep 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR268388205", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "scotwanderer"}, {"Content": "A really good choice       Towards Reception area at the Joy", "Date": "Aug 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR842367448", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "moruya2"}, {"Content": "In the thick of it.. Before I booked the Suite in the Hibiscus Tower I mentioned to staff there that I did not wish to be within earshot of the Karaoke Bar (situated at the base of the Hibiscus Tower) which is open untill 05:00ish.Unfortunately the first Suite they put us in I could hear the music quite clearly. A move to the other tower would have meant downgrading, however they did move us to the 6th floor and that was fine.Also before we arrived I struck a deal with the hotel that I could pay a 'Season Ticket' for the car park as were planning on staying for 21 nights and did not relish shelling out $210 in valet fees. (Although that would have been cheap in Waikiki ). The hotel did agree to this ( $100 for 21 nights) but upon arrival no one knew anything about this. However they did take my word for it and honoured the deal ( I had left the crucial email back in England ). They gave me validation permit to hang at the back of the rear view mirror.On one occasion I forgot to place the permit on the mirror and got a ticket from the Parking Company. However, the staff at the Joy, particularly Mike pulled out all the stops  sorted out my stupid mistake.Top marks to the staff at the Joy.Breakfast was good. Mostely fresh fruit, toast  coffee.

When I booked the room in August 2007 Trip Advisor had mainly good reviews, but as our departure date drew closer there were more negative and mixed reviews and I began to panic a bit that we'd made a poor choice. However, it was too late to book another room at a reasonable price, so we decided to hope for the best.We arrived at 5 pm and got checked in. I would describe the check-in process as transactional . . . . everything got done, but the clerk wasn't overly friendly. I had booked a room with a queen/king bed and specificially requested a room not near the elevator. When we got to the room, it was, yes, you guessed it, immediately next to the elevator and had two double beds. I immediately went back downstairs to the front desk where the clerk was surprised that I didn't like the room as it was an upgrade to a larger corner unit. When I explained to him that a bigger room didn't help us when we'd have to sleep in separate beds, he gave us another room. This one was also right next to the elevator (not sure why they ask for comments when you book when they clearly don't pay any attention to them), but we decided to take it. Fortunately, the elevators were quiet enough that they didn't bother us.Our room was fine for a few days stay, including a small refrigerator, coffee maker, and stereo system. We had a balcony with a partial view of the ocean, which was an unexpected bonus. It was a nice place to go out in the morning and enjoy a quick cup of coffee. The bathroom had a large tub with bubble jets which we made use of, although the tub and its surround was in need of updating-it looked like it was original to the hotel, while much of the rest of the room had been updated. The woman who did the cleaning always greeted us in the hall and kept our room spotless and supplied with everything we needed.The hotel also had a lovely first floor open air dining area where we had breakfast each morning, as well as a cute little koi pond. The continental breakfast was a quick way to get a bite to eat prior to starting our daily adventures and consisted of fresh fruit, bagels, rolls, juice and coffee. Again, the staff got the job done, but were pretty indifferent to the guests.The Waikiki Joy has a good central location, about 3 blocks off of Waikiki Beach and one block from Kuhio Avenue, where you can pick up the bus going to Pearl Harbor, Diamond Head, Haunama Bay, etc. It is also close to lots of stores and eating establishments. We paid $139 per night and I was satisfied with our stay for the price with the exception of the last night, when we were awakened at 1 am by the most terrible racket that proceeded to continue for 3 hours. I was told by the clerk at the front desk the next morning, who was very apologetic, that the building across the street was beginning construction, had been unloading scaffolding and that the work was expected to continue for 4 months. She had received a number of guest complaints, had called the police to get them to stop and was going to have building management talk with the owners regarding their future plans and the noise level. We were just very happy at that point to be heading off to Maui where we could get caught up on our sleep!In sum, we would stay at the Waikiki Joy again for the price and location. If you are looking for a luxury hotel or oceanfront location, it's probably not the right hotel for you, but if you are looking for a clean, serviceable hotel in a central location, it would fit the bill.", "Date": "Mar 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR213841629", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "threecatmomma"}, {"Content": "Ok for a few nights We stayed here for 4 nights on our way home of the mainland.

When I asked to see the hotel procedures in writing I was abruptly and rudely told to 'speak to the Manager' (which was impossible at that time, because we had to catch a plane).

Boy, were we built up for this hotel! The location was horrible...very hard to find, on a one way street, and in the middle of town...when they mean city view, they mean just that. Steps away from the beach sounds great...if you want to hike several blocks carrying snorkelling gear, boogie boards and a cooler. It's a catch-22 because there is little parking (and it isn't free) in Honolulu. If you're trip centers around ocean/beach oriented activities, stay on one of the beach resorts...it doesn't cost much more. Valet parking is the only option at $10 @ day. Didn't like this much.

The Waikiki Joy was a good choice. Resortquest offers very reasonable kama`aina rates (for Hawaii residents) on all of their properties. The location is a few blocks from the beach (mauka of Kalakaua on Lewers St.) but it's easily walkable. There is a Starbucks kiosk directly across the street. Parking was valet only at $10 a day, and valet service was always prompt. The hotel is on the small side, with a pleasant garden feeling in the white-marble lobby. There is a small pool next to the breakfast area. Beyond the lobby, you can tell that the place hasn't been renovated for a while. The room was a comfortable size with a small balcony looking onto the street, a king bed, TV and stereo sound system, wicker love seat. Also, a mini refrigerator, coffee maker, and a couple of bottles of complimentary water. Everything was clean and adequate, though a bit worn and outdated. There was a slight musty smell, probably a holdover from when smoking was allowed, but it didn't bother us. The jacuzzi bathtub in the bathroom (every room has one) was very nice. They give you a good collection of toiletries -- shampoo and conditioner, lotion, mineral bath, a couple of kinds of soap, etc. There is a hairdryer. The place was quiet, no problems with noise even on a Saturday night. Breakfast was offered in the lobby from 7 to 9 am (coffee, juice, fruit, various breads, butter, jam, cream cheese).

We were tired from our 6 hour flight from Phoenix and it was a pleasure that upon arrival our luggage was taken for us and check-in was very quick and easy. The staff at all times was very pleasant. The lobby and surrounding area is very pretty. Our luggage arrived at our room within minutes. We had a room on the 6th floor. The elevator, as some have commented is small, but it was no big deal. The room was very large. We had no view down as there was a parking lot and a side street with dumpsters. I simply chose to look toward the water and outward which was at the end of our lanai. The beds were two doubles. I requested a king, but they were up front about that not being a guarantee. I agree the room's furnishings could be considered dated including the stereo with cassette, but everything in our room was very clean. The bathrooms have large jacuzzi tubs and that made for a very relaxing evening soak after lots of walking. Breakfast the next morning consisted of the basic continental breakfast fare everyone has already mentioned. It was a great start to the day or there is a restaurant directly outside (Moose McGillicudys's) that had a breakfast special for a good price with eggs, bacon etc. As all have said the pool is only for getting wet. You won't be doing laps.My husband and I walked down Kalakaua Ave. half a block away, and a couple streets further to the ocean. One thing I became very aware of is the construction going on near Ft. Debussy Park. The city is making another pedestrian area for walking and the construction starts pretty early. I was really thankful we weren't staying close to that area. Kalakaua Ave. has both designer/boutique stores and the discount great for tourist stuff stores. There are nice restaurants and fast food places. Another advantage of the location of the Waikiki Joy is it's proximity to the bus stop. We did not rent a car and took the bus all over. You can check the website THEBUS[--] and bus schedules are available at the ABC stores for $3.00. The bus stop is half a block away approximately the other direction. Always ask for a transfer. Many times it saved us return fare. I believe you can get a multi day pass as well. I am one of those go with the flow types.

The location is wonderful and you can catch a trolly pretty much accross the road. The main plus for my sister and I was that we felt safe there, you are close to the beach and the markets etc, but the hotel is located in a well lit quiet street. The breakfast was pretty good and a bonus was being able to take it back up to our room and have it there. The pool is really small, however you are close to Waikiki Beach so we didn't really use it much. Having a kitchen was great, we used it a lot more than anticipated, its equiped with a huge fridge, toaster cooking facilities etc and there are a few good grocery stores near by. All in all, we are in love with Hawaii and will be staying at the Joy again the next time we go back as we felt really at home.

The location is around the corner from major stores and restaurants, and the beach is a short 5-10 minute walk. While I didn't swim in their pool, it appeared clean and well-maintained. Several colleagues of mine stayed in other hotels in this price bracket, including other Aston hotels; I was the only one satisfied with my stay. The continental breakfast was simple and offered the typical 'continental' fare. My only criticism is the $5 fee to use the exercise room; however, I must applaud that the equipment in that room (a treadmill, bike, elliptical machine, and free weight system) were all brand new and in fully functioning condition -- the only hotel in my travels this summer which had such equipment.

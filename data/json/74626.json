I lived in the Phoenix area in the 1990's. My family hasn't returned there - together - in over 10 years. Boy, have things changed! My husband and I were searching for an affordable place, close to the city, that was \"family friendly (we have a six-year-old son).\" After researching private rentals, resorts (including the AZ Grand)....for what seemed to be an eternity....we found the Legacy. At first glance, I was concerned about how \"family friendly\" a golf resort would be, and I remember this area wasn't the best years ago...I searched and searched online and couldn't really find any \"totally bad\" reviews about this place - some people mentioned noise issues....some comments about rude staff....and the other biggie were complaints from singles or seniors about all the kids around the pool, resort, etc.. - THOSE reviews SOLD THE PLACE for us! I wanted a rental where our entire family could feel comfortable - including our child. He's not some out-of-control nutcase - but he does like to jump and swim in pools...and, sometimes, he can get excitedly loud....so I wasn't interested in staying somewhere that frowned upon children. After looking at hundreds of photos online (yes - the pool IS that awesome), video's, etc., we booked a one-bedroom suite. When we arrived, it was apparent the area had changed A LOT in a decade. The grounds and area surrounding the resort were beautiful and well-manicured! My allergies were actually going nuts from all the flowers and trees around the grounds. From the get-go, we were greeted by nothing but friendly, helpful staff. The concierge hit us with the \"time share\" pitch once - which we declined...and we weren't bothered with it again. Our request for a second floor unit was honored and we were located in Casita 6 - which was a bit away from the main check-in area and pool. I kind of liked that - honestly, the units close to the pool seemed too \"busy.\" If you are interested in solitude, I definitely wouldn't recommend staying in them (and they are more expensive). The pool opens at 7 a.m....complete with music and lots of boisterous, festive sun bathers. Casita 6 was the farthest from the main area....and it still was only about a five minute walk up to the pool and main, common areas. THE CONDO LAYOUT: Just an FYI - each building seems to house four one-bedroom units (two upstairs, two downstairs) and four jr. suites. If you rent a one-bedroom, your unit will be on either end of the building - sharing only one common wall (if you are on the bottom, you share the ceiling, too). The jr. suites are wedged in the middle....hence, if you get one of the jr's - especially on the lower floor - I could see how they could be rather noisy (all walls, except for the floor, are shared). SO, if you want a quieter experience?? Rent the one-bedroom, upstairs....or, at the very least, request a jr. on the top floor! Oh, and building 12 is the only \"smoking\" building - something to keep in mind if you smoke OR are allergic to smoke... The one-bedroom was beyond perfect! Over 800 sq. feet with a patio, full kitchen, dining room table, washer/dryer, stall shower AND HUGE Jacuzzi tub. Everything was neat and clean. The fold out couch accommodated our son perfectly....and the king-size bed in the bedroom was gigantic. We had some issue's with the Wi-Fi - the front staff was responsive and helpful...but I don't think the problem was on their end. I would recommend bringing a LAN cable to wire into the internet. Our room had one in it. Housekeeping came every day - including Easter! We called a couple times for extra towels and tp - the response was beyond speedy. Although I am not a golfer, the course looked gorgeous! They really take care in landscaping this place. The pool was the best I've seen at a resort...maybe ever (and I actually enjoyed hanging out there all day - anyone out there with kids knows what I'm talkin' about....you get tired of spending hours are the same-old, dull, square-tangular hotel pools...and the kids always wanna hit the pool). In addition to the main pool you see in the photos, there was a small, circular \"child\" pool (only 1.5 ft. deep)....it was about the size of a Jacuzzi. Speaking of Jacuzzi\u2019s - they have two: one for everyone and one for adults only (in a separate, quiet area). Pool also features a giant-sized chess set, ping-pong table, bar and grill area, towel service an lots of seating. FOR THOSE CONSIDERING THE AZ GRAND: About mid-week, we got word from the Legacy that the pool would be closed one day for maintenance. Of course, we were disappointed...however, the Legacy worked out an arrangement with the nearby AZ Grand Resort; guests could use their pool for the day. I was actually happy about this as we looked at the Grand as a possible place to stay (we were intrigued by the water park and reviews...however, the price was a bit out of our range and the room looked small....so we went with the Legacy). We showed up at the Sedona pool at the Grand....and we COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW DUMPY this place was in comparison to the Legacy!!! I was so happy I didn't shell out $$$big bucks to stay there. The Sedona pool was very small, we couldn't even find a place to sit....and outdated. We actually SNUCK INTO the Oasis water park (am I bad?) - and it reminded me of Disney World....just totally busy and hectic.....no seats....disgruntled staff....yeah, the Oasis water park looked neat - but you know what??? After an hour in the wave pool, my son found us and asked if we could go back \"home\" to the Legacy because he was tired of the place. I was shocked by the Grand - when I lived in Phoenix, it was known as the Pointe at South Mountain. If was a premier resort BACK THEN. Except for the water park - and the $$ fancier price - it still looks like The Pointe...only 20+ years older with no updates. I know they have added on in area's....but, for what they want a night?? I was less than impressed.... Let's see....what else..... They Legacy did have daily planned activities (crafts, hikes, games) - something for everyone. We didn't have a chance to attend any, though. There is also a playground, on-site restaurant, bb-que area, shuffle board and tennis. Lots of attractions nearby (Gallagher\u2019s has GREAT food. It's at the corner of 32nd and Baseline...travel through the Grand, up 48th St. and visit South Mountain Preserve for ALL LEVELS of desert hikes. The preserve is near the Pointe's/Grands golf course - you'd never even know it's there if you weren't looking for it....and there are miles and miles of serene trails. Another great attraction is the sunset \"steak run\" horseback ride through South Mountain. Even if you HATE horses, you have to try this. You saddle up and ride through the park at dusk, to a steakhouse. After dinner, you ride back through the park at night - you can't beat the views! And, the Desert Botanical Gardens and Papago Park are a must see....also, on the off chance you get a rainy day and need to go somewhere indoors with the kids, try Amazing Jakes (Google it - too much to list)). The only \"complaint\" I really had was one morning, the city of Phoenix turned off the water to our unit....which was a little inconvenient....but that's about it...and the water was back on within an hour or two. SO, if you are a family thinking this \"golf resort\" won't welcome your kids??? THINK AGAIN! BOOK IT!! It's an awesome value....so much so that I'll be returning in August (for a rate less than $80 a night for a one-bedroom?!?!?! GREAT!). IF you are a single or a senior looking for a quiet get-away?? The grounds and golf course are lovely. Just be aware that there are lots of kids staying at this place....you will be outnumbered :) If you're looking for complete solitude and are bothered by boisterous vacation-goers - you may wanna try Sedona, Sun City or Fountain Hills.... I will never stay anywhere else - my family would kill me!", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Littleton, CO", "Title": "\u201cVery nice stay\u201d", "Author": "medako", "ReviewID": "UR127742204", "Content": "We needed a place as a \"home base\" for our stay in Arizona and this was a perfect choice.

The Legacy was very good a fitting our needs. I should start by saying that we are not golfers so we did not use the course, but it appeared to be well cared for and effectively managed. The course was not crowded and had a mixture of those walking and using carts. We were disappointed that they would not let guests walk the course unless they were golfing. The resort is in a rather sparse neighbourhood without a lot of areas to walk so it would have been nice to walk the course at sunset. Having said that the ammenities of the resort were great. There was more than enough parking, the pool area was well maintained and looked like it would have been very inviting. Unfortunately, it wasn't warm enough to use it while we were there. The unit's themselves (we had a one bedroom unit) had a very nice layout with more than enough space. The bathroom and tub area were separate and the jacuzzi tub was a nice touch. We were able to buy a few things for breakfast and prep them in the unit before heading out for the day which was nice for cost control. This would be especially good for families I would think. Checking in and out was easy and we arrived quite early (around 11:30) and our room was ready for us right away which was a nice surprise.

She added a footnote: Parking is first come first served. When I got to the building, I found out why she made a comment on the parking. There wasn't any. I had to drive about a half a mile away to find a spot and walk back to my unit. Not a good start. I entered the room which was a studio with a small kitchenette. As i walked through the room to assemble my stuff, I notice a creepy crawler on the bedspread. I'm not sure what kind of bug it was but I quickly trapped it in a glass and carried it outside for a proper release. That sent shivers down my back. But I never saw another such creature during the remainder of my stay. Not sure if it was a roach or a cricket. Other than the uninvited guest, the unit was clean and with the exception of a strong smell of chlorine, was comfortable. I spent 4 nights in this room. The bathroomm was clean and everythign worked well. The third checkmark on the negative column was the lack of bottled water in the rooms. Most hotels offer complementary bottled water because the city water is just so bad. No water. I ended up having to walk back to my car and drove out to find a convenience store. Still no parking when I returned. All in all, the stay was comfortable. Plenty of hot water and it was quiet. But it is not near any shopping or restaurants so a car is a must. There is a restaurant in the main building but it was closed when I checked in. The room had WiFi which was reliable and reasonably fast. I won't come back to this place as a hotel guest.

For starters, we were surprised to find this nice of a large resort on this side of Phoenix. We agree it being close to a lot of conveniences but did not see this much of an advantage between being located on the Northern side of Phoenix/Scottsdale. There is definitely a difference in the \u2018curb appeal\u2019 of surrounding neighborhoods! Our 1-bedroom unit turned out to be generously sized with many conveniences. D\u00e9cor is definitely more dated than other 4 star resorts we stayed in. Some make-shift end tables, improvised cabinet shelves, not very functional dressers, and uncomforatble couch and chairs leave room for improvement. The curtains, especially around the patio door looked fine at first but were right out filthy on their back side.

The rooms themselves have a few nice \"bonus\" entities: dishwasher with soap; kitchen stocked with dishes, blender and toaster; laundry (bring your own soap); coffee (single pot serving)) Other than dated linens, my only complaint about the room was the sound of the air conditioning unit: it's difficult to complain about the a/c because when it's 105, you're thankful you have it but still, it is VERY loud. and must run all night long. Other than that, the room is certainly not luxurious but for the price it's clean, has a nice shower/tub, multiple sinks, DVDs player. Now the not so good: The pool area. While the area itself is clean, it is severaly lacking in umbrellas or cabanas for shade. We just couldn't believe it. The only umbrellas are at the tables. They seriously need to add umbrella stands by every 4-5 chairs. Plus, they need to have the workers (who just sit there anyway) occassionally wet down the concrete. It was so hot, I fried the bottom of my feet just trying to get to the pool; unbelievably hot. The other pool complaint: there are no restrooms by the pool. you had to leave the area. Not very convenient; especially for families. Overall: the location is great.

We gave up and went home, so we lost out on that. I wanted to complain to see if we could get some $$ back but my husband said it probably would not matter.

I went back to my room, called a cab and went down..In the morning I spoke to the GSR at check out and she could care less.. So not only did I have to pay for a cab to go eat, which I should have been able to do at the resort, she could care less about the comments from the restaruant hostess.

First of all, it is close to the airport in a somewhat central location in terms of the valley. Its a quick drive from the airport, very close ASU and less than a mile from the interstate that can get you started on your way to anywhere in the valley. When you drive from the airport you go through some pretty rough areas and as you get close to the resort you begin to wonder if the resort photos were for real or not. Once you get to the resort you will see it is an impressive, well-maintained complex, just like in the photos on the various websites. I've stayed in both the small one-bedroom and large one-bedroom. I wouldn't stay in the smaller unit with more than 2 travelers. Its very nice, but definitely an efficiency apartment type set up - like a nice hotel room that has a kitchen. All the rooms I've ever stayed in have been very clean and comfortable. The pool area is also impressive with lots of chairs and lounges to hang out. They have two different hot tubs and a large heated pool. They have a pool side bar where you can order a drink and they can also get you food delivered from the restaurant. All of the pool staff I've dealt with have been very friendly and helpful - which is pretty much a standard for the resort as a whole. The golf course practice area is outstanding, you can work on whatever part of your game you want to with ample space. The golf course itself is a somewhat challenging track from the tips and very well maintained. For such a nice course, its never been crowded. I've always just walked up and never had a problem getting a round in. One negative aspect of the resort is that the fitness center has some out-dated equipment and is ALWAYS crowded. Fortunately, there is an Anytime Fitness right around the corner that you can get a short term membership too for pretty cheap that is a great set up for whatever type of fitness interests you have. Another potential problem is that parking spaces can be hard to come by if you return late at night. It also seemed like there were a lot of young kids in the main hot tub in the pool area when I went there which was awkward especially considering there is a perfectly good wading pool a short walk away. If you are looking to travel to the Phoenix area, want to stay at a resort with a kitchen, like to play golf and want a location convenient to all points of the valley then The Legacy is a great option.

Nice cozy informal place, with half price appetizers and Margaritas and well drinks from 4:00 til 6:00. The grill is located right by the golf course and had outdoor dining. If you don't eat during the happy hour the prices are a little on the high side. Hot dog on the course was $7.50 (including chips or cookie) a little pricey for my taste. The pool was very nice with a nice view of the surrounding mountains. They have a grill and bar there as well which is convenient. There are daiiy activities but we did not use. There are tennis courts, volleyball and shuffleboard courts. Easy access to the 10 to get most anywhere in the area. I highly recommend this resort for singles or families. If you're a time share owner, your golf rate is reduced by 20%. A larger discount for owners would be nice. The living room furniture in the unit was not very comfortable for watching tv.

In general, this is a nice resort with great people and we had a pretty good time! Arrived early at the resort...check-in was a bit slow but smooth. I got a bit terse initially 'cause I called a few times and requested a \"second floor unit;\" of course, we were given a ground floor unit. My husband and I were told to check back in an hour or so and we would be given an upper unit (which did happen). My husband and I stayed in Unit 1212 (I think)...first building, second level, unit 12...a great location. With a view of the parking lot (no biggie) our unit was clean, well-appointed, odor free, air-conditioned (temps in Phoenix reached 103 on 2 days), comfortable. While the inside of the units could DEFINITELY use a face lift (I think some of the units are undergoing renovations) and new furniture, our unit was alright. No flat screen t.v. (I don't watch t.v. but husband does, of course) but FREE direct line and wireless internet, a really appreciated touch! Small half fridge, electric burners, very limited counter space, limited cabinet space, small-ish kitchen sink, definitely okay as a partial kitchen. I wouldn't plan on cooking big meals in the kitchen 'cause it really is only a partial. Our bed and bed area were great! Bed-very comfortable, pillows-old, thinner foam (not so great but no biggie). Nice touch is the outer and inner sinks in the bathroom/shower area. Good closet space but limited dresser space (in studio we had the drawers of the t.v. armoire as dresser space). My husband sunned on our patio each morning. Air conditioner regulated without difficulty. Shower was great. Everything in room worked. No problems at all! Pool area was actually very nice! A LOT of kids and some rough-housing by teens but ample space and never a problem finding loungers even when arriving at 2:30 pm in the afternoon! Drinks by the pool bar were great! Food could be delivered upon request. Lots and lots of parking space! While the area around the Legacy is NOT the best part of Phoenix, my husband and I always felt safe returning late at night and walking from our car to our unit. The main highway to and from other parts of Phoenix and Arizona (Rte 10) is about a 10 minute ride down Baseline from this resort...convenient. However, the general area is not great and there is absolutely NOTHING within reasonable walking distance...so come prepared! Courtyards and property in general are very well kept, well-lit, gated...very pretty...do not miss the manicured ROSEMARY BUSHES that make the courtyards so fragrant!!!! Concierge gal, Helen was very very accommodating and welcoming. Set us up with a few perks after we agreed to attend the standard 90 minute timeshare presentation. Desk people were wonderful. Timeshare gal got testy with my husband and I over a minor misunderstanding. Overall, we were unleashed from the timeshare presentation much more easily than any others I have attended before...albeit we were practically thrown out-smile. Two BIG positives I MUST mention: Because DH & I missed our flight to Phoenix, we also missed our rental car date. Without an auto for two days (you REALLY need one at this resort), we ate at Trail's End Grill several times. While the food is just okay, the bartender, Tony and the waitstaff, Felicia COULD NOT HAVE BEEN NICER!!!! Husband and I had some FUN times at the Trail's End...great martinis, too! Tony & Felicia gave us TONS of useful information about Phoenix and the surrounding environs...very very helpful! Hugs all around when we left! Second thing...the front desk and housekeeping staff could NOT have been kinder, nicer and more accommodating! I realized I was without a shaver and I wanted to jump into the pool upon arrival. No problem-within 5 minutes of asking at the front desk, housekeeping arrived with several shavers and shaving cream. On another occasion, husband and I wanted more coffee-5 minutes, housekeeping was there with the coffee pods. I HAVE NEVER HAD THAT KIND OF RESPONSE AT A RESORT!!!! MY ONLY COMPLAINT...listening to the couple in the next unit having raunchy, dramatic sex morning and night (most days). WALLS ARE TRULY PAPER THIN because we not only heard them having sex but we could hear their conversations as if they were in the same room as my husband and I. This issue was a bit upsetting to me 'cause I really do not like listening to other people's conversations, let alone their sexual howls. I would not hesitate to recommend the Legacy Golf Resort to others. However, when I return to Phoenix (DH & I will 'cause we are hoping to semi-retire to Tucson someday soon), I will probably try another resort, just for variety!

Don't know how on earth this could be considered close to ASU; I had business on the north side of campus and it would take me 30 min to drive down here via University. I debated about switching hotels, but as it was prepaid and non-refundable, I decided to try it. I would not recommend it, nor would I stay here again. As a timeshare resort, it's a step down from the Starwood and Marriott properties I already own. I don't golf and it's nowhere close to the things I would want to see here. However, it was better than some hotels I've stayed at and it was a very good value for the $52/night rate. The good: Property is large with nicely kept grounds and plenty of parking. Units are a good size. Bathrooms come with a sink, toilet and tub separate from another sink and include two hair dryers and phone in bathroom. Washer/dryer in studio unit, as well as fully-equipped kitchenette with mini fridge, full dishwasher, sink and two burner stove. New-looking Sunbeam appliances. Free internet. Balcony with lounge chairs. Unit was very clean. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful. Reasonably close to shopping and restaurants on Baseline. The not so good: Check-in lobby is underwhelming - small space, only one person checking people in at 6 pm. Have to get a parking pass from another person who pitches the timeshare tour. No room service. Not set up for business workers; small round table that doesn't leave much room for more than a laptop and the ice bucket. Guest binder still refers to wireless; I called tech support when it wouldn't connect, only to be told there was an ethernet cable in the room. HVAC system is very very noisy - it was constantly humming, I couldn't sleep with the noise the first night. Thin walls - could hear the tv going on one side and every conversation on the other, especially when the people were on their balcony or outside the door. No trash can for the kitchenette; I had to use the laundry bag for trash (bathroom trash can was too small). No sponge to wash dishes. Decor is a little dated, but not necessarily run-down; I found the design to be very \"busy\" with lots of different colors and patterns thrown together.

Our first trip to the Southwest. We'll be back to the Legacy. The grounds are immaculate. Our suite was exceptionally clean and nicely appointed. This is not a hotel, it is a timeshare facility with fully furnished condos which include a full washer and dryer and appliances. I've read some reviews regarding outdated decor. I guess I just thought it was Southwest, so didn't seem bad. Master bath was wonderful. I certainly enjoyed the jacuzzi tub. Internet worked fine and was free so my husband and I were able to keep up with work committments that we just couldn't avoid. This resort is on a golf course that is known as being very nice according to area guides. We don't golf so can't attest to that. However, we did enjoy our view of the course with palm trees and mountains in the background. We especially enjoyed watching the golfing groups deal with the sand trap. It was quite entertaining to hear them banter with eachother. I did notice that many of the rooms do not overlook the course, so if a scenic view is important to you then keep that in mind. Also, our suite had older TVs(not flat screens). Was told that the TVs are in the process of being replaced with large flat screens. The ones we had worked well and I didn't miss a flat screen. I don't vacation to watch TV anyways. Too much to see and do in the area. As for noise that I've read about from others, I can't say that was a problem for us. We were on a corner unit on the second floor so maybe that helped, but never heard anything from neighboring units and they were occupied. Loved the pool. Yes lots of little one by the kiddie pool, but if that is bothersome to you, there is plenty of area to get away from them and still enjoy the sun and water. The staff at the pool bar was wonderful. All were very friendly including the \"towel person\". They asked several times if we needed anything, and provided great service when we ordered drinks and food. The concierge, Joyce, was wonderful. She helped us choose a Grand Canyon Tour that matched what we were looking for and we were extremely happy with the service and our guide, Rich, was excellent. He informed us on everything from Navajo and natural history and to current events in Arizona. I can't possibly come up with enough superlatives to do him justice. We told Joyce we were interested in seeing Sedona and she recommended that we take a day trip on our own rather than pay for a tour. She outlined our route on a map, recommended the sights we wouldn't want to miss, areas to shop, and places to eat. We had such a wonderful day. She offered to help us get tickets to some of the Spring Training Games but we already had tickets for the 2 games we wanted to attend. We never did have the opportunity to eat at the resort's restaurant so can't comment on it or the retaurant staff specifically, but any other staff we dealt with were friendly, accomodating, and professional.

The only negatives were that it is kind of awkward to climb in and out of the jacuzzi, almost had to hop into it, and the shower and bathroom flooring were all in marble so made it a little slick. Also my friend actually got bit by a scorpion that was in our bedroom on the floor! She was looking for something she had dropped under the bed and put her arm on the floor and got bit. We called the front desk and they very quickly sent a supervisor down who found and disposed of the scorpion. Also they provided a staff member that was an EMT who gave her some instructions in case of an allergic reaction. I was impressed with their quick service.

A very good friend of ours would be joining us a few days later in his own suite (not on hotwire). At the time we requested to be situated close to each other and of course, were told no problem. When we arrived in town we went a day early to make sure that we were still able to have our friend stay in the same block with us, again, told no problem. We realized when seeing the condos in real life that our friend would want to be close to the pool, if we could be guaranteed he would be placed there too, pay for the upgrade. Keeping in mind this was all the day before our actual check in. We decided to pay the upgrade but prior to doing so was promised our friend, who was travelling with us would be guaranteed a spot in the block with us. The next day upon arrival (told to come early) we were given a map and a choice of two suites, we chose, went back to the front desk where they handed us our card keys and told us if we had not heard from them by 3 o\u2019clock to go ahead and move in. We arrived a little after 3:00 and packed all of our suitcases and bags up the stairs to our suite, only to find the card keys we were given did not work. Myself and our two teenage girls stood watching our bags in 112 degree heat for almost an hour while my husband went back to the front desk, only to find we didn't exist and that room was given to someone else. Fortunately my husband remembered the name of the woman helping us, to no avail, she had left for the day. Finally, over an hour later, it was sorted out and we were allowed to move in. This ordeal was of great concern to us as it was obvious by the buzz in the line up at the front desk, that others were suffering from their promised rooms also been given away.We confirmed once again when our friend was due to arrive in a few days that he would be in the block with us, once again, we were told no problem. On our way back to the room we ensued a violent argument in the parking lot by a group of people that seemed to have hundreds with them overtaking the pool/parking lot/ and barbeque area, the noise from that party went on all night. The following night we entered the pool area, my husband was carrying a plastic cup and my son was carrying a can of soda. The attendant, who knew nothing about what was in the cup met us at the gates and rudely gestured for us to turn around and leave, he never asked what was in the cup, but being a highschool principal, my husband assumed bringing in soda/cup was against the rules and put it in the garbage. Once in the pool area, we realized almost every single party in there were drinking 'something' out of cups, bottles etc and the bar was closed so that couldn't be it. We pointed this out to the attendant who basically brushed it off as whatever he says goes. When my husband and son noticed that the ping pong paddles were being returned they asked to sign them out whereupon the attendant said no. It was 9:20pm and no where near closing time, finally, feeling very uncomfortable with his strange bullying we left. The next night there was a different attendant whom I spoke with as our girls were too nervous to go back to the pool. He said that the other guy was known to act inappropriately. Well, the inevitable occurred, our friend arrived, we went to check him in where he paid in full. He was given his card key in our block and told to come back after the room was cleaned at 3:00pm. After 3pm we helped him move his bags to the promised room to once again find the keys did not work..once again back to the front desk and once again told that they had no idea who gave the keys and there was no guarantees on being given a specific room. When we spoke with the manager to explain how we would never have paid for the upgrade to the block beside the pool had we not been promised our friend to be in the block we would have stayed over in the original room offered. When asked what we thought she should do, we said at least to be compensated for the upgrade we would never have sought, not being close to our friend and she decided everything we were promised about our stay had been given to us. There is actually many more smaller and petty complaints but these were just the main ones, It is safe to say we will not be back.

When I checked in for golf the next morning they said the discount did not apply because they had a discounted rate for the weekend. It is fine, but if you have to pay the same as anyone playing off the street then there is no discount for staying there so stop saying there is. The major disappointment was at the pool. The pool itself was fine but the staff working was not acceptable. The bar staff was ambivalent at best. I presented the discount card when first ordered and they said wait till I close out the tab. I did and didn't check the bill closely - my mistake. When I checked out at the end of the stay, I double checked the bill and found out that they had not taken the discount and to add insult to injury there is a 20% gratuity that is automatically added. There was no warning about the gratuity and they even have a tip jar out. That is unethical and unacceptable. The rest of the staff was not much better. We showed up on Saturday and signed out towels. We found chairs and then started for the pool and one of the other guests told us we couldn\u2019t go in.

The Angels of Anaheim where there during our stay and that was a huge bonus for our boys.

Positive: The resort sits on a beautiful golf course that my husband and boys found challenging and fun to play. The room (we had a master and single combined) was very large, clean and nice. We had a large kitchen with separate eating area, a small living room area, a very large master suite with nice large master bath. In addition, we had a separate bedroom with two beds, small bathroom and kitchenette. We had two laundry areas and two patios looking out on the golf course. The bathroom had marble vanities and the master bath had a jetted tub. It was not the Ritz, but it was very nice. The grounds were well kept and the flowers and mountain views were lovely. I was sursprised at how very big the resort is. The work out room is nice. The golf shop has much to offer. The pool is fine. It is large and there are many chairs along with a bar. It was always almost empty. The tennis courts are very nice. There is a cute children's area with jungle play set, etc. The cons: The resort is located close to the airport and very close to a dangerous part of town. Driving to the resort from the airport, you pass neighborhoods surrounded by barbed wire. While getting gas at a nearby gas station, we felt frightened of the drunks hanging out front. I did not feel safe when I left the resort for a run or walk. In the opposite direction of the hotel, you find Walmart, Target and strip malls. There is nothing charming about this location. You do not want to leave the confines of this resort in any way. If however, you are a business traveler, a golfer, or looking for a spot to stay on your way somewhere else, this is a very nice resort in and of itself.

The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. The room exceded my expectations. Very clean and well equiped with whatever one needs. The pool area was no exception, it too was cleaned daily and the area was well equiped and comfortable. The golf course was inexpensive and was a very nice course to play. The course staff were excellent representatives of a first a rate resort. Courteous and helpful in all aspects. I did not use the restaurant, therefore I am unable to comment in that regard, however, in keeping with everything else there, it was probably very good. They also have a very nicely equiped, maintained and air conditioned workout facility for an afternoon workout when the sun heats up to 110. This is a family oriented resort which is something new to me as I generally look for a more adult oriented vacation, however I wouldn't hesitate recommending this resort to anyone.

The golf shop has a great selection of golf apparel, and you get a 25% discount just for filling out a questionaire. Swimming pool, restaurant, tennis, sand volleyball, hot tub, are also on property. Each morning guests have announcements on voice mail of planned activities available for that day. A one bedroom condo, will provide you with everything you need for a short or extended stay. Washer, drier, complete kitchens, stereo, 2 TV's, double vanity sink, jetted tub, separate room with standing shower and another single vanity sink, dishwasher, balcony, and dining area. Even the studios have dishwashers, washers, driers, fridge, sink, microwave, and 2 burner range.

The clubhouse told them that their liquor license did not allow them to serve us drinks to take to the pool. I questioned the bartender, who was very rude, and asked for a manager. The Manager, Ryan, confirmed that the concession to the restaurant and the pool bar had been sold to different parties effective Jan 2006. As a result, liquor laws did not allow them to serve liquor in the other location. We actually observed the pool staff confiscate someone else's drink. Later, we left the pool and went to the clubhouse for drinks and appetizers. Karen, an excellent waitress, indicated that while they could give us drinks in plastic cups to take to our room, we shouldn't take them to the pool because they would be taken from us.

We had a golf course/mountain view.....just beautiful. The rooms were clean, the grounds were always being spruced up. It was a bit cool for the Arizonians (60's) but for two Wisconsonites leaving sub zero tempatures..it was perfect. Great Tips: The restaurant on the resort Trail...has great breakfast, the pancakes and french toast are more than enough to share so beware. The food is also resonably priced ~ 7 bucks for a egg/sausage sandwich with a side of potatoes. Aunt Chilada restaurant on north of resort on Baseline road is great and great prices. Go to Dobbins lookout on South Mountain....breath taking. **Warning, not intended for those affraid of heights, the drive up the mountain is pretty scary..just dont look down. Steamers in Biltmore Fashion center is delicious..very pricey, a whopping $92 for 18 oz lobster tail ( opted for the blackened red snapper). Delicious **Warning** If renting a car, try to rent outside of the airport...we had to pay a 32% airport sales tax in addition to other fees we ended up paying double for what we booked online. Beware of the welcome package at the resort..it's a timeshare trap, if you do accept a gift for your time....be aware that when accepting the dinner certificates that there is a 22% gratuity tax automaticly deducted from the amount so you really end up half the amount of the coupon after all is said and done.

The resort is very spread out and has really nice rooms. We were booked into a one bedroom in the 9 block, called Casitas. So we had about a 4 minute walk to the main building/golf pro shop. We didn't mind the walk, unless we were booked for golfing, we drove ourselves up to the Bag drop area. For those who do not want to walk far, book yourself in Casitas 1 or 2. #6 is the furthest away. The room was spacious and all of the amenities we expected, although we couldn't find a remote for the 2nd television, but we didn't call to complain, oh and the pepper shaker was empty, otherwise beautiful room. My brother slept on the pullout out couch and said it wasn't very comfortable, so we thought about going to Target to get a bed pad for $50, but never got around to it. Our king bed was ok, definitely not a HIlton or Westin type. One complaint is the location. Not close to any night life for us 30 year olds. We had to drive about 20 minutes to Old Tempe for the nightlife, and wanted the serious nightclubs, but they were 30-35 minutes away , so we never actually made it up there as one of us always had to stay sober. Phoenix and Old Tempe is awesome - it's always Happy Hour! 4-7 and then again 9-close at a lot of pubs including Uno and Great Expectations. The Conceirge desk was very helpful. If you want to go to the Casino, the conceirge desk has tickets for a free limo ride to take you there and back, as long as you agree to stay for 3 hours. Golfing was great with our ownership rate of 25%. And 25% off at the spa too! If you're not an owner, I'm sure there would be incentives to go for a tour. We drove up to the other property owned by Legacy, which is called Orange Tree and it's got a really pretty golf course, and it's more expensive. The rooms are right on the golf course, so not as private as Legacy. Legacy is a good location for privacy and it's on the edge of an Industrial area. The pool is horseshoe shaped and has 2 hottubs that were lovely after a day of golfing! We also went to the Phoenix Coyote game - bought tickets at the box office for the cheap seats $15, and after the 1st period moved down to better seats. Good cheap entertainment! Also drove Tuscon and on the way took a detour to the Biosphere 2, which was cool if you're into science and saw the facility where 6 people lived under a glass dome for 2 years. Also drove to the Grand Canyon - it took 3.5 hours - we went on the American Thanksgiving, so the roads were dead. Mapquest says it supposed to take 4.5 hours, so you be the judge. The drive was worth it!! Gorgeous scenery and don't forget to drive to Sedona! That's only 2 hours from Phoenix and totally awesome for scenery and hiking.

I chose the resort based on positive reviews on this website and was not disappointed. This is not a particularly fancy resort, but it has everything you need for a very comfortable stay, especially for families because of the \"apartment-like\" facilities in the unit. On the other hand, I was there by myself and did not feel besieged by kids running around because the resort is spread out enough. The resort is part of the Shell timeshare system but there is no pressure to join. The resort consists of about a dozen \"clusters\" of two-story townhouses. Each unit has a balcony or patio you can sit on. I asked for a unit with a view and got one on the second floor facing the 18th fairway, which was nice. I had a studio, which was spacious with a king size bed, sitting area with sofa and two armchairs, and a full kitchen (sink, half size fridge, coffee maker, toaster, stove with two burners, washing machine, dishes, glasses, pots and pans, utensils, don't remember if there's a microwave). The unit also has a stacked washer/dryer which was very handy. They provide soap for the dishwasher and also to handwash dishes, but for some reason no soap for the washer/dryer but no biggie. The room was clean and seemed relatively new; no dirt, peeling wallpaper, or other visible signs of wear. There is housekeeping service every day, as in a regular hotel. Parking is outside each unit. The grounds are very well kept. Check-in was smooth. The staff at the registration desk is young and somewhat less polished than the five star resorts, but they were friendly and efficient. I had a problem with the high speed internet connection in my room ($9.95 for 24 hours) and they moved me to another room right away at my request, instead of sending someone to fiddle with the wires. The main building also houses the golf pro shop, restaurant and spa/gym. I tried each of these. The pro shop is well stocked and well run. The golf course was in good shape and well maintained; it scores 4.5 stars in Golf Digest, which is as high as any golf course in the Phoenix area. It's not a fancy course but I enjoyed my round, especially at the twilight rate of $25 (for guests, and $29 for nonguests) which starts at noon. Yes, it's hot, but you have to expect that if you go to Phoenix in June. I had breakfast and dinner in the restaurant. It's good, basic food, like you would expect in a clubhouse. A little pricey for what you get, but not outrageous, and the service was very good. No complaints there. I didn't use the spa services but did use the gym, which was reasonably well equipped with two treadmills, bicycles, weights and so on. The swimming pool is next to the main building and is popular with families, though I did not use it. The resort is about ten minutes south of the airport. As others have noted, you pass through a couple of spotty neighborhoods on the way there and you may want to think twice about stopping at the nearby gas stations late at night because of the people who hang out there. But the resort itself is fine and there are security guards driving around the parking lots all the time. I felt very safe. There are a couple of shopping malls only five minutes away by car (in another direction) and the resort is centrally located for access to other golf courses, restaurants and so on. I think the positives of the resort's location outweighs the negatives. All-in-all, the Legacy is a great place to stay without the expensive frills.

Even had a chance to play golf one nite @5:15pm tee-off, clubs were complimentary as I was staying on-site and they only charged me for 9 holes and threw in a cart. Very nice course and knowledgeable golf employees. Not yet, a top notch resort but w/ a better on-site restaurant, a bit better on-site experience they could achieve in a couple of years. Value was excellent as w/ corporate rate I stayed at the Legacy at a Hamptons Inn price.", "Date": "May 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cLovely resort with beautiful grounds\u201d", "Author": "MLE642", "ReviewID": "UR4978043", "Content": "We stayed in a two bedroom condo at the Legacy for a week with our two teenage sons. The unit was actually a one bedroom apartment with an adjoining studio apartment. Both were very spacious and spotlessly clean. The boys used their studio basically to sleep/wash-up and hang out although it had a kitchenette, terrace and washer/dryer. The one bedroom has a huge living room/dining room/kitchen (fully equipped) with a washer/dryer/dishwasher etc. All detergents etc are supplied so if you go hiking in nearby South Mountain State Park, you can wash your clothing afterwards. The one bedroom bathroom is enourmous - soaking jacuzzi (although no jets for the back), marble shower, toilet (duh) and three sinks. Studio bathroom is pretty standard. One bedroom has two TVs, DVD and VCR plus internet for a fee. All staff was very helpful - whatever we needed, they gave us, promptly and with a smile. Food in the clubhouse was fine - nothing special but most golf courses aren't. Pool area was nicely kept, clean and with a grill house/bar. The fitness room was huge and well equipped - better than most four star hotels actually (I travel a lot for business). I had a massage after a daylong hike and it was done quite well by a CMT. I would strongly recommend that you request a top floor quiet room with a view (either golf course or mountains); we did a few weeks in advance and called to reconfirm. We were very happy with the accommodations. The South Phoenix neighborhood is basic (not scary as some have written but certain not strolling material). If you need to go to the drugstore, Starbuck, supermarket, there are several in the immediately area. The resort grounds are spacious enough if you feel the need for a peaceful after dinner walk. Literally just up the road (32nd St.), a 5 minute walk, is The Farm at South Mountain, an internationally reknown \"Slow Food\" organic restaurant. Coincidentally, it was featured in USA Today as one of 10 top picks in the country while we were there. It is open for breakfast, lunch, happy hour and dinner. Best place to eat downtown is Wild Thaiger on the 2600 block of Central Ave (just past the Heard Museum) - outstanding Thai food - better than in LA or NYC. Overall, I would certainly stay at the Legacy again. It was a great deal and an easy drive to any place I might want to see or do in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.", "Date": "April 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo", "Title": "\u201cNot for everyone\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4970506", "Content": "The legacy has the elements of a good resort such as large suites, proximity to the airport and new facilities such as the pool. The grounds are nicely landscaped. Overall all the makings of a good destination. What lets this place down is the approach taken to guests. This is a resort where half the accomodation is owned and half rented to guests. It feels like guests were an after thought with a tiny, low decor lobby and staff who are pleasant but missing the training and poise of a good resort. If you want a big suite (make sure you get a corner room)with good basic decor this place is good. Don't expect lot's of frills (the restaurant is basically a golf snack bar). The neighbourhood is not the best but nothing most of us can't handle just not the upscale feel of Scottsdale for example. Don't expect to find neighbourhood restaurants above McDonalds or IHOP. Value was good with the old story \"you get what you pay for\". Good rooms, no frills. If you really are looking for a resort with full service go elsewhere. If it's a big basic room at half or a third the cost of Scottsdale resorts, you should check out the legacy.

The service at the restaurant is indeed terrible. There was a baseball game on that night, so there was alot of fighting and shouting (diamond backs vs boston). If you are looking for a quiet place, this isn't the place. The food was, thank God, great! We didn't play the golf there as it was too expensive. In the end, the hotel was above our expectations as we were there just for the room, not the services. Oh.. forget the Concierge, they're never there!

I think some hotels want to make so much money, they pay low wages and don't have qualified front desk people. You know the saying, 'You're only as good as your front man.' When you want to use the pool, you have to check in and get a hospital-type wrist band to show you're a legitimate guest. I have never stayed in a hotel that imposed that. My room had a cricket that chirped all night long and ants that came in and had to be removed. They asked me if I wanted to move rooms, but who wants to move all of their things when you've settled in? The complex does not have enough convenient parking when the hotel is full. The rooms are very nicely decorated and mostly clean, but my bedspread was not clean, it still had popcorn bits on it from the previous guests. I wonder if hotels ever clean the bedspreads very often anyway. The patios are nice and the option of a washer/dryer is wonderful if you're planning on staying long. The towels are nice and so are the toiletries, very nice bathroom. They even give you dish soap and dishwasher soap to use. They're not stingy with the amenities, but they want it to be as nice as possible so you will think about their time share option. They do not try to sell this to you, which is really nice.

When we first arrived they said we had to wait for a room in the towers (which is where we asked to stay based on previous reviews) because they were still being cleaned. So we passed a couple of hours by walking around the grounds, which were beautiful, and eating lunch at the Trellis Restaurant, which was very pleasant. The hotel is right by the trolley but not close to downtown. The area is a little bit sketchy and the restaurants in the area are chains. I did find a good running route along Friar Road behind the hotel which was good because the hotel charges $5 a DAY for gym access. I found this ridiculous. The gym was just ok. The TVs were old school and the remote did not work anyway. The hotel internet in the Royal Palm Tower was not a strong signal (I was on the 9th floor) but better in the conference rooms. They initially tried to charge us a daily internet fee but quickly recanted. The maintenance staff was prompt and very helpful. The Trellis Restaurant's waitress I had each night for a glass of vino was absolutely the highlight of my stay here. The deli staff was disgruntled. The room itself was a bit dated and the coffee machine had no pot. The bathroom was not super clean but acceptable. For the nightly rate I would have expected more. As I said, we stayed in the Royal Palm Towers based on the advice that they were less dated however we found them to be very dated so I am guessing the cottages (I did not see one) were even worse. The TVs were very nice though and the room was large and facilitated some work during the day. The whole place is dated and feels like you have stepped back into another era. They did do an excellent job with the conference itself (as an attendee not an organizer) and the facilities worked perfectly for us. I would recommend the conference facilities but would never stay here again. It was just too dated and not clean enough for my tastes. Also the location was not ideal (not close to downtown or other attractions). The highlight was definitely the helpful staff!", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cThe Good, The Bad, The Ugly\u201d", "Author": "SiouxBarrett", "ReviewID": "UR126657442", "Content": "My family stayed at the Town and Country Resort Hotel for a weekend conference in this year, and our experience was mixed. This property is in some ways very impressive: two swimming pools, a hot tub, a variety of places to eat, a day spa, a conference center on site. If you are attending a conference at the center, I would strongly recommend staying at the hotel: you will get a discounted rate, and the convenience adds a great deal to the value. Even so, there will be some things to be prepared for. There are two different sets of rooms at the Town and Country: one set is in older style, rambling buildings, only two stories tall. The others are newer, and in more modern towers. The older rooms are small, and over furnished. The \"English country\" style chosen is overbearing and the furniture leaves the rooms cramped even when they use double beds instead of the more common queen beds. With that, let's talk about the place. THE GOOD The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. When you call for more towels, help with the HVAC, etc, they are there promptly and get things taken care of. This speaks well for the establishment, all the way around. The restaurants are clean, well-lit, efficient, and the food at the Terraces cafe is quite good. I will recommend the breakfast buffet there - it is a good value for the price. They have hit the sweet spot between variety of foods and price, at least for me. I've already mentioned the convenience if you are staying for a conference. They are also very convenient to all of the San Diego attractions. The property is right off the 8, and very close to the 163. THE BAD: I've already mentioned the cramped rooms in the older part of the hotel. There were three of us sharing two double beds: my husband, me, and our 14 year-old daughter. It is a good thing I am short (5'1\" if I'm standing very straight) because otherwise he and I wouldn't have fit into the double bed provided. The furniture left very little room to live out of a suitcase, which is common for a weekend or other short stay. There is a shortage of convenient parking, at least for the rooms in the older section. I had quite a hike from the car to the room with our luggage. Thank goodness for luggage on wheels! There appears to be plenty of parking, you just have to be willing and able to walk a ways to get to your room. The property clearly does not cater to the \"connected\" crowd. While they have wireless internet, it does not reach all the rooms. Our room was not at the edge of the property by any means, but we could not connect to the internet from the room. We had to go outside, to a gazebo, to be able to connect to the internet. This is a real negative for us. THE UGLY While the English country look was popular in the 80s, it is less so now. The property is well cared for, but the juxtaposition of box hedges and banana trees is jarring. Originally, it appears that the Town and Country was built when the South Pacific was the most romantic getaway (did it ever really stop being that?) and so many of the buildings have the curved roofs reminiscent of a tropical island hut. The pool courtyard was done up to resemble a European garden courtyard, but the buildings around it were round with the curved shake roofs of the original \"tiki hut\" style. This may or may not be a negative in your book, but it does give one pause. If the owners are this confused about the decor, what else are they confused about? All in all, an acceptable place to stay, especially at the reduced rate. You won't find better rates this close to town with this many pluses without having frequent visitor status.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cinteresting hotel\u201d", "Author": "MSURocks1", "ReviewID": "UR126625394", "Content": "this is a big hotel of a different era (as noted by other reviewers)....while dated the place is clean but it's unfortunate little details seem to be a problem for much of the staff.

Nice enhancement - decent channel lineup (no premium channels like HBO) Bathroom - decent size, water heated up quickly, was very clean but while using the room I was able to see the face of the sink counter was put on in a quick fashion and was 1.5\" lower on the right side than the left....the amount of dust bunnies in that 1.5\" was enough to make someone's stomach sick but I could see how this could easily be overlooked because of the where the issue was (but still should have been caught long before now given the age of the room product) Internet Fast - matches the best I've used in any hotel Breakfast Restaurant (Trellis?) - awesome servers....all of them - some of the best!!! Deli - opposite of the above servers...popped in to grab a quick drink (pepsi) but no staff was found, after a few minutes I began to call out - no one answered, finally after at least 10 minutes (yes I did start to time it) someone showed, no apology, no energy he was just \"there\" Sports Bar - see Trellis, great servers This hotel does tend to nickle and dime a bit, charges for Internet (like most full service hotels so I expect that) charges for parking (again like a lot of hotels but that doesn't mean I like it) but the one I do mind is the daily charge to use the gym.....I can't think of the last time I had to pay to use the gym at a hotel Be Warned - \"daily\" does not mean any day that ends in a \"Y\" at this hotel!!!

Knowing that this place would be packed for the conference, I made a reservation 2 months ahead, thinking that I could get a better room. When I made the reservation, I reserved a room in the Royal Palm Tower, which is supposed to be the biggest room with two quenn bed, nice view, and a balcony. However, when I got there, although the front desk told me that I had a two-quenn bed room, when I got to my unit, I found it in a complex (not the tower that I reserved) under a stair case, no view, with two double-beds instead. The beds were not comfortable to sleep on. Since the place was packed with two conferences going on at the same time, I did not ask for a different room, which was a mistake. In addition, the hot water boiler was way over the other side and it took forever just to have loop warm water. When we checked out, I mentioned to the front desk and was told that there was nothing they could do and that queen beds were available \"on requests only\", which I thought I did. It's not like I was asking for compensation or anything. A heartful apology from the manager would've done it. In addition, this place did not have enough parking space to hold two conferences at the same time and we were having hard time finding parking space after we went out for lunch. The last day of the stay, we went to one of their restaurant there to get a bite before I had to go and do my presentation. The place was full of people but only with one waitress. We had to ask three times and it took 20 minutes before the second waitress finally showed up. By the time the food got to our table, I had to leave for my presentation. You would think that the management would realize that there were two conferences going on and schedule more people in those restaurants. Obviously this place only cares about the money and not the customer services. I would not go back there again. And if the conference is going to be held here, I would not go to that conference.

Some of the best parts were the conference center,with the exception of \"the meeting room\" I belive it was sunrise, the building smelled horrible and was musky and old...the staff was very good and the food we had during our meals was awesome!. The grounds were amazing and great to look around. I ate breakfast at the cafe and it was ok, the fruit was awesome, the staff was really good, I had a cup of coffee in front of me within minutes of walking through the door even if they were busy...was to over priced for what you got. The bellman group was also very helpful and good...they did an incredible job. It was quick to tell that the training between them and other groups in the hotel must be done by different people as the level of service is not consistent. The rooms as mentioned in other places are outdated, small things could be done to make it better but they just are not taken care of. In my room the bedspread and curtains were very old and were either very cheap or worn out. The bed was very firm, I happen to like firm beds but could see where some people would have a problem with it. The housekeeping staff is not consistent or even very good for that matter, they need to learn how to dust, the tv stand, picture/mirrors, desk, and the curtain thing above the bed all had dust on them. Each day the room was left in a different state of cleanliness. The mirror in the bathroom was never clean and had what appeared to be toothpaste splatters (not mine) on it and the frame... I did call and request a room service menu but never got it not sure who was supposed to bring it but I figured if they didn't want to give it to me they must not want me to use the service. I did notice that for the people that did get to use room service their plates and dishes were allowed to sit on the floor for hours sometimes over night...I know on one day breakfast dishes were left on the floor by the elevator from around 11:00 in the morning until the next day. Overall I enjoyed my stay and the conference(didn't stay in my room much). I am not sure I'd say here again although I do plan to attend the same conference, I did check out a couple of the nearby(walking distance) hotels while I was there for future reference, they were not only cheaper but appeared to be much nicer, more updated, and offered better services. I enjoyed the $60 hotel I stayed in before I flew out to S.D. much better. If you are staying here for a conference might be ok for you, you might want to check out the other options that are right beside this hotel...not sure I'd stay here if I was just vacationing.

The food itself wasn't great, but at least it wasn't terrible. Luckily, there's a huge mall across the street that I ended up spending most of my free time at. What's sad is that you can tell that this hotel was originally nice. A lot of time and money must have been spent building that hotel. You can tell that they spend a lot of time on upkeep of the grounds.

Walking into the lobby reminded me of Grandma's house, it smelled like a museum and the furniture and decor was very old. My first clue should have been the old font style on the signage outside. Well, the hotel has been around since the 50's and no doubt, it has not been updated since then. Walking to my room looks like the walk through a cell block. Once in my room, the royal blue carpet is dirty, the bedspreads are faded and the underside is yellow, pretty gross. The bathroom's have never been updated, the fixtures are so old and scratch that it is hard to tell if it was chrome, copper or brass. The shower head touched my head and I'm only 5'7\" tall. On the third night, a letter was left on my bedside table stating that they were turning off the water between midnight and 3am. Fine, no big deal until it was shower time, everyone in the hotel experienced a cold shower. The convention center was also very old, they served the luncheons on plastic plates with plastic utencils. Trellises, the restaurant onsite: food was decent, service was wonderful, but the waitstaff begs you to go to TripAdvisor to give them nice compliments. They provide you with a hand written business card with their name so that you can include their names. So Pati Muklevicz and Angelina Stephens, thank you for your fine service. And Robin for your hospitality during dinner. I think the cost of $147 for a room is way out of the range of value for what you get. I get more value spending $100 at the Holiday Inn Express.

Well, long story short, I think things have changed, because I ended up canceling my backup, and spending the week at t&c. Service was excellent, the staff couldn't have been friendlier. We were allowed to check in early, and given a room in the back tower. Parking was also reduced to 5 a day, which was much easier to swallow compared to the normal 14. Our room was very clean and nice. I was actually so surprised by how nice it was I began calling and texting others that knew I was worried about it. The property grounds were very beautiful that for time of year. My only real issue were the on site restaurants, their quality and price points. We ate as a group one evening at Trellises and found the service to be very slow and the food quality to be five out of ten, despite a very expensive menu. We at The Terrace every morning and found it to be very expensive with the quality being near or less than Denny's.

I think changes have been made and continue to be made, nd as such T&C is now one of my favorite SD places to stay.

The first building I was placed in gave me a headache from the horrible smell of smoke as soon as I walked in - it was a low two-story building with room access on the interior. I decided to give it another try and after checking in for my conference came back and again, was nearly knocked over by the smell of smoke (not in the room, but in the building hallways). I called the front desk and was promptly moved to another building - which I very much appreciated. The bellhop arrived in about 5 minutes' time, and moved my baggage (as well as me!) via golf cart to my new room. He was super friendly and nice and gave me good tips on running in the area (I am a runner), which I was able to take advantage of for most of the week. The new room, although the furnishings were a little dated (like my original room), was pretty clean. The bathroom was not as clean, I noticed a little later (the tile floor had a few hairs from previous residents particularly behind the door), but not worth calling about. I did not have a mini fridge or microwave which was fine - bananas make a great breakfast! Every staff member I interacted with (including a maintenance man who replaced a broken light bulb) were incredibly friendly and seemed willing to go the extra mile to make sure I was appeased. A few of my colleagues said that they had requested and reserved rooms with King beds and were given rooms with two doubles (maybe queens) but not told that - honestly, not a big issue in my eyes. I ate at Kelly's Steakhouse my first night there - I am not much of a steak fan but enjoyed the Chicken San Diego that I purchased from their \"Early Bird\" section (on the back of the menu). The molasses baked beans left much to be desired, but my chicken was great and the service was friendly (although a little slow - but with the quantity of customers, you can't expect it all!). The proximity to the mall, as others have mentioned, was great. A few friends had rental cars so we went to the GasLamp District (about 20 minutes away from the resort) one night (highly recommend Rock Bottom Brewery's happy hour - $3.50 beers and great pretzels! - as well as Henry's Pub - great service, good beer, and good food!). We also went to Lucha Libre Taco Shop (15 minutes from the resort) another night - quite an experience and a great burrito! I also made it to Cabrillo National Park (20 minutes away from the resort?) to see Old Point Loma Lighthouse - it is positively gorgeous and has such a phenomal view - well worth the $5 or so it cost as entrance fee. The conference facilities were very clean and well set-up. Our \"group\" had classes in varying sized conference rooms, which was interesting. There are a TON of mirrors here! hahaha But we had gorgeous weather, so I welcomed the walk to- and from- classes and my room. We also were given use of the fitness center for free as a part of the conference (thank goodness!), which was pretty nice and well-\"furnished\" for a hotel fitness room (it is in the Spa! I was confused about that at first). During one of our classes, which was primarily focused on military housing, one other attendee said that this family-owned resort makes their facilities available to military families if they are available (at a low or minimal cost I think) - which I think is wonderful.

I knew I was in trouble when upon check-in, I asked for all feather pillows (rather than foam rubber), and I was told by housekeeping a few minutes later they could only find 2 feather pillows. On a property with a few hundred rooms, I found this hard to believe, but it was clear that housekeeping wasn't going to work very hard to accommodate what I thought was a simple request. My room was very rundown, old, beat-up furniture, the room in horrendous need of refurbishing. The hotel was sold out, and the front desk told me I couldn't be moved to a different room. Be sure to see the pictures I've posted from my room: the torn and frayed carpeting at the entrance to the bathroom, complete with exposed carpeting nails that were sticking up, and the especially unsavory rusty bathtub drain that looks like it has never seen a thorough cleaning. The air conditioning was very noisy, and didn't operate very well, I couldn't cool my room very quickly. Fortunately, it was November, and I could open my balcony sliding glass door and get cool, natural air, and I kept it open all night. That won't be an option for those with safety concerns (I obviously took a risk), and if there are insects during the summer months (I don't know if that's a problem in San Diego or not), it also won't be an option. The hotel property is very haphazardly laid out. On the positive side, my room was very quiet, I heard complaints from others from the business convention I attended that hallways could be very noisy if you were unlucky enough to be in certain buildings. The food was acceptable, though it was still very bland and typical \"business convention\" fare. Since this hotel is nowhere near downtown San Diego, you will pay $30 cab fare each way to go to some place interesting if you want to go on your own schedule. The last picture I posted is of the sign out front. It typifies the outdated nature of this hotel: old 1960s style graphics that fairly scream \"Jet Age Comfort\"! I half expected that George Jetson and his dog Astro would make a celebrity appearance. I know I'm being sarcastic, but this was not a good stay, and the hotel didn't work very hard at all to address the issues I encountered. On my last nite, I happened to meet the hotel manager, and showed him the picture of the bathtub drain that I had stored on my iPhone. He apologized, and promised it would be fixed for the next guest. Hope so.

I paid 9 dollars for a small plate of hash browns and coffee. One cup! There is a \"Starbucks\" in the cafe, but they were using different coffee and flavors but keeping the Starbucks prices and names. The line for the cafe went out the door and around the pool, they would only help one guest at a time and wait for their coffee to be made. Our room was extremely small with an old tv, and smelled like it was 100 years old. They need some fresh air. The nicest part of the \"resort\" is the convention area, which has been mostly renovated. The rest is a 60s flashback. There are no hallways and the whole place is motel style. You have to pay for wifi and the gym. There is no complimentary breakfast. All of the restaurants served on dirty looking cups/plates and smelled gross. Our convention had paid for breakfast, which was 25$ per person per day. I am very happy I didn't pay for it, all we got is hard sausage and watery eggs.

We booked a suite and an additional room - and received anything but VIP or decent service. The maids forgot something major every day - despite a $5 tip in each room (you try drying yourself with washcloths because there's no bath towels). The rooms were dusty and mildewy; we had to have the air filter changed because it dripped with dust bunnies. The faux New England decor must be from the 80-'s; it's like Laura Ashley vomited in the rooms; I mean, it's Southern California! What happened to light, airy, comfortable - and above all, modern?! This place needs a serious overhaul. Peeling paint, doors that stuck, dirty dusty fake flowers, a bed mattress that must have been 20 years old, peeling stickers on the glass doors, and dust and cobwebs everywhere. We expect a bit more when charged $2500 for an 8 day stay. The resort was laughable; horrible food in the restaurants (when open); no disabled access to the coffee shop when the restaurant was closed, because the only ramp goes into the restaurant - and an extremely b***chy hotel rep who basically called me a liar when I said an attendee in a wheelchair couldn't get in. There are serious fines for not being in ADA compliance, I believe - and they should get the book thrown at them. We waited four hours for a luggage cart to move items to the convention ctr; we were charged for a package left at the front desk 10 mins. before we arrived; they charged $10 a day for internet (hello, 1993!); they didn't clean the bathroom before our arrival; the main bar we were supposed to use (Trellis') was closed most evenings, and when open was seriously understaffed, and with horrible food and expensive drinks; Charley's was the same liquor at half the price, so that's where we went. I understand that this is used for a bunch of regional conventions - but boy, we are not a Shriner's or Comic-Con bunch, and we are used to a good hotel, good service, good value for your money, and this place failed to meet all expectations, and was a complete wipeout as an enjoyable decent place to stay. Beautiful rosebushes all around were all that was presentable about this place. It was like my grandmother's retirement community, stuck somewhere about 1983. I am not sure why people like this place - understaffed and surly customer service (they wouldn't even recommend any restaurants apart from the ones on the premises, and they were awful), so I can't imagine why they are still in business. If I need to attend a convention in San Diego ever again, it's back to the Hotel Coronado for us and our employees. This place was terrible.

In the mid-to-late '80's and the early '90's, my family and I used to go to San Diego for vacation at least 4-6 times a year, sometimes more. We stayed at the Town & Country 9 times out of 10. We LOVED this hotel. We've stayed there a few times since on San Diego trips -- have loved it still. I did then and have up until this last trip recommended the Town & Country to anyone asking me where to stay in San Diego, confident that I was recommending the best hotel experience at a great cost. So imagine my shock and dismay when I discovered that while the Town & Country still looks the same, it's gone downhill faster than a top skier at the Olympics. World Fantasy Con was at the T&C this year. That's 1,500 people, at a convention hotel that presumably can handle many more, since they weren't at capacity by any means. I could literally write an entire novel about this experience, so I'll list the \"highlights\". 1. The hotel refused to allow my roommate -- who has been on my reservation for 6 months, AND who, listed on the reservation, would be in either pre- or post-op from back surgery -- to get into our room before I arrived. She asked them to call me while I was on the road -- they refused. She offered to pay for the first night -- they refused. She was told they had to have my credit card and ID physically in their possession. They hadn't needed this when I made the reservation, but now, now it was vital. When she mentioned she was pre-surgery and by doctor's orders needed to be lying down for 50 minutes out of every hour, she was told this wasn't the hotel's problem and ignored. Ergo, she spent 5 hours outside on a pool chaise. Yes, it's San Diego. But at the end of October the Southwest gets cold, and it was indeed cold. And did I mention she's about to have back surgery? Yeah, great way to start your convention. 2. Service was abysmal. The bartender at Trellis' didn't know how to make drinks. Or clean glasses. Or clear tables. Neither did the 1 or 2 cocktail waitresses that were occasionally around. If you got good service from someone at one meal, said good service wasn't repeated the next time you saw this staff member. As near as we could tell, the staff were all working 11 and 12 hour shifts, doing several jobs, and therefore, none of them well. 3. Food was average to awful, and the restaurants ran out of staples like vanilla ice cream and mushrooms. There are 4 restaurants on site -- what property with that much food service runs out of vanilla ice cream, particularly when there's a convention? Especially when there were conventions immediately before, concurrent, and immediately after ours. 4. Everyone's a supervisor if they think you're unhappy. Every single time we asked for a supervisor, the person we asked always said, \"I'm the supervisor.\" Either the entire staff is \"in charge\" at the T&C, or they've learned how to avoid getting complaints, by taking a complaint about their own awful service and not sending it up to management. 5. The beds are like slabs of concrete. I know some people like this, but no one I spoke with happened to be among this group, myself included. I realize upkeep on a large convention hotel is costly, but when your average Best Western has better beds, you know it's time to invest in a decent set of mattresses. 6. Complete lack of interest in guests' needs, enjoyment, etc. I've never stayed at a hotel of this size where literally no one gave a damn about whether or not the guests were happy. We were not happy, and it was obvious, and stated many times, and yet almost no one cared. 7. We were charged a \"handling fee\" for a package that was sent to our room. Only, we never got it. We only found out that a package had been sent to us on Thursday when the sender called on Saturday to ask if we'd enjoyed the gift. Upon searching, we were able to get our package, which was clearly marked. They didn't have change for a $20, though, so that had to be charged to our room. No one cared that they'd had a package of perishable items for 3 days without even trying to deliver it. It wasn't their problem, which is what we were told. 8. Pool hours are not clearly marked, especially if you're trying to go to the pool at night. Which we did. We were the only people in the pool because it was late at night, but the pool's location has excellent acoustics so we were discovered by two armed guards. How do I know they were armed? They had their guns out as they came to, I guess, shoot us out of the pool, since we were there after hours. After giving two dangerous women a stern talking to about how we were pool hours rule breakers, and after we explained that, since there were no signs anyone other than Superman could actually see, and asking if the pool was really off limits, why the heck were all the doors without pool hours signs on them open, they went of to protect the property elsewhere, guns at the ready. 9. The \"hostess\" at Kelly's Steakhouse refused to put two 4-tops together so my party of 7 could eat together. She told us to go to their bar and turned her back on us. We went into said bar. The hostess then sent about 20 more people in after us. The ONE waitress for the bar was, unsurprisingly, overwhelmed. The restaurant never sent in another server. One of our meals wasn't put in, and when it finally arrived, 1 minute before we were leaving, it was so well done it was like shoe leather. I could go on. And on. And on. Let's look at the few, far too few, positives. 1. Housekeeping was awesome. Our maid (Josephina) was excellent -- possibly the best, most consistent maid service I've had in years. Housekeeping was quick to handle requests and pleasant while handling them. 2. The grounds are still lovely, lush, and well maintained. Same for the pools. And the whirlpool. 3. Some servers heroically managed good service at least one time each, so I can point to a lunch at Trellis' (Angelica), a lunch at Terrace Cafe (Andrea), a drink at Trellis' (F&B manager, who, due to circumstances we were in at the time, we weren't able to take aside and speak to about our many issues with his staff), a front desk clerk (Jeremy), and the night manager (who was on, literally, her last night on the job when we spoke to her and shared all of our dismay) who all managed to give us some good customer service. Our most enjoyable meals, other than the ones where a T&C employee managed to give us the kind of service you expect at a resort/convention hotel? They were at Pam Pam's Restaurant and the Valley Inn Coffee Shop on the other side of Hotel Circle. Those are attached to the Day's Inn and the liquor store, respectively. But their food was good, their service excellent, and they were actually happy to see us and our money. And they weren't understaffed, and all of our food arrived at the same time and cooked perfectly. Go figure. Speaking of going, I'm saddened to say that I doubt I'll willingly go to the Town & Country ever again. Which is too bad, because I'm back to going to San Diego regularly again. But since all my fond memories are tainted by this experience, I don't want to taint my family's memories, so the Town & Country is off our list and we'll talk of it in the past tense from now on.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winslow, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Staff, Great Location, Great Place\u201d", "Author": "Linda O", "ReviewID": "UR119928150", "Content": "The staff were wonderful!

It is a 38 acre property, which sounds nice, except it is 38 acres of concrete and asphalt between a freeway, shopping mall and a train depot. The room quality was poor. The hotel has various room options from single level bungalows, to very old concrete condo style with outdoor catwalks. The buildings are unpainted concrete, poorly lit at night. The room itself had parque fake-wood and a moldy bathroom door frame. The bed was way too soft, and sagged in the middle. Towels were super- worn, and the shower head was only mounted at about 5 feet, so you had to \"duck\" under it. The bathroom amenities were poor and scant, with some heavily perfumed soap. The iron leaked and did not get hot enough to iron a cotten suit dress shirt. It would seem the last update to the property was in the 1970s. Hallway (outdoor) noise was noticeable when trying to sleep, with a car alarm going off. Building was surrounded by asphalt. TV in room was old school (not flat screen) and every channel had snow so it was hard to watch. I tried to adjust the cable wire, but the tv was cable strapped to the bureau making it impossible to move. AC unit noisy. I tried to open the door to my balcony, but the handle on the lock cracked when I tried to. So much for fresh air. The carpeting was an odd dark blue. This was the type of room where you wear shoes and don't go barefoot for fear of picking up bacteria. The breakfast restaurant was atrocious. They offered a buffet consisting of packaged cereal, watery eggs and bacon so crisp it was in edible. Most interesting, when ordered off the menu the \"French toast with fresh cream and berries.\" I was treated to an artful and overwhelming pile of Ready-whip spray cream. So much so I couldn't see the French toast. So much for \"fresh cream\". The sausage links tasted to strongly of pork, it was the oddest thing. Just awful, odd and frustrating. I must say, even for people used to staying in dumps, this one takes the prize. Seriously, it should be shut down. There are probably a dozen national chain quality hotels nearby, including a DoubleTree and a Courtyard nearby. For your health and sanity, try those first.

To get everything wrong as consistently as the Town and Country does - they have to be trying. No way could this much badness be an accident. Sleep on a park bench before you stay here. A few highlights, I mean lowlights. The rooms are very old, dingy, and dated, all beat up. All rooms are entered from the exterior - there are no interior hallways. The headboard for my bed didn't actually reach to the floor. It was too small so it had been bolted to the wall. The alarm clock was hidden behind the TV with the cord wrapped around it (so off) - I found that it on the last night of my stay. TV was blurry, I don't know how they managed that with cable. It was perfectly alright for a hotel worker to stroll along the hallway at 5am with a noisy cart - who needs sleep? The bathroom door would not close - it was one of those sliding doors that had come off the runners years ago - which is probably an apt metaphor for the entire property. No safes in the rooms, great for a conference venue where everybody brings a laptop. No ramp to get into the tower unless you walk all the way round the back. Conference logistics were anything but logical - meeting rooms downstairs, exhibition halls and break rooms upstairs, not reachable without going outdoors (it was raining of course). The \"high-speed\" internet timed out on simple Google searches. The food was even worse. Kelly's is the worst restaurant I have eaten at in a very long time. After being seated we waited 30 minutes for someone to say, \"I'll be with you in a few minutes.\" Drink orders were taken, then another 30 minutes later, food orders. When we complained the server was extremely rude. The food was abysmal - $25 filets and such that were not as good as you can get at Denny's. My \"demi glaze\" was actually a runny soup. My neighbor's ribs were \"horrid\". Last night there I ordered a hamburger and a beer from room service. It arrived 95 minutes later. 1 hour and 35 minutes for a hamburger! I called twice to ask about the delay and was assured both times that it was on its way. It wasn't of course, which was easy to tell because my receipt had the order time printed on it - after my call. The room service was also rude to me when I asked why a hamburger was taking so long. Everything about this hotel screams cost cutting and being cheap. Calling a place a resort that is (a) in the middle of town, (b) has nothing but a pool, and (c) has consistently below standard service and amenities - is just wrong.

Worst resort I have ever stayed at!!!!\u201d", "Author": "HST_Gal", "ReviewID": "UR118996147", "Content": "My friend and I recently stayed at the Town and Country Resort for 5 nights and wished we were somewhere else most of the time we were there. The front desk staff were not very welcoming, and although we arrived early, we were told our rooms would be ready by 3:30pm. We checked back with front desk staff at 4:30, and only one of two rooms were ready. It was 5:45 pm before the second room was ready. The front desk staff did not apologize for the inconvenience at all. The rooms were not what we had registered for nor confirmed. We registered for rooms with king beds and both of us actually ended up with rooms that had two double beds. Both rooms had 1 inch gaps between the bottom of the door and the flooring, which would have allowed insects and small critters to enter the room. As a result, we both stuffed towels and pillows under our doors each night to avoid such scenarios. One room did not have a hair dryer available, and when one was requested, it took nearly 55 minutes before it was delivered. When my friend attempted to use the hairdryer, there were sparks coming from the plug of it. The bathtub in one room was not clean \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there were rings of soap remaining from shampoo bottles utilized by previous occupants. The Kleenex box was empty and was not refilled for two day and the d\u00c3\u00a9cor was extremely dated - like 1980s!! There were no desks in the rooms for working, and as a resort that is accustomed to hosting business conferences, the rooms should all have proper desks and appropriate chairs conducive to business. The small round table and chairs are absolutely not conducive to effective working conditions for business personnel. There were no extra blankets available in the room which is especially critical since neither the heating nor air conditioning units were in working order. The water bottles in both rooms were not replenished after being consumed by occupants 2 and 3 days prior. There was no refrigerator or mini bar/snack bar available in rooms which is absolutely standard at every other \"resort\" I have stayed at. A proper resort would never offer a combo shampoo/conditioner product, but rather would offer spa quality personal products. As a result, my collegue and I went out and purchased shampoo and condictioner for use during our stay. One of our rooms was located next to a housekeeping room, and staff was extremely loud and disruptive beginning as early as 5:30am. So rude and inconsiderate!!!! Numerous carts were being pushed around at all hours of the day and night by staff, and was extremely disruptive. Many conference attendees had the same complaint. The security was inadequate to assure the safety of hotel guests. While this is a large complex, the resort could and should implement some basic safety precautions, such as having security personnel on duty and walking the premises, installing entrances that require use of card keys to enter hotel areas. Anyone could walk onto this property at any time without being stopped by personnel or card key access points. The food and service quality at each of the hotel restaurants was substandard. The staff no more than handed us our menus, and they proceeded to ask us if we were ready to order. When we requested another minute or two, they walked away and did not check back with us for nearly 10 minutes. Despite our attempts to get their attention, they continued to talk with other restaurant staff, and were oblivious to our attempts to wave them over/get their attention. Once we got our food, we repeatedly waited in excess of 15-20 minutes before our wait staff checked in and gave us our bill. There was a fitness center on the property but we were told that cost extra. That is ridiculous to charge extra for fitness center...especially at a resort! To top this ALL off, when we went down to check out, we weren't even asked how our stay was which I guess is not surprising b/c Im sure they are tired of hearing from guests how bad it is. They also didn't even offer to help us out to a cab with our big bags and is not easy to get out the door of that lobby. Appalling!!!! This entire property is in dire need of updating and a general maintenance overhaul!

It smelled like someone had peed on the carpet, or there was a lot of mold/mildew in the room. Perhaps this particular room had not been used in months. I don't know but it smelled bad. The hotel was overbooked, so I could not change rooms. I did not have a car, so it was difficult for me to change hotels and still attend the conference. Several other attendees were complaining--some moved to different hotels, some were finally moved to the tower. I was never able to change rooms. The tower rooms from what I was told were better than the garden rooms. My garden room was a little dated, and the bed was not that comfortable, but that I could handle, if the room did not smell. After high use of air conditioning during the day and heat at night, the smell cleared somewhat, but everytime I went outside and came back in the smell was there.

The bathroom was nice and roomy however the lights were a bit dark when first turned on. The bed was firm, but we both slept great all week. The downfall in the room were the pillows: they sucked, but we still slept good. We ate at the Terrace Cafe, Charlies, and Trellises during our stay. Breakfast at the Terrace Cafe: we had the breakfast buffet a few times and thought the price was pretty good at $14.50. The cheese danishes were really good. We also had cafe mochas and hot chocolate and cookies at the little cafe in the evening, and service was always good. We had one lunch at Charlies and shared the burger sliders: nothing wow. We had read reviews about how great Trellises was, so our last morning we had breakfast. Very expensive: we thought our $30 buffet was a little high (for 2) but we spent close to $60 for 2 at Trellises. The selling point: we both had the eggs benedict and wow!!! they were great. Had a sticky bun, cheese danish, and juice/milk with both. Angelica was an awesome server. She was so funny and wonderful to be around. The grounds were amazingly beautiful. They should rename the resort the 'Rose Resort'. The pool was disappointing because we read it was heated: still way too cold for us, but the hot tub was something we enjoyed several evenings while there. Very close to the Fashion Valley Mall: right behind the resort with a quick walk. The trolley stop was also right behind and for two people who have trouble with public transit, we did very good.

I was at this hotel for several days for a conference. As part of the conference, breakfast and lunch were provided for the conference attendees daily in the Golden Pacific Ballroom. There were over 450 registrants for the conference, so there was a sizable number of people for whom to provide food service. I am on a gluten-free diet, so I asked one of the staff the first day which food items at the lunch were gluten-free. I was told that Wes was the person to ask, and they found him for me. I was basically expecting that he would likely be able to find someone who was knowledgeable enough to answer the question, perhaps after a long delay, which happens at many hotels, and simply let it go at that. Not many people have a good understanding of gluten and how to ensure that food is gluten-free, in part because it is a technically complicated issue. When I asked Wes about gluten-free food, he sprang into action immediately, got me the answer quickly, and explained it very clearly. On the next day, he took it upon himself to locate me during the morning general meeting of the conference (out of the many people in the room) and asked me if I would like a separate plate prepared with only gluten-free food for me during lunch. At lunch, he brought me a specially prepared covered plate of gluten-free food and asked me where I would like to sit so that he could bring it to the table for me. The next day, he did the same thing, and each time he explained in advance exactly what food items would be included in the specially prepared plate and asked for my approval of them. On the day of the last lunch, he told me that all food items at the buffet table were gluten-free (except the rolls), so I could select from nearly the full variety of food available. This top-flight level of service far exceeded my expectations and is unsurpassed in my experience, especially considering that there were so many other people during the meals to take care of as well. It demonstrates great attention to detail, a superior level of knowledge, and most of all a first-rate attitude. Apart from my basic initial request for information, I didn't ask him to do any of this, so he clearly went out of his way to go the extra mile. I rate the service he provided as five stars, and actually a very high five stars.

The staff was rude and unprofessional to us from the moment we arrived. For example, we asked the bell staff to call us a cab--but instead, Elisha--the bell captain, gave us a card for her friend's private (and undoubtedly more expensive) car service. This was happening as we watched other cabs pull up to the hotel for other guests. I think she figured we were young and was trying to take advantage of us with the expensive car service, while she had no problem calling cabs for other older customers. The next day we used their complimentary shuttle to drive five minutes away to order take out In N Out Burger to bring back for our group. This was working perfectly until we called the hotel to have the van come get us and were told it would be 25 minutes before they could come. This was after we were told by the driver to simply call the hotel when we were done and they'd come right back and get us. And oh guess, what--surprise, surprise, Rhodes Scholar, Elisha was in charge of dispatching the vans and wouldn't send one to get us. She said the driver was on lunch. Oh really? You knew you had customers out and would need a ride back soon and you approved a lunch break when nobody else would be available to pick us up? Brilliant. They also refused to pay for a cab to bring us back, so we had to simply wait for the van to \"become available\" as Elisha put it. When the driver finally returned, he asked what took so long and said that he was never on lunch. So the dispatch is lying now. Upon returning to the hotel, I asked for Elisha's manager, though the only person around that was above Elisha was a similarly unprofessional woman named Tina. As Elisha went to tell Tina that we were waiting for her in the lobby, we literally saw Tina roll her eyes in annoyance that we wanted to speak to her about this. Tina was as unwillingly to apologize for this error as I imagined she would be. And she even had the gall to blame the driver more than once. Wow. Sure, blame the lowest guy on the totem pole for a mistake that you could have easily corrected, and couldn't have possibly been his fault as he is not the one dispatching the vans. At one point, she must have been exhausted by my insistence that she apologize and take ownership b/c she turned exasperatedly to her partner in crime (Elisha) and whined, \"What is it that she wants me to do for her? I mean, is there anything we can possibly do for her???\" Mind you reader, she is asking this with all the sarcasm and disrespect she could muster. So there you go. And for the record, the only nice staff members we encountered there were the van drivers. We had used them several times before this incident and Oscar, Orlando or Octavio--can't remember which, and Kirk or Kurt--can't remember which, were ALL extremely polite, helpful and courteous. The problem there is Elisha. And Tina. And however much further up the chain of command it goes--I don't know. Additionally, the decor was outdated, and the grounds a little run down. Beautiful roses were in bloom, but also untidy. We had to shout \"Hello? Is anybody here?\" when we first walked into one of the restaurants bc nobody was staffing it. We ate one meal there and it was good, but nothing to write home about. They have three pools on the property and oddly they wouldn't serve food or drink at the pool. There was a complete lack of visible signage which was annoying b/c it is a big property and easy to lose your way. We had two hair dryers plugged into one room and the power went out. We joked about this hotel feeling like an assisted living community b/c there were so many old people in wheelchairs and the decor lives up to that.

My only complaint is that most of the hotels in this area include free parking and internet - this hotel charges extra for both of those via \"packages\" that you buy daily - so it adds an extra $12 a day to your bill for these \"luxuries\" that in this century are no longer luxury items but necessities especially for a business traveller staying at a resort and convention centre. The parking and internet fees in this era are truly pass\u00c3\u00a9' and this resort should evolve out of them.

We told them he had to go! Still, it took 30 minutes. I tried to find the history of this place, online. All I could find was what was outside my door. A strange, eerie world.

Upon arrival, we (my girlfriend and I) checked into the hotel just a stroke before midnight, and were informed that we had already been checked in. We both exchanged a few words of confusion, which I'll just assume the front desk employee didn't pick up on, and were handed keys and shown a map of where we were to park. The hotel is spread out over a sizable area, with a portion of the rooms being in a 10-story or so tower-like building and the rest of them being in what I can only describe as trailers. Not trailers like the on-wheels kind of trailers, I mean trailer park trailers. If a trailer park and an apartment complex had an illegitimate child, it would probably be called the Town and Country Resort. We ended up driving for 20-30 minutes searching for parking, as the parking situation is best described by the words \"pure idiocy\" and \"moronic\". The vast majority of the \"streets\" around the \"resort\" are practically one lane, leading to plenty of drawn out and awkward scenarios where you'll be maneuvering around another poor soul's car. Each set of trailers has it's own parking lot, only fitting about 20 cars or so, which is far too few. Around the corner is a two-story parking structure (one lane) and with a bafflingly low 6-foot clearance. In our search for a parking spot, we drove around the cramped structure only to reach the abrupt end of it, which is just a wall, so getting out of the structure (one lane, still) involves having to make your car shuffle into the opposite direction to leave, while hoping no one is coming in the opposite direction. We finally found parking in the back lot, which is much larger but has tiny parking spots and, again, narrow lanes to navigate. We got out of the car and spent 5-10 minutes walking back to our trailer style room, slid the key into the door, opened the door, and were greeted with a room with luggage and clothes strewn about, as it was already inhabited. We left and made management aware, who offered us another trailer room, which we dutifully declined, already angry that it was now pushing midnight and we just spent 20 minutes looking for parking just to turn right back around. Skipping all of the issues between, we were eventually moved to a room in the tower style building. Like the rest of the hotel, the room is disastrously dated. Don't let the photos online fool you, I am scrolling through their provided room photos now and none of them match the room we were in, which I'm assuming was a step-up from the trailer style room. The bathroom is small and the floor is made of dirty tiles, and (my favorite part) the shower head is about 5'5\", so I spent a great deal of time trying to kneel down beneath it. I just grit my teeth and pushed through this problem though, as I knew that the quicker I got showered and dressed, the quicker we could leave this horrid place. I would not suggest this hotel to anyone, not even my worst enemy. I've stayed at plenty of hotels that looked cheap or dated on the outside, but had those stays redeemed by passable room interior- this was not the case.

And in every room there is a large and CREEPY picture of a young girl in 18th c. dress that seems to watch your every move. Who thought THAT was a good idea? Did someone get a discount on prints of ugly child pictures??? The entire resort needs an overhaul, especially given the price for the rooms and services. It's not unusual to be nickel-and-dimed to death in hotels, but this hotel is charging top prices for a hotel that's one advantage is its location: in Mission Valley, close to Interstate 8 and Fashion Valley Shopping Center, and minutes from the ocean, downtown San Diego, and Balboa Park. Aside from location, Town and Country \"Resort\" Hotel can't compete with other similar properties. It doesn't help that the staff is uncooperative and sometimes out and out rude. We come to this hotel annually for a convention (it's the ONLY reason I would stay here). One year, the hotel staff caused the convention to come to a stand-still by forcing participants to move out of their rooms immediately despite earlier approval of an extended check-out time. They literally threatened to go into the rooms and remove all items, placing them in the hallway or outdoor pathways. Again, this was after approving a late check out time. One year we left, and within minutes realized we had left an item in the room. We called immediately and was told Reception would have to check with Housekeeping. Subsequent calls were treated with shortness and simple \"Nothing was found.\" This was truly one of the rudest Reception desks I've interacted with, at least in half the interactions I had with Reception employees. This hotel always seems busy. Some of the money coming in from higher rates and extra fees really needs to go back into the rooms and grounds. Planting rose bushes everywhere may make the grounds pretty, but it doesn't mask peeling paint, dated decor, and bathrooms that need a replacement of tubs/toilets/tiles etc. You can only pile on grout and sticky sealants so many times before it looks really tacky. If you are staying here by choice, rethink it. There are better values and better rooms in the same vicinity. If you are here for a conference, just be sure you don't leave anything behind and deal very frankly and firmly with the staff.

However, during my last several stays, I've noticed the level of service, food quality and room decor deteriorate. I agree with other reviewers that the rooms are outdated and in need of renovation.

How can that be and if so, why didn't they call to let me know so that I could have chosen another meal? I asked for a discount on the dinner and was told that they couldn't accommodate that request. They offered to send me soup or dessert free of charge. I chose a cheese cake, which wasn't very good. I would have preferred the discount. The food of the breakfast buffet for each four mornings that I ate there to be lukewarm. Aren't there food temperature laws in California? The selection wasn't as good as in previous years. Also, there was no toaster available to toast the bagels, etc. How about bringing back the toaster as part of the breakfast buffet? The coffee, supposedly Starbucks, was absolutely watery.

Also they did not mention that this would be going on during my stay and completely ruined any chance of afternoon naps, reading, or any quiet activity in the room. -They nickel and dime you to death (internet $10, gym $5, parking $14, check out earlier than initial check out date after you check in and you have to pay for a FULL night - even if it's with 6 days notice, .50 per local call) - apparently you can get a \"bundle discount\" for internet, parking, and gym but they don't mention it when you check in. -Room smelled like smoke -Shower head only good for short people (luckily I'm short but for anyone over 5'3\" it could be a definite negative) -Phone was old and had bad reception (even for local calls) The hotel is fine if you have a conference on the grounds here - if not DEFINITELY stay somewhere else where you will get more quality and some of your basic amenities included!", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat place if you got money to burn\u201d", "Author": "groves_six", "ReviewID": "UR105737127", "Content": "Good: hot water, nice flowers, most of staff is friendly and helpful.

The ONLY redeeming feature of this hotel is the staff. They were attentive and prompt. Otherwise, I would describe this hotel as dated, over-priced (in every respect) and terribly located. To start with, the entire complex seems to have been designed and built some time in the 80s, and from the stains on the carpets and drapes I assume there has been no renovation since (never mind the creepy print of the little girl hanging in the room). This place will also nickel-and-dime you to death. They charge for use of the fitness room, parking (specially DISCOUNTED rate of $8 per day -- usually $16 for guests), and $10 per day for very patchy and painfully slow internet. What is it about the inverse relationship between the rate you pay for a hotel and the likelihood that internet will be included?!?! They have plenty of on-site restaurants that provide service with a smile (again, the only redeeming quality) but you'll end up paying way too much for really mediocre food. The location doesn't help -- it's in a wasteland surrounded by highways. The five nights I spent here were among the most unrestful I've ever had... and I'm into backpacking. To starte, the beds were terribly uncomfortable. Every night some time between 1 and 2am we were disturbed by loud conversations from people returning to their rooms; it seems to me that a complex like this should really have a designated quiet hour. Bottom line: the management of this place is incredibly negligent.

While a lot of our people stayed at nearby hotels, most of us were here and everyone attended sessions and meals at the T&C.

It's an older property, made up of many one and two storey buildings sprawling around a large campus, filled with pools, gardens and courtyards, plus a couple newer towers at the back. The usual amenities in the rooms, several restaurants, gift shops, day spa etc. A nice big convention center unobtrusively on one side. Pros: - The afore-mentioned service. Every staff member was friendly and pro-actively helpful, whether I was in the coffee shop or taking a short cut and getting myself lost in the bowels of the laundry. :-) - Everything was spotlessly clean, everything worked, and everything looked nice (no mean feat in an older property). No broken blinds, crumbling sills, spotty showers or threadbare linens to be found - full marks to housekeeping & maintenance. - We ate all our meals in the convention center, and for having to feed 3200 in about an hour per meal (plated meals each time), I was extremely impressed. (Except for breakfast. Oh well.) Fast, quick, friendly and even tasty, too! - Well-located and easy to find. And just a 5minute walk across a footbridge over the river to a mall, should you want more dining options etc. - A lot of space, if you're booking for a group. Nice convention center, and a host of smaller ballrooms and meeting rooms, as well. Many of them have nice views to gardens, pools, etc. - Staff will drive you around in a golf cart if you need it. - Character! Peace and quiet. I took some free time one afternoon and just wandered around the gardens and courtyards. I'd much rather stay somewhere like this than a high-rise block that could be anywhere. Cons: - Well, for those who don't appreciate that character...It is older, which in many areas means \"smaller\". I think I was in the \"Traditional Accommodations\" - very small room. (We referred to it as the \"European section\".) If you need your space, or have more than two in a room, ask for one of the towers.

One of our rooms was given away - we were told the previous guests had decided to extend their stay. Our couple was offered a \"parlor\" (the sitting/dining area of a suite - it's a separate connecting room, and wasn't in use) and rollaway beds.

The room I stayed in had a shutter-style window, so the window doesn't actually close. This gave me the opportunity to hear everyone as they walked by my room and the freeway. What a horrible design idea. The room has three \"porno\" style mirrors on the wall in front of the bed. Apparently, I was not the only one who thought that, which was evident by what I can only imagine were bodily fluids on the mirror. Whoever picked out the artwork for the room needs to find a new line of work. There was a picture of this creepy looking vintage-style girl on one wall. If you ever stayed there you know what I'm talking about. If you ever stay there you will know what I mean. Bring something to cover the picture. On another wall was a latin-inspired print and colonial style flowers on another. I have no idea how they thought that matched. The bathroom had close to no room to put anything on the sliver of a counter they offered. Of course you wouldn't want a big counter since it would make the child-sized toilet look even smaller. The ironing board had years worth of crud on it that I feared would get on my clothing so I opted not to use it. I wont even bore you with my comments on the bedding, but enjoy. It's 2001, upgrade your 19 inch, broken, tube television. I ate one of their sandwiches they had for sale in the deli. If you get one of those, be sure to order two drinks so you can use one to soften the bread. I went to Charlies which is their pub style restaurant. Their food was actually okay. Their employees were appalling. I was the only customer when a group of ten people showed up and decided to eat outside. The entire staff made inapropriate comments about those customers. I know everyone jokes, which is fine, just don't do it in front of other customers. The resort will continue to fill their rooms since employers will continue to send employees there for conferences, which was why I was there. If your employer hasn't paid for your room and you don't require the convenience of being on the grounds for a conference, stay at the Double Tree.

I stayed here as part of a very large international conference. Our first room was like motel-hell and was way overpriced for what you get. The second room was much nicer, but I don't want to know what they are charging for it, as I might pay the \"C\" class rate for the \"A\" class room I was upgraded to. (might). The rooms are clean and they don't smell. The tower room that I was upgraded to was very quiet - definitely a huge plus for me. As I mentioned, we were here for a conference, so we had limited amount of time to eat lunch before we had to go back in for the afternoon sessions. We sat at Trellises for at least 20 minutes (I think it was closer to 30 but I'm trying not to exaggerate anything in this review) without anyone taking our order. Thus, we didn't have time to eat, especially since we had to go back to our room which was the first one and was approximately 5 minute walk (one way) from the conference hall. I complained, and they offered a free meal, but I asked for the upgrade to the new room instead. So, as you can see, they make concerted efforts to make up for the issues. Service was also extremely slow at Charlies. I didn't attempt to have lunch there but it's a good thing we didn't have any sessions after dinner because I think we might have missed eating entirely. Good things: If you are on the correct side of the property, the mall behind the hotel is a very short walk (shorter than the walk from the conference hall to our old room) and there is some decent restaurants there. It's saying something that we had more time to walk to the neighboring mall and eat in the restaurants there and walk back then we did to eat on the hotel property. And the food in the mall is better. The landscaping is gorgeous. Finally, I know I'm picky about internet but the wifi was worse than usual. Sometimes you can get on, sometimes you can't. When you do get on, it's so slow I could run down and get a latte and come back only to find the website timed out. Don't expect to be able to work while you are here. I could go on, but I will summarize to say that we had a lot of issues and complaints but the hotel did their very best to make up for them. That's the only reason they even get a 2/5 rating.

I traveled here for a conference, and while the hotel was beautifully landscaped there was nothing else to compliment- especially at $130-150/night. I tried to check-in and the front desk said that the reservations I had made in October had been deleted 2 days before my check-in (This also happened to one of the colleagues I was travelling with). I had the paperwork from my original reservations in hand so they finally relented and gave me a room. My colleague was denied a room and ended up at the Marriot across the highway (much nicer and newer anyways). The hotel is very spread out, and I dragged my luggage to a two-story building in the center of the \"resort\" - there were no elevators so I had to carry everything upstairs myself. I found an extremely dated room that looked older than I am. The room was a decent size but the walls were thin and I could hear my neighbors. Cracked tiles in the bathroom, hair on the bathroom floor, the tub handle came off everytime I tried to turn on the shower and the toilet rocked. My closet doors didn't shut all the way, and there was only one available power outlet in the room, unless I wanted to unplug the lamp in the room. The bed was hard and the comforter was so old that it was covered in fuzzies/pilled spots on the fabric. The tv was old and only got a few channels and I got to use the internet for 5 min one day out of the 6 I was there by walking to someone else's room. The hotel has wireless but it is EXTREMELY spotty and will cut off in a few minutes. The maid staff seemed nice, but were never consistent in what they left me- one day they took the bar of soap I left by the sink and never replaced it, somedays I had plenty of towels, somedays there wasn't a single washcloth in sight. I tried the Sunshine Deli, The Cottage Cafe, Trelisses and Charlies. The staff and food at the Deli were great- they had amazing chocolate chip cookies. The Cottage Cafe was okay, Charlies was completely unaccomadating to food allergies and food allergies were hit or miss at Trelisses. We had lunch at Trelisses and had a rude waiter named Jesus who did not even try to accomadate my food allergies (no acidic foods- ie no tomatoes/citus/bell peppers- I just wanted a plain salad) he completely ignored our table and I actually had to find another waiter to get our check (I used to wait tables in college so I am usually very understanding if servers are busy or such). We went back to Trelisses another night and had a server named Jamie and she was great. I wasn't the only one who had problems- one of my other colleagues went 3 days without hot water before they would move her into another room and she missed several parts of the convention trying to wait for the maitence staff. If you want to use the gym it is $5/day and the sauna and hot tub are $25/day. We went to the concierge several times with questions, and everytime were given answers- ie. whether we could print boarding passes, get a ride somewhere, etc. I think that the only reason this hotel still gets business is that there is a conference center located on the property so it is convient for that.

If you've read other reviews then you know that this Hotel is very old and needs updating. The best way I can think of describing it is to say: \"Think of staying at a 1980s retirement community.\" The grounds are nice and there are people driving around in golf carts (because the place is so spread out) but the furniture is old and looks like grandma has been using the same bedspread that your mom grew up with. You check in at the lobby then walk or get a golf cart escort to your room. I had reserved a King room but was given a double (not a big deal). The rooms have very old decoration, old TVs (cathode ray tube), fuzzy reception on several channels but are otherwise very clean. The mattress on the bed felt old and stiff. I could feel individual springs through the sheets. Internet is provided by ATT-wifi (daily fee) and is spotty at best (can check an email or two before signal is lost). I called to ask where the best place in the complex was for a good signal and was told \"outside.\" While this may be accurate I don't feel that it's an acceptable answer. The conference facilities have been fine so far and I think that's why this place still operates. I ran into several other conference attendees who were also a little surprised by the hotel rooms as well. I'm not really a hotel snob but if I'm paying upwards of $150 per night for a hotel I expect something better than what Motel 6 offers. If you're old this place will probably remind bring back memories. If you're under age 65 I would recommend looking elsewhere. I was able to check out early. They were nice enough to waive the $50 per night fee it would have been to check out prior to my scheduled stay. I haven't seen this policy at other hotels so it leads me to believe that the situation has come up more than once at this place. I had some pretty bad experiences with the parking lot attendant and security guard which are likely isolated incidents related to personalities and led to me leaving the hotel early so that's why they waived the fee. Pros: Clean Landscaping with lots of flowers and trees Several restaurants on site Good for old people Friendly front desk staff Cons: OLD OLD OLD beds and decoration Very hard old mattress Old cathode ray tube TV with fuzzy channels on 1/2 of my stations Spread out - everything is a walk from your room. Wi-Fi internet - poor signals throughout, unreliable, not for business traveler Beware of angry security guy and parking lot attendant. Let's say you book for a week but need to leave early, you are charged $50 per day for the remaining days on the reservations that you didn't stay. Not good for young travelers.

The grounds were nothing short of a garden; palms, roses, etc., and meticulously maintained. From my balcony, I looked down onto a clean, clear pool and yard. The elevator was fast and smooth. The door lock functioned just fine, and I walked into a room with a four-post king size bed. The slider opened out onto a balcony that looked out across the Hotel grounds, across to the nearby hills, and yet still seemed private. The tv was neatly hidden in an armoire, and there was a gaming control tucked in there as well, although I didn't get into that. The room was clean, bathroom and shower as well, right down to the vacuum patterns on the carpet. I actually took photos with my phone and sent them to my girlfriend, just to make her regret not coming along! Even the evening guard/ lot attendant was great!

Above and beyond, making you feel right at home. The person responsible for training certainly performs a first rate job, teaching what customer service is and should be when staying at a resort like the Town & Country. There are tower rooms and cottage's available. The cottages are located within an area almost botanical garden like, yet only a short walk to the pools, restaurants and gift shops. Very quiet areas for those seeking such. The tower rooms are well appointed and contain balconies which look out over the garden like grounds, pools and with wonderful views. Parking areas are close and adjacent to the location you are generally housed. Public transportation is a short parking lot walk from your door. An upscale shopping mall also a short one block walk. A golf course is directly across from the hotel, thus adding to the quietness of the area. The restaurants range from casual to a fine steak house, with prices most reasonable and the breakfast buffet is a bargain, being located right near a pool. Those with families will enjoy this resort and they even have movies on the week ends, shown on the lawn with popcorn, drinks, and all that goes with family enjoyment.

I complained about the condition of my room to my association and I was told, to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get in line\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as many of the other attendees were complaining also. Also, $10 a day for in-room internet which performed subpar was a rip-off. The grounds are nice, but very dated and boring. There is nothing to do on the hotel property (sorry \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). It is walking distance to a mall, but you can only window shop so much. I asked the front desk for fun things to do in the area and they kept insisting I stay on property and hang out at one of the restaurants. After 2 days of hearing this I finally gave in. Mistake! The food is bland, over priced and unless you like hanging out in a lifeless, barfly setting, not the place to be. English is also obviously a problem here, because unless you are inside the hotel building (sorry \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) finding someone on property to speak the language is equal to Indiana Jones finding the Lost Ark.

I didn't like that I couldn't work at my table and be able to watch the TV at the same time. The housekeeping staff were all very helpful, friendly and attentive if you needed anything. My experience with the servers and bellboys were good too. One night they drove us and picked us up in Old Town San Diego. I had a great night. Unfortunately my health turned for the worse and I had to call an ambulance one night and be taken to hospital. When I was discharged at 4am I phoned the hotel to ask if someone would be able to pick me up. They said no and that the bellboys were busy. I had to take a cab. I didn't understand that since they drove me and a couple of convention mates to Old Town San Diego the previous night, and seeing as the hospital was the same distance away - quite close. I found that was a bit of BS. Don't understand what the problem was but they wouldn't do it. The restaurants are pricey and the buffet breakfast wasn't great. Eggs and sausages were cold. If you want a good breakfast, walk on over the The Travelodge on hotel circle north across the way and eat at Adams Steak and Eggs. Much better tasting and price. I must say though that the Town &Country makes the absolute best Pico De Gallo ever. I wish I had the recipe.

Because the tournament was held on the T&C grounds, it was very convenient. The Room The room was just fine. As many have mentioned before, the room and grounds were very clean and tidy, and yes, a bit outdated. We had a standard room (2 queen beds) and it was roomy with a private balcony overlooking the pool area. Other families had a smaller room, so it may be just a matter of luck. And yes, we did have the weird picture of a young girl staring at us while we were in bed. My kids were freaked out, but it didn't bother me at all. The only complaints I have is that the showerhead is about 4 feet off the ground, so I had to bend over to get my head wet. Also the bathroom door is a sliding door and has no lock. My kids thinks it's fun to walk in on daddy during his \"private\" time. The Facilities The restaurants are great, but are way overpriced -- actually expensive. The deli sells Starbucks coffee at about double the normal price. The kids spent a lot of time in the pool, especially at night because it was heated. Bathrooms on the grounds and in the different buildings were hard to find and when found, they were very small (1 or 2 stalls) -- causing lines. A nice mall is located just behind the hotel with a walkway connecting the two. It was a great place to eat (decent food court) or to kill a few hours here and there. The Amenities Town & Country does charge you for everything. The rooms have no mini-fridge ($10 extra per day if you want one) which for an extended stay, causes a huge inconvenience. Internet access is another $10 per day. Fortunately, Town & Country uses AT&T for its internet service. So since I have an AT&T DSL account, I was able to access the internet for free. Internet service however was spotty and slow and there were times when I could not even connect. Parking was another $8 per day for hotel guests, but since I was with the YMCA group, I got a discount to $3 per day. Still, I'd rather pay zero. The convention area (where the gymnastics events were held) was nice. It was very spacious and clean. My only complaint about this area is that we were not allowed to bring food or drink into the area. The events were about 4-5 hours long and being able to snack on something would have been nice. Much to my surprise, there are no guest laundry facilities on site (just a dry cleaning service). The desk told us to go to the Best Western down the street to use their laundry. Instead, we googled for a local laundromat and went there since that would allow us to use multiple machines at once. Overall, my experience was good. With the YMCA group discount we paid about the same as we would have paid at the Holiday Inn.

About 1/2 of the property is one and two story older motel style rooms and the remainder is in two connected high rises. The grounds are very well maintained with palms, roses, other plantings and walkways. There is a problem with signage and room numbers. Each day in the afternoon there are scores of people walking about pulling bags looking for thier room. They give you a map at checkin but don't put up street signs or room number signs anywhere. I got lost, and so did three others of my group of six. It wasn't just me, I met up with at least 20 others who had had the same problem. The solution is simple - Put Up some Signs with street names and building numbers. The room in the motel style part of the property are very typical of their date, the 1970's. They are large, mostly two double beds and a large but somewhat dated bath. The TV's are very out of date, 19\" and really only viewable from one of the two beds. Very clean but certainly showing a great deal of aging - two sitting chairs with dirty and threadbear arms, stained and thinning carpet, fixtures showing considerable wear and tear, a bath with very little water pressure and no fan (there was a window that is left openned that is 1 foot from the opposite wall,) My stay was on a Friday and Saturday night. On the first night it was very quiet but on the second night, the Saturday, the hotel, which appears to host a great deal of group and convention business, was having an incentive event on a central plaza, next to the pool. The event looked to be set up for a large outside group and included a DJ complete with six foot high speakers. He started to play 100dba music about 8:00pm and it could be heard in all rooms in the hotel. Although my room was not that close to the pool I was totally unable to hear my TV with the door and windows closed, nor could I have attempted to sleep. A call to the front desk let it be know that the group had booked until 12:00 but that the group would turn down the music at 10:00. At 9:45 I walked to the pool to view where the noise was coming from. To my surprise the DJ and his equipment was playing for a group of two people. The other six people at the party were inside a building WITH THE DOORS CLOSED. The property could have done much to mitigate this serious annoyance. Move it inside - move the location - not agree to 100dba music after 9:00 - This hotel did nothing, He, the DJ thought that soft music wass Micheal Jackson - \"Beat It\" was his quiet song at 11pm. The hotel has five restaurants - gives away two free drinks per person per day as well as a free buffet breakfast. I tried four of the five - the buffet breakfast was just plain awful, poor quality food, cold hot food and terrible service, although it was listed at $14.50 per person it would not have sold any if not given away free. The Trellis restaurant was better for the next breakfast with so so food but good service. I had a pizza in the sports bar which was a heated frozen one and my other dinner was in their steak house, not worth much at all except with both dinners I had my free drinks. The level of service at both was good - the quality about as bad as it could have been.

We called the wireless company service number 3 times during our 4 night stay, and we were always told the hotel was working on the issue. Despite reporting the issue to the front desk 6 times, we were always told by the person we spoke to that the hotel was unaware of the problem, but now that it had been reported, it would get fixed.

The staff member informed her that her sweater was nowhere to be found and there was no one to call at the Dry Cleaners until 8am the next day. Her presentation was at 9:15am. The hotel refused to send someone to pick it up before her presentation, and in fact, did not locate it at all until 10:30pm the following night. She had to wear a long-sleeved t-shirt to give her talk in. They then included the dry cleaning charge on the bill (removed after another explanation). The concierge did provide us with 4 free breakfast buffet passes. When you are staying at a hotel for a business conference, you expect some basic things, dry cleaning and internet access among them. The friendly cluelessness we were met with by each staff member was astounding. Each person was able to speak with us kindly and yet provide no answers or real apology for these shortfalls.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monument, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cThoroughly enjoyable experience\u201d", "Author": "dmclabaugh", "ReviewID": "UR62406095", "Content": "We spent five days at the Town and Country while attending a conference.

Upon arriving there I was greeted by the wonderful staff and check in was flawless. The meetings went great and I enjoyed my room and the service! When I was checking out on Easter Sunday I experienced my first big earthquake! I was staying in the Royal Palm Tower on the 10th floor and it felt like the whole tower was swinging back and forth for almost a minute, my TV even fell off the stand! It was a very shocking experience to say the least. So after it was over I was all ready to go back to my hometown where there are NO earthquakes! But there was a problem! All the elevators were out and there was no way I was going to walk down 10 flights of stairs with all my luggage and items I had acquired over the few days I was there. So I called the front desk and they sent over a bellman. Steve was the bellman that came to my rescue! I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say enough good things about the way he went about helping me and informing me about the quake and what had happened at the hotel. I felt bad not being able to carry more than a tiny bag and watching him carry all my heavy bags and what not. But he was very nice and very helpful in getting all my stuff out to my car and getting me on my way. Its people like him and the rest of the wonderful staff at the town and country that will keep me coming back whenever I am in the San Diego area. So if you were thinking about a place to stay when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in San Diego, please give town and country a try. You won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be disappointed!

While the grounds and landscaping are absolutely lovely and well maintained, the resort is sprawling and does, indeed, have a 1950s feel to it. On the plus side, the convention center had nice facilities for the exhibition, including lots of restrooms (not always a given). The hall was well lit and ventilated. The main pool was heated and the jacuzzi was very large and worked well. I do wish parents would not dump their young kids off at the jacuzzi. Town and Country sits on Hotel Circle, and is very convenient to San Diego, the trolley line, a large mall, and Old Town San Diego. I don't mind paying $170/night for a room. I DO, however, mind being nickel and dimed for every extra cost, including: $14/day for parking; $10/day for internet access; $8/day to use the fitness center (and I'm pretty sure that was a discounted rate because I was there with a convention); and 95 cents to use my calling card from the room. There are so many other hotels on Hotel Circle where I could have gotten all of these amenitities for free and at a lower rate per evening. And I could have gotten a free breakfast. The room itself was very clean. The bathroom was tiny, and not particularly well lit. As a female traveler, I absolutely hate outdoor access to rooms (as best as I could tell, none of the rooms had controlled access through a security door or indoor corridors). The balcony was OK, and fairly private (I could not see either of my neighbors, which was nice). However, I did see some rooms at the ends of the corridors where their balcony stared straight out to a brick wall. Just a weird configuration. No flat screen TV, either. How is that possible in California? I ate two dinners at Charlie's, the sports bar. The food was OK, but way overpriced ($11 for a hamburger?). The service here was somewhat surly. The landscaping and cleaning staff all seemed to go out of their way to make me feel welcome. One of the cleaning crew even hustled over to open a door for me when I was lugging a carton into the convention center. Otherwise, the service was unimpressive. I would not recommend this place for the business traveler, especially if you are only staying one night, since the grounds are so massive, it takes forever to get a feel for the lay of the land. I saw one guy wandering aimlessly at 6:00 a.m. looking for the registration desk to check out while I was on my way to the gym. I finally was able to catch up to him and help him with directions. There are too many other business hotels (Courtyard, Residence Inn) on Hotel Circle to pick this place. Even for a resort destination, you can do better. I had some free time Monday morning and was hoping to use the spa. No dice. The spa is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. And how in the 21st century, can the fitness center not have any ellipticals? Fortunately, the bike and stair master that I used worked well.

Also, the showerheads in the bathroom are at chin level for short people (I was contorted to wash my hair and I'm not tall), and the walls are so thin you can hear every activity of your neighbors.

We had a room key mix up that was not the hotel's fault and an affable bellman, whose name I think was AJ, came immediately, not once but twice. Room service was excellent as well, rarely taking more than 20 minutes. The rooms were spacious - we had a suite which gave us plenty of room for different activities. Out of the back door of our building is a huge mall, accessible over a foot bridge, with all the major California department stores, including Nordstrom's and Macy's, a large movie theater, and multiple restaurants. I recommend Bing Crosby's Restaurant and Piano Lounge. Food excellent; music varies; not quiet on weekends. Also to the rear of the building where our rooms were located is the light rail system, which means a quick trip to downtown San Diego.

We literally drove past the hotel twice not wanting to believe the hotel was the one!

The first floor looked like something out of a disaster movie! We headed to the room and when we opened the door was greeted by very old, dirty blue carpet everywhere in the room, including the bathroom. The double beds were harder than boards, and the furniture appeared to be out of something from a \"Golden Girls\" episode! The bathroom was so tiny, you could not use the toilet without the door literally in your face or the shower curtain hanging off your head! The fixtures were outdated, the TV had little or no signal (of course, 10 years old!), and there were so many stains on the lamp shades that I thought it was a \"patterned\" shade at first! What hotel still has a \"gold chain swag lamp\" as it's main lighting? Come on - if you are going to use the word \"resort\" in your name, at least keep the rooms clean and updated - especially if you charge $147 plus tax per night (govt rate!)! We also went to the \"casual\" bar for some beers (we had to have them after seeing that room) and ended up spending $100+ for a few beers and an appetizer each! Again, the \"bar\" looked like we were in a Golden Girls show! Yikes. We would never had checked in, but we were so tired and exhausted from flying across the country.

I went along for the beautiful sites and weather of southern California. We paid the extra out of pocket for an upgrade to a \"premium king bed Royal Palm Tower\". When we arrived after a cross-country flight, It was fairly late in the evening. We were told that our room would be 3539...\"not in the palm tower...but just as nice\". The first thing that hit us as we opened the door, was the unbearable smell of mildew. I mean, it made my eyes water. As we entered the room, ready to collapse from exhaustion, the next thing we realized was that we weren't going to be sleeping anytime soon. I understand being green,,,and not using the AC except when the room is in use, but it was 80 degrees in there. That might have been tolerable, had it not been for rhe fact that due to the extreme need for a dehumidified, every surface in the room..including the sheets and pillowcases, ranged from damp to down right wet. We turned up the AC full blast, and went out for a late dinner. Unfortunately, when we got back, we realized that the AC was on it's last legs... I called the front desk, and told them that the AC needed service. When they sent the maintenance man over, he asked us why we were staying in this section. I explained that we had reserved the palm tower, but were told that these were identical. He looked at me incredulously, and said that we might want to check that out for ourselves...that the hotel was nowhere near full. I immediately called the front desk, and asked why we had been downgraded, and were still paying the same rate. I was told that there were \"no king non-smoking rooms available\". I explained that I was unhappy with the state of the room. The desk clerk said that she could put me in a queen smoking room in the tower. I reminded her that I PAID for a king NS. At which point she said \"sorry, that's all I can do\". My husband said we could try the smoking room, but I can't imagine adding smoke to mildew...not a great picture. I waited 20 minutes and picked up my cell phone and called reservations and asked for a king NS in the royal palm tower, for 3 nights...and you guessed it...They could accomodate me...

This is a really odd hotel and I'm not quite sure what type of traveler it is built for. Its not in an ideal location to be a relaxing resort, its not nice enough to be a good conference center, and its too expensive to be a budget hotel. First of all you have the location, on I-8 just east of I-5. While you're within a short drive of most of the San Diego area, you aren't really anywhere of interest. You're not downtown, not by the ocean, just kind of out among lots of other hotels. The property is large and spread out. Upon first look, it appears to be something out of 1960's Florida. There are several buildings and each contains different types of rooms. I stayed in the tower, which is at the back end (north end) of the property. It's about eight levels and has exterior corridors. Almost all rooms have a view of the pool below. The room I received was damp and dank, even with the air conditioner running all day. While it wasn't noticeably dirty, everything seemed to be sticky and there was a musty smell to the room. The bed was a murphy bed (pulled down from the wall). The TV cabinet doors would not stay open unless propped. There was a door that joined with the room next door that was paper thin and didn't even reach the floor. I could hear the slightest noise from the room next door, including every time the water was turned on and every footstep on the floor. Fortunately my neighbor was another business traveler, so there wasn't much noise from the room. After speaking with others who were staying in some of the other buildings on the property, it seems the tower offers the largest rooms. My room had a wet bar and mini-fridge as well as a couch and dining table. Rooms in the other buildings apparently did not have these amenities. The tower rooms also have a balcony. Even at the discounted conference rate, this hotel was no deal. Add on a $14 per day parking fee (no reason for it given the location) and a charge for internet, and this hotel is no value whatsoever. I was able to get around the internet fee by connecting to the wireless signal from the cafe below my room. For some reason that access was free and the signal was even stronger than the regular hotel signal. There are some aspects of the resort that were acceptable. The grounds are nice to stroll around (although it's easy to get lost or turned around). There are trees and rose gardens everywhere. There are also a couple pools that looked well maintained. The staff at the convention center was excellent. Fast and attentive. There is also a large shopping mall just north of the property, just across a small river and a street.

I book at this hotel 10 months in advance asking for a room with two queen beds and on a high floor. The day I arrived they couldnt give me my booking as they were booked out so we were put in a room with one queen bed on the 4th floor and the bed was a pulldown bed from the wall at 209.00 a night. There was an adjoining door with the room next door and even quiet talk we might as well as of been sitting with each other on the sofa cause you could hear every word said. The bed was really old as were the pillows god knew when they had last been replaced there wasn't much stuffing left in them at all. We did ask for more but they were as bad as the ones we already had. the couple above us like to have sex 100 times a night and there is no insulation so lets just say they might as well be laying beside us we could hear every single movement. It was so noisy at night people running down the hallways etc. One night they rented out one of the rooms for an event and we had to listen to the loud music played there till 10.30pm at night. When we complained was told there was nothing they could do as it was booked out for them till 10.30pm. We had booked for 10 nights but we left two days early as we could just not take the noise the uncomfortable bed anymore. I was charged fully for the room for the two nights we did not stay plus and extra $100.00 per night for leaving early. After 3 international phone calls at my own expensive I am still fighting with them to get this money refunded as they say it is their policy to charge for early departure. They staff were not friendly at all and have been down right rude at trying to get our money back. I keep getting put on hold and told someone will call me back to which this has not happened as of yet. No matter what time of the day I call San Diego time I am told that there is no manager onsite to deal with this issue. Do not stay at this hotel you would do better sleeping on the side of the road. The rooms are old and in need for some furbreeze it is very noisy and they staff don't care and have no customer service at all. It really did spoil part of our holiday to America.

Check in - no line up, which was nice. We were traveling to attend the San Diego Comic Con and had booked eight months in advance into a room for five nights in the Royal Palm Tower. We showed up at 1:30 pm and were told that our room was not ready but that we could book into a Garden room instead if we wanted. We did not want to do this so my husband and daughter went ahead to Comic Con while I stored the luggage and waited for our room to be done. After sitting there for an hour and watching everyone else get checked into the hotel, I went up at 2:30 and asked if my room was cleaned. Without even looking it up on the computer, I was told that my room was ready and they checked me in. Interesting. It did leave me wondering if they tried to downgrade me and then let me sit there for a while. Either way - an extremely nice concierge (I think his name was Chris) loaded my huge luggage onto a cart and drove me to the Royal Palm Tower and then helped me to drag everything up to the room. 2. Room - We had room 1812 - very clean, excellent a/c, good size. Creepy girl picture on the wall - just like previous reports. It had a balcony that looked over the pool area which was lovely. The decor was slightly flowery for me but I liked the big mirror and the bed was firm but comfy. Great pillows. We were on the eighth floor which seemed to negate any noise from the pool and overall the room was extremely quiet even though the hotel was at capacity with vacationing families and comic con folks. Two thumbs up on the room. 3. Room attendants - good. We had clean towels every day and the toilet paper was replenished as required. 4. Pools - there appeared to be three pools on site and we were lucky enough to have one right outside of the Tower. It was a salt water pool - slightly warm but still refreshing. The hot tub was great after we'd spent a day walking around the Con. One complaint - they ran out of pool towels by the end of the day and didn't restock which made for a wet trip back to the 8th floor after our end-of-day soak. 5. Dining - there is a deli right beside the pool that sells Starbucks and pastries which was lovely in the morning as they made a great non-fat latte. They also sell sandwiches - for $9.95 I got a huge ham/cheese croissant sandwich, potato salad, a bag of potato chips and a pop. Not a bad deal. There's also a store by the pool that sells small items plus pop, chips, etc. Handy. We had pizza from room service the first night - the large family deal includes a large pizza (it'd feed four and still have leftovers) plus six sodas. We thought it was a great and took the extra sodas to Con the next day. 6. Other - one of the best things about the Tower was the proximity to the trolley and the mall. Just walk down the path, cross the bridge, check out the ducks/squirrels, cross the street - and voila. Either continue ahead to go right into the mall or up the stairs to catch the trolley. During comic con the trolley has a 'red line' which is a special trolley that went straight from the Fashion Valley stop (by the hotel) to the Comic Con - very handy. Also VERY crowded - a few times we were on there when it was standing room only. The mall was very nice - we managed to spend some money there plus had dinner at the food court one night before we headed back to our room and the pool. 7. Check out - Just a small line up but it moved fast. Room charges were all a-ok. Overall a great stay and I would definitely recommend this hotel for the proximity to the trolley and mall. The trolley stops at a lot of the touristy spots in San Diego (Gaslamp, Old Town, etc) and is handy to use.

My first impression of the hotel is that it is somewhat schizophrenic, with some of the rooms looking out onto lush, plantation-style gardens (I thought I was back in the 19th century), and some of the rooms in a high tower structure. The gardens are nice and well kept up, and there are lots of singing birds. There is no way in the room I stayed in, however, to actually open the curtains and enjoy the view. I'm sure that is for privacy reasons and to avoid giving people outside a show, but I would have liked to have been trusted to do the right thing. Seems like a wasted garden. As I mentioned, the decor is, to be charitable, somewhat retro. This, I'm sure, appeals to people who like that sort of thing, but it just seemed quaint and antiquated to me. Frankly, it felt Victorian to the point where I was expecting some woman in a southern-style dress to pop out of the gazebo, say \"Ah do declare\", and disappear into the mist. That didn't happen, but you never know. Now, all that said, this does not mean I dislike the hotel, far from it. I liked the birds in the morning (and the garden certainly attracts them), the on-site cafe has good food and friendly people (a waitress had such a dazzling smile I tipped her way, way too much), and the value for the price is excellent - with my AAA card I paid a very decent price which included an all-you-can-eat buffet. Contrast that with another San Diego hotel that gave you an omelet (ONE omelet) and some orange juice for $9. This was value. When I stayed here, it was misty and rainy, and for some reason that actually added to the garden vibe. I think this place is best in a light rain. The hotel is literally right next to a freeway. This does detract from the tranquility a little bit, but I guess you cant have it all, and perhaps that helps keep the prices down. Would I recommend this hotel? Certainly. But not to everyone.

I personally would not stay there again just because I don't like the old style decor, and would much rather prefer the modern design, however that's just me. The staff was excellent and extremely helpful with everything I needed, check in was a complete breeze although I was extremely dissappointed that with as many parking spots as this hotel has they still charge for parking.. But it is San Diego and a lot of places outside of the downtown area are starting to charge now. They do have patrolled access gates however in and out so that does add a little security. The first room i was given was called a garden room which sounded nice, it wasn't in one of the large towers so I figured it would have beautiful sceanary and would be very quite. Quite the opposite actually, my scenary outside my window was of an ugly fence and I could hear everything going on outside my room. The worst thing about it though was when i opened the door I actually laughed at how small the room was, basically it was just barely large enough for the bed and the television, which was horribly small also. The bathroom was like a matchbox. I called the front desk and told them I wanted a room that was a little larger and they were quick to accomodate, they placed me in one of the towers on the ground floor so I had a patio. They even sent a bellman to my garden room to deliver my new room keys, he even offered to give us a ride to the new room. Once again excellent service. When i opened the door to the new room I was given I was pleasantly suprised. The bathroom was extremely large, with a second sink and vanity area. The bed was huge and the room itself was rather large, with built-in AC so it was never noisey when it was ran. The television also got much larger to with the new room. So my recommendation to anyone preparing to stay at this hotel is to tell the staff members that you would like a room in one of the two main towers, those rooms do not serve to disappoint, and while I was on the ground floor with many rooms above me I was not disturbed my noise at all. Everything was great, the bed was even really comfortable. Just keep in mind that since this is an older hotel the rooms have older style decors.

A booth for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153VIPS\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was in the middle of the Lobby , with another clerk talking with a fourth clerk.

Did I mention upon check -in a young person with a back pack sign-ined with an $85 dollar a night rate .. My first room was in the 3300 building, this hotel must have a thousand rooms. It looks like a few 50 year old country motels , with a high tower and a some random buildings. It is quaint, the flowers are nice and there are cute streets and welll \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 So I get to the two story building, no elevators. But its all good, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need one. The hallways are inside and dark, first floor is filled with students -the doors are open and its LOUD. A woman is screaming at them to hurry up. ( oh no I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m thinking) My room is on the second floor. A well dressed older European couple and I offer wary looks. I open the door to the worst MUSTY - OLD carpet smell. The carpet is blue and probably really old , the fabric on the bedspread thread worn. The smell is overwhelming. I phone the front desk. Oh she says , yes some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153people complain about that building \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Back to the front desk , back in line and a new key. < I did hear one woman exclaim to another about her four poster bed in the room - I was hopeful) My next room is set at the end of the property . There is an alley way leading to somewhere near the freeway which I can hear very plainly. The out side is kinda funky cute, well worn white paint cute terrace of flowers. I can do funky , even thread worn if its clean.. Inside the room with two double beds smells like old unwashed clothes. Gross. The carpet is really stained , a white chalking smear is on one of the bed covers. A glass on a plastic tray is shining sticky. The fabric lampshades are whiteish grey and dusty. There is a dead bug enclosed in the picture frame directly over the bed. Looks like a tic. I pull back the covers and a black curly hair is laying on the sheet. The other bed looks clean so I fold away the cover and wash my hands. I wish I would have had my camera. On a happy note the bathroom is clean. Except for the wall next to the toilet where there are some dried brown drips. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m thinking a spray bottle of cleaner , paper towels and buying some sheets will get me thru the week. In the middle of the night I hear the freeway and the guy next door snoring. Ho hum . I have read the reviews of this place and maybe if you are a VIP , there are better rooms. The Town and Country is a dump as far as I am concerned. Do not stay here if you can help it. If you book rooms for someone - do them a favor and book somewhere else. Right across the street are the Hilton, residence inn , Sheraton , double tree .. I will never recommened this place to anyone. In fact I suggest they stay away.

I highly recommend the hot stone massage, a truly amazing experience! San Diego is such a beautiful, wonderful city with many attractions, but can be costly at times, and without a car may be challenging for visitors to navigate.

There are modern towers and quaint bungalows spread out across the vast acreage. There are also some extremely average old, apartment-style rooms sprinkled into the mix. Unfortunately, I got one of those rooms in October 2008. For the privilege of staying in room #3714, I paid $169 for a Saturday night and $189 for a Sunday night. One earlier reviewer said this was \"Motel rooms at hotel prices\" and I think that nails it on the head. The hotel complex is so huge that you need a printed map to figure out where you are and where you're going and there are also maps with the familiar \"you are here\" arrow spread out over the grounds. My room was quite difficult to find, due mainly to the fact that the well-meaning but clueless young woman on the front desk who checked me in told me the room was on the first floor when it was indeed on the SECOND FLOOR instead. Whoops! Strike one. The room, once I found it, was very average. The bedroom and bathroom felt small and cramped. The bed was very comfortable, though although the bedspread and room decorations were old and tired. It had an old, small TV and the balcony looked out to the back side of one of the many meeting and convention facilities on the \"Resort\" property. I put \"Resort\" in quotes because, even though there are a few nice areas of the hotel complex, I felt that the room I got stuck with dispelled the notion that I was at a resort. The \"view\" was a joke, unless you like looking at the back side of another building ten feet away. I heard a great deal of noise from the rooms next door and below me, and even more noise from the hotel's maintenance, landscaping and housekeeping staffs wheeling their carts right outside. I had stayed at this hotel several years ago and stayed in one of the Towers, which made a great deal of difference. I enjoyed that stay a lot more than I enjoyed this one. This is not to say my stay this year was a total loss. The T&C is quite close to the Trolley line that runs east-west and is quite convenient to travel around San Diego. There's a mediocre but serviceable golf course next door and a great deal of shopping available in Mission Valley. The T&C property does have a couple of pools, but some of them are much nicer than others. The one near the lobby and one of the resort's restaurants is decent, but the one outside one of the towers is quite noisy, and there's another small pool in the courtyard of one series of rooms that reminded me of a Motel 6.

I hadn't read any reviews whatsoever about the place before heading there, so I didn't have any preconceived notions about what I would find, other than the pictures on the hotel's website. Needless to say, the hotel is completely unacceptable as a business destination. So, where to begin... * Accommodations The room we stayed in was in one of the hotel's two towers, known as the Regency. The hotel was decrepit. Everywhere you look, paint is scraped and chipped, lightbulbs are burnt out (and allowed to stay that way), windows have dirt in the corners, there are dings in the walls and door jambs, and other such problems. Our room itself has obviously not been updated since the late 80's, to include the comforter, which was faded and frayed. The bathroom is lit by two dim bulbs, which is fine, since brighter light would have drawn even more attention to the stained bathtub, yellowed and peeling grout, and rusty hinges on the door. The door itself looks like it has been repeatedly urinated on, as it is streaked yellow. The air conditioning in our room was so pitiful that we ran it non-stop from the time we arrived to the time we left, and it was never able to bring the room temp below 72\u00c2\u00ba. It was also unable to remove the mugginess from the air. We slept with the window open the first night, but, sad to say, our room faced the San Diego Herald-Tribune loading docks, so at 3:30 AM we were assailed with the crash of tractor-trailers backing up to receive shipments of newspapers. The window stayed closed after that. The grounds were beautiful, with rose bushes everywhere, and arbors, trellises, and cute little architectural touches in abundance. Of course, many of those touches, such as ornamental scrollwork, were straight from Home Depot and simply glued in place and painted; they were often askew or chipped and peeling. It was the equivalent of adding as much garnish to a dinner plate as possible to try and hide the fact that the main course was only so much boiled shoe-leather. In addition to everything else, our toilet stopped flushing on the second day. After we called maintenance to fix it, it wouldn't stop flushing. It's feast or famine at the Town & Country. Speaking of famine... * Food Business travelers and convention-goers are usually on a time crunch, as they have only so much time to eat and then be back at the next session or class. The food service at the hotel was so slow that a number of us had to skip meals or eat cold cuts from the deli; when you have only an hour and it takes 40 minutes to get just your drinks, there is a problem. The food was also sub-par; the breakfast buffet at the Terrace Cafe is to be avoided at all costs. The food is cold, rubbery, and of a quality well below that of most fast-food places. The ribs at Kelly's Steakhouse were overdone and dried out, as was the BBQ chicken; the only thing worth eating was the appetizer. Charlie's Bar & Grill was agonizingly slow and overpriced; $13 hamburgers and expensive sodas can quickly eat up your per-diem allowance. * Connectivity As a business traveler, it is essential to stay connected to the office, and Internet access is a key part of that for anyone operating in the 21st century. Here, too, the Town and Country was a let-down. With no wired access, you are forced to purchase ($3 an hour or $10 for 24 hours) wi-fi access through a vendor called LodgeNet. However, the access was so spotty that I was unable to reliably check email, and had to spend over ninety minutes on the phone with LodgeNet tech support to even get connected. * Staff The front-office staff were professional to the point of being brusque, but I only had to deal with them rarely. The waitstaff at Kelly's were utterly clueless, even to the point of failing to unlock the front door on time (we had to go in through the lounge and then tell them that the door was still locked). The waitstaff at Charlie's were arrogant and ignorant of the needs of the customers. The only two places I found excellent staff were at the Trellises restaurant and the in the housekeeping staff. At Trellises, both Angelica and Jesus, and a third gentleman whose name I didn't catch, were charming and responsive, and the food was excellent. As for the housekeeping staff, they did an excellent job with what they had to work with, and our housekeeper took extra special care with my boys' stuffed animals and even hung our wet swimsuits back up after having cleaned the bathroom. * Conclusions Overall, the front-line staff are doing the best they can in the absence of involved and commited top management, which may either be uninterested or incapable of improving the place. The Town and Country has the feeling of a sinking cruise liner; the band is still playing, but the ship is getting lower and lower in the water, and it is only a matter of time before it slips beneath the waves. Unless it is saved by a rescuer with an infusion of cash and competence, the Town and Country does not have much longer to live. I have already sent a note to our central education office (of a government agency with 160,000 employees) asking them to avoid scheduling us at this hotel in the future.", "Date": "August 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bay Area, CA", "Title": "\u201cAverage Stay\u201d", "Author": "noslengnow", "ReviewID": "UR19247353", "Content": "Stayed here as part of the San Diego Comic Con room block.

Common walls between rooms are very thin though and if you have neighbors it can definitely be an issue. The location is convenient to the San Diego Trolley and buses plus a mall as well. We took advantage of the trolley location to get to Downtown San Diego and it was pretty convenient. Checkout as a bit weird though. We attempted to checkout via the television system and it told us that we couldn't check out through that until 11:10 a.m., which is 10 minutes beyond the actual check out time. We ended up driving back up to the lobby and checking out there. The line was 5 or 6 people deep so it took about 15 minutes.

Yes, folks, there are indeed hotel rooms without beds?!?!? Not to mention that the room had been reserved for nearly two months, so what happened to our room? Okay, whatever...the kids and I are tired from being in planes and airports for the past 6 hours. Have to wait for the only bellhop in the place (yes, only one on a busy Saturday night and the place was hopping). He takes a large group off to their room--we can't walk to ours w/ our bags and a brass luggage cart because the staff \"can't allow guests to use them\" (oddly enough, they stay chained up to posts around the property). So we wait, and wait...and wait some more. The 6 minutes slowly turned into 25 minutes :( Ugh...tired, grumpy kids... Make it to the bed-less hotel room (via golf cart because it's all of a 2-minute ride and all) and they have a portable cot/bed delivered. There is a pullout sofa bed in the room, but it's so paper thin and uncomfortable that we are forced to actually rearrange heavy furniture in this room so that my youngest can sleep on two overstuffed chairs that are facing each other. Sigh... Paid $35 for two kids' buffets and 1 adult buffet for breakfast the next morning since we were all starving from our travels. The food was below par, although the service was great. I found this to be true throughout the stay. The maids and waitstaff were courteous and friendly, while the \"professional\" staff up front could learn some customer service lessons from these hardworking folks! Honestly!!!! To add insult to injury, I make it over to the supposed state-of-the-art workout facility (I can't vouch for this because I didn't actually go into it OR see anyone using it at any point in passing by) on the grounds inside of the day spa (also, not busy) to be greeted by the less-than-enthusiastic desk person by, \"Oh, are you staying here with a conference?\" I reply with, \"Well, yes I am.\" Then: \"Oh, they must have forgotten to tell you about the fee for use: $8/day.\" WHAT??? I'm paying $14 per day to park, ungodly markup on ho-hum food, overpriced (not to mention old and run-down furnishings in the) room, and now I'm nickle-and-dimed to workout??? I immediately left, of course, only to watch another fellow walk in and right back out. Who pays to use a treadmill at a hotel? I'm sure the Vagabond Inn around the corner has a free workout facility. In the end, I'm sure the management will kindly thank me for my feedback and apologetically promise to look into the issues I raised (as you've probably read in the other 150+ previous reviews). But, it's obvious to anyone and everyone reading these that the management is NOT willing to follow through with this because the same complaints would not be consistently arising. Okay, management, let's here a real game plan on turning this place around?!?!?! All in all, save your money and stay somewhere else on Hotel Circle.

I have to say that the grounds are amazing, beautiful, and well taken care of. I wish the rooms were as well taken care of as the rooms. The rooms are outdated, old, and need some TLC. The arm chair i'm sitting in is lumpy, and old. So is the bed I had last night. LUMPY and OLD. You guys need new beds. Every high-end hotel or even budget hotels are getting new beds these days. Even the Comfort Inns and Quality Inns. For me, if the bed is great, than the room itself is not so important. But, since the bed is bad, I look to other things inside the room to off-set the bad bed. This doesn't seem to be happening. :-( Furniture is old and worn out. Towels, small, and not very thirsty. TV is old, and needs more channels. Bravo, etc... Room is NOT private at all, I am facing the parking lot with sheer curtains. You can totally see in at night. Not good for changing clothes or just after a shower. I don't like closed windows, or cover windows, so this is a problem. I asked them for a more private room, but they said that they didn't have any other rooms, and that it would be better to call the next day. I haven't called yet because I'm kind of settled here already, but would still entertain something else. I asked the desk clerk last night to make a note of it, but NO ONE called me today to see if I still wanted to change. I justed to work in hotels, and if we had a note like that, we would have called them to see if they wanted to change rooms, accommodated them, and sold their old room to someone else. I did ask for a nicer room when we checked in. I was educated on types of rooms from their website, and saw one I liked. But was told the one I wanted wasn't in a good place... Well, I am looking at 20 cars out my window right at this very moment. Is that good? I think it could be better. PLUS it's loud. People constantly walk by talking, yelling, or just making noise as they walk. Not very relaxing. I am surprised at the spa/gym. They charge for those. $10/day for the gym and NO AMMENITIES. or $25 for 3 day. I was told too, that 3 day gym \"membership\" with sauna, hot tub, and steam was $65... OUTRAGEOUS! These things should be included with the gym price - regardless. There's an advertisement in the rooms for the Spa and gym - sounds and reads like hot tub, steam, sauna should be included. No mention of PRICE or daily fees on the card in the room. UGH! And you wonder why there's no one there... This place has 5 or so restaurants. I went to one last night, the Terrace. Food is diner-y. That's okay, it was 10pm when I checked in last night. Haven't been to any of the others yet. I'll follow up with more later if I can. Oh, the windows don't reall open either. they are just louvered on the outside and windows on the inside. Not much flow through with those. Could use another window. or windows that OPEN. Speaking of open windows, the A/C is horrible! Doesn't really work. Works similar to a swamp cooler. Kinda cools, but not really. Anyway, I'm in room 3250.

Over the years, I have traveled to many parts of the world, especially Europe and the Far East but I have never once found an establishment with such a uniformly well-trained and friendly staff. Never do you have the feeling that anyone is doing you a favor in responding to your concerns. This was amazing to me in a staff that runs close to 1500 people. In addition, the resort is the most beatifully landscaped that I have ever visited and the myriad of plants is meticulously maintained by an army of gardeners. The resort has numerous convention facilities and several excellent restaurants but is also a good place for a simple getaway.

The first night I got there, they stated that we would be put in to a suite with a couch bed (translation: semisuite) and that we would have to leave the room the next day and move into a regular room. Although the room was really nice and had an outside patio that goes to the pool, the inconvenience of having to check out and check in did not set well with me, especially when I had a seminar in the morning that I needed to attend to. However, they did take some responsibility and redeemed themselves by offering me and my wife a password for free internet use access (which is $10.00 per day value) and since I just bought a macbook the day before, my wife was happy with that. Mind you, other than the check in process, the hotel is a very nice place to stay. They take good care of their area and their gardens and the paths/walkways were gorgeous with a splendid assortment of roses, plants, and fountains fixated all over the place which would make any high school prom want to book this place. It is, funny to say, a labyrinth of twists and turns (and actually a dead end in one area between the pool/check in lobby) which makes you feel like you are in Frances Hodgson Burnett's \"The Secret Garden\" rather than a hotel resort. Also, as you and as you cross though the bridge to the behind the hotel to go through the Fashion Valley Mall (a superb outdoor mall!), you have to cross the small San Diego river. People just pass by it to go to the mall, but it is a really nice area with ducks waddling around and squirrels going to and fro the area as a more natural California scene from balboa park (which is driving distance to the area). For the two rooms that I stayed, they were really nice. The suite was furnished with a basic kitchenette of a microwave and an empty compact refrigerator which was wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stocked with drinks where the hotel would charge you up the ying yang for (although they offer a litter of aquafina for a $2.50 convenience charge). The d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the area was really nice with vases and plants and an outside patio to the pool. The second room that I stayed in was a regular one bedroom king size room equipped with the standard amenities. The inside room had a lovely blue theme and bed was comfortable with a nice view being on the third floor. Now, if you have the money for the high rollers, if you get a presidential suite on the tenth floor like my boss had, you will be sitting in first class with Donald Trump. Equipped with a nice indoor bar, ample space to throw an executive party and a gorgeous view of the resort, seeing this room was definitely one of the highlights of my trip. They even have a little potted tree bush the size of a tiny christmas on the left and right side of the doorway before you enter the room, now that's class! The staff was very competent in what they do and was very friendly and accommodating in whatever I needed. My family sent me a special package, and the people in the front desk were very helpful in assisting me to get my package safely and securely. It was funny because when I left the last day, the guy that helped in for the bell hop area next to the front desk remembered me and waived good bye to me, and that is the personalized service that I enjoy. All in all, the Town and Country is a wonderful place to stay. I think that they can get overbooked due to the proximity of being next to the conference center, but otherwise, it was really good experience for me and would recommend it to my friend, especially if they can afford the presidential suites.

And while the room was fine, the whole place just had a vaguely sad, worn-out feeling to it. Pehaps its just because it was overcast while I was there, or maybe because this is obviously not a new facility. It just seemed slightly depressed. I stayed in the big tower building. The room was quite adequate, and included a balcony (so you could smoke if you liked.) I know that improvements were being made on other floors, and while I suspect I was in an improved room, it still had a weary feeling to it. The showerhead was indeed low enough that I have a knot on the back of my head (I'm 5'7\"), and the bathtub would not drain unless I jammed a washcloth into the drain to hold the stopper up. The facility itself seemed well-maintained (and the roses lining the walk-ways were beautiful) but the layout is indeed confusing. Our conference put signs with arrows all over the place and I still couldn't find the room half of the time - don't even TRY to find a restroom without asking. On the plus side, the place is SUPER convenient to both the adjacent high-end shopping plaza and the public transportation. I'm so glad that I didn't get a car. I really never needed one. And the dining options in the shopping mall meant that I could easily avoid those in the hotel. The wireless internet service is horrible. And since it isn't handled by the hotel, you can't get the money taken off of your hotel bill. I paid $10 for crawling service. If you needed to check email, you could probably do a batch upload / download while you showered or slept, but I woudn't plan on getting much internet surfing accomplished. Ugh. My biggest complaint, honestly, was how spotty the service was. I had one meal (breakfast buffet) at their casual dining venue, and the waitstaff was great. Cheerful. Friendly. Prompt. I had lunch at their slightly more upscale restaurant and had a terrible experiece. Waited forever for food. Found large chips of metal were coming off my spoon as I ate my soup and had to wander around the restaurant looking for someone to help me. The man I found hardly acknowledged me and never apologized. He just took my soup away and eventually came back with a new spoon and bowl. No offer of anything - not even regret. There are steps up from the main driveway to the lobby and I saw customer after customer struggle to wrangle their luggage up the stairs and through the door while the bell hops chatted inside. Once at the front desk, though, the staff was polite and helpful and friendly. And on my way to the room, I was passed several times by bellhops zipping along in completely empty safari-type shuttle cars - which are apparently on the property to shuttle only the bellhops and never the luggage-toting customers. All in all, it was a confusing experience. I never knew what would be good and what would be bad. And half the time I didn't even know quite where I was.

I stayed March 10-15 and stayed in the Royal Palm Tower at the north side of the resort. I noticed someone was staying in one of the rooms that face the side of the middle tower... if I had been one room over to the left, I'd be sharing that view. For all those petrified of a horrible view, I'd say maybe 4-6 rooms per floor have the view looking into the side of the middle building, so chances are you'll be just fine. When I went to the T&C, I braced for the utter worst. The front desk was very welcoming and whoever complained about bad customer service either had a bad apple in the lot, or perhaps wasn't the most pleasurable customer to deal with in the first place. The vibe in San Diego is very chilled, and i highly suggest that visitors adopt this vibe too! The location is very central to the city, interstate, and trolley. I did my fair share of research on public transportation in San Diego and opted to take transit rather than rent a car. I'm used to the very slow transit service of Ottawa, Canada, so the San Diego system was great for me. The Green Line trolley from the hotel runs every 7-15 min depending on the day/time and you can connect to the Blue Line trolley in Old Town to go to downtown San Diego. Most days it took 20-25 min to get into the heart of San Diego from the Fashion Valley Transit Center. Speaking of Fashion Valley, there is an EXCELLENT mall right behind the Town and Country that is also home to PF Chang's, Uno Chicago Grill, and the Cheesecake Factory (plus food court restaurants and a McDonalds), so if you ever need a break from hotel food, there's lots nearby. If you do have a car, within 2 miles there's every restaurant and fast food joint you can dream of. I didn't eat at the hotel once the whole time i was there (someone mentioned high prices), so I can't comment on the food. The rooms... oh the rooms. Firstly, I'd like to say that the infamous picture of the creepy girl was NOT present in my room and someone said she used to be in every room, so that's good news. The rest, not so much. While the rooms were clean enough, the rooms were reminiscent of \"grandma's\", so be prepared for some 50s country decor. The rooms also didn't have a safe, which may bother some people (I personally locked my documents in my suitcase). The air conditioning took a little while to kick in and the maid turned mine off while I was out of my room one day, so I came back after a long, hot run to discover my room temperature warmer than the outside temperature. And yes, the showerhead is quite low, but I'm 6'0\" and I didn't have an issue slightly bending my knees to wash my hair. And you can go shower cap-less if you don't want to wash your hair! The layout of the hotel is a little confusing, but just walk in the general direction of where you want to go and I'm sure you'll get there just fine. This isn't a great hotel if you have a lower extremity injury and can't walk more than 300-500 ft, but it's always good to get a little exercise -- especially on vacation. In regards to parking, as I mentioned, I didn't have a car, but the Royal Palm parking lot was never totally full and there were always spots. Someone said the hotel was fully booked, so it seemed to be alright as far as parking goes. A good suggestion -- if you really don't mind taking public transit around (it's very convenient at the hotel), I highly recommend not renting a car. Parking at the hotel was up to $14/day, and I managed to get a 4-day trolley/bus pass for $15. This may be more directed to the economy traveller, but it is something to consider! Always good to go green! Finally, I do want to mention that the pools and grounds of the hotel were lovely. Grass was always cut and the flowers were beautiful, even for a cool March. The pool was heated so even on nights when it was 50F, swimming was a pleasure! If anyone has any questions on the Town and Country, San Diego, or transportation, I'd be glad to help!

Most of those making reviews here aren't old enough to remember the motels of the 50's and 60's. This place has managed to keep those places alive in one place. Except they charged $12/day to park in rather under-sized spaces. Finding your way around was extremely frustrating since the map wasn't to scale and none of the \"lanes\" were marked, and the room numbers weren't on the buildings, just the doors. The upkeep was very good in general and the rooms were clean. But they are just stuffed full of beds, gaudy drapes, and valences and tv cabinet clutter. The closet was a hint of one. To get to the front wall a/c, it meant either squeezing between the bed and the front wall or plopping onto the bed next to that wall. Luckily, it didn't get very warm because that a/c was pretty weak. The bathroom area was amusing. That is, if you could chuckle at the toilet paper roll almost in your lap as you sat there. Large people might put holes in the wall with their elbows. That's because the walls were like thick paper. I could hear the guy in the next room coughing and the lady in the room above also coughing and making other \"noises\" in the bathroom. Kind of funny at times.

I have just returned home from having attended a conference at the Town and Country from February 13-16, 2008. I too had read many less than favourable reviews about the resort, and so was not quite sure what to expect. However, my companions and I were more than pleasantly surprised by the facilities, service, and staff at the resort, and I was resolved to write my own positive review after returning home. We arrived at the resort shortly after noon on our day of arrival to find that our room was not yet ready (check-in isn't supposed to be until 3 PM, after all). The only room available was one without a view (the brick wall mentioned by other reviewers), and so we opted to wait for another. The front desk staff were most apologetic, and quickly called for the bell captain to store our luggage until later. As it happened, we did not have to wait until 3 PM for our room; our luggage was retrieved and we were transported by golf cart to the Royal Palm Tower. Derek then brought our luggage right up to our room for us, too! Our double room on the 9th floor was directly off the elevator lobby, but we were never disturbed by noise from the elevator, guests in adjoining rooms, or the freeway. We had a lovely view of the entire resort and the surrounding hills from our balcony, which was furnished with a white wrought iron table and chairs. Our room was quite spacious, and was furnished with dark colonial-style furniture. The 2 queen-sized beds were separated by a writing desk and chair, 2 armchairs flanked another round table, a long dressing bench sat under the picture of the little girl in the blue dress (very cute!), and an armoire housed the TV over three drawers for clothing. The dark blue carpet looked to be quite new, and the bedspreads matched the draperies and pleated valances over the beds. Our room also had a second sink and counter in the dressing area outside the bathroom - very handy when three women are sharing a room! The mirrored sliding doors on the closet were appreciated, as was the heatlamp on a timer in the bathroom. The weather on one day of our stay was cool and rainy - between 45 & 50 degrees - but the heat in our room worked very well to keep us absolutely comfortable. By the way, a photo posted by another reviewer is a bit misleading: of course all of the rooms in the Royal Palm Tower have windows! The photo is actually a shot of the open-air corridors along the BACK side of the tower from which the rooms are accessed. We were very impressed by the conference facilities at the Town and Country. In addition to the main exhibit hall and ballrooms, the resort has a multitude of break-out rooms of various sizes. Sumptuous carpets, mirrors, and crystal chandeliers adorn the foyers, and the restrooms feature marble countertops and tiled floors. The banks of smaller meeting rooms are separated by walkways bordered by well-kept flowerbeds and many benches and tables for further conversation. The only caution I would give regarding the facilities is that the sheer size of the resort requires quite a bit of walking back and forth from your accommodations to various conference facilities - a consideration for anyone with mobility issues. We also enjoyed our meals at the Town & Country Resort. The breakfast buffet at the Terrace Cafe does offer a good variety of hot and cold choices - certainly more than we could eat - and the regular menu for all meals has something for everyone. Our final dinner at Trellises Garden Grille was more expensive, but was delicious and beautifully presented. I can't say enough about the two banquets we enjoyed - one of roast beef and the other of chicken breasts stuffed with spinach! Beautifully cooked - beef still pink inside, vegetables crisp-tender, all piping hot, despite service for over 1000 attendees! Prompt service by unfailingly pleasant and accommodating wait staff. Oh, and the desserts! TOO decadent! We found that the Town & Country Resort was located quite centrally for all of our needs. It was only a 10-15 minute shuttle ride from the airport, and was a maximum 5-10 minute walk from the Fashion Valley trolley stop. It was quite easy to take the trolley system downtown to Seaport Village. And the Fashion Valley Mall begins just the other side of the transit centre/trolley stop. In summary, I would not hesitate to visit the Town & Country Resort again. The facility is quite charming and very clean, and the flowers and landscaping are beautiful. The staff were unfailingly pleasant and eager to assist whenever needed.

But since that is where our conference was being held, we had little choice. So we went into it trying to have as positive an attitude as we could, and I am pleased to say we were delighted to have had a very different experience. It was almost as if we were staying at a different resort! Please bear with a rather long review, as we feel we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to share the positives. We are simple middle class people who do a fair amount of traveling, mostly staying in mid range accomodations (Marriott, Hilton Garden Inns and Hamptons, Holiday Inns and the like). From the moment we arrived, all the staff was never anything but pleasant and helpful. This included the front desk, cleaning and other support people, restaurant staff, concierge staff, conference center people, as well as several higher level managers we encountered and talked with one day. I can honestly say we never encountered a crabby staff person during the week. We were booked in the Royal Palm tower, and having read about some of the rooms with views of brick walls, we specifically requested a middle room with balcony overlooking the pool area when checking in. We were nicely accommodated with this request\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.as with the few others we made during our stay. When we got to our room we found we were close to the elevator\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6which we had read was a problem for another reviewer in regard to noise. But we were never disturbed by noise from the elevator or any of the rooms around us. We never even heard any noise from the rooms around us and we knew people were staying in them. There was staff with golf carts to help you bring your bags to your room, if needed. We had a rental car, so did not need that service, but we never had trouble finding a convenient parking spot, as some other reviewers spoke of. We could see that there were not as many parking spots by the garden bungalows, so maybe was not as easy to park there, but we never had any trouble in the big lot by the Royal Palm. And some spoke of roads within the resort that were hard to navigate, but we never had trouble with that. It is a rather big place, but not that big. It was a nice, couple minute walk from our building to the lobby area, which were on opposite ends of the resort. Our Royal Palm room was very spacious and nicely appointed; with a king bed, easy chair and ottoman, small table and chair as well as a writing desk. There was also the armoire with TV, bed tables and both floor and table lamps in various locations around the room that provided good lighting. The balcony had 2 comfortable padded chairs and a small table and we enjoyed time out there every day. The bathroom was spacious and had an outer area with a counter and sink, as well as the sink in the actual bathroom. I will agree that the shower head was mounted very low, but if that was the worst thing wrong, we certainly could easily deal with it. There was a large closet, too, with plenty of hangers. And though the comforter was not of a design I would choose for my bed at home (as with most hotels), it was certainly not objectionable. And besides being comfortable, the room was very clean and cleaned nicely each day throughout our stay. I read a number of reviews that mentioned the proximity of the freeway. And while it did run close to the front of the resort and we could see the traffic from our balcony, we could barely hear any noise with it. Even in early morning when the resort was very quiet, so it never disturbed us in the least. Was it very scenic? Not really and certainly not like looking at the ocean, but those rooms on the coast have much heftier price tags attached, too. And since the layout of the resort was so nice; with trees, lovely gardens and flowers, pools, etc, it was not hard to overlook the freeway. The grounds were also kept very clean. There were always cleaning crews out first thing in the morning cleaning the pool and other common areas. And besides doing a great job, they were also quick to return a smile and a greeting. The pools and whirlpool looked very clean and though we did not use them, heard many good things from folks in our conference who did. There was some construction going on, as they were renovating some areas, but it was very easy to get around and did not disturb us in any way. Food at the resort was a little on the expensive side, but no more so than in other restaurants we ate in around San Diego. And all the food we had was very well prepared, portions more than adequate and wait staff very pleasant. The breakfast buffet was especially nice, with good hot food and many choices; scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage, pancakes, french toast, beautiful fresh fruit, cereals and a multitude of bread and pastry choices. Some thought it was a little expensive at $14.50, but included all beverages, so really was not much more than breakfast with juice and coffee at someplace like Perkins and was all you could eat. The Terrace also had nice salads, sandwiches and great homemade soups along with some other entrees and a fresh fish choice each day, making it a good choice for any meal of the day. The Trellis is a little more upscale and rather expensive for dinner (we thought), but we had a very nice lunch there.

I went back at 2:30 and was placed in 1132, an excellent ground floor room that actually walked out to a large patio that I used everyday. I used room service on three occasions and found the food to be of good quality and reasonably priced. And a large pizza is really large....and will feed 4 people easily. A co-worker requested a room change later in the week as her spouse was arriving with their 18 month old......this was handled with ease and they were allocated a room close by to us so that they could sit outside at night and use their baby monitor to llisten to their child.

My brother, a San Diego resident, made reservations for us at the Town & Country, via Expedia, months ahead of time. He also used Expedia to pay, and to request 4 double queen rooms. At check-in, we were given four double queen rooms, but told that we would have to move to different rooms after the first night. No explanation was given at the time, but we were told by Javier, the night manager, that the new rooms would be an upgrade, that they would be double queens, and that he would comp our three days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 parking (parking is a hefty $14/day) and two days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 breakfasts. Now, when I arrive at a hotel, I really want to unpack and settle in - and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to worry about packing again until it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to leave. I absolutely detest the unsettled feeling of staying one night here and one night there, even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s different rooms in the same hotel. So Javier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news that we would be moving after the first night was anything but welcome. The comps were something, as was his assurance that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be getting better rooms, but bottom line, they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth the hassle we were looking at in changing rooms. The property is huge and sprawling. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a small community, albeit a community that never understood the point of a planning commission. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of parking here, a bit there, and even a parking structure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see an actual entrance to that, so it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do us any good. We drove to the building where our four rooms were located, and circled the surrounding area a couple of times looking for parking, but there was none within the same Zip code as the rooms; we ended up parking just this side of Tijuana. To add to our delight, the rooms were on the second floor of a somewhat ratty old building, with no elevator, so once we humped our bags from the car to the building, we hauled them up an outdoor concrete staircase. It was starting to dawn on us that this was not so much a hotel, as a motel with pretensions. The rooms were small, a bit shabby, and one had a funny smell that gave my daughter a headache within seconds of entering, but they were non-smoking double queen rooms, and all four of our rooms were in the same small cell-block, er, building. The room design was a bit odd; I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even find the closet for several hours. (Note: in my defense, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually spend those hours searching for a closet. When I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spot one right off the bat, I just assumed there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one, and was therefore surprised to discover one later, sort of tucked behind the sink.) There was no point in unpacking, but there was not sufficient space to accommodate an open suitcase, as we were being thrown out the next morning anyway. We finally cleared the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s junk from the wooden table to put an open suitcase on it. I awoke early the next morning, increasingly frustrated at how we were being treated. In particular, it kept going through my mind that the only reason for moving us from our block of four rooms was that the hotel was more interested in accommodating the new guests than in making our group happy. At around 6, I got dressed and ventured to the lobby to see if they could do any better for us. I spoke with Christina at the desk. On a map, she showed me where our new rooms would be, circling an area encompassing multiple buildings, while she tried to sound like the rooms were somehow close together. She, too, assured me that we would have double queen rooms. I mentioned the lack of convenient parking, and she pointed out a number of parking lots around the periphery of the property. Perhaps there were parking spaces in those far-flung lots; perhaps there are parking spaces on the moon, too, but they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do us much good, being nowhere near our rooms. Anyway, Christina said that they would make the move as hassle-free as they could, and we at least wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait through the check-in line again. After packing what little we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d bothered to unpack, we had breakfast at the buffet at the Terraces. It was a typical breakfast buffet, with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, etc. Nothing special (e.g., no omelet bar), but it was OK. A couple of notes to remember: if you like to enjoy a beverage with your meal, order it before you visit the buffet; otherwise, it will arrive about the time you leave. Also, the nearest restrooms are located in the convention center (i.e., nowhere in the Terraces building), so plan accordingly. We checked out of our rooms (we had to go to the desk for this: for some reason, they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just transfer the account information without seeing our by-now snarling faces), and we checked our bags with the bell desk. After spending the day out, we came back to check in to the new rooms. Not only did they need to see our faces, but they needed to see our ID\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in order to do this, so we had to have one representative from each room turn up, with ID, at the desk. No idea why. The funny thing was, they enforced this ID thing with some of our rooms, but not all. They did have our keys all ready, and we trooped off to the new four rooms, which were located, respectively, here, over there, way over there, and way the hell over there. Thanks ever so much for the effort, Christina. The new rooms were, indeed, nicer. They were on the ground floor and were larger. However, each had a just one king-size bed, despite the assurances of both Javier-the-night-manager and Christina-the-morning-desk-person that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have double queens. So as soon as we looked at the first room, we called the front desk to see what was up. This time, the story was different. The person on the line said that she had no idea why Javier and Christina had both promised double queen rooms; according to her, both Javier and Christina should have known, at the time they were making their promises, that no such rooms would be available to us. Now, if we wanted to move again the next day (call the Guinness Book of Records \u00e2\u20ac\u201c three rooms in three days!), they could accommodate us. The bottom line was, we now had four rooms, each with a king bed in it, and, as the hotel had nothing more appropriate to offer us, we requested rollaways to be brought in ASAP. As it transpired, the term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ASAP\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean much to the staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they brought them at such a leisurely pace that we left for dinner not knowing whether there would be adequate bedding when we got back that night. In fact, one granddaughter ended up in tears, as Grandma had to cancel a planned sleepover because she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know whether there would be another bed in her room. By then, I was really getting mad. I told the person on the phone that they should be looking at comping rooms at this point. She said they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, as the reservations were made via Expedia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that our requests for double queens were only requests, and did not have to be honored, since they, too, had been made via Expedia. My pointing out that two hotel employees, one of them a manager, had promised double queens, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a dent. (Note to self: Self, in future, never book a hotel via Expedia; maybe use it to search, but book via the hotel directly.) The new rooms were pretty, but noisy. Each had a nice big bay window, which, I think, was the reason why anyone walking by, conversing in normal tones, sounded like they were right in our room, conversing via megaphones. Also, the shower head was mounted so low that, even though I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m only 5\u00e2\u20ac\u21225\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, I had to kneel to wash my hair. (And no, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like that in order to accommodate folks with disabilities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if that were the reason, there would have been handrails. It was just mounted at a stupid height.) Now, to be fair, I must say that they did supply some of those little extras that really make a trip memorable. For instance, one of our four rooms came complete with a dirty diaper; it was on top of the armoire, along with the rest of the trash left by the previous occupants. And another room had a little touch of the beach in it: sand all over the tub. Given that a rinse was all it took to clean out the sand, it was clear that the maids had not bothered to rinse the tub, let alone properly clean it, even between guests. Glad I opted for a shower. The bottom line here is that the Town & Country is woefully mismanaged, and staffed by folks who will look you in the eye, smile, and lie their guts out. The cleaning crew couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a job mucking out a pig sty.

Right behind the hotel is part of the San Diego River, and a bridge over that river takes one to a posh shopping center (Fashion Valley). My room was a sweet little cottage room with cherry wood colonial style furniture and a dark blue carpet. There was a huge four-poster bed, nice little writing desk, and a table by the bay window with two lovely big chairs. It opened directly out into a little courtyard with palm trees, a gazebo, lawn and rosebushes. It was a beautiful room, and a lovely, peaceful place to stay. I enjoyed walking around the grounds at night and in the morning--it was very well maintained. Weird stuff: Two of the more casual restaurants were shut when I was staying there, and the one that was open was too fancy for a person in casual clothes so I had to order (pricey) room service instead. Also, you have to pay for every little extra you would expect for free from other hotels, such as in-room internet service, parking in front of your own room (!?) and use of the fitness center. The fitness center is really a good one, but yeesh, uses is usually free at most other places. Good perks: On the south side of the river a block or two east of the hotel, you can get onto a very beautiful running path that goes for miles along the San Diego River.

Besides the decor - which is very outdated, I did not like that fact that you had to park in a gated parking lot and that you have to get a ticket from the attendant and present that each time you leave the lot. Also, the jacuzzi was under construction at the time of our stay, so we could not use it - but we were never told of this fact when we made our reservation or when we checked in. However - the biggest problem was when we checked out. Several hours after leaving the hotel I realized that I had left 2 jackets in the closet and my cell phone charger plugged in by the table. I called the hotel immediately and was told to speak with Janet in the Lost and Found department. Nothing was turned in that day and Janet said she would call me back with an update. Needless to say, several weeks later, no call back from Janet, so I called the hotel and asked to speak with a manager. After a run-around on the phone speaking with people who really just didn't seem to care, I got through to Mr. Sobek's office, the General Manager, and left him a message. He did follow up on my message by having one of his security officers call me back. My things were never found and when I pushed the issue the security officer offered to write up a report. Since I never heard back from Mr. Sobek directly I called him again and was able to speak with him in person. He did say that they had checked the lock records and according to that , no one but the 'room attendant' had entered my room that day. Basically he said they had done all that they could do and sorry that they never called me back and sorry that they don't know what happened to my things but that was really all they could do. No urgency, no offer to follow up on the matter, no real caring about the situation. When I pushed the issue Mr. Sobek stated that they often are accused of their staff stealing things from the rooms. At no time did I accuse anyone of stealing anything. My issue is that the hotel staff did not appear to take this matter seriously and that is what truly concerns me. Before this incident I had decided that I would never stay at this property again - mostly due to personal taste - but this issue is more serious and I warn travelers to be careful! To add insult to injury, during my phone call with Mr. Sobek, he basically hung up on me once he said 'goodbye', I didn't even have a chance to say 'goodbye' myself. I do find it interesting that the security officer offered to write up a report for me but Mr. Sobek didn't. Does he not know of the procedures in his own hotel?

It has got to be one of THE worst \"hotels\" I have ever had the displeasure of staying. Out of no choice of my own, our school district booked it for a conference that I was attending in July. (The conference hall, which is part of the Town and Country, is a step up from the rest of the hotel). I'll begin with the total disorganization in the lobby during check-in... Granted, there were a zillion teachers and other guests swarmed in the lobby, but one would think that by now management would have implemented some sort of organized procedure for handling guests at such high volumes. No one seemed to know what was going on and the times we were told our rooms would be ready varied from one staff person to another. As we trekked through the overgrown jungle-like walkways to get to a restaurant for breakfast, we landed upon a low-class version of a cafe. It looked like some sort of side of the highway Jerry's Restaurant from the 1960s. After standing in a line that went out the door, we were seated at separate tables (not a big deal, since there were 9 of us). However, after waiting forever I was hoping for a meal that was at least somewhat palatable. I'm not sure how you go wrong with a cheese omlet and potatoes, but they managed to. The potatoes were charred and the omlet was grey - everything tasted like a piece of charcoal! Yuck!! After two bites, I paid my twelve dollars and easily convinced the rest of our group never to dine here again. I've never paid so much for such a disgusting meal. Several hours later we had a room. With all of the money that they get from ripping people off, I don't see how they can't afford to update the place. The rooms were dark, dirty, old, and just plain old creepy. They have this bizarre old Victorian thing going on as their decor. The bathrooms have peeling wall paper and the shower doesn't seem to have been scrubbed since they built the hotel. There were special hairs in my bed and on a few \"clean\" towels. Yes, the special kind that you keep down under. The toilet backed up even after having someone come in and \"fix\" it. The walls are paper thin. We could hear our neighbors brushing their teeth and unfortunately for us, we got to smell their cigarette smoke all night and morning while in the room. Haven't they heard of separating smoking floors from non-smoking floors??? I've read several reviews about the beautiful grounds and pools. Not true... Unless you consider gardens littered in trash and worn down pools littered with seedy characters everywhere beautiful. This \"hotel\" couldn't have gotten things more wrong. They need to shut down and renovate every inch of this property. Perhaps back in the 1950s or 60s this place was of resort quality, but it has since been flushed to sewer quality. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. There are by far nicer hotels to enjoy while staying in San Diego.

The hallways were covered with filth ( including gum, toilet paper, trash, etc.) They looked like they were never cleaned! Lights in the hallway were blinking on and off. A small child looked at us in the elevator and said \"these rooms are disgusting\". We entered our room and it was filled with cigarette smoke, dark, dirty ( either a thumb print of blood or ketchup on our wall). We immediatly called the front desk and were told \" there is nothing we can do, we are oversold tonight). Why a hotel would oversell is beyond me, but upon insisting to talk to a manager, a room magically opened up. The next room was a \"suite\" that included a couch, but no bed. Once of us slept on the couch and the other on a cot. The next day we were promised the room we had orgainally requested in a renovated building. The room was not cleaned in time ( after 3:30 pm) despite being promised it would be ready by 12:00 ( we were driving around all day with our computers, etc. in the car) so we were put into \"their best room\".

We were concerned for our health at that point due to the poor air quality. Many people at our confrence felt the same way about the rooms. While the grounds here are pretty, they are not clean.

I've read many reviews about this hotel, many good, many bad, which made us a little skeptical. However, we thought, (1) the Town and Country had an excellent location to the areas we wanted to see, (2) we had never stayed at this hotel prior to this visit, and (3) everyone has different opinions about different thngs, so, why not, \"Chance Um\". We checked in on a Wednesday night after ten-thirty and was greeted by Brian, a courteous and very friendly gentleman. Brian informed us from the Get-Go that there would be a $12.00 a day parking fee, I guess other guests had complained about this surprise expense, but remember, I've read all of the prior traveler reviews, so I was \"ready\". After locating our building, you could tell that it looked like any other fifty-three year old hotel, showing signs of maturity, but still maintaining that graceful look. All of the parking stalls were taken. Vehicles were also parked out of stalls and anywhere you could squeeze a vehicle into, with no assigned parking stalls, the parking lot theme was \"Park Where-Ever\". Another \"Challenge\" to staying at this hotel, but we found our special parking space right next to our room, \"Be Creative\". We stayed on the second floor of a two story building in Room #3381. No elevators, so we had to hump our luggage up the stairs and carry our sleeping six year old grandson. The room was \"quaint\" with nothing to brag about. However, the room looked \"Beautiful\" especially after a long flight from Honolulu and a hassel with Dollar Rent a Car, but that's another story. Finding a place to eat dinner after eleven is another challenge. The parking lot attendant was courteous and informative. He suggested Denny's which we happily agreed to, hot cakes, over-easy eggs and link sausage never tasted so good. The next day, we toured the hotel grounds. Beautiful surroundings, day or night. Prices at the hotel are what you would expect at any other place, \"High, Higher, and Highest\". However, we had the use of a Dodge Charger, and there are a plethora of choices surrounding the Town and Country. There is even a Trolley, a short walk behind of the hotel, just before you reach the Fashion Valley Shopping Center, which can take you to Old town or Downtown for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Sleeping at night can be a problem if you are a light sleeper. On several occasions, I could hear people talking or walking \"heavily\" by our room. Adjacent \"Neighbors\" can be heard talking due to thin walls. Air Conditioning. If you like to have an instant cold air conditioning, this place is not for you. However, the room does get cold, but it slowly creeps up on you. So as you leave for your daily itinerary, leave the air conditioner on \"High\", and you will be rewarded upon your return to your room. Housekeeping was excellent. After informing the maid that there were three people staying in the room and not two people, we were never lacking in towels or amenities. Upon returning, our room was always squared away and since we stayed out to almost midnight every night, we were never bothered by the maid as long as you place the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign in your electronic key slot.

The light bulbs in the light fixtures in the hallways are too stong a wattage so they have left burn marks on the ceilings as they are too hot. A fire hazard. They did not replace drinking glasses in my room one day. I waited 2 1/2 hours for them to bring them to my room. Don't expect to use the sauna or hot tub. This is the only resort I know where you have to pay $9 a day to use the health club which includes the sauna and hot tub. This resort is poorly managed. It is a shame as the location is fantastic.

We stayed for 5 nights and six days. The hotel was paid for by the company, so, luckily, that was not an issue. Despite some of the other previous reviews, we enjoyed the hotel even with very small children. Positve Aspects: Right (smack dab) in the middle of Hotel Circle. Very near the zoo, balboa park, sea world, and the freeway. WHile my husband was at the conference, I was easily able to navigate around by myself. Very near to a freeway exit/enterance A large shopping mall is directly behind the hotel parking lot. City trolley station directly behind the hotel parking lot. I rode the trolley by myself with my 3 year old and my 5 month and I did not feel unsafe. At one point I did get on the wrong trolley, but easily corrected my mistake. I think there are 3 different pools on the resort lot. My children and I tried 2 of them. There was not a children's pool (which I would have liked), but the pools we did try were clean, well stocked with towels, very close to the hotel rooms, and surrounded by many tables and lounge chairs. One of the pools we tried was not heated, but the main pool in the center of the resort was. I don't know if this is normal for the hotel or not. Nice sized television with free cable channels. Nice view from the front (door) and back (balcony) of our hotel room. Negative Aspects: Nothing extra is free. For us, we usually stay at less expensive hotels (Comfort Inn, Best Western, etc.) and it is nice to wake up to free breakfast and coffee- even if it is a bowl of cereal and a banana. This hotel has restaurants on site, the price for breakfast was approx. $7-8 per person. I do think that children were able to eat free with paid adult at breakfast though. Dial up internet is charged. Local calls were charged. ( we brought our cell phone and used it while we were there for free). Movies and video game usage are extremely expensive.

When we arrived we verified with the gentleman at the counter that this is what we were getting. We got up to the room which was a very typical older hotel room. Definitely not a big deal. We were about to unpack when I noticed a sign on the door saying that this was a non-smoking room. I called the desk to say there was a problem and that this was a non-smoking room, they came back saying that was all they had and that maybe the next day they might have one (that would be night two of our two night stay). Be reminded that the gentleman at the front desk verified this is what we had asked for. To make a long story short, we decided we would find a room at another hotel that would definitely give us what we wanted (which we did. The Doubletree was new, beautiful, accomodating and less expensive). The kicker is when we went down to the desk to give the key back a lady was at the counter almost in tears. It seems she was attending a convention at the Convention Center at the hotel. She had arrived earlier that morning and they told her that her room wasn't ready and to come back later in the day. It was 5:30 p.m. and they had GIVEN HER ROOM AWAY!! She had made her reservation a month in advance, had her confirmation in hand, and all they could do was apologize, they had no rooms left!! I couldn't believe it! When they \"went back to check\" I told her that we had a room that we had been in for just 10 minutes and were leaving because it wasn't what we wanted or needed...it was exactly what she had a confirmation for.

We had a lovely view of the pool and tropical vegetation if we kept the drapes open, although people could then look into the room. The bathroom wallpaper was pealing in places, but not bad. The room was clean, and well-supplied with towels, etc. The handle on the bathroom sink kept coming unscrewed. The room clock/radio periodically made loud humming noises, so we finally unplugged it. The mattresses were VERY firm, too firm for me. The walls were somewhat thin, as we could hear the doors slamming closed next door, the service personnel rolling their carts back and forth over the cobbled walkway outside, and people talking as they walked by. After the first night we turned the room AC fan up on full to help drown out the noises. There is a charge for all calls outside the resort, including 1-800 calling cards and local calls, and you have to pay by the day to use the exercise facilities. We got parking included with the conference fees, but other people staying there had to pay. There were billing problems for many of the folks from our group, which still weren't resolved when we left. A PO had been issued by our employer to cover room costs, but the front desk hotel personnel (usually \"interns\") insisted upon billing someone for each room. Some of our group got angry and refused to give them a credit card #. One supervisor was told her credit card would be billed for the total cost of the group. Two of my coworkers said they had problems with their rooms, and called for maintanence, who promised to be right there and never showed up. The food at the restaurants onsite was overpriced, so most of us went to the mall next door to eat, or drove to other San Diego locations. The tram system is right behind the resort, and very handy to travel about town. It even goes all the way to Tijuana. I wouldn't stay at the T & C again, especially at the rates our employer was charged.

Where oh where to begin? When we arrived, the lady checking us in was very friendly and gave us free breakfast and drink coupons as well as one of the cottage rooms by the pool. The grounds are fantastic, with gardens everywhere you look, but that's about as far as the amenities extend. The room was marginal. Tiny bathroom (inhabited by ants), semi-clean, hard bed. A room at the Quality Inn is comparable. The prices at the restaurants on site are way overpriced and serve pretty lousy food. The waitresses at the Terrace Cafe (where the breakfast buffet is held) were scarce and often rude. But the worst part was when the hotel was invaded by the international aquatic fitness convention. They took over every pool for six hours a day, starting at 7:30 in the morning. We tried to find a quiet spot to relax, but their booming music could be heard everywhere on the grounds. The hotel staff offered to move us to one of the tower rooms (where the music was still loud) and said they could do nothing about the problem. We finally gave up and flew home early. Overall, I would not reccomend this hotel for anyone who wants a relaxing, peaceful vacation. This hotel gets their money from the big conventions in town and are not concerned with the comfort of their other guests.", "Date": "May 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cGood and bad\u201d", "Author": "LVSaint", "ReviewID": "UR3305152", "Content": "Stayed here not out of choice.

Seemed to be recently decorated, not at all shabby, clean and generally nice (although colonial decor a bit OTT and unneccessary). Looked out onto garden and pool and close enough to where we parked car. Bed seemed to be new, very firm (maybe too firm) Some of the bad... There is no guarantee that if you order a king online you'll get it (I booked via their website where you'll get a cheaper room than calling them directly). It's first come first serve. It's true, they will nickel and dime you! $10 extra for each of the following - cot, fridge, parking ($12) - cheap or what! Possibly many other things that'll be extra if you ask. Very little water pressure to shower. Room and bathroom although clean, were small. In a 3000 room hotel, to offer no coin operated laundry facilities is madness. Had to venture under freeway to Best Western. All in all, would not return. There are so many of this kind of place to stay in town. This resort seems dated and it's charging policies suck.

The grounds are nice enough, but the hotel is showing its age--little to no sound insulation in the \"bungalow\" rooms, skimpy curtains that can't quite block the security light shining outside, budget-class linens. The hotel provides few business travel amenities. Yes, there's a gym, but you need to purchase a $10 per day spa membership to use the gym. In-room internet access is $5 a day, with no wireless capability. There's nowhere to lock down a computer, either. Conference facilities are dreary--everything is a bit faded, the exhibit space feels like the basement that it is, and there are no indoor venues for grabbing a quick snack. The hotel food was overpriced and bland. You'll do much better at the mall, or driving up the hill near the medical school. My family stayed in the area shortly before. We rented a \"family\" sized room at a more pedestrian motel, which gave us twice as much space as the Town and Country at half the price.

It would have been nice to sit out there to sip coffee or read. The upstairs were we stayed was like any other hotel room. The room was clean, well maintained and nicely furnished. Our room cost included a daily breakfast buffet which was really great. The trolly is located at the rear of the property. The trolly can go north as far as the San Diego Misson and south to the TJ border/Mexico. There were at least 2 grand malls, Gaslamp district, Seaport village and Old Town San Diego accessible by this inexpensive trolly. We took a cab to have ocean view dining at Pacific Beach. The round trip cab ride was $30. Although our conference was somewhere else, the convention center at the Town and Country was lovely. The grounds were very beautiful with roses galore.

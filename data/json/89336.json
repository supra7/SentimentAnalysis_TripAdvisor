Although we live only 45 minutes from Baltimore, we hadn't been to Baltimore in 3 years. Given the wide array of things to do for children, we decided to do a local spring break. What a treat --- both the Harbour area and the Hotel. The Hotel is very pretty, lobby has beautiful fresh flowers, and the service is exceptional. The front desk has the most pleasant front desk staff I've encountered. They are more than accomodating. We visited Rusty Scuppers for dinner (recomment a visit...food was good and great harbour views) and while you can see if from the hotel, they suggested that given it was 6:45pm, we had a young child, temps dropped to about 45 degrees that while we could walk, we should consider taking the shuttle. They called Rusty Scuppers and they had a shuttle to the hotel in less than 10 minutes. We didn't plan to be in the room much, so we just opted for a regular courtyard view which served us well. The rooms are incredibly spacious and while the furniture isn't new, it isn't old and disgusting either!! Everything was clean and comfortable. My 5-year old especially liked the TV in the bathroom -- suggesting that we should have that at home. Our room safe was broken and they sent someone up immediately to fix it. We didn't have sufficient towels and someone was up in 5 minutes to bring new ones. The in-room coffee makers were Keurig's with a great assortment of coffees and teas. As with most hotels, the bottled water in the room was expensive, but I expect that. So, we bring our own Fuji water and don't even bother with it. My husband visited the Explorer's Lounge and said it was great. The pool is very small and is 5 and 1/2 feet throughout the entire pool, but it was fine for us. They also have a nice gym. It's small, but packed with equipment. Their gym areas also has a racquetball court and a studio for yoga or pilates. The only negative part of our experience, which the hotel compensated us for was the Brighton's Restaurant. They seem not to be able to accomodate a crowd. The first day it took us 40 minutes to get our breakfast, the second day almost an hour, and the thir day, we gave up. It was frustrating and many of the tables around us experienced the same thing. We had a breakfast credit built into our rate, so maybe that was the problem. They didn't expect so many people to have bought that particular package...not sure, but it was not idea. It was so bad on day two that they credited our account $100 for the two days of poor service we had on the breakfast dining. What a great thing to do!!! I highly recommend the InterContinental Harbor Court in Baltimore. Also recommend, going to Miss Shirley for breakfast or lunch (only open til 3). Oh my...delicious!!!! It's about a 10 minute walk from the hotel --somewhat accross the street from the Acquarium!!!", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cexceptional service from the concierge and food service - nice accommodations\u201d", "Author": "ecnewyork60763", "ReviewID": "UR127492492", "Content": "we spent a weekend in Baltimore with a group and had excellent help from the concierge, robert in planning restaurant reservations, transportation and any last minute detail. robin in the food services department was most accommodating as well.

Our plans were to relax and attend a game at Camden Yards. Check in time was 3 p.m., however when we arrived at 5, we were informed that our room would not be available for several more hours. This was very disappointing, as we had plans at 6, and needed our room immediately. We had to downgrade our room in order to get a room immediately. We were not very happy. The room was very basic - I don't know how long it has been since the hotel has been updated, but in my opinion it is in need of one now. All of the furniture had clearly seen better days, with chips, scratches and overall wear and tear. The carpet had several areas of spots, and there were several dust and dirt piles in the corners of the room. The bathrooms may have been renovated in the near past - the tile looked updated but the overall layout seemed odd. The bathroom footprint itself is large, but the location of the tub and toilet were almost touching, making it feel cramped. The room noise was also poor. This room overlooked the courtyard, so there wasn't any street noise - however we were woken very early in the morning by a metallic scraping noise. We were two doors down from the service elevator, so I'm assuming this had something to do with it. If you stay, I'd recommend requesting a room far from this area. We ordered dinner and breakfast room service, which was very quick and the quality average. Although they had lunch and dinner options for kids, there were none for breakfast. The portions were decent and the prices were not too bad. I think the best thing this hotel has going for it is the location. It is right across the street from the Science Center and Inner Harbor walkway, and within a 15 minute walk to Camden Yards.

We enjoyed the pool for a few hours which was nice, nothing spectacular but we witnessed one family who ordered drinks from room service who delivered to the pool. After returning from the pool we were getting ready for dinner. We called the concierge who recommended an amazing restaurant. They called us a cab and waited on the street to get it for us, and also offered us umbrellas while we waited. We decided at about 11:30pm to hit up the explorer lounge and Cameron the bartender was fabulous. Wonderful personality and dealt with all of our obscure questions and answered with a smile.

Although the service was outstanding, the hotel itself, and in particular our room, was not to the level I have come to expect from the InterContinental Hotel. These comments are directly related to room 317, a junior suite, and may not reflect the rest of the rooms but I have a feeling it sort of does. 1. The couch and bed were very \"worn out\" although we slept soundly I think that was more due to the nature of our travels then the quality of the bed. The couch, I don't think I would even keep that couch in my basement let alone a hotel of this caliber. It was so worn out that you sort of sank into it. 2. The carpet was very worn and had very large stains on it. I'm not sure exactly what the stains were from but they were about the size of a person, one right by the TV and one in the middle of the room. The wallpaper was peeling off in various spots around the room. 3. The TV in the living area would randomly either mute or shut off. At first I thought that someone else in a room above might have a like remote but after actually trying to figure it out it seemed that the TV would overheat and then stop working. If it muted you could move a channel up, then back and it would work...the mute/unmute button had no effect. If it shut off no amount of button pressing would turn it back on, you just had to wait. 4. TV in the bathroom is VERY dangerous!!!! The TV in the bathroom is a hazard. It almost hit my son on the head. It is on a stalk mount and the threads on the back of the TV as well as the threads on the stalk adjustment are stripped. If you move it at all the TV flips forward and, in my case almost hit my son in the head. Again I like the InterContinental brand and most of their properties this one is just not up to par.

In fact it has been our go to hotel when in Baltimore. As such, when we planned a weekend trip to Baltimore we just booked the Harbor Court again, expecting the same quality stay we experienced in the past. Not so. This hotel is showing its age, and it is not flattering! First off as we entered the room it smelled funny - like a combination of mold and rug deodorizer. In any event it was not pleasant and we had to open the window to clear it out. It never went away, but we got used to it I guess! The rug was also discolored throughout the room, in a very unusual pattern, making me wonder what had happened in that room to make it so. (Perhaps that explains the rug deodorizer smell??) The bed was absolutely the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in. The thing just caved right in...and they had a feather bed on top of the mattress in an attempt to cover up how pathetic the condition of the mattress really was. The televisions are old school and not high definition. The tv in our room would decide to mute itself every half hour or so, without any reason. We would have to change the channel and then the sound would return. There is no turn down service at night, or else they skipped our room on both nights we were there. Buyer Beware - We booked a special rate with breakfast included, but you are unable to order breakfast for two without having to pay extra! The rate gives you a $42 credit for breakfast, but if you order a basic breakfast it costs $24 per person. The buffet is $25. So unless you have a bowl of cereal and pot of coffee, there is no way you are going to spend $21 a person. Kind of a shifty deal if you ask me. The in room safe did not work, and the whole place just needs to be updated. And good luck trying to get hot water in the morning....warm is about it. On the positive side, the location is exceptional. And the valet parking although expensive is responsive and professional. The coffee in the downstairs coffee shop is amazing. And the staff is very nice. It is just a shame that a hotel that we have enjoyed immensely in the past has gone downhill.

We decided to try the Intercontinental this trip based on the Inner Harbor location and our experience with other Intercontinental hotels. Our room here was a mixed bag. Following an early flight, there were a variety of rooms available, so we were able to check in early instead of having our luggage held. We were given the opportunity to upgrade our room to a waterfront view, however we declined as $50 plus taxes seemed high. This is where we should have followed advice from tripadvisor posters who had recommended the water view rooms. What I didn\u2019t realize was that by not upgrading, our room faced a wall which I found to be a bit claustrophobic. I had also requested a quiet room away from the elevator, but our room was in the inner courtyard so we were closest to the elevator on our floor. This meant we not only heard the elevator clanking all night, but also heard a noisy group of guests coming and going in the hallway. I had planned on requesting a different room for our second night, however, we had early morning plans (and a train to catch) with our daughter, and the front desk was busy that morning. I slept with earplugs both nights. The next morning there were food bits outside of our door I had to step over. The positives on the room were that the bed was very comfortable and the room itself was spotless. The bathroom and shower were excellent with good water pressure. I swim whenever possible, but here I was only able to swim the second morning as the pool doesn\u2019t open until 8am on weekends. I was glad to get to use the pool as it felt wonderful after a day of walking. The pool is not huge, but it is very attractive with a designated lap lane. A couple negatives - the hot tub was not working and dirty towels from the day before were piled up. The fitness area looked excellent and with warmer weather, there is also a sunning area outside the pool. The location is fantastic for enjoying the Inner Harbor. You have to cross Light Street (which is 6 lanes), but the Science Center is across the street, so there is a crosswalk. We had a drink at the Rusty Scupper, less than a five minute walk and enjoyed a superb harbor view while we watched the boats come in. We opted for the self \u2013parking for $26/day. You take an elevator down to the lobby and then cross the driveway and take another elevator for the garage. It is not as convenient as the valet service ($48/day), but it was fine for us and we were in and out quite a bit. One perk is that you can use the lot all day after you check out, so we enjoyed the harbor right until we left for the airport. The staff we encountered was professional and when asked about our room, we were given a credit for the Internet charge. We had breakfast at Illy Caf\u00e9 in the lobby \u2013 great coffee and some healthy breakfast options (try the Greek yogurt, fruit, and granola).

I believe the evening hours are 5 pm - 9 pm. So plan accordingly. Parking is outrageous and I recommend parking elsewhere. There are a number of parking options with better rates.

After we booked back in Feb., we saw a few reviews that gave us pause. Any doubts about our choice were erased this weekend as our event was perfect! The hotel and rooms were spotless and the public areas\u2014the lobby in particular\u2014were simply gorgeous. We can\u2019t wait to see the photos by Gary Guerva from Rodney Bailey\u2019s on the winding staircase and in the library. The ambience in the Hamptons Room was cooled as requested and beautifully arranged and lighted, with a baby grand piano and beautiful wall draping. Cocktails followed in the Ravenhurst Room with guests being offered champagne, wine, or water by white gloved waiters as they entered that room. No lines resulted at the bars. The butlered appetizers were plentiful. Guests remarked over and again at how wonderful they were. The small crab cakes were delicious, closely followed by melt-in-your-mouth beef wellingtons, New England scallops wrapped in Applewood Smoked Bacon, duck quesadillas, brie and raspberries en croute, tiny macaroni and gruyere cheese bites with truffle oil. The display of Mediterranean vegetables, hummus, and pita was aesthetically pleasing and healthful. When we went into Whitehall Ballroom, it was exactly as we envisioned with white covered chairs, royal purple table runners, gorgeous lavender and blue flowers by Wicked Willow, hurricane candles encircled in roses, a beautifully displayed Sugarbaker\u2019s wedding cake and a semi-circular sweetheart\u2019s table for the newlyweds. The dinners of honey soy salmon and herb roasted chicken met our expectations. The parmesan bowl to serve the Caesar salad ahead of time and the strawberries and chocolates for a light pre-cake dessert were elegant. The servers were unobtrusively attentive. Jeff, the Director of Catering and Conference services was phenomenally organized and on top of every detail. Equally helpful and proficient in their roles were Scotlyn, the new catering manager; Miguel, the asst. director of Food and Beverage; and Lynnette, Banquet Server Extraordinaire. All of them were absolutely gracious to us and our guests. They went out of their way on so many little things, always with smiles on their faces. The bridal party was provided with the lovely Caucus Room to have a drink and appetizers in private for a few minutes right after the ceremony. Later, the staff saw that gifts, unity candles, reception book and so on were delivered to the bridal suite. The hotel even furnished a private break room (Homewood) for the Band (Love Seed Mama Jump). The band members raved about their dinners as well. After the reception, many of our guests proceeded to the Explorer\u2019s Lounge Bar and enjoyed more live music and a fun atmosphere. The mother and father of the bride were given drinks \u201con the house\u201d to celebrate our 41st Anniversary. It might be an understatement to say I am not an easy person to please and often write reviews when I\u2019m dissatisfied. We\u2019ve talked about the wedding all day and were truly 100% pleased.

We drove nearly 11 hours straight and had reservations at another hotel in Baltimore, The Holiday Inn, but after 24 hours with no sleep due to constant issues in a room basically in the middle of the parking lot and being afraid to leave the room because of the street folks who would follow me as I was taking Emily out or just going to the main hotel to get food and drinks, I spent the night on the phone trying to find another hotel and finally came across the Intercontinental which fortunately had an opening and accepted pets. I was very upset and worn out by the time I drove over and the staff was wonderful from the doorman to the front desk, housekeeping, restaurant staff and management. They all made me feel safe and secure and were always willing to help with anything I needed. The hotel is beautiful and ornate and the staff though very elegant and professional, were very warm and approachable. I hated to leave. It was filled with charm and grace, something you just don't see in a lot of the hotels now. I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is more expensive than my company had budgeted for, but it was well worth it to feel safe and secure. I enjoyed walking to the harbor everyday across the street with Emily. The harbor park is a dog park and provides all the entertainment you could need. The view from the roof is awesome. I never thought I would enjoy staying in a big city like this, but if you could live at the hotel....it would be perfect..lol I can't thank everyone at this hotel enough for making my trip a lovely one. It was very stressful being away from home, driving so far, then having the problems I did at the other hotel as soon as I arrived, but the staff made me forget all that and I left Baltimore feeling nothing but relaxed and grateful for the opportunity to spend a week in such a fabulous town. Treat yourselves to something really special and spend some time at the Intercontinental Hotel. Just exploring the lobby, libraries, cafes and my favorite spot, the roof, where the view, zen garden, gazebo, pool and spa area is, was an adventure.

From the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed. The concierge, doormen and staff were all wonderful and eagerly answered any questions we had. The complimentary lemon/orange water in the lobby was refreshing and decor astounding. When I opened the door to our room overlooking the Harbor, the kids ran to the window in awe and immediately began pointing out all the neat things we could see. We were fortunate to have a full moon light the water at night to see the sun rise is indescribable. We watched the boats slip in and out, joggers running by and had perfect views of the Science Center and Aquarium. The room, especially the Deluxe Harbor Front, is not inexpensive, but is comparable to the other hotels nearby. What sets it apart is the amazing staff, beautiful apportionments and what I believe is the MOST amazing view of the Harbor. It doesn\u2019t get any better. Of note: if you are traveling with luggage, make sure to stop by the entrance to the Hotel off Light St and drop it off prior to parking in the garage. As we had parked and visited the Science Center before checking in, we (our choice) needed to lug our through the garage to the elevator to the first floor across the garage entrance and into the back entrance to the Hotel then to the elevators and up to our floor.

We plan on writing a letter to his boss about how nice that was of him. Every time we entered the hotel, the valet would open the door for us even though there is a revolving door. We asked for additional towels and had them at our door within five minutes.

First let me address some of the comments I've seen on this site. One reviewer called it \"your grandmothers house\" I guess because the decor is Early American.....which may not be your style but if you think about it Baltimore is an old east coast city so the decor is probably pretty appropriate. Furniture in the rooms is pretty beat up, but I doubt your grandma's house had marble baths. They upgraded us to harbor view rooms, unfortunately the center vision panel in my room had a bad seal, so it was pretty much opaque....so much for the view. They apparently recently replaced the fixtures in the baths, and they are cheap stuff. Beds had feather pad and duvet and pillows, not so good for everyone and perhaps in lieu of upgrading from mattresses in poor condition....but staff knew how to exchange all that stuff for hypo-allergenic. Hotel is located on the frog hairs of the tourist area on the inner harbor, many other hotels more central. One restaurant and one bar on an upper level were pretty quiet, but food and service were five star. Kudos to Cameron in the bar for excellent service and hospitality. Rooms division staff were extremely nice and really went out of their way to accomodate our individual needs.....a special thanks to Alejandro at the front desk, a top notch professional who really cares, doormen went out of their way to help in any way, staff thereby made an otherwise so-so hotel visit a great stay. Agree with other reviewers that charging for the ethernet in the room is very tacky, just because the competition does it does not mean the Intercontinental has to follow suit. Likewise the charge for parking....and I saw signs at neighboring facilities, hotels and public, with stiff parking charges, guess it's a Baltimore thing. But here again my own feeling is bump the rate $20 and offer \"free\" internet and \"free\" parking....guests will be happier with that, product differentiation you see.

We experienced multiple problems:no electric sockets working in the bathroom or for one of the lamps; despite a confirmation that our room would be cleaned when we were out, it did not happen; wedding welcome packs prepared by the bride that should have been distributed never arrived, cold public areas (reception staff kept warm with an electric fire behind their desk!), restaurant not open for 2 nights due to low occupancy-whilst the same menu was on offer in the Explorers Lounge, on one night there were noisy football supporters there watching game on TV-not accepatable in my view. Reception staff were very difficult when a late check out was requested-presumably because we had complained about other issues. Eventually the management stepped in, we got an apology and agreement to a late checkout of 6pm-this is exceptional I know but in view of our experiences and the low occupancy at the hotel, it was at least something the hotel could do for us. The late check out was much appreciated. However, to our amazement, when we returned to our room to pack our last items of clothing about 4pm we found them out of the drawers and removed from the hangers and lying on the furniture in the room. The maid said she did not know where we were and had not been told there was a late check out. Why that gave her the right to touch our property I do not know. So, the only reason why we did not rate this hotel in the lowest category was because the management at least recognised their shortcomings and tried to rectify. Lots of reviewers claim they are experienced travellers but I have stayed in over 400 hotels around the world in the last 10 years. Many US hotels are over-rated and this one certainly is. This hotel has a serious training need. One member of staff was very good-she served us at breakfast several mornings and was very concerned when she was unable to produce drinkable cappucino when we had to have dinner in the Explorers Lounge-clearly a consequence of a closed dining room!

It's about 2 blocks further than most other hotels to the Conference Center and light rail station, but this wasn't an issue for me. I had a good half day before and after the conference to visit Baltimore. I came in a bit before noon, and my room wasn't ready so they took my luggage and I gave them my cell phone number to call me when it was ready. I can't agree with a number of reviewers who felt that the hotel isn't luxurious, although I can agree with a recent reviewer who criticized the front desk. I asked how to get to the Baltimore Museum of Art by public transportation. The concierge desk had a sign saying it isn't even manned until 3 PM! That's not what I expect out of a luxury hotel. Well, one front office employee had never heard of the museum, and the other had no idea how to get there other than to take a cab. I did take a cab and while at the museum learned that there's a direct bus which goes within 2 block of the hotel. (Ended up being the same story 4 days later when I went to Fort McHenry). When they called me when my room was ready, I asked for my room number, because I was going to meet a friend later on. The response was \"I would tell you, but then I'd have to change the room number.\" Leaving aside the issue that there was no logical reason not to tell me my room number when they were calling me with a number I gave them (having left my photo ID), there was certainly no reason to give me a snide answer. I can understand an employee having to follow instructions which don't always make sense, but a simple \"I'm afraid I'm not allowed to give that information over the phone\" would have been more polite. Of course, at Hilton group hotels, I can select my room over the internet a day in advance, so I don't see the issue in the first place. Having Platinum status means nothing in InterContinental hotels (and most other hotels in the InterContinental Hotel Group, unfortunately), but Ambassador status does, so I was upgraded to a room facing the harbor. No fresh fruit as the Ambassador website promises, but some chocolates made up for it for this Belgian-American. The room was large, beautiful, and quiet, with no earplugs needed. There's a large bathroom with a nice tub from which one can watch TV (separate TV in the bathroom). No HD in either TV, though. They have a very nice gym and spa facilities, as well as a nice pool and even tennis courts.

My husband and I stayed in this hotel and so did a couple of our friends who were in for the party. Both of us checked in after the hotel's check-in time and were told our rooms were not ready because so many people had received a late check-out from the night before (which was New Year's Eve). The person who checked my husband and I in was not apologetic at all, even when we explained that we had an event that night and we needed a room so that we could begin getting ready as we still had a few things we needed to get done before the party started. The only explanation we received was that so many people had a late check-out from New Year's Eve and we were assured we would be offered the same thing. We explained that we really did not have time to wait for a room to become available because we were throwing an event that evening they initially offered us a worse room than we had requested and paid for. We had paid for a king bed with a harbor view and were told our options were 2 double beds with a harbor view or a king bed with no harbor view. When we asked if we could get ready in one room and then move later on they were fine with that, but we felt that this is something they could have offered us initially. We thought maybe we should have told them that we had just gotten married, but I feel that a hotel like this that is supposed to be very nice and is pretty pricey should have been a little more apologetic about their screw-up. At the majority of nice hotels I've stayed at, I've never had a problem with check-in, even early check-ins are often accommodated, so I thought it was ridiculous for a room not to be ready over a half hour after their printed check-in time. That being said, everything else was perfect. The view in our harbor view room was amazing, the rooms were clean and very nice. And we found that most of the staff was relatively helpful. We were especially impressed with the bellmen who were always wiling to help out and were very friendly. Room service was also pretty good. And it's walking distance from all the shops, restaurants and other attractions in the inner harbor. Even with the initial problem I would probably stay again, particularly for the view.

They seem genuinely invested in the guests feeling pampered and happy. And if they don't genuinely feel that way, then they are wonderful actors. EVERY SINGLE staffer I interacted with made me feel special, like all he/she cared about was my happiness, convenience and comfort. The front desk staff, the bellmen, the valets, the housekeepers, the indoor pool lifeguard, the nice lady in the coffee bar ... they made it a memorable and very very pleasant stay. I'd reserved what they call a \"corner room\" with a harbor view. I knew that it was 420 sq. ft., larger than their standard rooms. I'd anticipated that a corner room would have windows on 2 walls, but this did not. By corner room, they mean that the door to your room is in it's own tiny hallway off of the main hallway. There were two other doors in that tiny hallway, and both of them were to a suite that was the size of two such rooms. The hotel is quite wide, so it was a pretty long walk from the elevator all the way to a far corner of the hotel, but that's not a complaint ... more like a warning to anyone who has mobility issues but would think they want a corner room. The hallways were elegantly decorated with china cabinets and oil paintings of early American aristocrat types. You know, painting of a man in a powdered wig with his hunting dogs or his prized falcon, paintings of the hunt, and so on. The parking lot seemed inconveniently placed relative to the lobby and porte cochere, so I quickly changed from self-parking to valet parking. The indoor pool on the 7th floor was one of the reasons we chose this hotel. We were in town for a family event, and we wanted all of the rest of our time to be fun for the kids, so we needed the pool as well as the close proximity to the Inner Harbor. I can't say enough about how WONDERFUL the service was. It just about made up for the inflated price, but I guess the service was part of what I was paying for.

The suite was beautiful and equipped with two bathrooms (one with a TV), a plush king size bed, a wall flip-down queen, living and dining areas, and a large flat screen TV. The room was exceptionally clean too. I find it rather rare these days to find hotel staff that go the extra mile, but that day they did just that. I was also happy to notify the hotel manager and InterContinental corporate office of the excellent customer service I received. She recognized a problem, and quickly corrected it above and beyond. I hope she received an award, because it was well deserved! Every once in a while I find exceptional service, and when I do\u2026I tell someone.

The hotel is really lovely; our harborview rooms were absolutely amazing, other than the fact that the thermostat seemed disinclined to function properly and the room was always hot. The rooftop fitness center is surprisingly well-appointed; I'm just sorry I couldn't roll myself out of bed early enough to take advantage of the free yoga classes they offer guests. The real highlight is the hotel's restaurant and lounge. We had breakfasts and one dinner at the hotel as part of the package deal. We went to the M&S on the harbor for dinner on Friday night and were completely underwhelmed, and my experience with hotel restaurants has never exactly been positive, so I resigned myself to having lousy culinary experiences all weekend. Breakfast on Saturday morning was an absolute eye-opener. The prices are what you would expect for this class of hotel, but the portions were incredibly generous and really superb. I had Greek yogurt and an incredibly oversized bagel sandwich and couldn't even eat again until dinner; the fresh berries my mother got were plentiful and perfectly ripe, and the waffles and croissants enjoyed by others at the table were superb. On Sunday morning we were brought toast free of charge just because we asked nicely. Our waitress was friendly and remembered us from Saturday, asking about how our spa date went and keeping our coffee cups full. My grandmother fell in love with a dashing young Dutch man named Joas who kept up with our water and orange juice and rescued my mother's napkin from the floor, and was entirely friendly, charming, and delightful. Dinner on Saturday night was AMAZING. Our waiter had a quick, dry sense of humor and kept us laughing all night; the bar invented a drink for me called the \"picky guest\" after I didn't like the cocktail menu; the lobster bisque my grandmother was the only one to have the nerve to order was so wonderful we sopped up every last bit of it with bread from the table and were fighting each other for the right to sample from my grandmother's bowl. The executive chef, an enormous mountain of a man nicknamed Zeus, came out to say hello and could not have been more wonderful - he told us the secret of the bisque is cognac and seemed more than happy to share the full recipe with us. Our entrees were fantastic, especially considering that they were the same price point as the place we had gone on Friday and been so sorely disappointed - the veal marsala is particularly wonderful. And Zeus came out with a plate of little bite-sized desserts for us, no doubt because my grandmother was busy charming everyone she could find. We were so impressed with everyone. And finally, in the lounge, we spent several happy minutes chatting with the wonderful pianist, who had sat down to play when I was in the middle of a ranting story about work and was careful not to overwhelm my yelling with his music (as he admitted to us when we started to talk). He was just the nicest guy as well as being a great musician.

The room reminded me of an extremely cheap low budget hotel; the carpet was some cheap velour-type of fabric, the bedding was gross, the AC didn't work well, the bed was missing a finial (it sounds minor, but gave the room an incredibly \"dilapidated\" feel), cheesey art work, etc., etc. On the positive side, the bathroom was quite nice. The next morning we had breakfast in the restaurant and the buffet was pathetic; they had these tiny little pastries that looked like something a child would make in an Easybake Oven, but perhaps the worst part was the museli had turned sour and tasted like stale milk.

ICHC is definitely worthy of the 5 Star Rating. The hotel overlooks the Inner Harbor and is right across the street from the Science Center. Everything was exceptional. It was the rank and file staff that really made the trip great and the hotel experience tremendous. When we first arrived and entered the lobby, I was searching for a garbage can to discard a beverage when \"Sir, I'll take that for you.\" One of the employees noticed that I was looking for the garbage and just offered to take it himself. Nice touch. THE BAD Our only complaint was this: we had just returned to our room about noon to find one of the cleaning staff getting ready to do the room. She offered to come back since we had just returned. We agreed, showered and changed, and left. She never returned, so our room wasn't redone. ALL IN ALL Top of the heap InterContinental.

Boy, some of those reviews are downright mean, sometimes based on an isolated negative experience with one person or relatively minor issue. Relax, people; not all travel experiences are going to be flawless from beginning to end. I also can't help but wonder if the personality (e.g. rude or demaning behavior) of patrons has something to do with the way they are treated by staff. But I digress. I found this to be a perfectly pleasant hotel. The hotel is well located just across the street from the inner harbor (I would point out, though, that the \"street\" is an ugly, busy, eight-lane monstrosity, so it's not exactly a leisurely stroll to the water). You can easily walk to all major downtown attractions. The lobby is attractive, I found the staff to be helpful (for example, they were all too willing to let us check in a few hours early), and our rooms was clean, elegant, and quiet. We splurged a bit for a small suite on an upper floor, and would recommend that. We had a terrific panoramic view of the harbor, but it's not a tall hotel so only the top couple floors have really striking views. Our room had a large HD tv, a separate tv in the bathroom, enormous tub and shower, canopy bed, and sitting area. I am very sensitive to noise, and the hotel was quiet; you could hear the typical door and low voice once in awhile, but nothing too disruptive. We took a peak at the fitness center, and were impressed to see an outdoor rooptop tennis court, raquet ball court, decent-sized pool, and ample fitness equipment. We didn't have to deal with parking and didn't eat in the hotel so we can't judge those experiences. Overall, you may not have a five-star, flawless experience, but chances are very good you'll have a relaxing, very comfortable stay in a very nice hotel in a great location.", "Date": "October 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cWonderful.

The hospitality manager looked into the issue and found that the front desk clerk had not reviewed the date of departure and that he had already fixed the problem, had spoken with the clerk, and reassured me not to worry any longer. He could easily have made my life miserable considering the inavailability of rooms and it was my word against theirs. I highly recommend this hotel.

After resisting the urge to scream I then proceeded to unload my bags from the car only to have bellman/valet finally offer to take my bags up \"in a few minutes\". I was hesitant to leave my belongings in that courtyard and decided after initially taking my carryon up to the room to go retrieve my luggage. I didn't see the bellman anymore. I needed a bigger safe to store my belongings so I went to the front desk to ask if they could store my property in a vault. The front desk rep gave me an unassuring response and after he opened every drawer behind the counter in a \"why are you bothering me tonite-manner\" he told me that they (the hotel) installed those safes in the room so that the customers......and then his voice trailed. I got the message and decided to take my property back to my room and \"try\" to make it fit in the safe.

We live only a few blocks from the hotel, but we had a $500 gift certificate so we thought we'd spend the night and have a nice dinner. Valet parking is easy and check in is fast and uncomplicated. I don't think the hotel has any other parking, so if you drive you will be paying $29 for valet parking. Our room rate was $319 for a harbor view room. That was with an AARP discount. This seemed kind of high for a weekend night, but what the heck, we had a gift certificate. The room was comfortable although it is starting to look a bit dated. The king size bed was comfortable, but not anything special. The view of the Inner Harbor is great. The pay per view did not work on our tv, but was fixed in about 10 minutes after a phone call to the front desk. There was no mouthwash in the bathroom. On the way back to our room after dinner, we ran into someone who appeared to be a high priced hooker, high on something, roaming the hall in her barefeet with an icebucket in her hand, looking for a an ice machine . I'm not sure if she ever found one. Much to our disappointment, Hampton's Restaurant in the hotel is no longer open. Although the restaurant was always over priced, we have had a couple of good meals there in the past and were looking forward to dinner there especially on a gift certificate. We made reservations at Brighton's Restaurant which is also in the hotel. I had the grouper and my girlfriend had the swordfish, both were edible, but for a dinner tab including a couple of cocktails each of $140 without tip, I expected a little more. I have had better in meals in Fells Point bars for about 1/3 of the cost. There were only 4 other couples in the restaurant and we were the only diners after about 9:00 pm. The following morning, I made some coffee on the machine in the room, but there were no mugs, so I put it in a glass. There was only one serving of unflavored coffee, so I ordered a pot of coffee from room service, which was close to $20 including, tip and delivery charge. They brought two cups, one of which looked like it had been put through the dishwasher with a paper napkin on it and then dried. The resulting caked on white stuff was pretty awful . I called the front desk to tell them that one of the cups had some foreigh matter stuck to it and he told me that \"that does not live up to the level of service we try to provide\". I thought \"OK, so do I get a clean cup or what?\" None ever arrived. The coffee was ok which I drank from the other cup. When we checked out, I told the desk person about the cup and they kind of looked at me strangely. The one clerk told the other to take the charge off our bill. I told them I drank the coffee and was ok paying for it, but thought they might be interested to know that room service is sending their guests cups with yukky white stuff on it. Anyway, all told we had to put another $70 on top of the $500 gift certificate to cover dinner, a pay per view movie, and a night at the hotel. I travel a lot on business and the service at this hotel does not even meet the level one can expect from any Marriott anywhere in the US. Bottom line - nothing about the service, the rooms, or food in this hotel is anything other than very average.

One final note, When we checked in, we had to lug our bags from the cab in to the lobby because no bellman was present. I left them in the lobby because the woman checking me in assured me that she would have them sent up to my room \"as soon as I can find someone\". After waiting 45 minutes, I went back down to the lobby only to spot the bellman putting my bags in the back of a departing taxi. Yep, this place is great on service.

We held our wedding reception there and have revisited the hotel a number of times since then for special birthdays, anniversaries, etc. We always considered it our desintation of choice for special getaways. Until this latest trip, we experienced the highest level of quality customer service, decadent meals, and overall satisfaction. Prior to our most recent visit, we were advised by friends that the Harbor Court Hotel is no longer the hotel it once was, following the change in ownership to the Intercontinental, which occurred I believe about a year ago. We were warned not to expect much. Sadly, this turned out to be an accurate statement. We booked an overnight stay to include dinner at Hamptons restaurant. Our dinner was mediocre, with a house salad that was simply greens, and devoid of flavor, a rib eye steak that was average, and filet of sole that was soggy. Although we will give the pastry chef kudos as the creme brulee was divine, and the only bright spot of our stay. We generally will stop in the Explorer's Lounge for cocktails, but had to take a pass this time, as the bar was so full of cigar smoke that it was uncomfortable even walking by, and we overhead another couple walking out for just that reason. Our Harbor View room had a great view, of course, but the clicker on the TV was not reliable, and the thermostat in the room wasn't functioning well so we slept poorly due to the high temperatures. We dared not try anything from the mini bar, as there were many moldy spots inside the fridge. Room service failed miserably. We contacted them in the evening for champagne glasses, only to have them not show up. In our efforts to get ice for the ice bucket, we had to visit another floor, as the one on our floor was not working. We contacted Room Service again the next morning to order breakfast, had to call them back a second time when we realized they didn't ask us for clarification on the side items of our dishes, and were promised a delivery within 35 minutes. After an hour, we called to question whether our breakfast may have left the building. After 75 minutes, the breakfast arrived, cold, without the right number of beverages, and with incorrect side items. Additionally, the mold on the blueberries was the icing on the cake.

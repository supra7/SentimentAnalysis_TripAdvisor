I needed aspirin in the middle of the night and they actually sent someone to go to a store and get some for me!

Our room was a deluxe queen which meant that we weren't tripping over our luggage. Comfortable bed, 27 inch screen for late night viewing, sizeable and very clean bathroom, and nice sitting area right by a bay window. Maid service was speedy. Assistance from front desk personnel was friendly and helpful. Location is off of Haight Street which is still a throw back to the 60's. We rented bicycles just outside our door and toured Golden Gate park, rode along the ocean, and ended up at the top of the Golden Gate bridge. Took advantage of the bus lines too that were within a block of the hotel. Parking across the street was secure and for $15 a day, a bargain compared to valet parking fees at other hotels. We utilized public transportation during the day and used the rental car in the evening. Never had any problems finding street parking near to restaurants.

Our room was away from the street. I selected such a room on their website, and got what I asked for. The room was small, but workable. The view was non-existent, but the room was quiet. TV reception was poor. Our room was clean, even by my wife's very high standards. The staff were very helpful to us, day or night. The Stanyan does not have the amenities of fancier places, but I attribute the somewhat high cost to the location. Their contracted limo back to the airport costs no more than a cab and is highly recommended. From our perspective, the only true negative was the quality of the breakfast, which included trans-fat-laden muffins and other low-quality items. I can easily imagine that a park view room would be very noisy, so if you value your sleep, follow our lead and pick a room off the street.", "Date": "Aug 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR761136758", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jw_slc"}, {"Content": "Be sure to double, triple check any special requests Needed to be close to UCSF Childrens Hospital-Our child was having a procedure.

We were visiting San Francisco for a music festival held in the park so the location was perfect. The high ceilings and crown moldings throughout the hotel were charming.

Although if one had to stay several days, this would be the way to do it.  We were surprised by the large dining room and living room. There was a comfy queen-sized bed in one room and two twins in the other. There was also a sofa sleeper which some friends were forced to use when another near by hotel canceled their reservation due to a late arrival (whoever heard of this?).

I actually found it quite depressing and reminded me of too many faded British seaside hotels.We had a room that was internal so we had one very small window in the bedroom that looked out onto an internal shaft (I think it was room 103?) and the window in the bathroom (which was huge and lovely by the way!) looked directly into the room next door and we could hear everything they were saying. I have to say that their room looked a lot better than ours with a lovely big window and lots of space.

This wasn't taken into account when they allocated us a room, we had a Park View room which meant that the room was on the front of the hotel over the lobby. Directly outside the hotel there is one of the major roads through Haight-Ashbury and there are traffic lights so you get lots of traffic stopping and starting. There is also a bar two doors away from the hotel. The hotel only has single glazing so you are really affected by all the noise outside. Oh yes and the next block is a MacDonalds and the associated car park - there is nothing between the hotel and the car park except a road. There seem to be two types of characters in the area directly around the hotel - those living rough in the park and surrounding area who we felt no threat from (despite appearances) - then there were those who were hanging out around MacDonalds who felt much more threatening although I have nothing to base that on beyond some comments from them when we were walking past. We asked the receptionist if we could change rooms after our first night and were told that it wasn't possible as we were staying for too many nights (6 more). It was too much hassle for her to rearrange anyone else's shorter stays to accomodate us - so you would really be wise to speak to someone before you come and agree a quiet room if you need one.No drinks facilities in the room beyond two glasses and an ice bucket.No curtain/blind on the obscured glass bathroom window. But actually the street light is bright enough to give you good lighting for most trips!So (after all that) the hotel was attractive from the outside, reception was nice, room was ok visually.

The parking is either street parking if you choose to leave your car out on the street or parking in the lot halfway down the block and across the street.

The 24 hour fee is $13.50 but they make you pay the hourly fee if you go in an out. The breakfast was very minimal offering items that appeared to be low quality.

We have family members who live in San Francisco and we were able to have everyone over to visit us, something we never would have done in a regular hotel room or even most hotel suites. We quickly learned where the good coffee houses were, the best running and walking routes in Golden Gate Park, and how easy it was to get anywhere by walking a couple of blocks and taking the N Judah streetcar downtown. The girls loved the shopping on Haight St. and the freedom to hang out there on their own. Although there are plenty of homeless people right on Haight St. and at the entrance to Golden Gate Park, we never felt unsafe. The staff at the front desk were extremely helpful and pleasant.

It's in or borders on the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of 1960s counterculture fame. That shouldn't dissuade older, more conservative folks like me, though. The neighborhood is safe, and the hotel's door is locked at 9 p.m. for better security (and you have to use your room key to get in).

However, during the day, when I came back to the hotel for a few hours, I was able to find on-street parking on the surrounding blocks. The hotel itself consists of a lobby and breakfast/tea room and two floors of rooms. My room was on the street side and there was some noise late at night from people leaving a nearby bar.

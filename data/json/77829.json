I was confident in staying here based on previous recommendations and I am here to say that my experience was great. The location is perfect in many ways. It is within walking distance of the Los Angeles Union Station. It is across the street from the locally famous Philippe restaurant and one block from the bus lines. Around the corner is Olvera Street, a short, one-block street that is home to authentic Mexican history and street vendors. The hotel lobby was clean and the staff was professional and friendly. They voluntarily upgraded my room to a large suite with a separate kitchen area with microwave and refrigerator. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the linens were nice. It is an older hotel so expect furnishings to be comparable. They offer a continental breakfast, which I cannot comment on, only because I wished to dine at Philippe. Overall, I got a great value and would stay here again. I searched other hotels in the immediate vicinity; none were close to my travel budget nor had the great location.

My room was large and decently featured. It had plenty of light in the daytime and was quite dark at night. It looked out on a curious feature of the property--a kind of low intensity strip mall at the back of the hotel's second floor. My room was near a bend in the building, so it was important to keep the curtain closed when I wanted privacy. The neighborhood is very busy during the daytime, but there was no noise at night. The bathroom was huge, though it didn't have any heat source and could be rather cold, at least until it got steamed up. For some reason the bathroom door wouldn't stay open, even when I wanted it to. The bathtub also didn't hold water, it drained out slowly, so I had to take showers. The only major facilities problem was that the internet in the building was not working for much of the time I was there. It didn't matter that much, except that it prevented me from printing out a boarding pass in a timely fashion. A minor problem was that the chain had slipped on the door and didn't work, though there was a deadbolt. As someone who advocates car-free traveler, I have to give the Metro Plaza props--it is the only hotel in Los Angeles I have ever seen with the Metro transit system posted in the lobby. Of course, being a block from Union Station, it is right at the heart of that system with numerous trains and buses available. There's the non-stop Flyaway bus from Union Station to LAX airport. The Metro Plaza is really a good choice for a car-free traveler who's looking for a budget (by LA standards) hotel. The Famima quality convenience store in Union Station stays open 24 hours a day, so you need never starve! Otherwise the neighborhood gets pretty quiet at night, though not dangerous (you are likely to see some homeless people sleeping on the street). I only ate one meal nearby--at Nick's Diner on the edge of Chinatown. I've eaten at Phillipe's, a few doors down and at Homegirl Cafe a couple of blocks away, which is part of a re-entry program for gang kinds. There are also lots of daytime/early evening eateries in Chinatown, which the hotel is adjacent to. One of these years I'll eat at the beautiful Traxx restaurant in Union Station.

Actually we arrived one day earlier and instead of looking for a best western or a something inn, we decided to ask if we could extend our stay in the hotel. The guy at the reception was really friendly and could even arrange that we could get 2 rooms next to each other which where the same ones as for the already booked nights. So we had not to check out at 11am and wait till 3pm to re-check in into other rooms. In addition he gave us immediately a lot of info about the city and where to go. The rooms had two queens, TV, AC, refrigerator andeach one its own bath room, so nothing to complain. In the lobby you can take free coffee 24h a day, so if you like me don't need any breakfast except a cup of hot coffee you could even sleep longer than the breakfast time which ended at 9am i think. The breakfast itself is quick small, so it has coffee, tea and some juices and to eat mainly toast bread and marmalade and beagles. We decided to take this hotel beside its economical prices mainly because it is just a few steps from the union station away, from which each part of the city is reachable, even if the metro system in LA is quite difficult to understand. At the end I would say that our main focus in these days was around the hollywood bvld so it would have been better to take a hotel in that zone, however there are a lot of interesting places even reachable by walking directly from the hotel (chinatown, little tokyo, toy district, downtown) and some of the far away destinations like Santa Monica beach, which is definitly a must see in LA, depart only from the union station (big blue bus) Fazit: The only reason for not choosing this hotel if you are looking for a cheap stay would be to stay nearer to hollywood which makes you independent from the metro which stops working at 1 or 2 am, and by the way it takes quite a long time from hollywood to downtown using the metro. that's it basically.

This place fit the bill nicely. It was a 5 min walk with suitcases door to door. The Subway sandwich shop opened really early in the morning so you can pick up your lunch on the way to the station. Breakfast starts at 6:30 at the Metro Plaza, so that was perfect. Another budget hotel in the area did not serve breakfast that early so that is something to consider if you are taking a train. The room was very small and dark. But hey, it was only for a night. The bathroom, however, was very large. The internet did not work when we tried it, but I am sure that had we taken the laptop to the front desk, they could have straightened us out. We really did not need it for that one night. The breakfast room had a suitable number of tables. The continental breakfast was basically two cereals (and when did you ever see CocoPuffs as one of the two choices?), juice and white toast and fruit. I have two main complaints about the hotel. One, our room overlooked a restaurant (I think) that starts revving up at 5:30 am. The sound was like a garbage truck making it's collections,except it never ended. Now, this did not bother us as we were getting up then for our early train. But had we been planning to sleep in, we would have been concerned and probably asking for another room. Our other complaint was the parking. I pulled up to the hotel and wanted to park in the garage for a few hours till it was time to take the rental car back. But the young lad would not let me into the garage as they were renting out the spaces for the Cinco de Mayo festival which was being held in the park next door. There was also no place to stop in front of the hotel to unload luggage either. I was in a real dilemma as I was alone at the time (my husband was coming in on the train) and did not know what to do. After a few times around the block, I found a parking lot that would let me \"rent\" a space for 5 minutes while I dropped our luggage. The front desk insisted that there was room in the garage and I could park there, but obviously they were not telling that to the parking attendants as I made it clear I was a guest and I was still denied admission. But I was able to drop off my suitcases and then change my plans and take the car back to the car rental place early, just to get rid of it since the hotel had no space. But I think if I were to stay here another time,with a car, I would call the hotel first and ask if there were any special events in the area planned for my stay.

About half the price of the nearby Kyoto Grand. I paid about $80 a night mid-week. The rooms are clean but aging and in need of a makeover. At least they seem to do a good job with housekeeping, much more now as the Metro Grand than when it was a Days Inn. The walls are also fairly thick and soundproofing is decent. It is mostly quiet at night. Most rooms have connecting doors which I normally don't like, but the doors are thick, solid oak doors that don't let in noise from next door. I had a few problems connecting to the internet but the front desk staff was friendly and helped me correct the problem. The downsides are the area is kind of shady, especially at night. In their defense, so is most of downtown LA. I've been approached by beggars outside the hotel on all three trips over the last five years, but none appeared overly threatening or violent. The architecture is kind of weird also, as hotel is located in a type of strip mall. Their are walkways outside the 3rd floor windows, so you don't feel safe unless you keep your windows locked, and the stairwell doors on the third floor were propped open on my latest visit. Don't know for sure but it gives the impression that some of the homeless from outside could just wander in if they wanted to.

I checked in late on a Sunday night for 3 nights. Check-in was smooth, and I was assigned the same room type as I had requested, a nonsmoking room with a king bed. A few weeks before I arrived in LA, I sent an e-mail to front office manager listed on Metro Plaza's website. The site said to e-mail that manager if you had any special requests or questions. I had some of both, but I never received an e-mail back. That was disappointing. As a former front office manager myself, that somewhat irritated me, but because it is a value hotel, I don't expect personalized service. Regardless, I had room 331. The view was a rooftop, but I didn't mind. It was a quiet room, and I never heard anybody else in the hotel. The room size was appropriate, and beds, though not new and fancy, were comfortable and the linen was clean. The TV was a bit on the smaller side, and the reception was iffy on many of the channels. I would say there were only a handful of English channels, possibly 10 or 12 tops. The minifridge in the room was quite large, and was clean. The bathroom was appropriately refreshed every day, with my towels being replaced even though I had hung them up to dry. The bathroom was quite large, and looked much like the photos other people have posted. Parking was convenient, and I parked outside in the lot, instead of in the garage. I believe it only cost $4.00, which is incredibly reasonable. I went down to the desk the night before check-out to see if I would be able to get a late check-out. The man was quite incredulous that I asked to check out at 2 PM, instead of the standard 12 PM, which I didn't appreciate. I nice apology and a \"no, unfortunately I cannot extend your check out\" would have sufficed. He was rather curt upon my request. Breakfast each morning was sufficient. Mid-quality muffins, bagels, english muffins, bananas, coffee and juice.

The desk staff is Asian, helpful, and eager to please (I was immediately given a tube of toothpaste as the TSA Nazis in Kansas City had confiscated mine). The building has a number of other commercial ventures on its first floor and is convenient to several Chinatown restaurants as well as Phillipe's, (a big favorite of mine and LA folks owing to the terrific French dipped roast beef sandwiches) and that little, touristy Mexican \"village\" rife with restaurants and gift shops. My room had two queen-sized beds, a mini-fridge (very important as I need to chill my insulin), a table with 2 chairs, a built-in desk with chair and a portable room safe on which I could mount my Bi-Pap machine. The maid had inexplicably left the drapes open during a heatwave (108 degrees when my plane landed) and it took the air conditioner almost 3 hours to adequately cool the room.

The neighborhood is lit up at night. Our room was spacious and clean. There is a bit of a language barrier with the staff, but not too bad. They were helpful and pleasant. The breakfast is basic, but has what you need (fresh bagals, cereals, juice and coffee.) We checked in a few hours before we were supposed to, and our room was clean and ready. We had a problem with our safe, and they sent someone up to look at it within 5 minutes. Most of the tv channels are in asian or spanish. Kind of a bummer if you want to watch tv.

The hotel is only 5 min away from union station and the flyaway bus service. In essence we agree with the previous review. The rooms are big and clean and the beds are comfortable, although the airco is making a lot of noise while not cutting the job (e.g. get the temp. down in the room). The location is good if you have your own car or do not mind a 5 min walk to union and taking the sub for 20 min to Hollywood. Now the bad stuff: First of all the staff is indeed really rude. Not even a smile when checking in and my girlfriend is claustrophobic and asked to use the stairs, but to do this you first have to take the elevator to the 3rd floor, walk back to the 2nd to open up the backdoor to let her in. The owner/manager was really disrespectful of this and actually yelling to her about it. So really do not expect any good service/hospitality from the chinese, they are just after your money. Secondly, the breakfast is a joke. Just some toast and bagels/muffins, a banana and some cereals, cheese and marmelade. On both mornings, cleaning staff were eating from the buffet as well and on both mornings they were vacuumcleaning the hallduring breakfast, which was very annoying. During this, the manager got into a loud argument with one of the arriving guests..... We would reccommend this hotel just for one or two nights because it is cheap and conveniently located from the airport and downtown/public transport.

Instead of arriving at 9pm, we arrived at 1:30am. The hotel is a 5-7 minute walk 2 blocks away from the main entrance of Union Station. It is located on a busy street, so even late at night we didn't feel unsafe or worried because there was plenty of light and a Chevron gas station was right next to the hotel (bright lights!). And with all of our luggage, the hotel's location was a lifesaver since the subway system was no longer running and we didn't feel like spending money on a taxi. - Location Bonus #2.. Cheap restaurants are less than one block away, including a Subway, multiple Chinese restaurants (with lunch specials for only $4 including rice and soup!), a BBQ joint ([--]), and the Original Phillipes, which is recommended by the Frommers guidebook. - Location Bonus #3.... you are one block away from Chinatown, and one morning we took a 90 minute walk around by following helpful markers that map out the route and provide detailed history about the area. It is also located across the street from Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument, which is a pedestrian-only street with vendors, restaurants, a church and a museum. All free too! - Location Bonus #4.... since we didn't rent a car, we bought Metro Bus Day passes that work on the lightrail/subway, the regular buses, and the DASH buses. If you want to forgo buying the bus pass, then for only 25 cents you can ride the DASH bus that will take you all the way to the heart of LA, and from there you can connect with other DASH buses. DASH buses are great because they are cheap and they run every 5-10 minutes on fixed routes. And with a stop so close to the hotel, you can't go wrong with relying on the DASH. - Amenities. There is an on-site parking garage for people that have a car. I think that the rate is maybe $8 a day? Can't be sure though, just call them. The continental breakfast was an added surprise, fresh and sufficient. You have 2 types of cereal, milk, coffee, tea, apple juice, orange juice, donut bars, bananas, bagels, english muffins, jams/jellies, cream cheese. No waffles or anything hot like that, but it did a good job of holding us over until the late morning and the nice thing is that it runs from 6:30AM-10:00AM. The 2nd floor of the hotel has a fitness room that wasn't too small and looked fine. There is also free cold/hot water dispensers located next the elevators on each floor, so it was great to fill up your water bottle before heading off. Check out was 12pm. -Accommodations/Price--totally fine. Nothing fancy. It was clean, there's a few cable channels but no premium channels like HBO or Showtime. The room came with a small fridge and toiletries like soap and shampoo. Real hangers in the closet. Nothing much else, it was perfect for our 2 nights and at only $75, it just can't be beat. I saw a sign that at the front that also offers 10% off to AAA members, so if you have your card, Show It! Didn't have much interaction with the staff. We were checked in quickly at 1:40am in the morning. Check out was quick. They do take your credit card at the beginning of your stay and put a hold of like $50 or something. One last thing is that they have racks of tourist brochures, including $8 off Knott's Berry Farm. Plus maps for the LA Fashion District, Hollywood, Santa Monica and more. The front desk also has walking tour maps of Chinatown and information for catching the bus to Santa Monica. This was a good visit and I would not hesitate one bit to stay here on my next visit to LA, especially if I don't have a car to get around.", "Date": "April 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cClean Room, but some Unfriendly Staff\u201d", "Author": "Garrance", "ReviewID": "UR6230937", "Content": "Two issues: Cleanliness & Customer Service. Cleanliness: My room was clean, and that is very important to me. The lobby area was also clean, but a bit drab.... it would serve them well to spruce it up a bit., and make it more cheerful. The elevator, however, had a stale odor, which I told the staff about. Customer Service: The woman at the front desk, who mainly works mornings, was cold, unfriendly, and unhelpful; in a nutshell, very unpleasant to deal with. On one occasion, I asked if she had a cup, so I could make tea, and she barked at me that there were cups in my room. I told her those cups were for cold beverages only, and wouldn't work well for hot water. Besides, I was running late to meet a friend, and didn't feel like going back up to my room for a cold beverage cup, especially when they had a restaurant in the hotel, and it would have been easy for her to allow me to get a cup from there, or get one for me. Instead, she gave me a dirty look, then went into the back room behind the front desk and got me a Styrofoam cup, which was dusty, and didn't look fresh. I had to rinse it off. I couldn't understand why she was so unaccomadating and miserable. On another occasion, when I was using their computer down in the lobby, I asked her if there was an outlet so I could charge my cell phone, and, with an obnoxious tone in her voice, she frowned at me and said: \"there are outlets in your room, why don't you charge it there\". So, I told her since I wanted to use the computer, it would be more convenient to charge it in the lobby while I was on the computer.. and also because I was expecting an important phone call. She gave me a dirty look and just pointed to an outlet near the computer. I could not believe how disrespectfully she treated me, it was unbelievable. So to summarize, she should not be working in the hospitality/hotel industry, because she has no clue what Customer Service is and has NO people skills whatsoever. Additional Comment: On a positive note, the night front desk clerk, who worked from 10 PM to 6 am, was a very nice man, very helpful, and friendly.

Then there is the car parking expense even if you are an overnight guest: $4 per night and $5 per day in advance if you park your car during your trip. We got lost trying to find the hotel in downtown LA and ended up touring Skid Row. Calling the hotel for help was a joke. They were giving me wrong directions in broken English. This hotel is right in Chinatown. I was not prepared for the culture shock. Then, although the room was old but clean, the air conditioning unit was not working. When they sent the owner up, he sat silently looking at it and replied after a few minutes that the hot roof had made the large room hot and that it would take awhile...the room never did cool completely and we sweated out the night. Upon the eve of our return while still onboard, I realized that Amtrak was running 11 hours late and would not arrive in time to check into this hotel. So I called the hotel directly and was treated very disrespectfully by the hotel owner's wife. She said \"too bad\", I made the reservation and did not call 24 hrs in advance to cancel.

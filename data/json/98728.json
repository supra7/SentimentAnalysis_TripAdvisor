I stayed at the Westin Galleria Hotel in Dallas 20+ days over a four week period to find it to be average. The location is perfect for the mall, and number of restaurants in the area but the hotel does not jump out or provide anything to make the stay special. The rooms are dated with older furnishings in some rooms that show many years of wear. The highway side of the hotel provides a dull roar of traffic 24-7 but the back side overlooking the mall is much better. There are two restaurants in the hotel; one that is part of the hotel and the other is leasing space. Both of the restaurants are overpriced for the food quality and quantity received. For the money, Del Frisco's Steak House is much better quality food in a better atmosphere. Some of my frustration with the hotel is with the staff that did not appear to be knowledgeable about the hotel, how to handle any special requests, and how to extend the check out date on your stay. On my second trip to the hotel, I requested a room away from the highway, as the sleepless week before was not good, only to be given a room facing the highway that had been smoked in without proper cleaning. That same trip I requested information about a promotion that SPG was providing only to find that 3 out of the 4 people at the front desk did not know anything about the promotion and made no attempt to find out any information. On my third trip, I needed to stay over the weekend and an extra week and called down to make the arrangement which were to be taken care of but the end of the first week I received my bill under the door which is typical on you last day only to find the staff had not made the changes and were expecting me to leave per my first reservation. The issues with the staff lie with the management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responsibility to properly train the staff before allowing them to interact with customers. The second issue I have with the Westin Galleria is the lack of services provided and the excessive fees for any service that is provided. There was a $12 fee for the delivery of a UPS package to my room (in which I tipped the delivery person $5 not knowing I was being charged $12 for the delivery), and $2 charge for a call to SPG to ask about a promotion at the hotel. If you are in Dallas for shopping at the Galleria, the hotel is in the perfect location and the euphoria of shopping may help overcome the short-comings of the hotel and staff.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, OH", "Title": "\u201cGreat Dallas Hotel - North of City\u201d", "Author": "carrotop", "ReviewID": "UR126127311", "Content": "Unique location - attached to large mall.

As hotels are a public place, there are certain cautions that one might expect to take in general - like using a Clorox wipe on the remote control or not walking around in the bathroom with bare feet, for instance. What is NOT expected, is to find semen stains dotting and dripping down the headboard, which was the case in our room. Of course, this left me feeling quite uneasy and not really able to relax and \"enjoy\" my stay. A little more attention by the housekeeping staff would be appreciated, as these stains weren't exactly invisible. Anybody paying any attention at all would have noticed, and thus should have been cleaned accordingly.

Its right next to the Corner Bakery, Grand Luxe Cafe (Upscale CheeseFactory owned by the same) and Starbucks in the mall for a quick bite or coffee.

There are a few surface level spaces available outside the front of the hotel which are convenient and free. The hotel also offers valet parking for $15/day. The alternative for self-parking when the few spaces in the front of the hotel are occupied (which was often the case in the evening) is to use the underground mall parking. These spaces do not have direct access to the hotel which seems odd and requires that you exit through a dimly lit stairwell which exits at the side of the hotel. Then you need to walk through an area the staff of the hotel and mall use as a smoking area.

The thermostat in the room did not work properly and there was quite a bit of noise from the road. We requested a fan, which was quickly provided, and it helped drown out the road noise. The bathroom did not contain a vent, so it became very muggy and hot when taking a shower. The room was a little smaller than I had expected.

We asked for a fridge in the room and it was delivered in less than 10 minutes, same for the bathrobes on a later time.

Its hard to find parking right in front of the hotel but i got lucky on both days, but had to park in the purple garage in some occasions when coming back from our other trips outside the mall. If you are not on a budget and planning to visit the galleria anyway, this would be a good hotel for you. Or just in town and need a central location this is a good hotel too, its right beside the dallas tollway and 635. If i have to complain about 1 thing, its the AC.

It kept the room cool, but i wonder what it would be like when it was 100 degrees outside like 2 months ago. Looks like AC was not part of the renovation it got.

The rooms are nice and comfortable, if not overly spacious, and the furniture is pretty new and in good condition. The Heavenly bed used by the Westin chain, of course, lives up to its name. I ate in the \"casual\" hotel restaurant one day and thought the food was pretty good and in the \"fancy\" hotel restaurant (Oceanaire), the food is simply awesome. Of course, you have plenty of food options in the Galleria mall itself. For business travelers in that part of Dallas, something to consider between this hotel and Le Meridien across the street is that the Westin has a taxi stand and Le Meridien does not. So if you don't want to rent a car and you want to quickly get a taxi ride whenever you want, the Westin is a much better bet.

The bathroom was large and clean as well. One complain however. While taking a shower, it kept getting cold despite my efforts to the contrary. I discovered that the shower handle had a slight design defect. In order to have the perfect water temperature, one would have to place the rather heavy handle in the horizontal position. Well, the handle had not been tightened down when it was installed, thus it kept sliding down. As it would slide down, it would change the water temperature from perfect to polar ice cold. I pulled a MacGyver and fashioned a knot with a towel around the handle to keep it in place. I immediately called the front desk and notified them regarding the issue. Well, it was never resolved. I would have given this hotel a 5 star rating, if it weren't for that. For those who are shopaholics, you'll be in heaven. The hotel is attached to the Galleria Dallas which makes it very convenient for those diehard mallies. Most stores and restaurants are upscale, but you'll enjoy the scenery regardless of your financial status.

The front desk family placed us on the Executive 20th Club floor and welcomed us with open arms.

Sleek and beautiful with HD televisions, room for relaxing in the living area and the Heavenly Bath, well, just that . . . Heavenly! If that were not enough, the Executive Club lounge an ideal space in which to decompress serving evening beverages including wine and beer and hors d'oeuvres. A short walk over to the Galleria to graze followed as it was so convenient. The following morning prior to leaving for the Arkansas turnaround trip, we once again stopped in at the Executive Club lounge for a continental breakfast which includes beautiful display of freshly cut fruits, bagels, yogurt, scrambled eggs and oatmeal with all the fixin's. Starbucks coffee and fresh juice were drawn for you by the concierge, Ljiljana, a STAR in our day, and placed on your table.

The American Girl package is an additional cost and my 5 year old was very excited for the this weekend. Check in was very fast and the staff friendly. The room was nice but not quite what I was expecting after seeing newly renovated on the web site. Upon check in I was informed the American Girl package would be delivered between 5pm and 7 pm. We purposely stayed out of the room so upon our return our 5 year old would be excited the see what had been delivered. We returned to the room at 7:30 pm and nothing had been delivered to the room. Needless to say I was upset and my daughter very sad. I called to Express Serice and was told the people making deliveries were backed up and it would be there in 20 minutes. While I was not happy that nothing was in the room, I was willing to allow more time even though being in the room when it is delivered is not quite as exciting. 30 mintues later, nothing, so I called again. This time I was told it would be 2 mintues. Yes, 2 minutes. Well, 4 minutes later nothing, so I went downstairs. At his point I was very angry and made it well known on the phone. When I went downstairs I began explaining what was going on to a person at the front desk. Before I got 10 words out, the person told me to relax in a smart [---] way. This did not make things any better. Finally, the on duty manager spoke with me and informed me everything was on the way and we would have a discounted rate for the 2 nights. While, I appreciate the fact the manager was willing to make this concession, it did not make up for the fact I had a very disappointed 5 year old in the room. The hotel failed to deliver the package on time as well as make it an experience for the child. When I returned to the room, all was there and we were ready to settle. Went to get the coffee ready for the morning and a packet had been used by the previous guest with the open package in the cabinet and the packet of coffee still in the maker. Called to get more coffee around 8:45 pm and nothing was ever delivered. My wife went the club upstairs to fix coffee and was talking to a staff member about the coffee maker. The staff member called the front desk and within minutes someone had called the room. Front desk apologized and sent fresh coffee to the room. However, when delivered we were going to be charged $6.95!! All we wanted was a packet. Luckily the room service attendant put it on the house. The room was nice but nothing to get excited about. The bathroom was like a sauna and would get very hot with the lights on. No ventilation in the bathroom at all. In addition, the hotel wants you to reuse the towels, but hardly anywhere to hang towels. Luckily I travel with a fan and this made the use of the bathroom tolerable. Overall the hotel was very nice.

Our kids loved sitting, reading and drawing on the built in bench with cushions by the window. Nice LG Flat screen and typical lovely Westin beds/bedding. Our bathroom did not have one of the newly renovated full-size showers with frameless glass door, but rather a standard tub-shower combo. Because our kids take baths, this did not matter. Maid service, turn-down requests, bellman requests were all prompt. We had access to the spectacular concierge lounge on the 21st floor: great continental breakfast with smoked salmon and Starbucks and nice evening appetizer presentations (two hot foods such as eggrolls, chicken fingers, cheese selection and beer/wine). The women who worked in the 21st floor lounge were exceptionally helpful and gracious and especially kind to our children. Sometimes it's not worth upgrading to a club level but here it was definitely worth the price. The gym was exceptional with all top-of-the line Lifecycle Fitness equipment and machines. The connection to the Galleria mall was perfect for our kids and keeping them occupied with diversions to the ice rink, shopping, etc. The few issues we had were as follows: (1) the $10 charge for WIFI per day was absurd at a hotel of this caliber. Is Westin really making that much money on this charge to leave customers feeling nickel and dimed on what is an essential service to the modern traveler? Especially for SPG members or those paying extra for club level access, it's time to bag this silly incidental. (2) the pool area was lovely with great cabanas and nice fluffy towels. However, as echoed by previous comments, the water was unheated and nearly unswimmable. A little heating would go a long way. One other minor point: I had a great meal at the Second Floor restaurant but the service during the day was mediocre: it took almost an hour to get a sandwich and a bowl of soup.

We had always wanted to stay at the Westin Galleria, but always stayed at less expensive hotels. We were celebrating a birthday and decided to stay at the Westin for the convenience of the location and proximity of the Galleria. We are in the market for a new mattress at home, and wanted to try out the Westin Heavenly Bed, as it is now sold to individuals for their homes. Upon arrival, we were greeted by no self-parking available in the surface lot and were offered $24 nightly valet parking or directed to a parking garage of the shopping center. When we found a parking place, we came up out of ground quite a distance from the hotel entrance. As we chose to self park, we accepted this inconvenience as our choice. When we opened the door to our room, we were met by a less than impressive appearance to our hotel room. The property had recently undergone a renovation, so we expected a warm, welcome environment. Instead, we were met with a bleak, half-empty, gray, dark hotel room. The carpeting and seating reminded us of the seating area at the airport gate. The back half of the room, approx 14x10 feet was completely empty, no furniture, just two very small chairs and a lamp. What happened to the furniture? The desk, nightstands, and headboard were contemporary formica laminated furniture. There were a couple of small pictures in the room, and it seems they were black and white too. Well, we didn't plan to spend much time in our rooms, so esthetics weren't as important. It did remind us of our single days staying in Motel 6 and it's lack of esthetics. Contemporary design can be relaxing, as is the Grand Hyatt at DFW. We love staying there before an early flight, but the Westin can learn a lot about decor from the Grand Hyatt. No comparison, Hyatt wins hands down. We looked forward to a good nights' sleep, away from the stress of home and the kids. We both slept very little and woke up with back aches. The bed was far from heavenly. Our \"old\" bed at home was much more comfortable. We will definitely not be purchasing a Heavenly Bed. Also, the bathroom was only supplied with 2 bath towels. My wife uses 2 towels herself, but we got by with the 2 supplied, didn't bother calling for more. We had already requested a mini-fridge to store some medication (the in-room fridge is electronically wired to your account---you can't touch or remove anything without being charged). We had planned to stay two nights, but phoned the front desk with our complaints of the bed. We weren't offered a different room, but were told we would not be charge an early departure fee. We checked out and went to Embassy Suites at Frisco. Had an excellent night's sleep there. I normally don't write reviews, but felt our less than pleasant stay should be reflected.

Awesome! Or so I thought.... We arrived Friday for check in and to my surprise, we had been moved from the 18th floor city view room that I had arranged...flowers had already be delivered to the room. YIKES! While discussing this with the front desk person with my wife standing there, he discreetly told me that he would find me another room and asked us to wait over in the sitting area and he would bring us the key. As we were turning to go wait, I heard him tell a bell-hop to go to the room and get the flowers and move them to the new room. Shortly after that, he brought us the key to room 1907 on the Executive Club level. And he gave us access to the Executive Club for breakfast on the 21st floor! Wow! When we arrived to the room, it was far away from the elevator, it was quiet, it had a great city view and it had a built-in window seat that I had asked for. AND the huge flower bouquet had been re-delivered to our new room from the previous room that we were supposed to be in! Clearly, the Westin Galleria staff knows what customer service is really about...it's about ME the customer. The check-in process went very smoothly. The valet parking, albeit a bit pricey, went smoothly. The Continental Breakfast was typical, but satisfying. The only complaint I have was that they recently put new TV's in all the rooms and since then the A/V inputs have been disabled so watching anniversary movies were scratched from our plans. :( We had a nice relaxing stay at the Westin Galleria and would recommend this location to any that are staying in the Dallas area.

My wife and were pleasantly surprised to find our 18th floor King sized room to be nicely decorated and very clean. Upon first entering the room the scent of aroma therapy was evident, which catered warmly to the senses. It has somewhat of a contemporary, European flair, but we like that kind of stuff. It should be noted that floors 15 thru 18 are for Starwood preferred guests, of which I am not, however, we were provided this room anyway...maybe because it was the weekend. (not sure if the non-Starwood preferred rooms are comparably equipped). The all white bed linens are of high quality and very comfortable and appeared almost brand new. There was a 32 inch lcd TV and a nice sized desk and high tech mesh chair for laptop work, if necessary. Two additional contemporary chairs offer the ability to read or just relax. The only \"downside\", and I don't really want to use that word, was that we were facing East, which gave us a \"view\" of the roof of the Galleria Mall. You only saw it though, if you were standing directly in front of the window and looked down. Otherwise from the bed or chair, we had clear view of eastern horizon. One review was correct in that the fridge was not meant to store your own goods, but rather there in the event you need a quick fix. Along the same wall is a nice built-in cabinet with plenty of drawers for clothes as well as a safe. The bathroom does not have a tub, however, the walk-in shower is very nicely decorated with subway type tiles and the bathroom counter is granite or limestone, I believe. Both were very clean I must say. If a tub is a necessity, then this will not work, but I'm of the opinion that showers are a bit more sanitary, for what it's worth. I read reviews that complained about the parking and the non-free internet access. I don't like being \"forced\" into valet parking and was able to avoid it by finding parking directly in front of the hotel. Being that we returned to the hotel after 11pm each night, we didn't seem to have a problem finding a spot. In fact, there were several each night. I guess if it were earlier in the evening, the Galleria Mall parking lot would have been an alternative, albeit a little less convenient. Personally, I'll walk the extra few feet to save $24! In regards to internet access, another \"trick\" I discovered, was to simply go into the mall and use the free wi-fi at either the 'Corner Bakery' or at 'Starbucks'. They are both located literally as soon as you enter the mall from the 2nd floor hotel lobby. Instead of paying the $11.95 Westin access fee, you can sit and have breakfast and watch the kids ice skating in the Galleria skating rink. The wi-fi reception was excellent. I think the Westin should take a tip from the 'Bakery' and 'Starbucks' and just offer the service for free!! Overall we had a very enjoyable experience at the Westin and would gladly stay there again. We thought about the Hotel Zaza and the Crown Plaza, but at $300+ each, respectively, we saved enough money to go and have dinner there instead. Unless there is a need to stay in very close proximity to downtown Dallas, I have no problem recommending a stay at the Westin Galleria.", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cToo many errors\u201d", "Author": "mille125", "ReviewID": "UR36754319", "Content": "I stayed here for one night with my family.

The Good: 1) We asked for a connecting room since I was travelling with three children under the age of five.

The Bad 1) As another guest commented, the room keys continually malfunctioned. 2) My wife and I ordered room service and asked for our burgers to be cooked \"medium well\". Both came to the room cooked no better the rare (almost raw). It was quite disgusting. 3) All of our kids were sleeping in our connecting room. The hotel room service decided to call into this room at 11 PM even though the front desk had instructions to not ring the phone in this room.

If my review seems a bit too flattering you can put it off to that, lol. We live about 11/2 hours north of Dallas and I would not consider myself to be knowledgeable about highways in the city, but the Westin was very easy to get to. It is just off the LBJ Freeway at the intersection of the Dallas North Tollway. I booked a two night stay at this hotel through Priceline asking for a 4* in the Galleria area for my soon to be 8 year old daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday. We wanted a hotel close to this particular mall, the Galleria, because of its proximity to the Holy Land of 8 year old girls dreams, The American Girl doll store. The Westin is not close to the mall, it is ATTACHED to the mall and about 50 yards from the American Girl store. My daughter was in Nirvana as we drove up and she realized this. The hotel offers valet parking ($18 + tax), but there is no dedicated parking solely for hotel guests so I opted for the free self-parking in the area next to the hotel as there were several open spaces. (Saturday when we came back from the Science Place, there were no longer any spaces there, but there is plenty of free parking in the underground garages. Park in the purple one as close as you can to the yellow tunnel and you will walk up the steps and come out right next to the hotel). Walking in to the lobby you hit a wall of a/c that is very welcome in Texas in the summer, but the front desk is set off to the left side and if you continue walking you are in the mall. A bit strange to me as I expect 4* hotels to have grand lobbies. Check-in was fast (on our drive down we called and asked if early check-in was available and they accommodated us at 11 am!) efficient and friendly. The front desk clerk, I wish I had gotten his name, was super friendly and he gave my daughter a bag with Westin Kids Club stuff. I did not know anything about this and would not have expected it having booked on Priceline, so we felt very important and welcomed as though we were high level members of the hotel reward club. We were booked into room 1301, yes they have a 13th floor, and so off we went to see our room. The room is spacious with a window seat that is 8 feet in length and padded overlooking the pool and Dallas skyline with a retractable mesh window shade for filtering outside light and privacy curtains to block all light. The bed is king sized with a lovely teak looking headboard with attached nightstands. The mattress is supremely comfortable and the bed is triple sheeted with linens that are on par with the 600 tc sheets at my own home. There are 4 pillows on the bed and an extra in the closet and our request for two more, and two terry cloth bathrobes, was met promptly. There is a built in armoire that contains drawers for clothing, the coffee maker-with Starbucks!, a safe and the mini-bar (no liquor-but water is $6). The desk area is built into the wall and has a modular rolling chair. A 35\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd flat panel TV is on top of it directly across from the bed. There are two more chairs and one leather ottoman. The closet is large with plenty of hangers and contains an iron and ironing board. A full length mirror is next to it. The room has a distinct \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Asian\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd feel to it. Very streamlined and modern and the cleanliness level is immaculate. The bathroom is somewhat small considering how large the room is, but is quite nice. Granite vanity, HUGE glass enclosed shower with two shower heads (no bathtub) and nice sized White Tea scented shampoo, conditioner, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6The bathroom door is a sliding door of frosted glass that I found to be odd but my daughter loved. The towels are fluffy and plentiful. Now, onto the features outside of the room. The pool area, on the 4th floor, is lovely. There are many comfortable lounge chairs, sofas, and tables, but what we really loved are the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the pool with the table in the middle. There was only one other family when we first went swimming on Friday night and even Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning the pool was NEVER crowded. I was surprised at the coolness of the water temperature considering it was July in Texas, but it was better than the water being too hot. The workout gym, also on the 4th floor, is huge. They provide cold filtered water, towels and personal headphones. The equipment looked to be all new. There is a small gift shop on the same floor, but it is overpriced as all hotel gift shops are. I did not use them, but there is also a Fed Ex business center and a car rental office on the same floor. One other nice thing about the hotel is that they have the Dallas Morning News or the NY Times available at the front desk on the weekends for free. I appreciated having the paper to read over breakfast. BTW, the La Madeleine in the Galleria, it is on the bottom level next to the ice skating rink, has wonderful food. We ate breakfast there both days and bought several bags of their cookies to take with us for snacks. I can also recommend The Corner Bakery Caf\u00c3\u00a9 for lunch. Soups, salads and sandwiches on freshly baked bread. Inexpensive and tasty. We did not utilize the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurants, they did not look particularly appealing places to take a child, but are probably great for adults. All of the staff at this hotel were all extremely pleasant and helpful to my 7 year old daughter and myself.

Overall I have no complaints, but it's not where I would want to spend a vacation. Location is convenient off the tollway. And there is a wold class mall connected to the hotel. But the view is dead boring, flat and ugly. It overlooks the highway. The whole area outside the mall parking lot has nothing of interest. Our convention room rate was more reasonable that the $299 internet price. I would not stay here for $300 of my own money per night! And everything else about the hotel was way overpriced. $24/night for valet parking. $13/day for internet access. $4 for a minibar soft drink. $8 for a beer in the lounge. The good news is that it is convenient to the highway and its easy enough to drive to better restaurants, less expensive bars and much more interesting places. So my recommendation is sleep here if you can get a good price because it's clean, comfortable and convenient. But leave as much as possible to find things less expensive and more interesting.", "Date": "April 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tulsa, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel.

This was a last minute trip, so I was not able to book weeks in advance. All of the online rates started at $199/night. I booked the room online via hotwire.com on 3/24. I selected a 4 star hotel in the Galleria area and this was the one that I ended up purchasing. Of course, I did not know the name of the hotel until I made the non-refundable purchase, but I was okay with any 4 star hotel in the Galleria area for one night. The rate that I paid was $69.00 plus Hotwire.com's fee of approx. $16, brining my total to $85.00. At $85.00 this was a GREAT choice, but I would not pay more than $125 (at most) a night for this hotel. The hotel was definitely nice, but not sure if it is worth $199 a night.

This was our penultimate stay in a Starwood property before achieving Platinum status so please bear in mind when reading this review that I am very familiar with Starwood, and Westin in particular. We checked into our Preferred floor room and, as usual, my first impulse was to inspect the bathroom. I was dismayed to find, that though there was a very nice walk in shower, there was no bath tub. As a woman, and particularly when going to a dressy event, I like to soak in the tub with a glass of wine before getting ready. We called and changed rooms (to one on a regular floor), but in the process found out that there are no King rooms with tubs and very few doubles with tubs. As the bellman explained, all the tubs had been removed as part of the renovation. It is quite clear to me that no woman was involved in the redesign of the hotel and that the guest that is being catered to is a lone business MAN. Now, he may be the main client of this hotel, but we saw plenty of couples and families during our stay. I have always appreciated the classic Westin look: pale cream walls, white linens, dark wood, delicately coloured pictures and a slightly Japanese feel. The furniture in this hotel looks like high end IKEA. Not that I mind the Scandanavian look, but this was too stark, sharp edged and minimalist. The carpet is charcoal coloured, the walls beige, the pictures black and white and the soft furnishings muted rust red and dark aqua. There is no colour accent (the most colourful thing in the room is the cheap TV remote control). The room is completely washed out sepia toned: tasteful, but extremely depressing and unwelcoming. The bathrooms are small. Given the size of the rooms, they had ample space to work with to extend the bathrooms and include a walk in shower AND a tub. That shower was also designed by a man - it has room for a bench but doesn't have one. When will men get it that women need something to put their leg up on to shave? Another clue that the room was designed with single occupancy in mind is the bathroom door. It is attractive to be sure. It is made from translucent glass. So, when you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night you flood the entire room with light and disturb your sleeping partner. Form over function. The corridors and elevators are similarly decorated in washed out sepia tones. It looks like a suite of upmarket corporate suites, not a hotel. I am worried that this is the direction that all Westins are moving in. A couple of weeks ago I stayed at the Westin Market Street in San Francisco which also had a dismal corporate look (although not quite as extreme as this). We paid a special introductory internet rate of $99 so I cannot complain too much. If I was paying the regular rate which is about double, I would have been disappointed. If my husband had been by himself as the lone business man, he would have been find with it - although he said that more than a couple of nights would have got to him too. I appreciate that this is mainly about aesthetics which is a very personal thing, and if the aesthetics of this hotel appeal to you (and lack of bath tub), then there are no problems.", "Date": "December 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cLOVE IT!\u201d", "Author": "avillebud", "ReviewID": "UR21756078", "Content": "I stayed here over TX OU weekend 2008.

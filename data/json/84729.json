However if your just looking for a place to get your head down when your not busy at the many parks, than this is the place for you. The rooms are kept very clean by the maid service and they will work around you, so they will always come back later if your not quite ready for them. The pool is clean and not too crowded. Our room did need a little work as one of the sockets was hanging off the wall, but generally a pleasant place to be. The internet was pretty fast and its free! You do get a full sized fridge which is so handy. Our only real problem with the place was the bus that takes you to Disney from the hotel. It was always well too overcrowded (i mean packed in like sardines), do not use this bus if you have kids. It will take over an hour to reach Disney as it goes via all the other hotels. The return trip bus is also awful as there were always more people waiting than the bus could take, if you didnt make it on the first one than you had to wait an hour and a half for the next one. Because of this arguments between commuters and the bus drivers would happen, making an already unpleasant situation unbearable. I REPEAT DO NOT USE THIS SHUTTLE IF YOU HAVE KIDS!. On a brighter note there is a Steak N Shake right next to the hotel which do the best burgers in Orlando in our opinion. Walmart is also just across the road (so handy).

The pavement in the parking lot is all messed up, and the presentation is dirty. The rooms themselves are VERY old, furniture has a lot of chips and wear. The worst part was how dirty the carpet was. I could feel the dirt as I walked around barefoot, and my socks turned black after a few hours of walking around. Also, the curtains do a very poor job of blocking out light, which is a huge issue if you stay facing the courtyard, which has these intense orange lights on all night. The distance to the parks also makes this a bad value...US 192 is one of those roads where you will catch EVERY SINGLE TRAFFIC LIGHT.

You don't know anything about the lies that they are telling your guests? I let him know that it's not a good idea to tell people that they offer discounted tickets unless they tell them upfront what they have to sign up for a time share demo. I've purchased tickets from the Disney website on several occasions and I would have done it again if they had been honest about it in the first place.

We initially requested a room with a fridge/microwave as when booking it was not possible to specifically book this. However when checking back on the HOJO website nearer the time of arrival they had updated their website to make it explicit which rooms have a fridge and microwave and they were $5 more than what we had paid. When we checked in we were asked to pay the extra $5 to upgrade to a room with a fridge and microwave but we were expecting this and felt it was worth it due to having such a long stay. There is also a resort fee of $4.82 a night but they do clearly state this on the website so again we were prepared for this extra charge. Despite these \u2018extras\u2019 we still felt our room was good value at just under $40 a night after the resort fee and tax. Our room was on the ground floor and built for disabled guests so was larger than average. As well as the fridge and microwave there was also a tea and coffee maker with tea and coffee replenished daily. As well as a large bed, TV, wardrobe and dresser there was a table and chairs which was good when we had meals in the room. Overall we felt the room was homely which was perfect for our longer stay. The room was cleaned daily, and hotel staff all friendly and helpful, even letting me make a call to my bank in the UK when I lost a bank card during my stay. Being so close to Walmart and having a fridge and microwave in the room was a huge bonus for us as we saved us so much money being able to make our own breakfast/dinner. Plus we bought a cheap cool pack to take packed lunches/snacks/drinks to the parks each day which I would estimate saved us in excess of $200!! Some days we literally spent nothing in the parks - generally spending $10 on a drink or an ice cream and that was it! The Steak and Shake outside the hotel and Ciccis pizza buffet which is a 15 min walk were also great budget meals choices after a long day at the parks. To sum up: if you have a car then this hotel is great, if you are only going to use the shuttle bus for Disney this hotel is great, if you are going to use the shuttle bus for Universal and only have a 2 day park ticket perhaps look elsewhere (see shuttle bus explanation below). Shuttle bus info: This was the only negative to our stay as the commute to/from Disney/Universal was an hour journey and a limited service. Being the furthest hotel away from Disney and Universal means you are first on the shuttle run so despite getting picked up at 7.30am (the only morning pick up) you do not reach Disney until 8.30am (Epcot) as you go round at least 10 other hotels picking guests up. On the way back it leaves Magic Kingdom at 8.45pm or 10.15pm and again you are the last drop off! There was also a 12.30pm service to Epcot but we never used this. The Universal bus is scheduled to depart the hotel at 8.40am but as it uses the same bus as goes to Disney it NEVER picked us up until 9am so I don\u2019t know why the hotel doesn\u2019t just change the time to 9am pick up! We would typically arrive at Universal after 10am. The Univeral bus picks up from the park at 7.15pm and was generally on time. Using the shuttle we got to the Disney parks each day usually before the parks opening at 9am as there is very efficient Disney transport to all parks from Epcot which you could jump straight on. Plus there is the #56 Lynx bus which goes from US192 \u2013 right outside the hotel to Magic Kingdom and back from 4am \u2013 10.58pm which we generally used to come back from Disney if we didn\u2019t want to stay until 8.45pm. It was $2 a journey. You could use it to go to Disney if you wanted to get there earlier/later too. The Universal bus was not ideal if you only had a 2 day ticket there as I think you would struggle to do all you wanted to do in the parks in 1 or 2 days as the bus times would cut your day short by 3 hours of the park opening times. We didn\u2019t arrive until at least 10am and left at 7pm whereas the park opens at 9am and closes at 9pm. Taxis to/from Universal were $40 each way from the hotel and there is no easy bus commute. However, it would be worth checking the above times with the hotel before booking as there may be a better service during summer season as the hotel was operating the May schedule (despite it being June).", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Town Central, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cYou could do better in the area\u201d", "Author": "Neetlebug", "ReviewID": "UR113314799", "Content": "For the price we paid, we were happy with what we got, but we did get the impression we could have been in a more convenient location, especially to get to the parks.

The hotel has recently been renovated including bathrooms, mattresses etc. It is well kept and clean with both the housekeeping and maintenance staff right on top of things. Our room provided hair dryer, coffee maker, iron/ironing board, small fridge, microwave and in room safe (free). Also included was cable tv and free wifi. Guest laundry facilities are available.

This room was definitely worth $65 or more a night since it was so clean and new, but - as I said, we paid $29 a night. HOWEVER, they charge a \"resort fee\" of $4.50 PLUS TAX for EACH NIGHT. They also don't offer free breakfast, you have to pay for it, but you can eat at the hotel, which is nice. Walmart is right across the street, so you can purchase anything you might forgot at home without even using your car. the resort fee is for the shuttle service to the theme parks which we didn't use, in-room safe (which we didn't use), pool towel - THE POOL HAD NO WATER IN IT (but it was freezing cold out, so we wouldn't have gone swimming anyway) all in all: I paid only 35 bucks a night (including the resort fee) and I had a very clean, nicely decorated room with two double beds in it. So I am very pleased. I do want to mention, though, that I stayed at baymont inn last weekend (which is just a few hundred meters down the road) and there the price is the same but the rooms are A LOT bigger and all of them come with fridge and microwave and the beds are queen size, not full. So next time I might stay at baymont again. This weekend I didn't cause for some reason they were $50 a night. Last weekend they only wanted $32 a night.

(She paid $38 for a 4 night stay.) It's true you do get what you pay for. I didn't want to walk in this hotel based on how it looked from the outside. This hotel is way in the back sitting in a very trashy area. There is some sort of tool shed with trash, paint, wood, and plain out junk being used by the hotel. The elevators were so scary, I walked up and down the stairs with luggage in hand the entire time. Checking in was fast. We got into the room the carpet was dirty, the bathroom was plain out disgusting. The bathtub had a dirty ring around it, and there were strands of hair on top of the toilet. This room smelled so bad we asked to be switched to another room, which we were fast. In both rooms the decor was out dated. The room had a nice size T.V . The walls and doors of the hotel was paper thin. You could hear everything. During the night we heard loud children and adults running back and forth through the halls. Next door someone was playing extremely loud music for 5 minutes. I can't believe no one asked them to quiet down. The constant sounds of the heavy door slamming scared me to death. Someone's car alarm kept going on and off the out entire stay. It was a very unpleasant stay. One positive thing about this hotel was the computer access in the lobby.

Big TV, 45 channels We were recently in the other hotels in Orlando and paid like $70-80 for one night and they did not look better So we were happy being there and you cannot beat the price really.

At this time, we had a Club Lounge room and we could see the hotel was remodeled , but the staff still do an excellent job. From your arrival, the front desk people, the concierge and everybody that works there pamper you . If you need an information, they give you a complete map, explaining very well all the stuff you need. The breakfast was fair, with eggs, ham, cheeses, breads and muffins, coffee, tea and juices. Also they offer cereals and fresh fruits. You really don't need to have breakfast anywhere else. On the other hand, the happy hour - between 5;30 and 7;00 P.M. - is good if you don't drink alcohol. Soft drinks are free but you have to pay (and it's expensive) for any glass of wine or beer. As we can see, it's an unhappy hour.... But the appetizers were very good, mainly the shrimp appetizer.... Also to get the Port of Los Angeles you have to do a long trip - more than 50 minutes ! and if you call the Supershuttle, you have to go first to the Airport, and then, to the Port... The best thing is: you are almost facing the Universal Studios Hollywood! So, you can choose different things for dining and you don't need to have a ticket to go to Citywalk... If you like the rides, you can spend the whole day for fun... At Citywalk you can shop and dine, isn't lovely? The real problem we had at the hotel was with neighbors screaming, running and slamming doors at 1:30 A.M. I tried to knock the wall, asking for silence and they began knocking the wall like mad people.

Front desk staff very friendly but had a little trouble explaining just what the club floor rooms actually were - it was simple question but really seemed to stump the staff - was finally told the rooms were a little bigger than your standard room. Upon walking into my very small and a bit outdated room (espcially the bathroom), I felt sorry for those not staying on a club level as the room was very small so the non-club level rooms must be tiny. The television was smaller than any TV I have seen in the last three years in any hotel (travel a lot for business so I am out 1/2 of each month). The bathroom, as mentioned, could use an upgrade as well offering some new towels as the towels were very thin and frayed. To be honest, I have never stayed in a Sheraton and am comparing this to a Starwoods Westin so maybe this is not a fair comparison. After night one, thought about checking out and going up the hill the Hilton but then went to the fitness center. The fitness center is one of the best ones that I have been in a hotel outside a hotel giving you a pass to a local health club. The fitness center alone kept me at the hotel all 4 nights. Good to see that the Sheraton understands that business travellers do work out and like to have a wide variety of cardio and weights to choose from. Asked my business asscociate staying at the Hilton about their work out facilities (she is also an avid fitness person) and she was not impressed so I stayed put for the four days. The executive lounge is nothing to write home about. It is your standard lounge - did find it strange that they did not offer coffee or soda throughout the day but perhaps this is because this is more a family/tourist hotel versus a business hotel (?). Not sure I would stay here again on business.

Firstly, to get to the room, one has to go up some 4-5 steps or so- there are no elevators to go to this part of the hotel- not good if you have some heavy luggages. Upon entering the room, we noted the carpet was stained in several areas (see pic). We then realized the wood panel on the door frame to the toilet was almost falling off (see pic). We went back to reception to ask for a different room but was told there were no other rooms available that were equivalent to the price of the room we paid. We were offered a room without a balcony but there will be no refund or upgrades. The receptionist went to speak with his supervisor and came back with nothing except the reassurance that his supervisor will follow up with us; of course no one followed up during our 2 night stay! The parking is shabby not attached to the hotel, you have to walk across a lane to the hotel for $15/night and the parking elevator smelt of urine. Room comes with 3 towels- there were 4 of us (2 kids) and so we asked housekeeping for more towels- they were prompt and brought us 4 extra towels but unfortunately 3 out of 4 towels were heavily stained (see pics). It was disgusting, adding to our disappointment. The only good thing was it's location if you are going to Universal Studios. You will be within walking distance to US.

No problems with the Heat or A/C, and extra blankets were available if necessary.

The hotel is perfectly located, approximately 2 blocks from Universal City, which can easily be reached by Shuttle directly at the front door, walking down to the Metro/Universal Shuttle, taking the elevator up to the Hilton Hotel level and walking over, or, as we did, you can easily walk up the hill. We chose the Walk to get some exercise, and work off the extra pounds that one gains on vacation. The Hotel is also located close to Warner Bros Studios, The Hollywood Bowl, Mulhulland Drive, The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHollywood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sign, and Forest Lawn Cemetery ( Where a lot of the Movie Stars are interred.

We travelled on Hollywood Blvd, Santa Monica Blvd, Rodeo Drive, and shopped at Westfields in Century City, right beside Fox Studios, and were lucky enough to shop directly beside Movie Star, Amie Adams, in Bloomingales. The Santa Monica Pier is beautiful at night with all the lights. If you stay at The Sheraton Universal, either drive or walk over to Ventura Blvd, and try the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc IN-N-OUT BURGER\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The burgers are fantastic and inexpensive.

Valet service rocks, as they run to your car and are so nice and helpful. Location was perfect! We took an hour walk to Warner Brothers for a VIP tour (very fun experience) on a beautiful October day, enjoyed a great choice of restaurants on the walk there (recommend Paty's at Toluca Lakes) and walked through lovely residential areas. Took the free shuttle up the hill to CityWalk, did Universal's Halloween Haunt Night (get the Front of the Line pass), and walked back to hotel late at night. Did a USC game, while only 15 miles away, it did take an hour to get there, so have patience! On last day of trip, took a 20 minute drive (through West Hollywood) and went to eat brunch at the Marmalade Cafe at the Grove (outdoor shopping center and farmer's market) where they film Extra everyday. They were preparing for Halloween and Christmas in the same day. Very fun. Overall, great experience. We will return in a heartbeat next year. Great customer service, great room, and with so many fun activities/places to see surrounding the hotel, it's a win-win for a great vacation!", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Providence, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cGood location for visiting NBC Universal\u201d", "Author": "81FrequentT81", "ReviewID": "UR120813606", "Content": "I stayed here one night before meetings at NBC Universal.

Of course I was upset the only thing they did was offer me one cot free of charge which I accepted but the other adult slept on the couch. Over all the hotel is nice inside and clean, staff is nice.

I asked how much for the presidential suite they never provided me a price and I didn't get the other cot until 4 hours later I had to go back downstairs and ask for it.

They were very supportive of our previous problems at the Andaz, we paid for the buffet breakfast, we were put on the Sheraton 'Club Level' floor and given vouchers for free drinks on the club level floor as complimentary. The room was very clean and modern with two double beds, free internet, I pod docking station and complimentary starbucks coffee. We also had great views of the city, however there is no mini bar or fridge in the rooms. At the rear of the lobby there are several computers that give you free internet, there is a small store selling basics a very modern bar and a good size 24hour fitness centre on the basement level, which was always empty when we used it, and above all the staff were very friendly and approachable. The Restaurant serving breakfast, and dinner was very clean; we used the breakfast buffet for our six night stay. The choice was really good and varied which included scrambled, boiled and egg omelettes, bacon, sausage, hash browns, hot and cold cereals with bread and muffins, fruits, yogurts and a choice of pastries. Now the fun stuff!! Universal Studios and City Walk is literally on the door step, there is a free shuttle from the hotel that takes you to Universal studios, but you can walk it around five minutes. Universal City Station is a seven minute walk from the Hotel, which is on the red line that takes you directly to Hollywood/Highland (Hollywood Boulevard/Walk of Fame area) one stop in less than ten minutes. It costs $1.50 each way but a day pass was $5 which you can use on the buses and trains. We felt safe on the train when we travelled and that was at all times of the day. The last train being around 1.00am. As I said previously we stayed at this hotel for six nights, the staff were very pleasant, rooms clean and we used the public transport system to get around LA, this included getting public transport to see the dodgers play the Arizona diamondbacks.

We were one couple so the size of the room was acceptable and we didn't spend anytime in the room except when we wanted to shower or sleep. There is no minibar or fridge for standard room so if you are planning to buy stuff that needs a fridge think twice. We bought chips and biscuits for snacks. The parking is 18 US$ per day but you can go in and out as much as you like. So include that in your budget if you are renting a car. I would advice you to rent a car in LA as the taxis are bit pricey. Hotel lobby is very nice and clean, staff are friendly. The 45 minutes free internet at the lobby for guests are very useful and you can use printers to print boarding passes or tickets for free. We used to check tripadvisor for local attractions nearby and plan our day. There is internet in the room with a fee. Breakfast was around 22 US$ open buffet but limited, however you don't need more than scrambled eggs, bacon, pastries , french toast, fruit salad, hash browns to start your day.

We loved every second of it. The entire staff was excellent and really went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The maid said hello to us every morning and made small conversations. The concierge was great. He worked efficiently, but also provided each guest with the attention that they deserved. The people at the front desk were super friendly and helpful upon our arrival. The waiter during happy hour kept our snacks full and our drinks replenished. Our room was very comfortable and had everything that I would expect in a hotel room. Yeah, the bathroom was a little small, but I'd rather have space in the room than have the bathroom take up space. The view was also wonderful. We were on the 16th floor, so we got a nice view of the pool and of the surrounding scenery. I'm not sure what they do, but when you enter the lobby, it smells amazing. I loved breathing in when I walked in each time, as weird as that may sound. The location of the hotel was the best part. It is so close to Universal Studios and they offer a discount of 2 days for the price of 1. We took advantage of buying the tickets from the concierge, but didn't end up going the second day because we saw everything at the park (except for the Shrek 4D--we weren't interested in that) in just 8 hours. I suppose we could have gone back and done some things twice, but 8 hours was enough when you're in the sun and crowds, and we had other things we wanted to do while on vacation. We didn't take the free shuttle from the hotel because we were so close that we just walked. (Avoid doing this if you do not do well with hills.) This brought us to many entertainment options from movie theaters, a bowling alley, restaurants, shops, bars, etc. Anyone can find something to do and something they will like to eat at the City Walk area. We were also a super close drive to NBC Studios and Warner Bros. Studios. We went and saw the Tonight Show with Jay Leno and took a Warner Bros Studio Tour while we were there. Both were great experiences and extremely close to the hotel. The only complaint that we had was that the elevators were very slow. They were often over crowded because people didn't want to wait anymore. I think it was pretty normal to wait at least 5 minutes for an elevator. Being on the 16th floor, I wasn't about to take the stairs. The ride up was very uncomfortable when people overstuffed themselves into the small space. In the hotel's defense, there was some pageant going on during our stay as well as the Teen Choice Awards, so perhaps they were busier than normal and their elevators don't normally experience these types of delays? The parking also was a bit pricey. I mean come on, $18 a day for a piece of concrete? That was a little bit annoying, but I guess that's life.

I have experienced a wide range of service and issues during all 4 ownership changes and management at the hotel. Prior to the renovation was probably the best time period for this hotel. Management was great at that time. Presently over the past 12 month period I have stayed at the hotel about 6-8 different times. Current management is not what I would consider to be responsive or care about their customers. They offer comment cards but NEVER respond to issues. This is not a hotel for business travelers as the hotel does not cater to them. If you are on vacation then you are the perfect victim to the hotel as there is no timliness in their vocabulary. I met with the operations manager On one of my past trips and he assured me everything would be corrected. That was a lie. The hotel has no quality control - some examples arriving in the room and TV doesn't work or no shower curtain in bathroom or telephone never charged and not operating or light bulbs burned out and non operating. This is hotel management 101 and this hotel doesn't care. Other negatives include untimely delivery of room service breakfast when ordered the night before, not reading breakfast card to not include certain items because they cause extreme allergy and could cause medical emergency, high speed wireless is a joke, some rooms have air conditioning while others don't, gift shop hours vary depending on when they decide they want to close despite hours posted in hotel guide. Forget about enjoying the view frOm your room as it would appear windows have never been washed on the outside - only when it rains. The value charged for nightly accommodations increases during summer months when there are more tourists. The prices do not meet the value at this hotel.

I had read that the food was over priced and the elevators were an issue. We stayed here from July 3 to July 8th. We did not have any issues checking in. A bellman took our luggage and let me keep my car in front of the hotel until I got our bags out and checked in. We chose to self park. The parking is extremely close. From the reviews I had read, it sounded like it was farther away but it is very close and very convenient and I don't see why you would need a valet. We were on the 4th floor and our room faced the pool. I thought the room was clean and well serviced and never had any issues at all. The main floor/ lobby of the hotel is renovated and very nice and they have a concierge who, when they are there, is very helpful. You can purchase Universal park tickets on site and they are knowledgeable about any deals or savings. We wanted to purchase tickets with cash but could only use credit card and the man was willing to put on his credit card and we would pay him the cash. We used our credit card but that was going out of his way I thought. There is a lounge right across from check in. Down farther on the main floor are computers for anyone's use. I think there are at least 6 computers available and I used them at different times during the day and never had to wait. The gift store has various items, from gifts to books to items you may need such as nail clippers (which we did). We had club service, so it was very nice to be able to go up in the morning and have some breakfast and h'ors doevres from 5 to 9 pm. Yes there is a charge for alcohol but soft drinks are free. The only problem with this hotel and it is a HUGE problem are the elevators. They are truly awful and I was so thankful to be on the fourth floor because you could walk down two flights of stair and be at the lobby. Lobby is 3rd floor. Just like everyone writes... they take FOREVER and A DAY. We checked in on a Sunday night and after we were settled, we wanted to go to the club level, floor 9 and check it out. The elevator was full of people. It was elevator #2... we were trying to get to 9 and it was like it was trying to understand the message of the floors but couldn't quite get there. It went to 9, stopped but didn't open, then went to 7, then back to 9 (not opening but acting like it may be thinking about it) went up to 10, down to 5 and then to 9 and finally opened. It was AWFUL. I have never been so close to thinking I was going to be stuck in an elevator. We got out right away. We chose to take the stairs down to the lobby to check it out more. When we went to go back to our room... there was a maintenance man talk to the elevator door saying, \"OK sir, I have called the repair people and they will be here shortly\" According to hotel staff, he was stuck in there for 45 minutes. They reassured my family member that it was all fixed. The next morning I was back in there and lucky for me, #2. I was trying to go to one of the top floors and the same thing happened. I never stepped foot in #2 again. The elevators never once took 90 seconds. I waited up to 15 minutes most times. They have seats outside the elevator, for a reason I believe. You really need to use them because the elevators take so long. We did have lunch one day in the restaurant and it was fine. There is a grocery store very close and we purchased some beverages and snacks. It costs $22 for two beer delivered room service which is crazy when you can go to the store and purchase more than two for cheaper then that. Loved the pool, loved the shuttle to Universal. Really easy to access and very friendly drivers. Does get quite full as it services more then just that hotel, so I had to stand once but all in all, it was easy and free! One day I was trying to rush and catch the shuttle and I could see it start to drive away and so I stopped running and my body language showed I was disappointed. The driver saw me and stopped and waited for us. So that was very nice. The worst part about the hotel is the elevators and I would not stay here again because of the elevators. Very scary. There are several comments about the elevators, so Sheraton needs to pay attention to that because it is a deal breaker in my opinion. Otherwise this is a fine place to stay. Just need to fix the elevators.

The hotel stay was absolutely terrible. Please read on to see what you are in store for should you decide to stay at the Sheraton Universal. First of all, while checking in, the front desk clerk (Jason) failed to tell us about the evening hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeuvres service (not a big deal initially, but it set the precedence for this hotel stay). I knew about the Club Level because I reserved a Club Level room. However, this hotel has Club Level floors and Preferred Guest Level floors. Although the floors look identical, they are labeled differently when getting off of the elevator which leaves a guest who reserves a room on the Club Level floor to believe they are getting less value of a room by having to stay on the Preferred Guest Level floor. The hotel put us on the Preferred Level floor so it was confusing to the front desk clerk (looking at his computer) as to what amenities were available to us. I asked him 3 times after checking in and he kept telling me that if I wanted evening hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeuvres or breakfast, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to go to the hotel restaurant (he kept looking at me as if I were trying to get a hotel service for free). This got me very confused and second guessed myself as to what level of room I had reserved. Next, most hotels offer complimentary beer and wine on the Club Level during the evening hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeuvres service. Not this hotel. And that is hotel, in the club reception room, there are bottles of 5 beers and 2 wines on display on the appetizer table. There are sodas and bottled water right next to the alcoholic beverages display. However, there is no mention of those alcoholic beverages costing anything. No sign, no announcement, nothing at all. Even when the hostess came by to take a drink order, there was no verbal mention that there would be a fee for the alcoholic beverages. Once the hostess brings you the beverage, she brings you a check with the alcoholic beverages on it (and expects a tip on top of that). Now, what is the point of paying extra for a club level room if they are even going to expect a tip? Although most hotels offer complimentary beverages, beer, and wine at the evening hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeuvres time, it is fine that this hotel does not. But at least inform the guest of such. Ok, so next problem. The elevator service is terrible. Before staying that this particular hotel, I read a review on this hotel that stated that the elevators took a guest 8 minutes to get from the ground floor to her room. After reading that, I thought to myself, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that cannot possibly be true. What an exaggeration\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, on that particular review, the manager responded that he tested the elevator service and it should never take more than 90 seconds to hail an elevator. I thought, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, believe it or not, that guest was correct! The first elevator trip to our floor after checking in took 13 minutes to arrive at the lobby level, not to mention a few additional minutes to get to our floor. The elevators could not handle the capacity of the guests, and once to capacity, seemed to bypass the lobby floor where the majority of guests were waiting to go to their rooms. If an elevator stopped at the lobby level, it was a miracle (and so crowded that only 1 or 2 guests could get into the elevator). I think the manager who responded to the previous guest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s review about the elevators was testing the elevators out at 3:00am in the morning. Next, we arrived in our room and it was facing the freeway (obviously noisy as heck). I called to request a room change (mind you, this is at 6:00pm) and I was told that the hotel was sold out and there was nothing they could do. I was told that maybe there would be rooms available tomorrow (Saturday) so I politely said to let me know in the morning. The front desk clerk said I would have to call back in the morning and inquire. Ok, so one more thing for me to do? I asked if they could simply call me and they said I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to call them and re-inquire. A few minutes later, I called back and said I definitely needed a room change. I was told someone would call back in 5 minutes. 20 minutes later, I called back since no once had called me. I was told that they were still searching for rooms (mind you, there were still tons of guests checking into the hotel so what the big deal was about a room swap was beyond me). They finally called back and said the only room they could fit me into was a standard room on the third floor (not a Club Level room) that faced the hotel parking structure. And when I say faced it, I mean you look out the window and you literally see a concrete wall in front of you with a little cement entrance road below. How disgusting and certainly a slap in the face. Was it intentional, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll let you decide? Read on and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll somehow agree that the culture of employees at this hotel are rude and not customer service oriented. So, we kept the room and moved on. We left for Universal City Walk at 8:00pm and stopped by the front desk on our way out. We spoke to the clerk who initially checked us in (Jason) and asked for a room refresh of towels and an evening turn down service. Jason looked up our room and stated he would take care of it. My wife even double confirmed the correct room number and Jason repeated our names back from the computer. So we thought we were set. Not so. We returned at midnight to find the room untouched. I called downstairs and was told there was no housekeeping staff on duty at midnight. Now come one, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d think a hotel this size would at least one housekeeper on duty. I asked for a manager and was told there was not a manager on duty until 9:00am the following morning. Are you serious? No manager. Who is in charge if the hotel was on fire? I was told that there absolutely was no manager on duty and there was absolutely nothing they could do. They sent a maintenance type employee up to our room with a stack of towels. Period. They stated that they would email a manager and he would contact us at 9:00am sharp the following morning. I simply got a voice mail message on our phone (which I did not get until we returned from Universal Studios the following day at 5:00pm). The message simply stated along the lines of said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hi, this is Chris Moraca, Front Desk Manager, I heard we had some issues last night. Please feel free to call me with any questions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The next evening of our hotel stay (night 2), we left for the City Walk at about 6:30pm and called the front desk to request a room refreshing and turn down service again. They stated that there would be no problem with such a request. We returned at midnight to find the room untouched again. I called the front desk and was again told there was no housekeeping at that hour and no manager on duty. This is a Saturday night. What do you mean no manager on duty? It was the same front desk person I spoke to the previous evening (Leanne) and she could not believe what was happening. She apologized and stated that this was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153completely unacceptable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for this hotel to treat a guest in this manner. She promised to have a manager call my cell phone the following morning (of which I received no call from a manager or supervisor). Furthermore, Leanne stated that the manager that she was emailing that evening was Holly and that Holly would be the person contacting me in the morning. I told her we had no shampoo or soap left and had to get up very early the next morning for a flight. She said she would have the items brought right up to our room. Ten minutes later, my wife called and asked where the items were. It was 1:00am and we could not be hanging out waiting for the items because we needed to get to sleep for an early morning flight the next day. We were then told that the items were not on their way because there were other guests that needed attention first and we would have to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wait our turn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a line of requests. Finally, a hotel employee arrived again with a stack of towels and an entire bag for soap and shampoo. I mean, there had to be 20 bottles of mini shampoos and about 30 bars of soap. What point were they now trying to make? Finally, upon check out on Sunday morning (at 9:00am), there was one luggage valet available for approximately 7 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10 parties waiting for his services downstairs. Thank goodness we did not have to have a luggage valet come to our room. It would have never happened. We were getting a bit anxious that no one was able to assist us with calling for a taxi so we went back into the hotel and visited the concierge desk. We asked him to help us get a taxi. Although he was helping no one, he said only the bell desk could help us. Come to find out, all the bell desk needed to do is push a doorbell style button once which signaled a taxi to come to the lobby entrance to pick us up. Are you telling me that the concierge could not walk over a few steps and push said button (or at least tell us how to push the button)? It would have saved so much waiting time and energy. All in all, this hotel is poorly managed, lacks proper training, and a disgrace to the Sheraton name. I have never wrote a review on anything in my life as they are very time consuming. However, in this instance, I felt compelled to because I have never been treated this way.

The room had a flat screen tv, coffeemaker, safe, iron and 2 phones (wireless phone doesn't work-battery light was blinking). Major stain on the carpet very close to the window- gross.

Checking in was easy and everybody was friendly and helpful. Since we arrived early our room wasn't ready but the desk agent gave us a key to a lower room (no view) and said if we were okay we could have that room or else wait for our room with a view. Well since we were not there for the view we checked out the lower room and it was fine. We went back to the agent told him it was okay and so he upgraded us from that room to a low floor with the pool view which I thought was way better then the room we were supposed to have because this had a balcony. Also, since it was our honeymoon they gave us a comp breakfast coupon. The property is very nice as you would expect for a Sheraton. Location was perfect for going to Universal Studios. Short walk or you can catch their shuttle. Conciege desk was very helpful in giving us ideas for things to see along with maps on how to get there. The bell desk was helpful and valet parking guys were great and even wiped down our windows for us. I have no problems recommending this hotel to other and would gladly stay here again. If I had to find something negative to say I'd say it was finding our room the first time. To get to the lower level rooms you have to go down the hall (passing rooms) to an elevator. There is no sign on the outside saying elevator down the hall. So we walked down the hall as that was the directions given, saw rooms and figured it was the wrong way so turned around before getting to the elevator. Then after checking all areas we asked again and was told to pass the rooms to find the elevator.

My husband and I, along with a friend of ours booked 2 rooms for 2 nights so we we would be close to Universal Studios. We booked our rooms through Priceline (after shopping different sites and even calling the hotel itself) and got the best deal. When we arrived we found that our 2 rooms were on different floors, which wasn't that big of a deal - but the wonderful woman at the check-in desk went out of her way to find us 2 rooms on the same floor, that were right across the hall from each other. We meant to go back and get her name but we never saw her again. Just about everything to do with the hotel was wonderful. -The rooms were very clean (and we got a view of the park) -The bathrooms were clean and the water pressure was great! - There was a coffee pot in the room with STARBUCKS coffee and Tazo tea! a HUGE deal to me. -The entire staff was great! The valet people in the front were so nice! They joked around with us when we were coming in and leaving and helped us with walking directions (and we didn't valet, we just parked in the garage, but they were nice and helpful anyway and always smiling). - The people who worked the desk were friendly and helpful - Room service was speedy and our order was right. :) - The hotel is right across the street from Universal Studios and down the block from the subway station (which we walked to so we could catch the train to downtown and go shopping, see the walk of fame etc. etc and the Hollywood sign is visible from the Mall if you go to the top floor). -Housekeeping was great (we left them $5 a day - you should always tip everyday because you might get a different housekeeper at the end of your stay so if you tip only when you check out, you may have stiffed the person that cleaned your room most of your stay!) -There is a bar in the lobby which was great after a day walking around and also a convenience store in case you forgot anything -There is an outdoor pool, which we didn't use, but it looked nice clean (our friend had a view of the pool and the hills) -The overall hotel was clean and well maintained. We would definitely stay here again. Not only are you close to Universal and the Subway, but you are a short drive or cab ride to lots of other attractions. The ONLY bad thing we encountered in the hotel, and this only applies to my husband and I, not our friend, who had no issues whatsoever.... was that in the middle of the night our air-conditioner stopped working! The fan was going but warm air was blowing out... we both woke up very hot and the room was very very stuffy. It was the last day of our stay and it was the middle of the night - it wan't that big of a deal (although it was a little hard to sleep) so we didn't bother calling the front desk. The room was back to normal when we woke up and then we were checking out anyway. No biggie. I'm sure if we would have called someone, it would have been fixed in no time. But that's it... just one little tiny issue that did not ruin my vacation. :) We had a great time and we will be back! Oh and for those out there that complain about having to pay to park - good luck finding a decent hotel in California where you don't have to pay.

The location is excellent, easy access from the freeways and if you're into the tourist stuff Universal City Walk is within walking distance. We go to LA to visit family. So, I'd just as soon not be in the tourist mess but really it's worth it for this hotel. It's clean. It's nice. There is pretty much always someone on staff at the front desk. You can get a great deal on this hotel on Hotwire if you know how to recognize it in their system. That's what we do. It's listed as 4-star but I would call it a very solid 3.5 star, not a 4 star. Without the Hotwire rate I think it's still a great place to stay but I probably wouldn't stay there paying full price. I did once and it was over $1000 for 5 days. Maybe that's ok with you, and if so, you're going to really like this hotel. They have food, a bar, and a gift shop. I only have 3 complaints and they're fairly minor: 1) They use a flat sheet in place of a fitted sheet. For me, a person who rolls around a lot while sleeping, that meant that every night I ended up sleeping on a bare mattress since the flat sheets just wont stay on the bed if you move much. 2) They charge $18/day for parking. I think that's a lot considering that pretty much every person who visits LA gets a car. But, there's no place else to park. So, we pay it. 3) They can have long lines at check-in and just one guy working that desk. We unfortunately arrived just after their airport shuttle and had to wait about 1/2 hour to check in as all the folks from the shuttle were ahead of us. I think the hotel should bring an extra couple of people to do check-in when their shuttle arrives.

Questions were answered knowledgably and courteously. The lobby was as attractive as I always remembered it, but with no real sitting area unless you went into the bar section. The decor in soft beige tints was pleasant both upstairs and down. Self-parking was good value at $18 per 24 hours, as was the internet. Yet, there was also a motor hotel feel feel which was new and unwelcome. The room maintenance was bizarre in my case. It was no more than perfunctory, if that. After my first night I returned to the room after several hours away and found that the bed covers had simply been pulled up \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and not much more. Dust balls on the carpet evident when I checked in were still there 24 hours later. In the bathroom, I had left one towel in the tub because it needed replacing. When I returned it was now on the bathroom floor, along with the bath mat which I had carefully folded and draped over the tub in the morning. There was soap scum in the wash basin. Also. I suspect that easy access to restaurants up the hill on City Walk has had a negative effect on food services at the Sheraton Universal. Again, the staff in the sole remaining restaurant was pleasant and attentive, although not especially professional. But it was essentially a coffee-shop menu and coffee-shop quality food.

Pros: - Received really nice service from the bell boy (man, actually) who showed genuine friendliness that made us feel that he really wanted us to have a pleasant stay from his heart. When he found that we were staying for 10 days, he offered to bring us a mini-fridge just in case. It's complementary anyway, but his service was really superb. Too bad I am not good at remembering names that I could have given him credits here. - 70% of the hotel had been renovated. E.g. wall papers, bedside cabinets, etc. - Couldn't request for a King bed room before arrival and hence we could only use a room in the same floor of the front desk. But since the hotel's big and the room was located furthest from the front desk, we did not find this much of a concern at all. - Computers in the business center were all new models (new at least to a computer idiot like me) with speedy internet. Before we arrived, we read the earlier review saying that the computers in the business center were not working properly. But during the 10 days of our stay, we did not see any of this happened and made good use of them. So it was still fine without free in-room wi-fi. - They offered $5 voucher each day we declined housekeeping service. Hence we'd collected vouchers worth a total of $30. We used them all at one go and enjoyed a breakfast in the hotel on the last day. (Though don't expect too much on the food...) Cons: - The only 2 mirrors in the room were located inconveniently. The biggest one was in the bathroom but there was no way I could lean closer to look at my face clearly as the bathroom was really small. Another mirror was located inside the closet. Since we have 4 big luggages, one of them was put inside the side right in front of the mirror ('cause no where else in the room could we have put it instead). And with the dim lighting next to the closet, it was still hard for me to try to put some make-up on. And we had been wondering why the mirror was not placed behind the working desk where there was a really big empty wall. - While every thing seemed to be pretty new, spider's web was found in the ceiling corner in the bedroom. Mold was also found at the ceiling corner at the bath tub. And the door lock was obviously not replaced after renovation and looked quite dirty and old. - Is it how the blankets are arranged in hotels now? We have a thick bed cover over a down blanket over a thin bed sheet. All these 3 items are just loosely covering in layers without any thing holding them together. Every morning the 3 blankets went different paths and it was really not comfortable to find yourself directly covered by the down blanket when you woke up in the morning. - With a flat screen TV already in place, the hotel at a level like Sheraton should really consider incorporating the HD features. - Traveling to Universal Studio/ City Walk from the hotel was not meant to be done by walk. Either you catch the shuttle or drive there yourself. We wanted to watch a movie past 8pm at one night but the shuttle was already off. We had to pay $10 for parking in the City Walk while we were supposed to be staying in the hotel at Universal Studio.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Menlo Park, California", "Title": "\u201cSheraton strives to deliver the best service - And it does!\u201d", "Author": "chriscoolio", "ReviewID": "UR97160648", "Content": "This is the first hotel review I've ever written - the reason I'm writing this is because the Sheraton has delivered exceptional service to my family and me.

Even as a repeat visitor, it's hard to find the entrance to this hotel. Staff check in was fast and friendly. I was upgraded to an \"Executive\" room which was basically a large junior suite. The room had nice/new Sheraton furnishings, but the new-ish flatscreen tv was way too small for the room/the way it was positioned (too far from the bed or sofa to see). The main problem with the hotel in the guest room as well as in the Terrace Room where I attended a cocktail reception was the lack of functioning A/C. I think the management is aware of this issue (as evidenced by the fan placed in the room at check in). The room wasn't terrible, but the ballroom was unbearable. People were sweating in their gowns and suits and constantly stepping out to breathe. Room service was fast and delicious. The lobby bar was a great place to catch up with an old friend. Good beers on tap, great cocktails, good service. Valet was fast. The only other problem (potentially a deal breaker if you're here on vacation) is that the elevators were woefully below the hotel's capacity. I'd wait 5-10 minutes on average. (To be fair, there were 2 events in the hotel and it was a busy Saturday night) but a trip to/from your room shouldn't take 20 minutes.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreatest Staff and Comfortable Stay\u201d", "Author": "jetski579", "ReviewID": "UR95231255", "Content": "My family stayed in January 2011 for 4 nights.

We arrived just before noon and was able to check into a room right away. The service was great with our bellman offering a free fridge for all of our snacks/drinks that we brought. Parking for our car was included in the package, but runs around $18.00 for self parking. The room was located on the 17th floor with a nice view of the park. Although small, our accomodations seemed recently remodeled and clean. We quickly unpacked and headed to the park. By foot, you first take an elevator up to the next level (where the Hilton is) and then take a short uphill hike to the park. Total time about 15 minutes. There is a shuttle that picks up at the Sheraton but we never used it. Universal was not packed during our stay, and we easily covered everything in the two days. One evening we took the Metro to Hollywood/Highland (one stop from Universal Station) to see the Graumans Chinese Theater and the sights. On the return trip back to Universal Station there is a bit of an uphill walk to the Sheraton. It seemed safe as there were others walking. The next morning we decided to try their buffet breakfast downstairs and it was one of the best buffets we've had in a long time. Although not cheap (around $25.00/person) we enjoyed the breakfast faire. The big breakfast precluded us from eating much in the park that day until we had dinner that evening. That evening we spent at the City Walk next to the park. The recent acquisition of the Sheraton Universal by the Shenzhen group may bring some interesting changes to the Hotel. As a Starwood member we would definitely consider staying there again in the future.", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "L.A.", "Title": "\u201cA little frustrating\u201d", "Author": "BuddyMalloy", "ReviewID": "UR92713789", "Content": "Was here on business for 2 nights, a few observations. The outside looks like nothing special but the inside has been redone. TMy first thought was that it looked pretty good. But... The pluses: - All staff were extremely friendly, at all times. - It is located within walking distance of Universal Studios and City Walk (but there's a shuttle anyway as some of the walk is uphill). - The hotel has an area with a number of computers for free use, including internet access. - hotel was quiet. The negatives: - The computer centre was not working 9 out of my 10 trips to it. When I finally mentioned it at the Front Desk, they were nice but completely unconcerned and it was never fixed for the rest of my stay. I saw others get up and leave the computer centre in frustration. - My 'recently renovated' CLUB floor room had stains everywhere - on the bed, on the drapes, on the literature. - room had plastic cups - no fridge or mini-bar (I really felt this was odd considering I was on the club floor) - The pay per view movies on the tv would not come up. - Could not access the \"current account balance\" - ever. - The restaurant closes before 6:30, leaving only the bar area on the main floor. The bar area is nice, the staff are great, but I thought the food was awful. - Conceirge gave me incorrect information (I was told a shuttle to the airport is $20.00...ah, I wish). - Bill was incorrect at check out and I had to get manager's assistance to straighten it out (completely their error - they were apologetic but the mistake was so unncessary). Keep in mind this hotel is not a cab ride from the airport (that's over $100.00). So you should rent a vehicle. It's too bad, with a little work and attention to detail, this could be a great place. I plan to take my family to Universal Studios soon, but I will be staying at the Hilton right next door. I didn't get a chance to visit it, but something tells me it's got to be better.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cDissapointing service\u201d", "Author": "ILuv2Travel", "ReviewID": "UR92387528", "Content": "As flights from Australia arrive into LAX early in the morning, I contacted the hotel quite a while in advance and requested early check in. We booked 3 rooms and requested them all to be together. I communicated with a lovely man from the hotel before our trip and he sounded so positive and helpful. Of course upon arrival (with 4 feral children!) NONE of our rooms were ready and the receptionist didn't try to help us at all. A very dissapointing arrival. The rooms however are lovely and the beds are extremely comfortable. During our 3 days we never saw the shuttle bus to Universal Studios and this was a huge problem as I have multiple sclerosis. The walk is just too far and difficult (for anyone really!). Taxi drivers got really annoyed at us because the drive was too short. The Hilton is definately closer and an easier walk. Next time I would stay there as it is much more convenient. I wish other reviewers mentioned that! It is definately worth getting the club lounge as the continental breakfast is lovely and fresh. I would also like to mention that I left a US$250 brand new tracksuit on the bed as I left. I was silly to not check the room before I left. There were kids running around and we were running late so it's my fault. We phoned the hotel 1 hour later and were put through to lost property. They found nothing. We phoned again the next day and spoke to reception and lost property again - once again, nothing.

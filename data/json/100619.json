If you haven\u2019t yet stayed at the Radisson SeaTac, I highly recommend that you give it a try. There are so many wonderful aspects to this property, but the exceptional customer service is why I always return. Located directly across the street from SeaTac International Airport, it\u2019s a five minute walk to the terminal or a three minute ride on their courtesy shuttle. The Central Link (light rail) station is two blocks north \u2013 you can be downtown in less than 40 minutes. The rooms are very spacious, well laid-out, sunny and extremely quiet \u2013 even the ones facing the airport. The mattresses are very comfortable; linens, duvet and pillows are luxurious. The towels are of excellent quality, highly absorbent and fluffy. The complimentary toiletries are by Asira, all with a very nice, fresh scent. If you book a suite, the living room area is a wonderful place to unwind after a day of sightseeing. Housekeeping does an amazing job \u2013 your room is always spotless! Bonus: You are able to open a sliding window, to get fresh air. The property has a business center, indoor pool, fitness center, restaurant and bar. I encourage you to have at least one meal at their Gateway Grill \u2013 it\u2019s fabulous! The breakfast buffet is an excellent way to begin your day and the dinner entrees are superb. (I have not ordered room service but my expectation is that it is equally exemplary.) As if everything so far wasn\u2019t enough, I\u2019ve saved the best for last. The hospitality at the Radisson SeaTac is second to none. It begins with the gracious courtesy shuttle driver at the airport, then a friendly wave from the groundskeeper, and continues with a warm welcome at check-in. Housekeeping will ensure that you\u2019re comfortable; the restaurant and bar staff will treat you like a long-time friend. Be sure to enroll in Club Carlson, because I know you\u2019ll want to return to the Radisson SeaTac!", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for pre or post SeaTac Flight\u201d", "Author": "yr66", "ReviewID": "UR126605306", "Content": "We (family of 4) had a king suite for one night before flight, and it was exactly what we needed.

This property is perfect for anyone flying in or out of Sea-Tac on short notice. The location is directly across the street, and if a person wanted, they could actually walk from the airport to the hotel. Of greater importance, the hotel is right next door to \"13 Coins\" restaurant, a five-star Seattle staple.

The beds were sleep number numbers beds - first night me and my husband tried one bed - changing the numbers all around - did not help. Felt like we were camping on our air mattress! The second night I had one bed he had the other - not any better. Third night we tried the other bed together - bad bad bad! Other than that it was just fine! I did enjoy the fabulous water pressure in the shower. It is directly across the street from the airport and a 10-min door to door (including buying your tkts) to walk to the Light Link Rail. Just head right out of the parking lot and walk for 7-min and you will hit the entrance to the Rail station. Another 3-min to get tkts and get the actual platform. Then it was a 40-min ride into Seattle - $5.50 for a RT ticket. We had a room facing the street and airport - I could not hear any street or airport noise. But if you are a light sleeper you might want to ask for a room on the other side - which only faces a parking lot so at least the street noise might be a little less, though again I didn't hear anything.

We called the hotel and at about 1:30 our room was ready. We booked a king room. In addition to the bed, there was a desk and small sitting area and the bathroom was pretty big. Everything was super clean. I loved the Sleep Number bed. The wi-fi was free in our room. The hotel was about 3 blocks from the Light Rail and we walked there and purchased rail tickets downtown, which was about a 40 minute ride. When we came back, we bought drinks in the lobby, which I just loved. It was very nice with couches and a fireplace and you just felt like you were at a friend's house having a drink. The bar tender poured a VERY good vodka and cranberry and we sat there and chilled out and watched TV for a while before heading up to bed. We had breakfast coupons and in the morning we headed down to breakfast, which was good.Even though there were a ton of people there for cruises, we didn't have to wait for a table.

I called the front desk and they advised me that the bedding should be in the closet. This was a shocker to me. I have worked in a number of hotels doing house keeping, and have NEVER seen a hotel skimp on making up the pull out couches. It was increadibly un-professional, the thought guests, paying for a room and having to make up their own bed or even having to ask for someone to do it is compleatly lazy on part of the hotel. Not to mention, knowing there were 4 people in this suite, it should have been at least done prior to us arriving IN the suite. Bad planning on the hotels part. We started to make up our bed, and discovered how disgusting it is. It was very uncomfortable and had holes in it! Paying customers saw this!!! I have a bad back and my father-in-law has recently had shoulder surgury. This bed was no good for any of us.

She sent for a cot to be brought up, and this was much more comfortable. the front desk staff should have acknowledged this from the get go. The pull out couch is crap-at least be honest about it! It would have saved some face. The manager also offered us breakfast in the morning. We obviously said ok, even though it didn't really make up for the experience.

The staff have always been friendly and helpful. There is a cute little library style lounge for a nightcap or snack. Prices are very reasonable. We found the rooms on the front of the property to be a little noisy as they face International Blvd and the airport. The rooms on the back side face a small lake and are much more peaceful. We always ask for a room on the back and have never had a problem getting one. We stayed once in a One Bedroom Suite. Nice room, but unfortunately right by the elevators and facing International Blvd. We heard the elevator motors groaning and humming all night form the living room and the airport / road noise from the bedroom. The Suites are all by the elevator. I would take a standard room on the back over the suite, even if it was offered at no extra charge. We have otherwise always had a King Sleep Number Bed room. I Like the layout of the room and also the bed. After a couple of stays, we did what the Sleep Number people want - we bought a Sleep Number Bed for home. They are really a great bed. This hotel is the first thing you see when you come out of the airport. I guarantee you it is quicker to walk to the terminal than take the shuttle. Problem is, the route all hotel shuttle busses take to the airport is not exactly direct. Even from this hotel, it is about a ten minute ride. If you want to walk from the airport, come out the doors at baggage claim and immediately turn right. Do not cross the road to ground transportation. You can't walk from there. You will find the hotel at the end of the sidewalk in about 5 minutes. To walk from the hotel, just cross the street and follow the little concrete path. Easy.

Oh, and after reading earlier reviews about the window sheers not blocking out the light, no problem in my room, I found the black-out curtains strategically located behind the sheers. - Very nice room service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Food came up within 20 minutes, the lady called me beforehand to tell me she she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be there in a minute, and she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been nicer and friendlier. Perhaps the best room service person I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had (and I wish I recalled her name). Steak sandwich and fries were quite delectable. - I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reiterate how convenient it was to be that close. On my way out the guy in the shuttle said he was leaving in 15 minutes, so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother waiting. You walk a lot longer than 4 minutes when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re inside the airport. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll admit, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raining which made it easier, and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much luggage. As I was walking up to the terminal, two people behind me were complaining that their hotel told them they were two blocks away and that it felt like two miles. The Radisson is literally the first hotel across the street from the airport. Next closest was the Red Lion Inn. After that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably too far to walk. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely closer than the O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare Hilton in Chicago, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attached to the terminal. So why doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the Radisson get five stars? A couple reasons: - Handicap switcheroo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read enough TripAdvisor reviews beforehand to see that the front desk pretty much pushes you into a handicap room until you complain about it. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m miffed and still kicking myself that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change rooms. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that big of a deal but the bathrooms aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as nice with all the bars and equipment. - Bright lights, big city smells \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Once I exited the elevator onto the 4th floor hallway, the place smelled like a one-star hotel with cleaning supplies trying to mask the palpable scent of cigarette smoke. The hallways were way too bright and surgery-room sterile, and whenever I looked up into the popcorn ceilings, in the hallways and in my room, there was patchwork and cracks from some serious Frankenstein-scar renovations. The rooms themselves were fine, but I was sure nervous in the purgatory of the hallway during that all-important moment when you open your hotel room door and hold your breath. - $199. I just have a hard time paying that much for a two star hotel, albeit a very good two star hotel, particularly in the midst of an economic meltdown. And I tried valiantly to find a cheaper rate. Not even on kayak.com. The room was clean and quiet which are my primary considerations, but it is very bare bones. I usually enjoy taking the shampoos from hotels. These I left behind. Had I paid $79, I would be giving it another star. All in all, I would certainly stay there again if only for the convenience, but also because it delivered on the promise of what a business traveler is looking for, though just barely. And maybe in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloom-and-doom, sky-has-fallen world, just barely is as good as it gets.", "Date": "October 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cAs far as airport hotels go...\u201d", "Author": "WineTool", "ReviewID": "UR20098996", "Content": "...this one's pretty good. I've stayed at the Seatac Radisson a couple of times now, for either a quick business trip or a close-to-the-airport stopover, and both stays were better than adequate. You don't usually expect much at aiport hotels, but this place is pretty decent. LOCATION The hotel is on International Blvd, literally right across the street from the airport. You can walk to the airport if you want to. Both times I've taken the shuttle, but would certainly walk if it seemed like the shuttle was running behind. The area is primarly hotels, restaurants, gas stations, and parking facilities (and, um, the occasional \"gentlemen's club\"). If you're driving, there's a Safeway with a pharmacy not too far away. Anyway, it's ideally located for a preflight hotel stay. ROOMS The rooms are pretty nice. (Many Radissons I've stayed at previously have inspired me to rename the chain \"Ratisson\" due to their general griminess; this one is much better.) I stayed in a king-bed room; the workstation was large (great since I was working), the WiFi was free, and the furniture and decor were tasteful. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean, and the room was quiet. In short, it's pefect for catching up on business before you have to fly out the next day. FACILITIES/LOBBY The lobby is functional; not huge, but not tiny. There's a restaurant that wasn't too bad (for lunch, anyway), and there's a comfortable bar/lounge where you can grab a drink and watch the Mariners lose horribly to whoever they happen to be playing that day. It's not fancy, and don't look for a party scene there, but it's perfectly adequate. Aside from WiFi, I didn't use the business facilities, so I can't comment. There's a pool, but I didn't use it, so I'm not sure what it's like. STAFF The staff was very helpful and cheerful. On one of my stays, I arrived *way* before check-in time, and they were happy to find me a room that was ready early... which allowed me to get a lot more work done than I would have otherwise. That was great. They answered all of my questions about local services, and did so with a smile. In short, the staff greatly enhanced my stay, which is always a nice surprise. SUMMARY If you're a business traveler and you need a good place to stay near the airport, this is top-notch. It's a particurlay good deal if you get it through hotwire or priceline. The staff is helpful and friendly, the rooms are nice, and you can't get closer to the airport without sleeping at the terminal.", "Date": "September 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Keizer, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cadequate hotel\u201d", "Author": "J-ME-19", "ReviewID": "UR19361688", "Content": "Stayed here one night before leaving for a cruise Check in was very quick.

We had booked through the hotel website and got a good rate without looking for AAA discounts, etc. We were flying into SeaTac on Saturday evening and needed a place to crash before heading for Victoria, BC on Sunday morning. Seattle has been having an unusual winter and when we got there it was cold with snow/ice on the ground. The hotel had not done much to clear their parking lot - just the main entrance drive (which is mostly covered) was clear. We had quite a time getting from our rental car back to the front door of the hotel, but luckily we thought to leave our suitcases inside before going to park. Our room was spacious and very clean, as was the bathroom. The bed looked comfortable and inviting. We ordered room service for dinner which, while pricey like all room service meals, was delivered quickly and the food was still warm. Our room had a king sized \"Sleep Number\" bed, a feature that Radisson promotes heavily. We fiddled with it a little, but didn't spend a lot of time finding \"our number\". The bed was comfortable, but the linens were awful. The sheets were scratchy and stiff and not at all comfortable. The pillows were flat and horrible. If the bed is going to be promoted as a feature of the room, invest in some decent sheets, fabric softener and new pillows! In the morning, I tried the shower. The water pressure was fabulous and I could have stayed under it forever. The shower head, however, appeared to have been installed by/for Oompa Loompas. I'm 5' 3\" and I had to duck down to get my head under the spray. Angling the shower head upwards only resulted in water splashing on the end wall of the shower and running in a river onto the floor. We found that out the hard way when we sopped up a huge puddle just before it spread to the carpet under the door. My husband is 6 ft tall, so he enjoyed his shower even less than I did. We did not use any of the hotel facilities such as the airport shuttle, but when we came down to the lobby (very early) the driver was right there asking us if we needed a ride to the airport. We also did not visit the lobby bar or try the continental breakfast (we left before it opened at 6:00 am).

It was 2am we jut wanted a hotel to sleep for a few hours after driving for 15 straight. Anyway spotted a black bug looked like a centipede but my son missed it and it hide behind the tv unit. As soon as we turned off the lights my husband felt something on him turned on the light and it was a roach the size of an pink single erasers ou use to use in school on his bed. Disgusting. Needless to say he killed it and I shook our things and ran out. Got our mony back but will never ever stay in a days inn like this again. So gross. I don't recommend. This place should be shut dOwn.

We thank god the room we booked for our friends was half way decent. OUR room was NASTY, we paid extra to get a king size room. The bed was out of the 70's and hourly hotel decor - mirrored head board and all. The molding on the head board was falling off. the rest of the furniture was out of the 70's as well including the STAINS on the dresser. The refridgerator did not work. Also, every corner of the room looked as if no one vaccummed in months DUST & COBB WEBBS. I killed several bugs and a couple large brown spiders. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!

Not to be prejudiced, but a certain ethic group takes over a lot of these hotels and run them into the ground. The bank stepped in on this one and improvements are being made immediately! There is plenty of tractor-trailer parking in the rear. It is pet friendly with a fee. Pillow top mattresses are on order, the rooms will be refurbished shortly and the entire place will be made over. At the front desk, Melinda is a pleasure to deal with and is the new front manager. The rooms are adequate but as said, big changes and a make over are long over due and coming very soon. Everyone is thrilled about it! With the Daytona Speedway and Flea Market near by as well as a multitude of shops and places to eat, this hotel will be in heavy demand! Looking forward to staying here when we are in the area! And to the upcoming changes!

The next day I tried to get a discount, but they couldn't return any money because I had booked online, so they said they would give me a 50% discount for my next visit.

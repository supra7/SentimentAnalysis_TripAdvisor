{"Reviews": [{"Content": "The Manager has serious issues Everything was pretty good on check in evne though it was late at night, however one thing that annoyed me was getting knocks on the door from the maids at10:30 well before it would be normal check out time to clean the room. But the kicker is I had called the night before check out and asked for a late check out with which the clerk who answered the phone said was fine but the next day while taking a shower, the manager or asst manager pounded on the door and my gf said he told her we had to leave immediately and that any late check outs had to be cleared thru him, stupid me, I should have known that right, because obviously Im psychic. Upon returning home I noticed that he charged my card for an additional day even though I hadn't stayed so now as we speak Im disputing this with my bank, and I called Ramada's customer service to let them know and within 30 mins later I get a call from the manager person who basically calls me a liar and tells me I can drive down there anytime to review the video for whatever reason, anyways, avoid at all costs unless you like getting screwed over.", "Date": "Aug 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR104460771", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "grendel_matrix"}, {"Content": "maintenance@Ramada Having to go to Dallas Texas,I went on the internet to fnd a hotel closest to the area I needed to be.The Ramada Ltd. was recommended by hotels.com.

There was a plunger already in the room.(how lucky and convient that was!!!!).Iplunged the toilet to stop it from running over.I called the front desk to inform them what had happened.The clerk informed me that i needed to use the towels to mop the water up. There was too much water on the floor.She informed me that i had a problem and she was the only one at the desk and that was the best that she could do for me.She did however take the time to bring me a bag of rags for me to mop with.Then she later was gracious enough to bring me a mop and bucket to mop with after I called the hotel managerr/owner who hung the phone up in my face.She eventually came and mopped the room and I don't think she liked it one bit.Stay away from the hotel will never visit again!!!!", "Date": "Feb 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR780954407", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "LouisianaMadea"}, {"Content": "Overcharged on Checkout I had a confirmed rate of $61.75/night plus taxes. When checking out I was charged an additional $2.50 per night as an amenity charge. The manager explained it was a charge for the availability of a coffee pot and ironing board in the room. I nicely explained that I neither ordered or used the coffee pot or ironing board, but he would not remove the charge. My opinion is to seriously avoid places like this.", "Date": "Aug 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR533917327", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "TXTraveller55"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d109447-r19481575-Ramada_Limited_Dallas-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "109447", "Price": "$93"}}

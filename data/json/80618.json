The website looked good, as did the photos. After arriving in San Diego we drove over to check it out. Getting there was easy, but the neighborhood started looking questionable the further we drove. When we got to the hotel, my wife was not impressed. We walked into the lobby (which was empty) and were a little disappointed. The front desk clerk didn't bother to greet us or show us around. The hotel is neat and has a cool history, but we just got negative vibes. The pool is definitely smaller than what I thought. The Red Fox Steak House is indeed next door, but it looked tired and haggard. The biggest turn off really was the area surrounding the hotel. There were some seedy looking establishments replete with homeless people hanging out at a liquor store nearby. We ended up canceling our reservation and stayed elsewhere. I was rather disappointed because the hotel had a cool history...but that's about all it has going for it. If I had millions of dollars to renovate the hotel, I might have done things a little differently to make it seem more inviting. If you're deciding whether to stay or not; I would definitely say to actually go to the hotel first.

The Good - the room and bath were clean and refurbished, and the bed was confortable. (I am an older man and I liked the old style architecture.) Parking - secure, enclosed garage beneath the hotel. I liked that. Price - reasonable. $265 total for the three nights. The Bad - on both Friday and Saturday, there was a lot of noise from \"party people\" - young people who seemed to use the hotel as a gathering place for parties - very noisy. Also, on Sat. night there was a live band somewhere near my room that blasted away until 11 PM. The Ugly - when I checked in on Friday afternoon, the counter person was uncommunicative - almost surly. She was not voluntarily helpful at all, almost as if she hated her job.

My boyfriend and I stayed here 1 night when we extended our vacation and the hotel we originally booked for was completely booked and it was one of the worst nights in a hotel we've spent. THE HOTEL: The hotel is located on a main street with parking around and underground. The parking seems kind of sketchy and i was really skeptical about leaving my car during our stay, but we found a parking spot right outside of our room so that made me feel a little better. The inside of the lobby is nice, but as soon as you walk out to the patio/pool area it is not all that great and i'm hoping they are planning on renovating that as well. When we booked our room we booked a king bedroom, when we checked-in they didn't tell us that the king bedroom wasn't available and that they had changed our room. The pool area is okay, looks kind of dirty though. THE ROOM: We got a non-renovated room and it was horrible!!!!!!!! Like I said, they had switched our room because the one we booked had a broken toilet so they checked us into a two bedroom suite with what i believe was two FULL beds. I sleep on a queen bed every night at home and the beds in this room were definitely NOT queen. The beds were really uncomfortable and the room was just disgusting. I felt dirty just sitting on the bed. The pictures I saw on another travel website didn't show any pictures of the rooms and the pictures on the website only showed pictures of the renovated rooms. so misleading and I had no idea what we were booking.

The surrounding of the hotel is not bad really. its actually got some cute little places. and its not scary or loud or anything like that.

I've heard it is under construction to update, but it is still horrible (plus, the only signs of work being done are some orange cones in the lobby, a couple of flyers regarding the work, and a plastic runner going up a stairway....on very very old carpet). The hall leading to our room went passed two offices where you couldn't help but look through the windows into rooms with messy desks. Next, when we opened the door to our room I was in shock! Depressing green walls, smelled bad, the bed was as hard as a rock (harder than the beds I've slept on in China, where they like their beds hard). I couldn't even sleep on it and spent two days with a sore back just from laying on it. Looking out the window from our room we were sickened to see an open concrete area with nothing but windows looking out on it. The only other things to see were a ladder and a maid/room service cart. The windows looked like they hadn't been cleaned in 50 years, with cracked glass and a totally messed up lock. There was hair on the bathroom wall, no counter space...only a small poorly place glass shelf directly above the sink (watch out when you wash your face or you'll hit your head!). After the shock of the room settled in we decided to check out the pool area. It looked NOTHING like the website, which boasted a beautiful setting. The first thing to see was the sign on the gate going in stating that people that are not staying there must pay $5. Does that mean anyone can come and use the pool? In short, the pool was as gross as the rest of the place. I wouldn't set foot in the pool and was totally overwhelmed with how depressing and filty everything looked. I've seen low income housing that looked better! After the first night we couldn't take anymore and checked out. At first one desk clerk told my husband that we would have to be out by 11:00. He told her we needed time to find another place and couldn't be out by noon. That appeared ok. However, when we went to check out another clerk indicated that it didn't matter when we were checking out. Hmm? I prefer hotels that are truthful upfront. Overall, even if they are fixing things up, there appears to be no pride in the condition of the entire hotel. They should be ashamed!

Was a huge convention time period, so for the money, this was about the best thing available. The hotel itself is very unique, as are some of the locals who patronize it. It seems that the management is banking on its uniqueness and history and failing to do the things necessary to keep the property to a minimum acceptable level with regard to cleanliness, maintenance and simple functionality of the property. The pool was not operating for the first four days and no one seemed concerned. The front desk did lower our rate for the trouble otherwise deflected complaints with a variety of excuses too numerous to mention. And once it was fixed and refilled with water I never saw anyone testing the water or cleaning it. this would not have concerned me except that on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, they have a locals pool party with entrance allowed to the neighborhood for a fee (I hope)and in the hope they will buy drinks from the bar,(they do). If you stay there, be ready for an instant party in the pool from noon to six or eight pm and grab a lounge chair early because they will be gone quick. This is obviously an attempt to increase revenue, which I am sure does occur but for the management to take the last piece of goodwill left from the actual customers paying the high rates for a hotel in San Diego on the weekend is very short sighted and can only eliminate return customers. The main draw of this property was that it was a decent location and is usually 15 to 20% lower than mainstream properties. For myself in the future, this ceases to be any type of deal as I would gladly pay the extra 10 to 20 dollars NOT to have the same experience.

I had booked through hotwire and was already billed for the place, otherwise I would have bolt.

That should have been my cue to leave. It was finally my turn to speak with the solo receptionist, a young lady that was very sweet.

I asked to be on the first floor as I have problems with my knee and didnt want to injure myself more.

When we followed their directions, we came concerned when we started driving into a rather bad part of town, very commerical. the \"colonial\" hotel sets right on the street with a narrow circle drive in the front.

The front desk clerk told me that they were sold out the night before (surprise!!) and we could not check in before the 3pm checkin time. When we arrived around noon, they did however, allow us to use their restrooms to change clothes and then stored our luggage for us. When we came back, I wanted to see the room.

He took me to another \"suite\" and it looked the same. We had paid for the room in advance in total, so I ended up taking the standard room with 2 beds - it was the \"best\" of the three rooms I looked. The bedspreads were faded, bedskirts wrinkled and dirty and the carpet was soiled. So.....let this be a warning, don't always trust a hotel's website - they are not always correct! I would not recommend this hotel even to someone just staying overnight. It is worth about $30-$40 per night and is not as advertised. I feel confident that in it's heyday, it was a beautiful hotel.

From talking to other guests, it was clear that the bathrooms are the worst part of this hotel. Ours was in serious need of being redone, or at least a thorough cleaning. Also, it seems that the rooms that are not surrounding the pool area tend to be larger rooms. Our room was decently sized, and I loved that we could walk out of our room and right into the pool. The surrounding neighborhood is not the best example of the beauty of San Diego, though it is very close to the Zoo and Balboa Park. Other than that, honestly, the hotel was worth the money we spent on it.

It went from scalding, to freezing, to normal, and back every few seconds, in all of our rooms. At one point early in our stay we requested the toilet be plunged. They did come, but they did not clean the toilet afterwards, leaving us to look at the remnants of the previous guest. The ceiling in the shower had obvious water damage, the shelf in the bathroom was chipped, the windows did not fit tightly in their (dirty) frames on the (dirty) windowsill, and the door to our room did not sit plumb in the frame, allowing about 1/2\" of daylight to come in at sunrise each day. I left the patio area one evening at 9:30, and there was bits of food on the floor under our table. When I returned for breakfast the next morning at 7:30, the table had not been cleaned off and the food was still on the floor. The hotel allows local residents to use the pool free of charge as long as they keep ordering food/drinks from the bar. This meant that the hotel guests could not get any lounge chairs. It also meant that there were dozens of loud, inebriated 20-somethings in the pool from noon till 10 PM, making the water taste like sweat and suntan lotion. Also, the fact that there were no locks on the pool entry area is both a safety hazard (no lifeguard) and a security hazard. The sole waitress working the area on 6/20 ignored my family completely although we were sitting at a table on the patio, clearly emptyhanded, for over 20 minutes. We eventually walked to the bar and ordered from there. None of the 3 videogames in the \"game room\" worked...all ate my quarters. There is no air conditioning or fans in the lobby or on the patio outside...it was not a comfortable place to sit or wait for friends.

After finding out what hotel we would be staying at, I have to say I was very concerned. The Lafayette has not done well on the review side as you will see if you scroll down. That being said, my expectations were pretty low as we pulled up Saturday afternoon. We intentionally came after getting signed in downtown at the Marathon, as we had read about problems relating to the Lafayette and early check-ins. We arrived about 2:30 (check in is at 3:00) and were greeted by a friendly desk clerk who quickly, upon learning we'd like the quietest room possible since we'd need our rest and have to get up very early on Sunday, upgraded us to a presidential suite. Now granted, I can't imagine a president stepping foot in this hotel but...it was clean, twice the size of what we paid for (a discounted room at about $65/night) and as promised, was in the quietest part of the hotel complex. Being a Southern California resident and fairly well acquainted with San Diego, I really think your like or dislike of this place will depend on your level of expectation, as well as doing the reading on sites like this in terms of what to expect. With that in mind, here are a few observations that I would put high on the list of things to note if you are thinking of staying here: 1) As you've probably read, this is an old building that apparently was going to be condo'd a while back and by the looks of the permit request signs on the front windows, is in the midst of being sold or having new management come in. As such, the rooms are not terribly modern. There are cracks in the walls. Fixtures in our bathroom were drooping a bit and it just had the feel of a very worn place. From what I could tell, most of the place sort of falls into that category. 2) With most of the rooms surrounding the pool area, this hotel is catering mostly to young people (or very care-free families). There is piped in music all day around the pool and while I almost have to laugh when typing this, the vibe is sort of a very wannabe Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas. Lots of 20 somethings taking in the sun and drinking/laughing/partying. 3) There has been a lot written about the neighborhood. Again, it is all about what you expect or perceive but frankly, I was very surprised after arriving there because I found it to simply be a middle class, albeit old, neighborhood. I went out both nights and never felt the least bit concerned for my safety. All this being said, would I recommend the place? For the third or fourth time, it would depend on what that person was expecting for their money. If I was flying the family out from Green Bay for a week in sunny Southern California for our big vacation would I want to stay here: absolutely not. For a family vacation I would do the research and find a moderately priced (if money was a big concern) chain hotel around Hotel Circle where I would know exactly what to expect and which was close to all the attractions. If it was a couple I knew who were also coming down to SD for a weekend to see a ball game or run the Rock N Roll Marathon, I would have no problem suggesting it. My expectations may be lower than some. Unless I am specifically looking for a fancy, upscale place, I can deal with an old and outdated place if it is clean and the price is right. This isn't too say that some of the nightmare's you're reading about didn't happen but I cannot say they happened to me. I was far enough away from the circus at the pool that my wife and I both slept well before the marathon (something that, given the high stress level, could be tough at any hotel). I even used our free drink tickets Saturday afternoon and hung out on the patio overlooking the pool for a bit. So...at the end of the day, my suggestion is simple: If any of the things you've read, really worry you (noise, location, old rooms, etc), you should probably just find a Holiday Inn rather than risk being disappointed. If you want a fun place to cut loose at the pool and hang out with your friends on the cheap, you'll probably love it. I am in neither group and for me, the negative hype did not live up what I was expecting (thankfully!!!) and although it's far from the nicest place I've ever been, it is not even in the ballpark with the motel (national chain even) that I stayed at when I ran the marathon here in 2002 (but that is a horrible rant for another time!).

The place is not a \"dump\" as others have described, although there are some broken tiles in the bathrooms, the carpets are not immaculate, the furniture is scratched, the bathtub/shower is not pristine, etc. Breakfast is included, and they offer a waffle bar (always a line of people), fruit, cereal, toast, bagels, juices and milk. The pool is clean and decent. Our stay of three nights was quiet, and we were in a pool-side room in the back corner (don't remember the name or number of the \"suite\"). The Internet access was free and moderate in speed. The staff was not overly-friendly, but was not rude either, like others have suggested. Bottom line: the hotel is centrally-located in a moderate neighborhood (there are some adult clubs nearby), and for the money - in San Diego - it is a good value.", "Date": "August 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laguna Woods, CA", "Title": "\u201cLafayette Hotel\u201d", "Author": "GolferFolks", "ReviewID": "UR8494713", "Content": "Old Hotel but refurbished somewhat.

And the tenants from the run down apartments all around the hotel use the hotels pool and facilities as an extension of their own apartment. A very ugly place to stay. Then to make things worse, when we told the Front Desk that we needed another room, they didn't have one. So we checked out and they charged my credit card anyway. And as of 3 months later have refused to reverse the charge. So I have had to dispute the charge with my credit card company. A terrible place for a vacation or even a quick stay.

Another front desk clerk insulted me and accused me of \"crashing\" in the lobby when I was sitting and doing a Sudoku puzzle, and closed my eyes for a minute.

We are very seasoned traveller and have stayed in all type of hotels,motels etc all over the world and know what to expect from most places but ths place is just too misleading. We had a newly renovated room with balcony overlooking the pool (sounds good huh? ....well it wasn't!) the room was quite large but had a very odd smell, renovated meaning a lick of paint on a 60 year old door and someone had brushed the carpet. The balcony had a flooring of sharp loose gravel, very dirty old plastic chairs and a palm tree which encrouched into the room! The pool and this is probably unfair but it just looked dirty and so we didn't use it. Breakfast comes free but once again cheap produce and pretty much on a first come basis (don't leave it late). All in all we had pre booked and payed online through expedia (\u00c2\u00a350 per night) but we found it in a hotel voucher book we picked up in vegas but it wasn't called the Lafayette it just said inns & suites you could tell by the photo and the address and was $89 + tax about the same money so our advice would be look before you buy.", "Date": "June 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "AZ", "Title": "\u201cProblems\u201d", "Author": "TifGreen7", "ReviewID": "UR7713920", "Content": "I booked this hotel through a website for my family, for my Brother-In Law's b-day celebration. We drove into town from AZ expecting a long weekend in a nice hotel. The hotel staff, is not the nicest around. We called once from the road to see if we could check in early. They told us to call back in a couple of hours, we did and they promptly replied no. We had a sick family member with us. We got to the lobby and were told, we can have a room available in 20 min, great, it was better than nothing. 30 min passed and another couple walked in from the street and they were checked in, in no time. More time passed and eventually we were checked into both rooms, they upgraded us both to suites, we were satisfied. The room was old, we expected that. They had new carpet installed and some nice queen sized beds. The ceilings have major water damage and there are some nails sticking out of the ground due to the new flooring installed. The bathrooms were small, but cute. The shower itself was possessed; you either had really, really hot water, or really cold water. The drain didn't work; it would fill up as you showered. Then the next morning we found a roach. Yup on the side of the drapes, there it was a huge one. My mother in law caught it, they offered to have it taken out of the room and were told by maintenance that it was due to the flooring being put in. They offered us to switch rooms, but we figured hey, it's the flooring, it makes sense. We stayed. The next morning, we leave early, come back in the evening, and there is another one in our bedroom again. This time we call the staff downstairs and they state\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never had a complaint about roaches\" We state, well we called yesterday about one. They come up to get this one and then say, that it was due to the party they had the other night. In all, it made us not want to stay there again. You can excuse one as just chance and then 2 in a row means something is wrong there. Maybe we should have changed rooms, but you would think that charging $148 a night would be enough for them to make sure that they get an exterminator there. I would have loved to have a great nights sleep, but wondering what could be living under my bed was not good. The second night of finding one left us with a bad taste in our mouths. I read reviews about this place and thought to give it a chance.

Bar staff and maids were nice and requests for things such as fresh towels were brought to your room almost straight away.

The Lafayette is in walking distance to quite a few diners/restaurants and we never felt unsafe walking at night back to the hotel after a meal. Coco's Bakery Restaurant is probably the best to get a good meal at a reasonable price.

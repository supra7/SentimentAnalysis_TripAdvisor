There are cheap motels for under $80/nite or the InterContinental and Doral for $250/nite and up. As a business traveler, I look for something in the middle. What hotel will give me the most for a room where I will only be sleeping? I don't need a fancy pool, a full restaurant, ocean view, or a gym. I'm not on vacation. What I do need is a clean room, with decent linens (not towels that feel like sandpaper), bathroom, AC, and TV that work, wireless internet that works, and staff that get my reservation right. Continental breakfast helps but is not absolutely necessary. Just decent coffee. The La Quinta airport West has what I need for about $100 to $125/nite depepnding on the time of year. The rooms are spacious, the location is good, and the service is reasonably good. The elevator is rickety and they are going through some rennovations at this time. It is noisy someitmes. But overall, I like the price for what I get. The only time I really got upset with this particular hotel was when the Super bowl was in Miami and they chanrged $400/nite Thurs to Sun. There are two other La Quinta's in the area called \"North\" and \"east\". I've stayed at both and would not go back to either. There is a strip shopping center accross the parking lot with shops, restaurants, and a gas station. If other area hotels that offer full breakfast are priced within 10% of the la Quinta, I will stay at those. But usually the price differential is more like 20% and for that amount of money I can go out to eat.

Room was clean and beds were comfortable. No on-site restaurant or bar but front desk recommended several all within easy walking distance. Recommend Doral Ale House on 87th Avenue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we ate there for evening meals for both stays. Free complimentary breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c basic but acceptable.

Hotel allowed us a free late check-out (and stored our bags) due to evening flight home and we used free hotel shuttle back to the airport.

There are plenty of food options within walking distance (brick oven pizza, Tony Roma's, etc.) However, the hotel sits almost directly under one of the approach paths for Miami International, so be prepared for a moderate amount of airplane noise during the day (a bit less at night.) Front desk staff is very friendly and professional, and let me borrow a cell phone charger from the many they have stored behind the front desk. A number of things could definitely be improved about the property. Hallway carpeting is badly stained. Worse yet, many room doors are badly beaten and dented (almost as if people have been beating on them with hammers.) My room itself was clean, but digital clock was broken, TV remote batteries were dead, and tub faucet dripped steadily. The hotel management states \"if you can't give us a 10, let us know.\" I appreciate the commitment, but I really shouldn't have to complain to get my room to be right. A better program of regularly inspecting rooms and fixing them would please me more. The breakfast area was mobbed by large numbers of people every morning (not much can be done about that) but please - the selection is very poor (Corn Flakes or Froot Loops for cereal, waffles, hard boiled eggs, and bread items.) Healthier cereals, fruits, donuts should all be considered. Finally both my coworker and I were very disturbed by the extreme numbers of restaurant advertisements being pushed under our room doors daily. I travel extensively through the US and have never in my life seen a hotel this bad- amounting to 4 or 5 flyers per day. We ended up resorting to each shoving a towel in the crack under the room door just to prevent them from being shoved under. The hotel management alludes to the problem via a sign warning guests not to order food from any of these places. This really needs to stop. It is a major security issue to have random people wandering the hotel stuffing ads under doors.

My room was clean, spaceous with an interesting layout, perfectly comfortable bedding, fridge and microwave...and it was quiet despite the proximity to the airport...almost perfect. Staff was very friendly, pool area is beautiful, breakfast was good, too. The sorrounding area is safe and offers a wide variety of chain restaurants. I'd definitely come again. But...and this is not to ignore. If you consider the La Quinta as a base from which to explore Miami attractions, think again. Mapquest may tell you that it is only a 20 minute drive to the beach. But Miami traffic is really bad even on weekends. So expect to spend a considerable amount of time on the highway when getting to and from the hotel.

It has a couple of restaurants nearby. The room was nice and plenty of space for a sink and room for bathroom. The bed was comfortable and spacious. My biggest complaint with the hotel was the shuttle service. One of the shuttles drove close to the curb at the airport and was picking up passengers, and of course, this shuttle was to the \"other\" La Quinta. Another La Quinta shuttle was always passing by at a higher rate of speed. The shuttles run only til 10pm, after that you need a taxi to get to the hotel. So $14 later, I got to the hotel. I told them my complaint, they didn't seem too interested. I later asked for a shuttle for the next morning, the front desk person said, \"be here 10 minutes before the top of the hour and the shuttle leaves at the top of the hour.\" So, I think, no problem. Next morning, check out at 1045am for the 11 shuttle. I see the shuttle up front and the driver walking around. The front desk person told me to wait near the door, the shuttle would leave at 11. Well, before you know it, it is 11, then 1130 and 1145, the shuttle is still up front. The driver is having breakfast next door with a guy who is leaving for the airport at a later time. I had to catch a flight, so I called a shuttle to pick me up, another $25 to spend. Just made check in time for my flight to Newark.

It had a nice work desk, a recliner to sit in, and what felt like a comfortable bed. But...when I pulled down the covers to get into bed, the sheets were covered with small black hairs. It looked like they had not changed the sheets from the previous guest. The next morning when I got into the shower I noticed that the caulking in the shower was moldy. Nothing a decent cleaning and some bleach wouldn't fix, but it seems no one had done it for a while. The bathroom floor needed to be mopped as well. Most of the parking at the hotel is on the sides of the building, away from the main entrance. There are doors on the side of the building that will open with a room key. But the key readers were not working...in fact, it looked they had been ripped out. So someone wedged a rock between the door and the doorframe so it never closed. This may explain why I kept getting takeout menus from local restaurants slid under my door. The breakfast was pretty good. Nothing fancy, but it was decent. Would I stay here again...maybe.

The shower was nice, with a shower-pic shower head and a curved shower curtain which made the shower seem very spacious. The continental breakfast had a lot of choices; a typical hotel breakfast with cold cereal, juice, fruit, yogurt, bagels, danish, waffles. The staff was very nice and helpful. The shuttle service to the airport was good, but the hotel is about a 15-20 minute ride to/from MIA International. The benefit to being a little further from the airport is less airplane noise. The only problem we had this first stay was that the internet service didn't work. The second night we were on the third floor and the condition of the room wasn't as good as the first stay. The ceiling above the toilet was peeling, and the entire floor smelled kind of musty. The room was very clean, and the internet service worked this time. We ate supper both times at the Tony Roma restaurant located about 6 blocks away. The food and service were excellent. The first night we walked both directions, but the second night the shuttle driver from the La Quinta was kind enough to offer us a ride. The driver said that if he wasn't busy going to the airport or helping behind the desk, he could give us a ride. We really appreciated the lift because the weather was COLD when we were there.

Certainly the location is fabulous for conventioneers, a couple of blocks from the convention center and right on the edge of the Gaslamp District for easy access to restaurants. And despite numerous complaints from other visitors about the uncaring staff, I thought they were just fine, friendly, chatty and helpful, just not particularly 'corporate'. They didnt seem like career hoteliers, just nice folks. The lobby was a study in floral upholstered wicker and freezing cold during my visit. The in- house restaurant was fine for breakfast, although we found the Cafe 222 down the street to be much better. It was the rooms that made it so difficult, as they weren't just old fashioned, they were run down and positively reeked of mold. It's the first time I have ever felt that I had to go out and buy a scented candle, which didn't help all that much. When I asked the maintenance guy who came to show me how to adjust the temperamental room thermostat if all the rooms were so stinky, he told me that it was from new carpeting and curtains. But we all know what new smells like, and this wasn't it. The oddly shaped bathrooms had pedestal sinks without adequate room for toiletries, and the shower head was installed at such a low height it was barely manageable even for me, 5 foot 0 inches. The much touted in-room fireplaces have a single candlesized gas flame burning in a corner without even the benefit of some fake logs. The bed was comfortable. Had the owners tossed the synthetic gold colored 1960s Howard Johnson's looking bedspreads and gone with patchwork quilts or Victorian lace, the whole atmosphere would have been upgraded while staying in theme. And felt a great deal cleaner. For a hotel that caters so frequently to conventioneers, greater effort should be put into providing free or affordable wifi and adequate smartphone charging stations. Still, the atmosphere was so homey, so much like staying in an old house, that I adjusted quickly and focused on the coziness rather than the annoyances. I don't think it would necessarily be my first choice for a return visit, but at the $130 convention rate, neither would I object.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfax, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cBoutique Hotel...\u201d", "Author": "rlamond", "ReviewID": "UR123368349", "Content": "If you are used to the amenities and styles of the larger franchise hotels then I'd not recomment this for you.

First off and most importantly in my opinion - the hotel staff is very kind and attentive. Second, the location is absolutely perfect - especially if you are attending a conference at the convention center - it is only a couple blocks away, and it's very close to great restaurants, bars, and convenience stores. The decor is extremely interesting - think antique, elegant, possibly haunted (at least that seems to be what they're going for, though I never felt the presence of spirits or anything spooky during my stay). The elevator is old hydrolic style - slow and it smells like an old Grandma's perfume. The elevator slowly passes by windows into little rooms done up with really old items and dolls - interesting. The hotel room was comfortable and on the small side. My TV unfortunately had a small crack in it that was slightly annoying. The walls were dreadfully thin and you can hear every conversation of the people in the room next to you - but nothing the TV or earplugs won't drown out (so it didn't bother me). The bathroom was unique - it had an old style toilet with the water chamber up high and a pull chain to flush. The tub seemed newer and was nice and clean. In fact, the whole room was pretty clean. Overall I was very pleased with my stay. The only thing that frustrated me, may deter you from staying, and was the reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars was the fact that the wireless internet was terrible - they had an outside company handling it, so forget customer service and even though I paid a lot to have it for the week, it kept dropping out shortly after connecting. Don't expect to be able to work much on your laptop while you are here. It may be a common thing among all the hotels in the area, I just don't know.

First of all, its location is very good. While securely in the Gaslamp area, it is toward the west of the area, and so is an easy walk to the convention center - about 5 minutes. The rooms are nicely decorated, and we found the bed to be acceptable, neither hard as rock nor soft. Most rooms have a small balcony with two chairs and a working gas fireplace, although they really need to repaint the chairs. I would not sit on them. The bathrooms are more than adequate and are attractive. We never had an issue with hot water - there was plenty. The toiletries provided were above average. It is an old hotel, so you get a lot of charm. Like all things in life, there is the other side of the coin. Because the hotel is antique, there are some expectations you must suspend. Soundproof rooms are among those. We could hear every sound, other than voice, from the room above us (consider requesting the fourth floor). There are no mini-bars or coffee machines in the hotel. They will have room service soon but they do not now. Having room service and a seven-days-a-week, regularly open restaurant will help tremendously. Our understanding is that this is in the works and will be a reality soon. Internet is not free but it is not badly priced either at $29.95 for 4 days; there is a 7 day package also. There is a Starbucks right around the corner, so you can access the Internet there if you don't want to pay. The staff were very friendly to chat with, and we enjoyed talking with them. Customer service could be improved in these ways. First, we were not given much information when we arrived. We didn't even know until the morning we left that there was coffee in the lobby. There were no suggestions for restaurants, etc. We arrived way early, and they kindly checked our bags for us. They were very accommodating, and had our room ready two hours early. We can hardly complain about our treatment in that regard. However, when I tried to inquire as to suggestions for where we could have lunch or otherwise pass a few hours until we could check in, I was pretty much ignored. We left, wandered around, and ate at an ok but really expensive place that we found. Second, and I know this will seem nit-picking but it was pretty important to us at the time, they had no change for metered parking outside. We had to rent a car for a couple days for some dress-up events, and, right after we picked up the car, had to park the car for an hour while we changed into our fancy clothes. When I asked for change for the meters, I was fairly well dismissed, and told, no, we don't have any change. I expect more, I admit it. The Poogs and I were able to scrounge together enough change for 20 minutes, so we ran upstairs and changed pronto. In case you don't know, there is no non-metered parking in the Gaslamp area. That experience really stuck with me, I think because they weren't very nice about it and seemed put out that I would even ask. There wasn't really a place around there where we could get change without making it a hike. And, honestly, I really didn't need to rush when I had to be dressed up, made up, and have twinkles in my eyes. If you are young, and have not stayed in old hotels like the Horton, you should do so, at least once. There is an elevator, which is more than I can say for many of the old hotels I have stayed in over the years. As old farts, I think our boutique-y, antique hotel days might be over. I love having a coffee machine in my sound-proof room when I travel.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florham Park", "Title": "\u201cElegance and Charm\u201d", "Author": "Colinscott779", "ReviewID": "UR118190127", "Content": "The Horton Grand is a superior mix of old world charm and modern day luxury.

Though I've stayed at some of the higher level \"resort\" hotels on the bay (e.g. Marriott), I've been lately staying at smaller, more intimate hotels in order to reduce costs (the govt. rate hasn't really kept up with reality in areas like San Diego) as well as to blend in more with the local culture. If you've been to San Diego, and done their \"bus\" tour, you'll know the Horton as the one with all the innate, ironwork composing the facade of the building, and also that it is probably one of the older \"classy\" hotels in this area having been built by Mr. Horton, who made his fortune developing this area back when San Diego was a lot of mud. Obviously, now it's a land of million-dollar condos, glitz, sun, and really nice weather, not to mention a serious marina-like enviornment with great seafood. I liked my stay here. On the plus side,..this is one really old and authentic hotel. You can almost feel the ghosts in this building, and I'm sure if they exist, they've been very hospitable. It seems most of the architecture is original from the fireplaces and bathroom fixtures, to the chairs and furniture scattered throughout. The main stairway is something out of the Stephen King \"Shining\" movie. If you walk around here at night, you're feeling like you might run into a ghost, or at least, that you're being watched. Like some other reviews, I did notice that the staff is just a bit under pressure during the 10AM - 2PM time slot, but otherwise, I found them very pleasant and helpful. I did not have a car. Early morning and evenings, the staff was very friendly. I had a good conversation with a couple of them this week about how our IRAs and 401Ks had dropped about 20% during the last week. They didn't seem to mind that I actually worked for the government either. Really, just down-to-earth, real people with no pretences. Staff at some of the \"resort\" hotels around here can seem a bit too plastic for me. The restaurant was \"down\" during my 3 night stay. A bummer since I DO like a good breakfast to start my working day out, but Starbucks was 1 block away. The rooms are comfortable. Big bathrooms (just like in the good old days) with a separate door. The bed was very comfortable. Rooms have good airconditioning as well as a ceiling fan, making for a very good nights sleep. No coffee makers in the room, but there's a fresh pot in the lobby. The location is superb. Since it's really on 4th and thus, 1 block off 5th which is where the action focuses, I found it very quiet and peaceful. It's only about 4-5 stories high also, which shelters it completely from the tram lines. The latter by the way, are pretty bad if you stay at the big resorts (like the Marriott). Walking distance to the marina and anything else you'd want to do in this part of town. There is no gym. There are drink and ice machines to cool off with. Too bad about the restaurant. It looks really cool with all the authentic, victorian-like furniture, original artwork and scultures, and millwork. If the restaurant was working, then I'd have had a perfect time. From what I understand, the restaurant usually serves breakfast/lunch, but I seem to recall that dinner is not served (which is okay,..there are great restaurants located nearby (try the Thai at Rama's, about 1 block away). The maid service was superb. Rooms were super clean. I had no problems with anything of this sort. In summary, if you're into history and like old hotels, stary here. You'll have hours of exploring to do. The courtyard is something I've not seen before. Very authentic again, and quite charming. I would recommend though calling ahead to find out about the restaurant. Having even a coffee maker in the room would have been nice. Very quiet. I had some hours to kill, and enjoyed myself, just laying in bed and finishing a novel I'd brought with. Wireless was reasonably good. It was about 9.95 per day,..or 40 bucks for a week I think. This is a typical fee around here. The elevator works well. On one side, you can look out into little museum-like displays as you're riding it up and down. Overall, a very pleasant stay.

Only Grandma's really not much of a housekeeper, a hostess, an entertainer, or a decorator, and she and cooking don't get on, either. What a disappointment this hotel turned out to be. We were in San Diego for Comic-Con, so the given understanding is that all the hotels are maxed out and you have to settle for whichever hotel you get; but the other side of that is the expectation that the hotel will be more than \"just a bed\", particularly when paying over $200/night and paying another fortune in parking fees. We were staying over a week, so this was NOT an overnighter type of experience. First off, the customer service is nonexistent to abysmal, with occasional flashes of good. The answer for any issues whenever I called the hotel (if they ever answered the phone) to ensure our (medically necessary) room requirements would be handled was, \"Well, it's Comic-Con, we can't promise anything.\" This held true when we were on site and asking for things like restaurant recommendations (\"really can't say\", \"oh, there's lots here\", \"go a couple of blocks\") and repeated requests for a couple of extra towels. On the plus side -- we did get the bed size we needed, thanks to the woman who checked us in. And when the toilet backed up and overflowed, housekeeping was right there to take care of it (once someone answered the phone). And, after a few days of us angrily requesting two extra towels EVERY afternoon (in person, because we got tired of hearing the phone ring for 5 minutes before someone answered it), the maids started leaving them. And we only had to call two of three times to ask why, when we'd been gone for hours with the \"make up room now please\" sign hanging on the door, our room was not made up. This place would have been great, if it was a bed and breakfast. Only...there is no breakfast. Well, there sort of is. There's a \"restaurant\" that, should it ever be open, you can get, and pay through the nose for, a breakfast. It was never open whenever we wanted it, so no review of that. It does have a quaint little bar that was well stocked, and the bartender was very pleasant. The rooms are small. I have no idea why the term \"suites\" is in this hotel's listing, but we never saw, nor had an option for, a suite. There were only 2 extra plugs for computers and phone chargers, the chair at the desk was too low to make typing comfortable, and the TV is hidden behind mirrors. There was an armoire with 3 whole hangers, and, after begging and the gal who checked us in searching all over, we managed to score 5 more. (Remember, we were there for over a week.) The room did have a plethora of doors, and the fireplace in the room had a mantel, so we were able to make do. The air conditioning -- oh, the air conditioning. Thank God there was a ceiling fan in this room. The A/C worked...but it took rocket science to get the bizarre \"timer system\" to function. Following the directions meant you were in a constant circular trap of setting the temperature to what you wanted, only to turn that off the moment you \"confirmed\" the setting. Some rooms have windows that open, ours did not, which we knew when checking in (though we had no idea the A/C was so cleverly set up to never turn on when we said that no opening windows would be fine). Everything in this room was made for tall people (we're short) EXCEPT the shower, where we had to hunch over to wash our hair. The tall person this room was made for would need to shower on his or her knees. There is no pool. There is no gym. There is sort-of room service -- I only know this because someone had tea and what appeared to be toast. I know what they seemed to have because they left the dishes on a side table in the hall on our floor...where they remained for a week or more. For all I know, they're still there -- they were still there when we checked out. (Yes, you're reading this right -- there were 2 little teapots, 2 cups, 2 saucers, silverware, and what looked like butter cups on a table in the middle of a hall every maid walked at least twice a day...that remained there for at least a week or more. And yes, they were all dirty.) There were no glasses or cups in the room. The gal who managed to find hangers also found some Styrofoam cups I'm fairly sure she snuck out of the employee break room for us. Carpet was stained, the bedspread was stained. The walls were clean, the bed was fine, nothing great, but sleepable. The place IS quiet, and there was never a long wait for the elevators, and the stairs were also easily available. It's historic, and if we'd been paying $100/night we'd probably have thought it was fine. At well over $200/night, this is a rip off of the highest order. IF you're into the whole \"quaint\" idea of lots of old furniture and absolutely no amenities, this is the hotel for you. Next year, I plan to stay with Uncle Hilton, who actually comprehends why the kids like to have a pool available and restaurants to eat at.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cQuirky hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "MacamoDC", "ReviewID": "UR114985001", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at the Horton Grand Hotel.

The location is great and the rooms are not too bad for the age of the hotel but the service is horrible. We thought the hotel was pretty empty given its location but after experiencing the service there it made complete sense. We received bad service on 3 different occasions. 1st incident. At check in the lady was short and brief with us. We were told there was no restaurant or room service. Saturday morning we walked down and sure enough the hotel restaurant was open. The employee at the restaurant there was complaining that it was extremely slow and had no customers. We told her its due to the fact that the restaurant is not really promoted there and and sometimes told that there is no restaurant. Maybe its easier to say there isn't a restaurant then to give out their hours? The restaurant does not open on Mondays. 2nd incident was Saturday morning. I left the valet ticket in the mail box since i had to leave really early and my wife was still in the room. Wife came down and the lady at the front desk was busy on a personal call. Wife had to clear her throat a few times if you know what i mean. Then she was short and brief with my wife and told her she couldn't find the valet ticket. Once she looked in the mailbox where the valet guy said he was going to put it she found it. 3rd incident. Our friends checked out early on Saturday and were waiting for their vehicle at the valet area at the same time we were. The valet guy brought the car around and loaded the luggages with our friends help. The valet guy quickly left to get our vehicle since my wife and I had also been waiting. All good up to that point. As the valet guy went to get our vehicle our friends realized that they didn't tip him so they waited for him to come back. My friend tried to tip him and the valet guy rejected his tip. Apparently he was hurt because he didn't tip him right away? I thought that was hilarious but what he did was extremely rude. So to sum it all up the service is horrible and the employees there don't seem very happy to be working there. If your not big on customer service then this is the hotel for you.

When we arrived, we were offered an upgrade to a balcony room by the nice lady with long hair at the front desk. She warned us there would be a lot of noise from a neighboring nightclub. We accepted (being no strangers to noise!) and loved the room on the top floor. It was clean, charming, the bed was comfortable and, having brought along a little \"white noise\" gadget, the nightclub music and \" whooping\" did not disturb us. If you are sensitive to noise, there are plenty of rooms away from the nightclub and you are given plenty of warning. The next day, we went out early. I came back to drop off some purchases, and was asked by one of the housekeepers if we were checking out or staying. We'd had the \"please make up this room\" sign on the doorknob when we left in the morning. I told her we were staying, and then ran out to go to an early dinner. When we got in, later afternoon, the room still wasn't made up and there were no housekeepers to be seen. We had to start getting ready for an evening event and didn't want to have to vacate the room. I saw an abandoned housekeeping garbage/dirty linen cart in one of the halls when I was doing my \"search\", so we made the bed, I emptied the garbage into the large plastic bag, and threw the towels into the laundry cart . Couldn't find the clean towel cart, so my husband called down to the desk to say that the room had never been made up, and could we please have some clean towels. The desk person said yes, and in about forty-five minutes, a housekeeper came to the door with towels. She asked if we needed anything else, and I told her I had already taken out the trash, etc. She said, \"Oh, thank you...\" and went on to chat a bit. I have to say, even with nobody worried that our room was never cleaned, they were all very friendly and nice. The valets were great--really fast and asked if we needed directions when we were heading out. We consider including the valet parking charge as one of the costs of staying there. It's a busy downtown location and you don't want to spend valuable holiday time searching for parking. The restaurant in the hotel is closed Friday through Sunday, so we went a block away to Starbucks and brought back some breakfast to have on our balcony. A hotel bar is advertised, but we never saw anyone there. We saw people waiting for the valet with drinks, so I'd imagine if you asked at the desk, someone would make you a drink. Actually, we saw empty glasses on a small table near the elevators, and they were still there the next day, so there might be drinks somewhere, or people brought something back to their rooms. It would have be nice to have tea or coffee in the hotel without having to make the Starbucks run. There were some interesting displays around the hotel, and a sign offering tours followed by another sign saying \"No more tours\"! The hotel kind of had the feeling of being only partially staffed, there didn't seem to be many guests around, and it felt a little-- sad. It's such a lovely hotel, resonably priced, and I'd love to be able to recommend it, but to be honest, I'd have to say that I wouldn't be very tempted to return. The housekeeping thing may have been a fluke, and I'm sure if I'd have insisted, the room would have been cleaned after we left for the evening.

Con- However, the carpet in my room was matted and stained, and the place didn't seem particularly clean over all, e.g. there was a dirty men's sock in my armoire. To print my boarding pass in the lobby, they were going to charge me $5, which is annoying. Finally, I was not particularly impressed with the Gaslamp area, overall.

I used to roam the other, bigger hotels during my 13 years of going to con, but once I found this one about five or six years ago, I never looked back. First, the staff: They are all super nice and efficient. A couple of them are also hilarious. Any questions they've got answers pronto, checking in/out is a breeze, and if for some reason you need a cab, it's there in moments. The staff is there if you need them, and leave you alone if you clearly want to be left alone. Second, the rooms: They are comfortable and cute. I very much appreciate the option to do a small part for the environment by not having your sheets laundered every day. (I wash my sheets once weekly at home. This is the same thing.) For me, a person who can't stand air conditioning, it's fabulous that if you turn off the air when you leave, it's still off when you get back! It's also very quiet and peaceful in the rooms and the hotel in general. This is not a party hotel, which I very much appreciate. When I get off the giant, sensory overload exhibit floor that is Comic-Con, I want peace & quiet and no random loud parties popping up in the next room. When I get to my hotel, I know I can fully relax and actually sleep. Third, the building: I love being in an historic space and wandering around early morning or late at night looking at all the details. After several years staying there, 2010 was the first time I noticed the beautiful 17th-century carriage under the staircase on the second floor! The restoration job on the place is excellent, and the displays all throughout the place are wonderful. Fourth, the location: For me, it's a perfect location. Step out the door and to my left is Cafe 222, my fave breakfast spot. To my right is a bank with two working ATMs and rarely any line, a critical need for the convention. I'm steps away from Sushi Nippon, The Field and The Cheese Shop (which also delivers to the Horton Grand if you're too lazy to walk 1.5 blocks). There is also an independent mini-grocery half a block away for when you discover you forgot to pack your toothpaste or lost another lighter. And of course it's within easy striking distance of the convention center, especially if you cut through the parking lot on Second Ave. Simply put, the Horton Grand Hotel has absolutely everything I need in a hotel for Comic-Con. Because I haven't quite kicked the habit yet, I do wish there was an ashtray somewhere out front. The Horton Grand, like most hotels these days, is a non-smoking facility. The closet space is period-correct, so bring your own hangars if you have too many outfits!", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cA unique gem in the middle of cookie cutter high rises\u201d", "Author": "EllisMarche", "ReviewID": "UR72500352", "Content": "I had no idea what to expect from this hotel.

You'd think they'd get more people for a holiday. Similarly, the line to check in was long because there was only 1 woman at front and she wasn't overly friendly or apologetic for the wait. And the hotel did not have any extras. Even though the website shows a restaurant, there is none, even though the phones show room service, there is none, no book in the room to explain anything and no soaps or toiletries, and the fixed shampoo container was empty. These may be petty to some but it's pretty much a standard at hotels less than this one (i.e Comfort Inn). And it was loud.

But after turning on the air conditioning, a mere 24 hours later the room reached a comfortable temperature. The bathroom was the smallest I've ever experienced but it was clean. The only other negative about the bathroom was the toilet. It's been a while since I encountered a toilet with a wooden tank that sits high on the wall... but that's what they had. Over the days I even got used to the loud whooshing noise it made each time it was flushed. In fact it was so loud you dare not flush it at night because you'll surely wake your spouse... and maybe even the people in adjoining rooms.

We had to catch an early flight and each day as we met a new desk clerk we asked if getting our valet parked car at 4:00 AM was going to be a problem since the valet is only there once in a while. They assured us it wasn't going to be a problem. Well they were all wrong. When we got to the front desk there was nobody there. There was a roughly scribbled sign that said will be back in 5 minutes or call [--]. After 5 minutes I called the number and got a lady who said she was in the parking garage down the street but she would be there in 2 minutes. After 10 minutes she finally showed up and was the meanest nastiest desk clerk I've ever encountered. She berated me for being concerned about making my flight. I told her I'd tell the Western Foodservice Expo staff of my experience and she threateneds to call the police for threatening her. She seemed to be crazy but maybe it was just a drug induced rage or something of that nature. In any case she eventually brought us our car which she parked down the street next to a tree so as to make it difficult to get in the front door. I could go on and on but in the interest of brevity let me just say... BEWARE OF THE HORTON!

One desk clerk made a comment to me about another guest, and while I agreed with his sentiments I thought it was more than a little unprofessional. The rooms vary in size and decoration. My room was comfortable despite cracking paint and water stains on the bathroom walls. My co-workers room was filled with plastic wicker furniture and a lamp that made the room a horrid shade of pink when lit. The rooms were clean in appearance though I found used silverware outside my door on two days of my stay (not left by myself) The bell staff at the Horton worked hard. They were always kind and did the best they could given the guest volume. I had to wait 15 minutes to get my car, that issue I fault management for and not the staff, who were obviously doing the best they could. The final thing that is simply bizarre has to do with the elevators. In addition to the jerky and unnerving stopping and starting, the hotel created extremely odd window scenes for your \"enjoyment\" when going up to the rooms.

They do have breakfast, and apps for dinner, but for a meal you'll need to go elsewhere. The storage for your clothes is inadequate as the furniture is antique. Nice rooms - very cool - but made for people with just a few garments. Another annoyance is that while the rooms do have irons they only have dormitory sized ironing boards.

The restaurant was always closed and there was no room service. Due to this, one of us ordered a pizza and the staff refused to let the delivery person into the building. They called the room and stated \"We don't allow delivery people into our hotel.\". We had to go down and pick up the pizza outside of the front entrance to the hotel. The ceiling in one of the rooms started leaking water directly onto the bed. The solution to this problem was for the staff to come up and move the bed aside as the water continued to drip onto the floor instead. We had used the valet service but did not feel like getting the car out as we did not want to risk losing the parking space. We politely asked the valet to get us a cab, to which he rudely responded, \"I don't hail cabs.\". We decided to have him retrieve the car and when he returned he waited impatiently for us to tip him (which we did not!). About four of us sat in the courtyard one night playing a board game. We were laughing and having a good time but not being too noisy. However, a member of staff told us to be quiet so we decided to stop playing the game and just relax and talk. Another group came out to the courtyard and I guess they were too noisy because the same guy came back and yelled at us (a group of 30 year olds, mind you). He told us we all had to leave and we motioned over to the other group and he kicked them out as well. He went as far as turning off the lights strung about the courtyard. Our key cards never worked, we'd use them once and then have to get new ones. The rooms were booked in my husband's name and so even though we would present our key cards, they wouldn't give us new ones if our names weren't on the reservation. They even did this to members of our party that they had personally checked into the room. My husband had to call each time, until we finally suggested they write down the names of every person in our party.

Beautiful and well appointed room, except no hair dryer for wife who had to wait 25 minutes to get one from housekeeping and it disappeared when we got back the next day.

Though our room was smallish, it wasn't any different than a room found in any other major city like New York or London. And despite its lack of size, it was very well-accommodated with lovely furnishings and an extremely comfortable bed. The hotel itself was elegant and stately and after long days of sightseeing and even longer evenings of enjoying the nightlife, it was always a pleasure to return to the hotel with its grand lobby and blessed air-conditioning. The staff was gracious and we were especially appreciative of the concierges in particular who never steered us wrong with their recommendations. We also loved the location which was close enough to walk almost everywhere, but just far enough off the strip so that you weren't directly in the middle of the never-ending action. The only cons were an unusually long wait for what equated to a mediocre breakfast in the dining room (despite it being relatively empty) and a less-than-stellar view from our window which included the backside of some dirty, dingy buildings. However, there's not much that can be done in terms of the view beyond upgrading to a room with a better one. And we did have a fantastic meal at Domenica, the hotel's Italian-style restaurant; which sort of made up for the breakfast. Though this was our first trip to the Big Easy, I hope it won't be our last as we thoroughly enjoyed our time in NOLA and wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Roosevelt again should we return.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cAnticipation!!\u201d", "Author": "nik35805", "ReviewID": "UR139513896", "Content": "Ok, this review will be updated after my actual stay.

There is good reason for why this hotel receives such positive reviews and I can only second the comments made by several other reviewers. Once you pass through the entrance doors at either end of the hotel, you enter a world of grandeur, old-world elegance, comfort and luxury. This hotel generates the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd factor a hundred-fold. Just taking a stroll through the lobby is a magnificent experience given its form and d\u00c3\u00a9cor which is basically that of a grand, ornate hall comprised of mosaic tile floors, decorative columns, gilded trim, hand-painted wall murals, coffered ceilings and chandeliers that runs the length of a city block. On a previous occasion I have walked through the lobby in December when it is bedecked with Christmas decorations and it is a sight to behold! The hotel is centrally located in downtown New Orleans just off Canal Street and within easy walking distance of the French Quarter. The circumjacent area encompasses a typical metropolitan environment though perhaps a little dingier than that which may be experienced in other, contemporary, American cities. To be frank \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and some may disagree \u00e2\u20ac\u201c New Orleans is a bustling town that retains neighborhoods and districts exemplifying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bygone Southern and/or antebellum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd charm but, aside from those areas, the city is not all that appealing and it has seen better days. Hence, the rather pronounced difference between the circumjacent area outside the hotel and the swish environment within the hotel which is obvious but a welcoming experience. Bear in mind though that many other hotels in New Orleans will likewise be surrounded by commercial buildings and activities that may be unattractive. Basically, a sensation of calm and opulence envelops you once you are within the confines of the hotel. Customer service, quality and the overall setting help make the place. The staff is courteous and attentive and they seem genuinely concerned about their guests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 welfare. Not only do they make an effort to be helpful but, they also make you feel welcome. The hotel is comprised of an older wing/building (original Roosevelt Hotel), located on Baronne Street, and a later wing/building, containing the formal lobby entrance on O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keefe Street, that are interconnected in such manner that it all seems to be one complex. Given the height of several nearby buildings, you will, however, need to be on the higher floors to enjoy any kind of view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c probably the 10th floor or higher though this is pure speculation. (Note: The hotel is comprised of 14 floors.) The rooms are very clean and comfortable. They are stylishly furnished and decorated in such manner so as to evoke that sensation of classical grandeur, elegance and luxury that I mentioned earlier. Moreover, both the bedroom and bathroom are well-appointed with all the accoutrements that denote a high-class establishment such as quality linens, towels, robes, slippers and other amenities. We were in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Superior King\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room which means you actually have a separate sitting/living room and bedroom. To be frank, for us it was like having a spacious mini-suite. The nightly turn down service with chocolates is a nice touch. In our case, we were in Room 1302 in the old wing that afforded us a nice, unobstructed view eastward over downtown towards the Mississippi River (in distance) as well as the Southeast part of the French Quarter. Though we came to visit the Vieux Carre and partake of the various cultural activities and venues to be enjoyed therein, I can easily see couples opting to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hole up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd inside their room for a few days and enjoy a romantic interlude. There is no reason to leave the confines of the hotel to have a great time! Another somewhat unexpected but enjoyable feature of this hotel is their outdoor, roof-top pool and sunbathing deck which can be a relaxing respite after spending time wandering around the French Quarter. Both the layout and fixtures in this recreational facility are more synonymous with the arrangement that one may find at a typical seaside resort - particularly when you add in the bar, eatery and towel kiosk coupled with the ambient music heard in the background (through speakers). While lazing in a reclining chair and sipping a tropical cocktail, if one closes their eyes and clears their mind, one can easily forget where they are and, instead, think they are somewhere far away \u00e2\u20ac\u201c certainly not in the heart of downtown New Orleans. Only by opening your eyes and seeing the surrounding buildings brings you back to reality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though it is somewhat unusual to be observing these monolithic edifices from a height other than ground level, particularly the two spires of the cathedral next door. Given the climate of New Orleans during the summer season \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hot, humid and sunny - the pool is not only very popular but also quite lively. Finding a vacant chaise can be difficult during the afternoons though the towel attendants will endeavor to find you one as they become available. Another neat aspect was that people were friendly and strangers would talk to each other. Lastly, it is worth noting that the prices of cocktails and food from the poolside bar/grill were not bad and, in fact, equal to or modestly cheaper than the prices found at most other hotels of comparable stature as well as that of many resorts. Though the hotel supposedly contains a world-renown spa \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Guerlain Spa \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we did not utilize this facet of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amenities. However, we did dine at the Sazerac Restaurant located within the hotel on the lobby level. The food quality was excellent, the service was decent and the prices were okay (I\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcve seen worse pricing at many other hotel restaurants). Unfortunately, the interior setting and decor of the restaurant is perhaps a tad unexciting or cool which leads to a lackluster ambience or setting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but, hey, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just my opinion. In contrast, the adjoining Sazerac Bar is rather unique, funky, popular and worth a visit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if for no other reason than its historical context. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website (via the Hilton website) is well-designed, informative and contains several photographs. We recommend that prospective customers check it out. One special feature of their online booking process is the opportunity to pre-purchase an option on a room upgrade that is confirmed at check-in if the upgrade category is available for a very reasonable fee. If not available, then you pay nothing and retain the rate and room category originally booked. This is a great way to potentially have a higher caliber room and live the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd life for a nominal amount. We did it and obtained the upgrade to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Superior King\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd category for just $29.00. They also proffer upgrade options involving larger fees which will upgrade you to higher categories. I think this is a neat idea and I wish more hotels would do this. After all this positive commentary one may naturally ask \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what are the negatives? There are none per se. But, there are a few things you may wish to consider. They are subjective in nature and may be inconsequential for some. Though we did not stay in a room on a floor near street level and experience it firsthand I could see how traffic and related street noise could be troublesome at certain times. Obviously, for light sleepers and people from other time zones, such noise can make sleeping difficult and the room environment less relaxing. But, this is something that can happen at other hotels situated in an urban environment. The cost of utilizing the mini-bar is high and I highly recommend buying your drinks and snacks elsewhere. There are plenty of options nearby. Moreover, in light of the very sophisticated control system for monitoring consumption I strongly suggest that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go near it at all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unless you truly wish to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and keep the kids away from it or you may incur charges even though you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use anything. To avoid using the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internet services and costs associated therewith I had my own mobile Wi-Fi device (Verizon) with me. However, curiously, my device would not work within my room which was totally mystifying to say the least. I have no idea why it would not work but that was my experience. I even called my cellular provider for assistance but they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help me nor explain it. So, be forewarned that you may encounter similar problems. Parking is available at the hotel but it is very expensive. Though street parking can be found throughout the surrounding area the parking rules, time limits and payment methods are complicated such that I advise against parking on the street. It is NOT worth the hassle!!! There are parking garages nearby that charge less than the hotel but, not necessarily a lot less. The best solution \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need your vehicle while staying at the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is utilizing one of the parking lots within the area but slightly further away from the hotel that proffer discounted rates by pre-booking or via coupons and promotional codes. I obtained a discount code online from the website of one of the lot operators with allowed me to pay just $10.00/day (less than 25% of the cost of overnight parking at the hotel). This particular lot was in the southwestern fringes of the French Quarter within 10 mins.-walk of the hotel. Check out the website for Central Parking in New Orleans which has three lots in the French Quarter that currently offer the ten-dollar rate. Finally, in light of my aforementioned observations regarding certain expensive services found at the hotel, I wish to make an overall comment about the cost of using this hotel. This is a high-end hotel and thus it is not a cheap lodging option for staying in New Orleans \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly with the addition of the lodging tax (13% or so). However, for what you get \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an experience of grandeur, elegance, luxury and service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the rates and prices charged by this hotel are relatively fair and apropos their lower room categories rather decent. On numerous occasions I have either observed or experienced many other hotels and hotel chains within the peer group to which this hotel belongs, as well as several lesser-tier hotels, both in New Orleans and elsewhere, charging higher room rates but without the awesome experience. There are certainly many less-expensive lodging options to be had in New Orleans. However, at this point it is important to recall the old adage that you get what you pay for. One of the benefits of higher pricing is that it normally ensures a better level of clientele. Apropos our stay, the hotel did not appear full and we obtained a greater level of comfort, satisfaction and enjoyment that may not have been experienced at lesser-priced and/or lower grade hotels. We highly recommend this hotel because of its classical appearance, elegant feel, clean and well-appointed rooms, quality facilities, good food, and excellent customer service.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, OR", "Title": "\u201cTop Notch\u201d", "Author": "Lady_Nafziger", "ReviewID": "UR138231055", "Content": "I had business to do in New Orleans so my husband and I decided to make a weekend of it before the work week as we were celebrating our birthdays on top of it all. We planned to use Hilton Honors points for the weekend and then booked a separate reservation not using points. This hotel is spendy -- $200 + but you get what you pay for. We had serious issues getting to the hotel due to airline issues so we ended up not arriving until a day after our reservation. I had called the hotel and Hilton Customer Service (I am a Diamond Member) to let them know we were going to miss our first night and to get a refund on 50,000 points. I must say I was so thankful with the service and while it took a little while on the phone to accomplish due to computer systems it wasn't a problem. My points were refunded and I was still able to use points for the second night stay. When we finally arrived at the hotel the next afternoon around 4pm the valet staff is so friendly. They should be for $40.00 a day to park the car, but they deserve the tips they earn. I tipped extra on this trip. The valet parking is directly across the street and while we didn't need the car during our weekend stay I did need it during the week for three days of work. By the time I called down and took the elevator the car was waiting. Our check in was pleasant as well - the front desk really goes the extra mile. We were told we were upgraded to a King Suite but that they were running behind on getting the rooms ready. They gave us drink vouchers to use in The Sazerac Bar (which is a nice quiet beautiful place in itself)and when the wait extended to two hours we asked for additional and more were given. The bar has many unique drinks worth trying. It helped take the edge off the wait and I must say the room was wroth it. WOW. The room was just amazing, clean, the bed is one of the best out of all of the Hiltons I've stayed in over the years. Robes are provided, slippers, two rooms, three tv's -- flat screen in the living room, one in the bedroom and a smaller one in the bathroom. Do not touch the mini bar fridge if you do not want to get charged. We new ahead of time that if anything was touched you own it. They do go to great lenghts to tell you this -- their is a card in with your room key as well. The mini bar is expensive -- $10.00 for M&M so go to the CVS a block away if you have a chocolate craving. The bathroom is small but clean and very nice. The shower had jets which were fabulous and made up for the smallness of the shower area and the lack of a tub. That would really be my only criticism -- tub would have been nice. The tile work in the shower and floor is elegant as well. Maid service is great too - with bed turn downs and chocolates left. I did dine at Domenica as well -- the food was great and the atmosphere is casual. This hotel is a great location as well -- sits on Canal across the street from Bourbon and is just a minute walk to everything. We also walked to the French Quarter within 10 - 15 minutes with no problems. Close to everything. The best part was it was quiet. We did not hear a lot of hotel noise or street noise which was fabulous. We were at the end of a hallway though which helped on our floor. I've stayed at other hotels in New Orleans before and this one has them all beat by several stars. I'd stay here again without a doubt. It's a beautiful hotel, with excellent service.

As a Hilton Honors member, was looking to keep it \"in the family\" and find a nice hotel with convenient access to both the Central Business District and the French Quarter. The property was formerly the Fairmont Hotel and has one of the most gorgeous and ornate lobbies - think very gilded, Art Deco style. My host in New Orleans explained to me that during Christmas time the lobby is totally decked out with unbelievable decorations. A few days prior to my arrival, I received an email from the hotel concierge introducing himself and inquiring if I needed any reservations during my stay. Didn't require his help, but it was a very nice touch. Front desk staff were very friendly, efficient, and knowledgable. Thanks to my Hilton Honors status I was upgraded to a luxurious one bedroom suite. Very neatly appointed with a spacious living room containing plush furnishings. It was perfect for a short business meeting with two other colleagues. Would be ideal for corporate recruiting or any other situation requiring a nice private space for a meeting. Down the hall was the bedroom with king bed. Fantastic mattress and comfy linens. I was on the 8th floor in Tower 1. A teensy bit of street noise did come in during the night - but mostly motorcycles revving their engines so it would have been hard to miss unless you were on the 50th floor of some building. And hey, it's New Orleans if you don't like street noise, you aren't going to like this city. Bathroom had both multi-head shower and a separate bathtub. Grabbed cocktails at the Sazerac Bar and enjoyed a couple of the namesake cocktails. The environment was incredible - again a very stylized Art Deco room with a beautiful bar area. Good place that got pretty busy on a Tuesday night. Only knock against Sazerac was that they did not offer any food beyond the bar snacks (cornnuts, pretzels, and really tasty truffled potato chips) Headed for dinner at Domenica - the Italian bistro in the hotel. I'll do a separate review there - but it was excellent. After dinner wandered one block from the hotel down to Bourbon street to take in that scenery. Conveniently located to take in all that the Quarter has to offer and stumble back easily.

Well it shows. The hotel was first opened in the late 1800s. The 2009 renovation returned the hotel to a 1920s splendor. The main lobby is a giant open area all the way to the other side of the building. Everything about this place gives the feel of old-school luxury and opulence. I was there for a conference and spent most of my time in the convention center part of the building. It felt bigger on the inside than it looked on the outside. The staff was very attentive. My room was quite small. Don't be discouraged though. I willingly accepted a small room because i was travelling alone and didn't need much space. From the floor map (on the back of the room door), it was obvious that I had the smallest room on the floor. Despite its diminutive size, the room felt very high end and accommodating. A large screen TV, a mini fridge snack bar, my own robe and a very comfy bed. They even turned down the sheets and left a chocolate on the pillow; something I hadn't seen done in years. I didn't have a chance to eat in the restaurant. I did eat the convention center food. It was very good, but it's hard to make an excellent meal for 400 people at the same time. Plus, I also typically went out to eat. What the point of going to New Orleans if you're not going to go out and explore the local fare? The Roosevelt is conveniently located near Canal street and a block from the famous French Quarter. It's nice to be \"near\" the French Quarter rather than \"in\" it; if you know what i mean. The Roosevelt is a classic beauty and allows you to temporarily escape the modern world for just a while. You can imagine what it was like when New Orleans was like in its glory days back in the 1920s.

What a great choice that turned out to be. The hotel entrances are just half a block from Canal Street, so you can stroll to the French Quarter in a very few minutes but are not surrounded by the clamor of the nightlife when you return. It is a very historic property that has been beautifully preserved and renovated. The lobby, the beautiful Sazerac Bar, and the \"Blue Room\" ballroom (which opens to the public for Sunday jazz brunches) all convey a sense of the splendor of times gone by, but none of the glory is faded or shabby. Don't miss the unusual antique clock located near the University side of the lobby...it is really beautiful and unique, a true work of art. This is a big hotel with hundreds of rooms, but the excellent personal service will make you feel like you are staying at a small boutique property. We stayed in one of the hotel's expansive \"Waldorf Suites.\" They run in excess of 1300 square feet. Ours featured one and a half baths, a large wet bar with a refrigerator (great for bringing home desserts, keeping bottled water for walking, etc.), a big soaking tub and separate shower with multiple jets, a terrific set of linens on the comfortable king bed, comfy microfiber robes, and soft and thick cotton terry cloth towels. We were on the same floor (4th) as the rooftop pool and bar, which provided a welcome retreat from the August heat during the afternoons. The suite was full of quality furnishings and featured a big formal dining table and lots of chest of drawers. The bedroom was separated from the big living room by a set of attractive French doors. The climate control was very quiet and was completely effective, despite it being the warmest time of the year. The room was dead quiet, with no street noise at all. Housekeeping adjusted seamlessly to our comings and goings...we would go out at different times every day, but the room was always made up when we returned, and we never ran into them...it was almost supernatural. Likewise we came \"home\" every night to find our bed turned down and our ice bucket filled. The hotel provided copies of the Wall Street Journal each week day, and the Financial Times over the weekend. The suite was decorated with attractive artwork and vintage photos of various significant sites in the city. Three flat screen TV's, and a mini bar tucked away inside a credenza. We even had a \"back door\" to the hallway (from the wet bar). Famed chef John Besh has located his excellent Italian restaurant, Domenica, in the Roosevelt's lobby. Their happy hour from 3 to 6, 7 days a week, is the best deal in New Orleans. All their fabulous pizzas, well drinks and cocktails, and wines by the glass, are at half price during these hours. It is a smart strategy, because when you taste one of the pizzas, you'll want to come back for the full dinner service, the food is delicious and very authentic, with great cured meats (made in house), and a wonderful selection of high end cheeses, supporting an extensive and varied menu. The Sazerac restaurant is a solid choice for lunch and dinner featuring typical New Orleans favorite dishes, and Teddy's Cafe offers a full espresso bar and pastry selection. The pool side bar has a grill cook on hand and features some unique and well-crafted frozen cocktails. There's a shop in the lobby called the Emporium that has a really nice selection of apparel and merchandise, in addition to the usual packaged snacks and treats, books and magazines, and other merchandise one ordinarily associated with hotel shops. Fitness and a really fine looking full service spa are all on hand as well. The room service menu is extensive, and the hotel is ready for laundry, dry cleaning and shoe service pickups with a quick turn-around. I am sure I am forgetting something, but trust me, the Roosevelt is a full-service property, in keeping with the high standards of the Waldorf Astoria brand. Our personal concierge, Claire Bartells, deserves special mention and the very highest praise. She contacted us by email a few days before our stay and was excellent at promptly clarifying information and and answering questions about our accommodations. We were contacted again at a check-in and a few days into our stay to make sure everything met expectations, and she was constantly ready to provide information and make arrangements in connection with the rich set of experiences that New Orleans offers to its visitors. Ms. Bartells is a stellar member of an already great team, and the Roosevelt is both wise and fortunate to have her looking out for its guests--her amazing devotion to excellence in her responsibilities is exactly the sort of thing that builds strong customer loyalty. After celebrating our 33rd wedding anniversary with a lengthy stay at the Roosevelt, we now want to return several times a year, and Ms. Bartells fine work is a huge part of the reason. I honestly can't think of even a minor complaint. We loved staying in the Roosevelt, and we can't wait to plan our next stay. Luxury, comfort, and perfect personal service that is genuine, unpretentious and seamless, all come together in this magnificent hotel.", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "BoilerDan93", "ReviewID": "UR136725852", "Content": "Absolutely the best place to stay in New Orleans.

I've sort of drifted from one hotel to the next for one reason or another. My original favorite was the Monteleone (I don't recommend it unless things have changed drastically since the final straw that separated me from it forever), then I wandered to the Intercontinental (later J.W. Marriott) where one of the bellmen was such a great guy that I specifically chose the place over others. Well, my friend Alfred left when Katrina blew in, so I've settled on the Ritz for most stays lately. It's a wonderful property and if you have the chance to stay there, I'd recommend it. The problem with the Ritz is that it can be quite . . . ritzy on prices, especially if there's something going on in New Orleans that has a lot of folks in town. That was the case when I booked the Roosevelt in the run-up to Mardi Gras. I'd never stayed in the Roosevelt, though I had walked past a time or two. As a guest, I was pleased with service, the room, the size of the room, the location . . . that is, all the things we're asked to rate on this site. I would not put the Roosevelt in the \"worth $400 a night\" category, but then again I didn't stay in a $400/night room, so I can't really judge. For what I paid, I was quite happy and the value-to-quality ratio on this hotel is very high. You can pay more for rooms at other hotels, but you won't get more for your money. One last point - and this is always a question in the minds of folks heading to New Orleans - what about location?

It is part of the Waldorf-Astoria brand, so I expected excellent service and top-notch facilities. My expectations were half correct. I was greeted warmly upon arrival and the check-in process was quick and efficient. The Roosevelt is an older hotel, so guests should not expect the most up-to-date features. Many design aspects are lovely and charming. The paintings and ceiling decorations in the lobby are fantastic. The elevators have indicators that say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This Car Up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when the car arrives. The Sazerac bar is warm and inviting. I found my room, which faced Baronne Street, to be on the small side. The closet was large, but the bathroom was small. The door of the bathroom would not stay open, which meant the steam from the shower would always fog up the bathroom mirror. The hotel provides bath products from Ferragamo. The room did not have a coffee maker, but it did have a warning about how using the mini-bar to store personal items would incur a charge. I bent down to the nightstand to plug in my phone charger and found a discarded candy bar wrapper. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that the housekeeping staff didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do a good job. Across the street from the hotel on Baronne Street is the Church of the Immaculate Conception. I was awoken in the morning by the ringing of the church bells. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just ring every hour, or ever half-hour. They ring every 15 minutes, with a different chime each time. I suppose the bells might be charming in the evening, but after traveling across time zones, they were annoying. As noted above, the service was terrific. After checking out I wanted to leave my lugagge for the day. No one was at the bell clerk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s station, so someone else rushed over to assist me.

Very comfortable bed, nice shower (no tub, which was a bit of a bummer but the awesome shower made up for it) sitting area with giant TV. The hotel common areas are spectacular! The bar and coffee shop wonderful and comfortable. So why the 4 stars? Well, for a couple of reasons. First-- the WIFI charge. I mean, COME ON! This really is a basic service these days and the fact that so many places offer it free should send a message to the hotel industry that they need to pony up and quit charging for it. Second--the staff were very nice, but they really needed to take a stand on all the shrieking children in the lobby. It was horrific to sit in what should have been a wonderful area. I know sucking up to clientele is part of the fancy hotel business, but perhaps they should think of the other guests who don't have children, or (heaven forbid) those with well-behaved children who aren't screaming, running, grabbing. I run my own business, dealing with the public all day long, and I wouldn't inflict that situation on my customers. Third-- and this is just a minor pet peeve, but there was no way to say you didn't want new bedding and towels without saying you didn't want any room service at all. I love to come back to a refreshed room, made bed, et cetera, but I'm not so precious that I need brand new bedding every night. I think it's time that luxury and consumption are separated in people's minds. This was a very luxurious hotel, I didn't need fresh linens after only one night to increase my enjoyment. Maybe just a card that you could leave out for the housekeeper to let them know. I realize New Orleans isn't exactly short on water, but why waste resources if you don't have to?

There were a group of bachelors and another group of bachelorettes celebrating, but everything was tame. There were also plenty of couples and families having fun. Somehow the atmosphere remained relaxing and elegant with so much going on. We were so content at the pool that it was so hard to leave our lounge chairs to go sightseeing. Minor complaint- no coffee at the pool. This would be so nice in the morning after a night of partying. fYI get there early on the weekend to get a good spot. The rooms are relatively small... But I think that is pretty much standard for hotels in NOLA. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were not. The irony of staying in an upscale hotel is that they do not provide you with a microwave, coffee maker, mini fridge. I have these amenities at the holiday inn I frequent for work. I guess that's their way of nickel and diming you. You can ask them to empty out the mini bar but they charge you $25 a day. Housekeeping was very good. They cleaned everything very well. I did not like the Ferragamo toiletries. Are they associated with Guerlain? Since they have a Guerlain spa, I thought they would have better tolietries. The high end hair dryer was very nice. Since my husband and I eloped a few months earlier, we decided to have a wedding celebration here. We hired a photographer, who took beautiful family pics in the gorgeous lobby. Then we proceeded to Domenica (Italian, John Besh) restaurant in the hotel. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and efficient. My parents are vegetarian and they were very pleased with the food. The meat eaters were equally happy. We finished off that night with cocktails at the Sazerac. The drinks were impeccable and the atmosphere was sophisticated lounge style ---tourists, hotel guests, well dressed businessmen and locals. It was busy that night but some patrons were nice enough to let me, my husband and my brother sit at their table. Good drinks, good service and nice conversation. We had a wonderful stay, my mother in law felt like royalty. It takes a lot for me to give a hotel five stars. If the rooms were a little better, with better in room amenities this would be five stars in my opinion.", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThanks for the upgrade!\u201d", "Author": "AandCStoecker", "ReviewID": "UR132119003", "Content": "We came to new Orleans to celebrate our fifth anniversary.

On the other side of Canal St from Boubon St/French Quarter, so it was quiet yet only 2 blocks away from the action. Not sure I would want to be any further or closer Service: Excellent, from the initial check-in, maid service/turn down service, concierge, pool side waitress to check-out; nothing to complain about. Concierge was helpful, and suggested the great Mr. B's Bistro! Rooms: Standard size was adequate; however, it was more than made up with the fantastic bed and linens. Bed+Black out Shades=Sleep in! Extras: Don't overlook the Roof Top Pool & Bar. Great little setting with a nice little lunch menu. Killed the club sandwich w/ avocado, matched with the suggested Sangria. It was perfect. And the service is just as good as the restaurants downstairs. Speaking of the restaurants; don't miss out on Domenica's. We went there twice. Sazerac bar looked nice as well, though we did not visit. History: When we told locals that we were staying at the Roosevelt, we initially were anticipating disdain for staying in an upscale Waldorf Astoria Hotel. However, it was the exact opposite. Several had fond memories as children visiting the hotel, while others expressed appreciation for the hotel chain trying to keep the original spirit of the Roosevelt alive. Example 1: All the rooms have black and white pictures of the the original Roosevelt Hotel, mostly donated by long time citizens. Example 2: One person told us about the Blue Room, which was \"the spot\" back in the day. He even went to so far to tell us how to find the room; when you enter the lobby, the men's restroom is on the right side. Next to the bathroom are a set of non-descript doors, which lead to the Blue Room. Entering really gives you a sense of a step back in time. Complaints: Nothing of any note. Parking is expensive, but so is the rest of the French Quarter area. Just grab a taxi from the airport ($33) and use your feet to get around town afterwards!

We found the location to be perfect -- it's a short walk to boubon street, and convenient to streetcar stops. If I were to nit pick: - shower head water flow was too gentle -- it was literally like a sparse, constant rain flow - double queen deluxe room was a little snug with all the furniture and two beds; bathroom is also small - parking is pricey at $40 valet -- and guest have to load and unload right on baronne street (although we didn't have any problem) - the foreground view from our room wasn't very pretty - there were two small complimentary bottled water in the room, but was not replenished -- not sure if it is supposed to be or not; however, there's a walgreens and cvs nearby Additional: Sazerac - we had breakfast at, and the fresh melon juice and the creole crab cake benedict stood out Teddy's Cafe - my children adored all the sweets in this cafe -- the ones we tried were decadent but not overly sweet.

Compare to world and US 4-5 star hotels I have been, the management and staffs did not meet my expectation, except Concierge service which was good. Staffs were not professional nor graceful. Also lack of how to handle emergency. We were taking nap after we came back from a wedding party.

They did not say anything to us. We got down to the lobby, there was no evacuation. No staff was guiding us. We got to the concierge who was making restaurant reservation for a guest, we did not know what was going on. Some of us ran to front desk the front desk staff said it a false alarm. One of the guest asked to the front desk staff \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 how could your even did not announce it was a false alarm\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the stuff said to him\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chill out man, it is just a false alarm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The way he responded us would never ever happen in any other 5 star hotel in the world. We were so upset how the staffs handled the situation. No staffs seem to know it happened nor no one cared. The next day, We had problem with the safety box. It was not working, we could not get our wallet to go out. First they said it must be the battery, sent a security. It was not the battery. Then they sent electrician then an engineer\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 they were working on it hours. I was waiting on the bed-wasting my vacation time. After a while, I realized it was quite. I looked out they all just left without telling me. The Safe was working. It was to late to go out before dinner so I went out to the pool. When I came back from the pool I had a phone massage that I have a massage on front desk. I went down, the staff said, the electrician or engineer need to get back to your room to work on the safe, when can I schedule it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. We were so confused. It was already fixed hours ago! Best of all, the fire alarm went on again while I was taking shower the day we check out. Once again they did not announced that it was a false alarm, we had to call front desk to find out. What a vacation! I was so relieved when I checked out. The Lobby was Grande and classic beauty.

I had read the articles on the Roosevelt and its restoration so I was hopeful that it would be a decent place to stay. I wasn't disappointed. The hotel has an old world charm that is recognizable as soon as you step out of the cab. The interior is very opulent and tasteful without being gaudy. The service staff was very friendly and check-in was effortless. We made it up to the room and Josh the bellman was not far behind with our bags. He gave us a nice tour of our room, got our ice and told us to have a great stay in NOLA. The room was very well appointed with a king bed. The bathroom was very nice, but there was no tub, which wasn't a problem for me but my wife commented on it although it wasn't an inconvenience for her. The door to the bathroom closed automatically, which was rather annoying so we had to prop it open. Really though, you should be able to tell that this is a pretty nice place since my only negatives were the tub and the bathroom door. There are so many wonderful places to eat in NOLA that we only had one meal in the hotel, which was on the day we arrived. Domenica, a Chef John Besh eatery, is a pizzeria with pasta and other specialties. We each had a pizza and it was very enjoyable. One evening during our stay, we had a nightcap in the famous Sazerac bar. I wanted to try the namesake drink. It was nice to try such a famous concoction, but I'm not really a whiskey person. I didn't use it but my wife tried the pool and loved it as well as the pool bar. The conference facilities were very nice as well and the hotel did a great job of managing it, including the food. There was no convention chicken, thankfully, but everything was very well done. We had a black tie awards dinner on the last evening and the hotel really knocked themselves out. The food and service staff did a phenomenal job. I can't speak to the price of the rooms. We paid a conference rate of $239 and I didn't look up what the rate would be normally. For what I paid, the accommodations, service, ambiance was more than I could expect. The Roosevelt is on the dividing line between NOLA and the French Quarter, Canal St. It was about a two block walk to Bourbon St. About 15 minutes to walk to the river and Jax Brewery so it wasn't far from everything of interest, including many of NOLA's best restaurants.

I had a run of about four stays right after they opened, and there was lots of room for improvement. They finally seem to have hit their stride in becoming the grand hotel I always hoped they would become. Check in was a little slow, as they seemed to be a bit overwhelmed with a large conference. I arrived just before 5 PM, and it took her a few minutes to find me a room that was ready. The staff was very friendly, if not a little green. She at first welcomed me back and later asked if this was my first time at the hotel. When I got to my floor, there were quite a few housekeepers in the halls still cleaning rooms. I was assigned a room not far from the elevator, which is opposite of my requested room type, but the superior room was so large, I never heard the elevator bells ring. This was the first time I reserved a superior, and it was well worth it. It is really like a mini suite. It has a full marble foyer, a walk-in closet, three large windows, a long main room with pull-out sofa and chair, and a dressing table outside the bath. The bath is the same as most other deluxe rooms. The room overall is quite a change from the rather snug deluxe rooms. The TV was so far from the bed I was a little concerned that I might disturb my neighbors with the volume, but the room was as quiet as ever. I took a picture of the room, but it really does look exactly like on the website. I noticed this time there was a little refrigerator set out in the lobby in the morning with chilled towels and bottled water for joggers. I'm not sure if I noticed that before. The concierge was extremely gracious in printing my boarding pass. I'm not sure about the complaints about the air conditioning. It reached a record high of 92 while I was in New Orleans, and my room stayed at a comfortable 66 the entire time. If you put the fan on high, it does time out after a while, but the rest of the system does continue to work. My only suggestion this time, other than my usual of no coffee maker in the room, is that the walk-in closet could have used a light. It was a little dark with only the foyer light to see by.

The hotel is really in a great spot for going out at night\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust a 2-block walk to Bourbon Street, yet those 2 blocks give you a nice buffer from the late-night noise. We were able to check-in by about 3 or 4pm (although I did overhear a guy complaining that he had been waiting for his room for a while), and were also able to get a later checkout. We had limited contact with the bellmen, concierge, etc., but they were all there if needed. The lobby is extremely well-apportioned and well-staffed. The Sazerac Bar was a great place for a drink (but only one drink at the prices they charge). The bartenders really put a lot of effort into the cocktails. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at any of the restaurants, but they looked very nice (with prices to match\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI think there was a fancy Mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day brunch for $80/person, plus gratuity). The pool was delightful. Although a bit small, it was never over-crowded. The service was impeccable there if you wanted anything to eat or drink (we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t). Nice outdoor pool bar and hot tub. The one complaint about this area is the setting\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe pool is on top of only the fourth floor, and there are quite a few dilapidated buildings that surround the pool. Nothing the hotel can really do about that, but still, not exactly a pleasant sight to look out on (and this goes for most of the views from the rooms, as well). The fairly spacious rooms were very luxurious: comfortable beds, big-screen TV, plus another TV in the bathroom, robes, chocolates on the pillow, high ceilings, etc. Some contributors commented that housekeeping was spotty; this was not our experience, as each afternoon the room was cleaned properly, and when we returned at night, turn-down service had been performed. Street noise was minimal, and noise from other rooms was non-existent. A few relatively minor nits: First, the in-room refrigerator was mini-bar only, and it was electronically monitored such that if you touched anything you got charged. In other words, you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the fridge for your personal use. I really find that obnoxious. The drain in the shower always got backed up. Likely a function of old piping, but still, not pleasant. The air conditioning had a lowest setting of 65F. However, despite putting it on the lowest setting, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it ever got that cold. We were never uncomfortably warm, but if you like it really cool/cold, you might have an issue. One of our rooms was missing an ipod player/alarm clock, and as I said earlier, most of the views are of building walls. We noticed that guests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 discarded room service remains sat in the hallways for hours or even a couple days. Finally, if you weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t HiltonHonors Gold or better, you have to pay for wireless access. All in all, we had a fantastic stay and I would recommend it to anyone.

Following are my observations: 1) If I can't secure a room 9 months in advance (paid in full, although through a 3rd party) how much further in advance would I have to pay to secure a room at a Waldorf Astoria hotel? 2) Why would a customer who intend on staying at a Waldorf Astoria hotel want to be moved from one hotel to another in the middle of a vacation? 3) The Hilton, although not a motor inn, has an inferior star rating compared to the Roosevelt. 4) Why should ANY customer be subjected to this kind of undue distress on her 40th birthday, and at the beginning of a holiday, no less?

Most of the previous reviews cover the basics (both the good and the bad), so I'll just list a couple of strengths and weaknesses of the property that I noticed: Strengths 1) The hotel is beautifully decorated; 2) Location - it is just across the street from the French Quarter, close enough to get there quickly but away from the madness; 3) My room was very quiet and the beds were comfortable; and 4) The outdoor pool on the fourth floor is very relaxing and a nice place to spend the middle of the day when the temperature starts to get up there. (The Ritz does not have a pool) Weaknesses 1) I was staying during the first week of Jazz Fest. Apparently, each year Zurich (insurance company) holds its yearly corporate retreat at the Roosevelt. They literally take over the hotel and if you don't have a Zurich tag you're treated a little bit like a second class citizen. Last year I stayed at the Roosevelt for the second week of Jazz Fest and the service was great. 2) As stated in other reviews the air conditioning doesn't work too well. The rooms have very high ceilings and it's an old building so I don't know if there is much management can do about this. 3) The housekeeping service is not great. A couple of times we did not receive new towels and the turndown service didn't do much (not a big deal to me but it may be to others).

However, the food poolside was not worth the money spent. It took about 45 minutes to get a salad and potatoe wedges and then when they came the salad was small, mostly iceberg lettuce and did not have the dressing I requested (bleu cheese). I was then informed that they didn't have that dressing at the pool so they mixed bleu cheese crumbles with their creamy cucumber dressing. It was not the same and I probably would have gotten something different had they informed me of that sooner. For the money I paid it was rather disappointing.

The problem: according to a hotel employee, the hotel's computer system had been down for 18 hours, and so the staff (who was working very hard) didn't know who had checked out, which rooms were occupied or which rooms had been cleaned. Everything was being done by hand. It took two and a half hours for us to get assigned a room (we were told that it would be 40 minutes by the front desk....). Ironically, the staff took my cell phone number in order to tell us when our room was ready, but because ATT had between zero and 1/2 bars in the lobby, and I didn't have a lot of confidence in the process, I decided to stand in 20-minute-long lines multiple times to check on our status.

Second, another hotel employee stated that this was the third time this network problem had occurred at this property.

The location is a couple of blocks outside of the French Quarter which could be viewed as a positive or a negative. We enjoyed being a little outside of the French Quarter for the quietness factor (we went for food and definately drank but not really on Bourbon Street- it was a little dirty/gross for us). But the whole area surrounding the French Quarter isn't very nice at all. It was very reminscent of Downtown L.A. or Venice Beach (lots of homeless people loitering around, lots of interesting characters). With that being said, we didn't get harassed or asked for money or anything at all- it just surprised us because we were not expecting to be in a downtown sort of setting. We ate every morning in the Teddy Cafe in the hotel for coffee/tea and pastries and it was fairly priced and everything we ate was good. We ate in Domenica's for Happy Hour and had great pizza (the food is good and the happy hour prices are good so definately keep it in mind for a cheap meal). The walk into the quarter was very short, and with my husband we felt safe everytime even walking back around 11:00 at night.

An older hotel so small rooms are to be expected. The bed and pillows were very comfortable for all of us. The bathroom shower jets were fabulous, wish the hair dryer had been more powerful, did use the tv in bathroom when getting ready but the door to bathroom needs adjusting so it doesn't automatically slam shut, the robes were super comfy (I may have to purchase one!), the view not so great but then again the building isn't close to the waterfront but on a busy block, and the bathroom wallpaper is in need of redoing. The one day we did have to ask the maid to come back later (it was four pm and we had about 20 minutes to get refreshed)--she just left things alone for us and did a great job each day. I didn't use the spa but visited the shop. The woman helped someone else check out before helping me (I had asked to see something in a closed case and the woman paying for an item had merely just stepped up to the register)--she was friendly enough but not efficient. If in a pinch, I might buy something from the shop, but there are too many stores everywhere else to pay the higher prices there.

The wait staff were attentive to any needs. I enjoyed the roof top pool and also used the work out room, which though small was adequate. It was in in windowless room. I also had a massage which was very nice. The spa facilities were small with no lounge area- only 4 chairs in a waiting room. The spa did not have sauna or steam room. The spa shower stalls should have a hook, shelf or bench in each stall as there was no place to set belongings. There were no locks on the shower doors. The staff in the spa were all polite and welcoming. In fact, the staff attitude throughout the hotel was top notch. If was obvious the staff was lad we had chosen their hotel.

Meeting was in hotel so lodging was pre-arranged. However I booked rooms on line and did better than meeting rate. Hotel is situated on the other side of Canal Street so you are not directly on Bourbon Street or the Quarter but it is a block or 2 away. I have to think this is the best since you have easy access to the action but dont have to hear it or be in it when time to retire. Plus if you want to have a quiet evening, you have that option too. The lobby has a grand appearance, it is well kept and still functional. There are 2 towers with elevators for each. At times, the elevators were slow. Check in was a problem-their computers were down when we arrived. However, demonstrating the level of service I was hoping for, they put us in the hotel lobby bar and covered our drinks. They also put me in the wrong room type but easily corrected this when I called them and moved me quickly to the correct type. Normally all of this hassle with check in would irk me to the point of dropping a rating but their style and attitude and drink comps made up for it. I booked a 2 room king suite, which surprising was not much more than the standard king room. Again, well done in style. Furniture was comfortable, bed was great. I believe the sofa was a pull out. Had TV in each room which was well sized. Bathroom was spacious with fancy shower that had multiple shower heads. Closet was huge and could easily accomodate multiple people. King suite has sink with small fridge-ideal for me since I like to go a buy a small pack of soda from local convience store which even at convience store prices is much cheaper than hotel soda. There are 2 major chain drug stores less than a block away. I had hotel food as part of the meeting, I have say everything I tried was very good. Meeting rooms were also nice, chairs were comfortable. Easy access from meeting rooms to lobby via escalator or elevator. The lobby has a bar, a fancy restaurant and another restaurant/coffee place for breakfast, sandwiches and snacks. Many of us ended up having a coffee in this place while talking, meeting friends etc All in all, I was very happy with this stay and hope to come again. The service was excellent and because of this, i was willing to forget the problems with check in.

Rehab I never found out when, but The Roosevelt could have been a very tired hotel built in the 30\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and instead has been updated and is a great hotel in the year 2012. The facility has been updated, and it was great to stay in a grand dame hotel that had a terrific face-lift that brought her back to life. Room My wife, daughter and myself stayed in a fabulous end suite so we could all stay together. It could not of been better. Clean, modern, great amenities; i.e. flat screen, wifi, etc. Common Area Like most hotels build in this era common place aplenty. Beautiful main floor, nice coffee bar area and wonderful coffee room. Dominica, a very nice Italian restaurant is part of hotel and we ate there one night and loved it. Fitness Center Was tremendous. Terrific size so could get a machine when wanted and very spacious. Plenty of room to stretch out and enjoy your workout. Location I did not love the location, just off Canal Street on the non-French Quarter side, but it was fine. Canal Street has a full frontal view of New Orleans life, and best to always be aware when walking on it and past it to go to French Quarter.

It's also played a central role in the life of the city: the best society wedding receptions were held there, Huey P. Long kept a suite there, Walker Percy's protagonist in The Moviegoer took his girlfriends dancing there. In 1965 it became the Fairmont Roosevelt and later simply the \"Fairmont New Orleans\". It was closed after Hurricane Katrina and the ensuing flood in 2005, and it reopened in 2009 as a Waldorf-Astoria hotel. The restored hotel is even grander and more beautiful than it was before. The lobby stretches for a city block, with mosaic floors and chandeliers and lots of marble, and yet somehow manages to be not the least bit gaudy. The guest rooms are also exquisitely appointed. The bar, restaurant, and coffee shop are all quite good -- although the Roosevelt is only a block from the French Quarter, so it's a short walk to the Cafe du Monde for beignets and cafe au lait, to Antoine's and Arnaud's and Galatoire's for dinner, and to any number of bars whose menu and atmosphere are at least as good as those in the hotel's Sazerac Lounge. On the downside, as noted by some other reviewers, many of the rooms are somewhat small, although the bathrooms are large. It's also too bad that the Blue Room -- which was historically the hotel's flagship restaurant/lounge, at one time regarded as one of the best \"big band\" venues in the world -- now seems to be open only for private functions. Bailey's, once the city's only 24-hour high-end coffee shop, also seems to be gone forever. Hilton Honors members should be aware that while they might be upgraded to a good room or a suite, there is no executive floor or lounge. And then there's the question of staffing: many of the Roosevelt's employees are as courteous and capable as the hotel and its guests deserve, but a few are not. On a recent visit I called the \"wake up call\" button, the operator, and the reception desk, one after the other, at about 12:45 a.m. Each number rang about twenty times and then gave me a recording proclaiming the virtues of the Roosevelt Hotel. There was no opportunity to leave a voice mail message. I tried again about fifteen minutes later with identical results, so I gave up and set the alarm on my mobile phone in lieu of a wake up call. When I asked about this the next morning I was told that all late-night calls go to the reception desk and that whoever was at the reception desk must have been too busy to answer the call. The employee who told me this, who also worked at the reception desk, did not seem to regard it as an important problem. Despite these few deficiencies, the Roosevelt has done a far better job of preserving its grandeur and its traditions than most other hotels in New Orleans or anywhere else. It's a great place to stay and a great place to be.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jackson, Mississippi", "Title": "\u201cwill return if we go back to New Orleans\u201d", "Author": "lmdallas", "ReviewID": "UR125825629", "Content": "Very nice hotel.

The bathroom was pretty large for a standard room also. Shortly after arriving in the room, there was a know at the door, and the bellhop was there with our luggage. He was EXTREMELY friendly and told us of some good places to go eat and sight see while in town.

We had a king suite which had a main bedroom, a huge bathroom, walk in closet, powder room and living room with a pull out couch, more space then we could ever need need and very nicely decorated. Also it was honestly the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. Housekeeping and turndown service always made sure to keep everything neat and tidy and along with chocolates on the pillows there were cute little cards with tomorrow weather and a little quote which was, for me, a really nice touch. I'm a fan of the the little extras, they seem to make the stay a little more special. One extra nice touch was a little package of pralines and a note saying happy mardi gras and thanking us for staying at the Roosevelt, we loved that. The hotel itself is perfectly located, just on the other side of canal street from the french quarter. Far enough from the noise but a super easy walk if you want to get in on the action. Seeing all the parades was no problem because they all went down canal which was literally just steps away. We did take the time to eat at both Teddy's cafe and the Dominica during our stay, both were excellent. Teddy's had quick bites, mostly sandwiches or bagels, we liked to stop for a quick breakfast on busy days and check our email on the free wifi. Also they did make one of the very best lattes I've ever had. The Dominica gets a mixed review. I LOVED it, the fresh ricotta and the Gorgonzola pizza were amazing, my brother thought his clams pizza was just ok. Still, I would for sure go back. And as far as staff go I did not meet a single unfriendly or unhelpful person the whole time I was there. Reception provided assistance, directions, maps and tips on where to spend time. The housekeeping staff were lovely, always trying to make sure they didn't get in our way while still keeping everything up to incredibly high standards. The doormen, security and everyone else, all were wonderful, gracious and welcoming. They really made our stay. If I had to find a con it was the in room wifi, it didn't really work well. It would be lightning fast for a few minutes and then slow to a crawl. Often I couldn't get connected. They did offer a plug in for the internet but alas I had brought my tablet and it wasn't an option. However I did call down about the issue and no internet charges seemed to show up on my bill. Add that to the free wifi in the lobby and cafe and it really wasn't a big deal at all. Oh, and did I mention you get to print your boarding passes for free in the the business centre?

Since I was on business and by myself, I figured I could survive a couple of nights. But the corner room they gave me was next to the stairwell, and I had to listen to the constant banging of the stairwell door late into the night, and early the next morning. When I asked to move, they gave me the EXACT same room in the EXACT same location, two floors up. This happened even though I explained exactly what the situation was with the stairwell. When they moved me after that, I asked for a tub this time but that request was ignored (I would have been OK if they had simply told me one was not available, rather than acknowledging the request but doing nothing about it). The shower controls are impossible are near impossible to figure out, two different knobs that work differently depending on how far you turn them (careful not to scald yourself). Directions should be posted. I was also very disappointed that their website did NOT make it clear the pool was closed (the hotel is only 2 years old, so I was quite surprised it was already under renovation). I ate at both hotel restaurants and was expecting some spectacular food - but both meals were quite bland and in the case of the fine dining restaurant, overpriced.

It is Hilton's Waldorf-Astoria class hotel. The staff displays Southern hospitality at its best. Before we arrived we received an email from our personal concierge. This was a nice touch. She set up a driver to pick us up at the airport - pricey, but worth it since we had never been to New Orleans. When we arrived at the hotel, check-in was a breeze. It was nice to be greeted by our names. The front desk staff was definitely well-trained. We are Hilton Gold Card members and we were immediately given an upgrade to a king suite. Again, a very nice touch. Our rooms were lovely with an exceedingly comfortable bed, two closets, two bathrooms, and a sitting room. I think even a basic room would have been just as lovely, as the staff really makes you feel at home. One especially nice amenity was a shower with multiple jets from the wall, as well as an overhead rain shower. This is a hotel with a grand history. Huey Long, former Louisiana governor, once had a suite on the twelfth floor that was his exclusively. He used it whenever he came down from Baton Rouge. The Sazerac Bar has been remodeled, but they kept the hole in the wall where a bullet missed him during an altercation. Also on display is the Deduct Box replica. They say he deducted a portion of the wages from men for whom he found jobs. Quite a character from the old world of politics, circa 1930s. The food was exceptional. The Sazerac Restaurant, adjacent to the Sazerac Bar, prepared some of the best food we have ever had. My breakfast favorite was the Creole Crab Cake Benedict. In place of the traditional English muffin was a crab cake with Hollandaise sauce and a poached egg. I would have had this every day, except I didn't try I until our last day. Lunch in the Sazerac was also very good. The Prix Fixe menu was the way to go. Three courses for $25 was a steal!! They did not offer the Prix Fixe menu in the evening, although a server said they were bringing it back. It is worth asking about. The absolute best time we experienced was the Sunday Jazz Brunch in The Blue Room. From 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. you dine on exquisite food while listening to the James Rivers Band. James Rivers was in the movie The Bridges Of Madison County. You see him singing to Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood, look for his signature black beret! To our delight, he also dedicated a song and sang to us. A magical moment. The Sunday Brunch food was a real feast. Starting with appetizers, salad, and gumbo soup displayed tastefully, we sampled some of everything. This was NOT your Vegas type buffet with mounds and mounds of food, just plenty of the appetizers that we had been ordering throughout the week in the main restaurant, plus some added treats. The caviar was one of the extra treats. The main course offered nine entrees, all served at our table. My husband chose the enormous Prime Rib that was an inch thick and filled his plate, and I chose the Herb Marinated Grilled Poussin (chicken) with oyster dressing. I don't think you can go wrong with any selection. Throughout all of this our waiter was freely pouring Mimosas and champagne. We never had to ask, he was just there. The dessert bar included Bananas Foster, creme brulee, cheesecake, an array of pastries and chocolates, and, of course, pralines (my personal downfall). See the pictures, such delightful food. People make or break a hotel. One of the nicest hotel administrators was the Emporium Manager. She was also the hotel weekend manager. We kept running in to her throughout our stay. She saw us in the Sazerac during dinner and happened to have the table next to ours during Sunday brunch.

There is no notice on their website about this--lesser Hilton properties let their guests know that the pool is closed in advance. Why can't the Roosevelt? I was in New Orleans in January and live I in a cold place. I should have been alerted that the pool was closed when booking the room. Unacceptable. 2--There were dirty, smelly dishes in the hall my entire stay. And I saw the cleaning staff many times. Apparently nobody wanted to deal with them. 3--I am a Hilton Diamond member and should get a beverage voucher when I check-in. I didn't get one and didn't realize until I was in my room. But the bottles of water that you are supposed to get were in the room. But I think all guests get those. 4--The restaurant is just OK. With all of the food in New Orleans don't eat at the hotel. The Sazarac bar is worth the trip and cannot be missed. As is the Italian restuarant located in the hotel but not run by it. Overall worth staying.

There were no linens for the sleeper so we called and asked for someone to bring linens to the room. A young man promptly appeared and cheerfully prepared the sleeper sofa.

I had stayed here before on business when it was the Fairmont so I had a bit of experience with it. The hotel Lobby had just been decorated for Christmas, and it was magnificant. Trees draped in white lights throughout the lobby with birds nestled among the lights. Truly beautiful. Upon checking in, the staff was welcoming and friendly. My son (who lives in NOLA) was driving us and the doorman allowed him to back up on the street into the cab stands for about an hour so he didn't have to pay to park which we thought was very nice! We went up to the room on the 3rd floor. There were 2 queen beds, a desk and lounge chair with ottoman so the room was spacious. The main issue we didn't like with the room was the bathroom. While decked out with Kohler plumbing products which is always nice to see, the faucet on the shower was loose (came off in my hand) and a screw was protruding most of the way out of the cover of the handle (the round part against the bath tub. Now when cleaning the tub, I'm quiet sure the handle would have come off in anyone's hand so apparently the cleaning crews must have known about it but didn't (or forgot to) have it repaired. I waiting through the second and third night and it was still not repaired when we left. Another big issue was the bathroom had a pedastal sink and no shelving or anything to put any of your toiletry items on. While I (with my toothbrush and hairbrush didn't mind that much, the two women I was travelling with didn't care for that at all with no place to put makeup bags, and all the stuff women carry with them. Further, the complete lack of storage and only one towel rack in the bath had them storing the bath towels and washcloths outside in the closet in the room, so it was a wet cold walk if you forgot to bring your towels into the bathroom with you before you took your shower. We spent several cocktail hours in the Sazerac bar. Directly inside the bar to the left there is a cozy little seating area where we spent several hours over the weekend. Waitress staff is very attentive and they have these very tasty spicy little corn munchy things that go good with your drink. We also ate breakfast on Thanksgiving morning in the Sazarac. While the food and service were good, we sat down hungrily and were immediately greeted with \"I hope you don't mind, but your order is going to take a while because we are back there remodeling the kitchen. Seeing as how we were already sitting and sipping coffee, we decided we were in for the long hall so we ordered our food. She was right, simple omelets probalby took 40 minutes to get to us. ONce there the food was delivered, it was very good and as I said the service was very good as well (except for the wait for the food to arrive). One thing was a bit shocking that I thought might have calmed down since the many times we've been to NOLA. The first night we went out to eat dinner and when walking back, the whole street on the side of the Waldorf had been cordened off by police as there had been a shooting right next to the hotel. We walked up to a crowd that was standing there and they were tourists that were looking forlornly at their car because it was riddled with bullets in this running gun fight that had happened. Two nights later, there was a shooting right on Bourbon St about 11pm. I had always heard that the tourist section was off limits when you were setting arguments with guns, but apparently not that night. NOLA is a lot of fun with a lot to do, but overall, you will be smart to watch what your doing, know where you are (and where you shouldn't be) and keep a wary eye out to your surroundings at all times. Crime is still high in many areas so be careful.

It's a must see even if you aren't staying in the hotel. The rooms are large and elegant, with extreamly comfortable beds. I had a seperate sitting area in the room so you didn't feel crowded.

It was enjoyable to see all the families with their kiddies coming to pose for their traditional holiday photos next to the trees. The food service was very good both at Domenica and the main dining room. We ate breakfast in the Sazarac dining room all three mornings. The food was better than average, except for the institutional potatoes which really brought the meal down. Getting a drink is very difficult in both Domenica and the Sazarac Lounge - hugely popular, crowded, no seating, poor service. BYOB. The hotel offers a historic tour on Saturday afternoons. It was guided by one of the concierges who answered our questions, and shared a book of old photos with us. However, he could not explain what happened to the old hotel sign that existed during the filming of Easy Rider. Guess he was too young.

Upon arrival, the hotel is a striking, beautiful, stately Grand Dame. Even the name\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe Roosevelt, a Waldorf Astoria Hotel evokes an air of arrival and prestige; and signals that you should prepare for something very special. Unfortunately, the curse of being fairly well-travelled is that one gains a certain expectation for service delivery; and when those expectations are left unmet, one goes on to Trip Advisor, and attempts to maintain a level of decorum while telling it like it is. If you are a seasoned traveler, and have expectations when you check into a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153premium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, luxury hotel, IMHO, the Roosevelt will be a dismal disappointment. This hotel misses the mark on so many levels. We were upgraded to the Huey P. Long Suite for a six day period during the Thanksgiving Day Holiday. You would think this would be a great thing\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe certainly did. But, it was not. The suite is a beautiful affair. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing the entire space to be around 1,500s/f, with double doors leading to a formal entry foyer, then a huge living room, including original fireplace (non-working), beautiful rough-cut, highly polished hardwood floors, large HDTV, sofa, several overstuffed chairs, live plants, and nearly floor to ceiling windows. The dining area includes a 6-top Oak (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a wood expert) formal dining table and buffet / server. There is also a separate wet bar with refrigeration and marble counter-tops everywhere. Off of the wet bar is still another room\u00e2\u20ac\u201da very large butler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pantry. With 15 ft ceilings throughout, there are 2 very nice walk-in closets in suite, and a HUGE bathroom that features a ball and claw-foot tub, 4-head shower stall, mounted HDTV, double sinks with granite counters and marble floors and walls. Although, there is no half-bath for guests. Even though the carpeting was dirty, the bedroom was well appointed, and a bit tight. The suite is very well decorated with photos of Gov. Long throughout, and reminisces of New Orleans and of Louisiana\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto make sure you never forget you are in the Crescent City. We arrived on a Tuesday afternoon, by cab, right around check-in. The cab stopped in front of the University Pl. entrance. It was actually very slow at the hotel during this timeframe. We know this because there were six or seven porters standing around the bell desk having a pretty good conversation, and totally dis-regarding our arrival. As we settled-up with the cab driver, we began to notice that no one was making a move to help with our luggage, so we got out, and gathered our things and headed up the steps that were covered with old, tattered red carpeting, and filled with debris and dirt. There was another bell person standing at the top of the steps, who at least had enough sense to greet us, but, not enough to hold the door open as we struggled with our luggage. This was the first indication of poor / lacking service. When we arrived at the check-in area, there was a family in front of us already at the counter, and only one person working behind the entire reception desk. There was another, very tall bell person (and perhaps a second person) working with this group, and making over them as though they were the First Family, while nearly knocking us over. At one point, the tall bell person kind of \"kicked\" my suitcase out of his way. This was the next indication of poor service. We immediately began wondering how these folks were getting so much attention, while it seemed as if we had been erased already. We even discussed among ourselves, who these people might be. Eventually a second reception desk person came from the back office, greeted us, and began our check-in process. He was very nice to us. He welcomed us to the City, and informed us that we were being upgraded to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Presidential Suite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (not really Presidential). Since I was already a little perturbed, this news was very welcomed, and helped to take the edge off the two or three snubs we had just experienced. The clerk told us the elevators were behind us and that our suite was in the first tower\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6again, not offering any assistance with luggage or anything that a guest checking into the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Presidential Suite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd might expect; or that we had witnessed the other group receive. We were on our own\u00e2\u20ac\u201danother indication of poor service. When we arrived at our suite, prominently located at the end of the hall, there was a large placard beside the double door, reading: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gov. Huey P. Long Suite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In that instant, we were very happy, and anticipating what we would find behind the double door\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit had to make up for the heretofore lackluster service. We were not disappointed at first. It was huge. You could not even determine the end of it when you first walked in. It felt like a luxury apartment in the middle of Manhattan. Then my nose took over, and all I could smell was mildew. I never could tell where the smell was coming from. There was also mustiness in the entire suite; but, as long as the 2 separate a/c units remained on, the smell was only slight. Seeing that it was about the cocktail hour, we pretty much dropped off our luggage after \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ooing and awing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a few minutes, and headed down to the Sazerac Bar\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich is absolutely beautiful. There are huge murals on the walls which tell the story of Louisiana, and New Orleans (and own up to All the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history\u00e2\u20ac\u201dincluding slavery and ill treatment of African Americans which occurred in the City). We were really excited about the bar because we had seen it on perhaps HGTV, and it is pretty renowned\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand ordered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special of the House\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd drinks off the menu. I had a Ramos Gin Fiz. It was not good. There was more egg white in it than anything else. I shared my displeasure with the waitress, but, she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer to fix another drink, or to take it off the bill\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstill another indication of poor service. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t return to that bar again. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel exactly welcomed in there anyway. Perhaps they meant to send the message that we were not really wanted there--I'm not sure. They weren't getting anymore of my money, anyway. But, the contractors were there in the lobby setting up the Christmas decorations at this same time. They were all very pleasant and welcoming to us. We even noted that the people setting up the Christmas trees were nicer to us than the hotel staff! (Decorations are over the top\u00e2\u20ac\u201din a good way! The only bad thing is they are old and dank\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey need to get new, fresh decorations). Then we went exploring around the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe went up to the pool area, which was totally empty, and restaurants and other public areas\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey were all nice enough. We went to the Besch Restuarant, and the people were warm and inviting there. I understand they are only a tenant in the hotel. Maybe that explains the difference in treatment and ambiance. Finally, we returned to the Suite. This is when we discovered the TV remote controls did not work. We tried different things to make the remotes work, but, they were just not going to cooperate. Finally, I called down to the front desk, and asked them to come and fix the remotes (I really thought something was wrong with the TVs). You could see the wires hanging behind the TV in the living room as if someone had been working on it, but, didn't put the cables back in their \"hidden\" state. By the time a young maintenance man arrived, I was in the bedroom lying across the bed. The maintenance man could not get the remotes to work, either. I asked him to change the batteries in the remotes, which he initially refused to do (poor customer service). At one point the remote finally made the TV power-on. The maintenance man indicated they were working now. When he handed me the remote I tried to operate the TV, it still did not work. He took it back from me and said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yes, it works; you just have to stand next to the TV\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Eventually, he agreed to go and get new batteries for the remotes. As he warmed up to us, (over the hour or so that he and another maint man were there), he eventually admitted that there was an ongoing issue with the (Lodge Net) remotes functioning properly in the hotel. He also pointed out that we were not getting any of the premium channels we were paying for. So, for 6 days, we had to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just stand next to the TV\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in order for the remotes to work\u00e2\u20ac\u201dboth in the living room and the bedroom; and we didn't see HBO, or all the other premium channels that we paid for. Are you feeling Presidential yet? I just know that if I were the manager at this hotel, there would be a standing directive that I be notified immediately if the tenants in the Presidential Governor Huey P. Long Suite are complaining about ANYTHING. But, we never saw or heard from a manager, until the end. But, wait. This is nothing. When we went to bed in the wee hours, we realized there were three smoke detectors in the unit. We knew this because the detectors blinked, in unison, bright white light, like the strobe lights on an airport runway. WE could not sleep at ALL. I called down about 7AM in the morning to complain about this (we went out and partied, and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t return until the wee hours!!!). The clerk at the front desk said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no one has ever complained about this before\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As if to imply: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153...so, why are you complaining?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd An hour later maintenance men came with a ladder, and sarcastically asked us what we wanted them to do about it. We asked them to put tape over each of the detectors strobe lights (duh); and that's what they did, but, only after acting like they were being inconvenienced first. Of course, this was during the daylight hours, and they were not the ones trying to sleep with intense strobe lights blasting their eyes out in the middle of the night. They only did a half-witted job of covering the strobe light smoke detectors, and the lights were always annoying, even with the tape. And still no manager!!! I made another call that morning to Room Service. I explained that I had read on the Roosevelt Hotel website that since the hotel didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide coffee makers in each room, they provided complementary coffee upon request. I asked the lady on the other end of the phone if she could deliver our complementary coffee. She told me: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You better go and read the website again. This hotel don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give away no free coffee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Well, upon my return home, I took the young lady\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advice and did go and read the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website again. And in fact, under the Q&A section, it clearly states, the hotel will provide coffee at no charge. So, my suggestion would be that the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees go back and read the website. I would also like a refund for all the coffee we bought from the hotel bakery shop. At a point, after you are so frustrated, and disappointed, nothing is going to be right. Even if it is right, it will not be right. We reached that point with the remotes, and the number of complaints we had already lodged on just the 2nd day of our vacation, with absolutely no communication from the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management. Here are some of the other issues: no waste basket in bedroom, radio (which they brag about on the website) did not work\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit was not even plugged in when we arrived, so they knew it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working before we got there\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere was no clock in the unit as a result, live plants had layers of dust on the leaves, and had yellowing and brown leaves, drapes dragged the floor and were difficult to open and close, they brought us dirty champagne glasses and carried them in their hands (as opposed to on a tray, like you would think they would), they were extremely stingy with towels and face cloths, even after requesting more, they never cleaned the bathroom for 6 days\u00e2\u20ac\u201donly replaced towels, if we asked maid service to come back later (after showing up at 8:30AM), they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come back at all, we only had turn-down service once in 6 days, they never vacuumed the carpet in the bedroom\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere were rocks and mud on the floor for the entire 6 days we were there, we had to beg them to change the sheets on the bed, and even then, they only changed the sheets and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clean up, there was only one robe for two people (and one size does not fit all), you had to pay for internet service (even in the Presidential Suite), desk blocked the walkway in the living room (we figured because the hotel was too cheap to drop an internet line in a location that would have been better suited for a desk than the hallway), old windows\u00e2\u20ac\u201deven on the 11th floor, the suite was extremely noisy (and cold near windows) from outside city noise (if they brag about a multi-million dollar renovation, they should have done it correctly), my pet peeve\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey did not have a plastic liner for the ice bucket, and it was a major problem for them to bring one, after we requested it, they wiped out the used / dirty drinking glasses in the room and put them back on the shelf as if to suggest they were clean and ready for re-use (I guess that's how they prepared them for us in the first place), and although the shower stall had 4 shower heads, you had to use one head to prop=up the other head so that you could use it\u00e2\u20ac\u201dotherwise, they were limp and just fell over. After we got over the initial \"awe factor\" of the Suite, we started to realize it was ust not clean, and we were therefore never really comfortable in it. Any interaction we had with staff was categorically not pleasant, with a few exceptions at the Besch Resturant and in the Deli shop. Staff was either condescending or pompus; or both. On the day of check-out, I arose early. A cleaning lady had already entered the Suite by 7AM saying she was sorry--that she thought we had checked out already. I went to the front door and saw the bill had been slipped through. Upon inspection, I realized there was a big problem with the charges. Instead of our bill being X, it was nearly 3X! Needless to say there was a major disagreement at the front desk that morning. After speaking with a young man at the front desk who represented himself as the hotel manager and who has evidently never been to a customer service course in his entire short life, David Simonis eventually came out, and was at least professional, although not friendly. (This is where orchestra plays \"grand entrance\" flourish) He eventually agreed to fix the problem with the bill after we passed a few words and he realized the fault was that of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s; and after he destroyed any hope that we might remember our stay at the Roosevelt fondly. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too bad that no one ever told him the customer is always right, especially when you are paying for luxury, \"Waldorf Astoria\" treatment. His attitude was condescending, and dismissive. All things considered, this hotel added absolutely nothing to the enjoyment of our vacation. Any positive memories we took away were a result of us deciding we would not be deterred from having a good time by the poor experience at this hotel. On the positive side, we felt safe at the Roosevelt. But, if you are seeking a luxury experience, try the Ritz Carlton, across the street. None of these things would have happened over there\u00e2\u20ac\u201da manager would have been up to that suite after the first complaint to the front desk, making sure all problems were resolved immediately; and I certainly would not have had to argue with an early morning manager about a bill at the Ritz. If I wanted to argue over a bill, I would have never made reservations at what I thought was a luxury brand. We checked in to the Roosevelt because our home away from home is an integral part of our vacation experience. We were made to believe the Roosevelt would deliver on these expectations and thus enhance our vacation experience. We agreed to pay more, because we expected more\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get what we paid for.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germantown, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cFive star rooms, two star service\u201d", "Author": "JPax", "ReviewID": "UR121565892", "Content": "We stayed at the Roosevelt for the second time since the re-branding and renovation.

The bed was deliciously comfortable. The bathroom had a shower only, which is a minus for me, and next time I'll be specific about room with a bathtub. We had PJ's coffee at Teddy's Cafe and breakfast at the Sazerac restaurant, which was of course nice and pricey. Valet parking is $40.

Really quite nice and way beyond a typical room. The hotel is a classic, elegant hotel that is a throwback to a bygone era. Both of the times that we were there, the Christmas decorations were up and that adds to the enchantment. Surprisingly the staff are not of the stature of the hotel itself, other than the concierge.

The gym is of decent quality - 4 elipticals, 2 treadmills and some bikes. They also have a leg press machine, an array of dumbells, and a cable machine. It won't provide a solid weight workout but the cardiovascular machines are top rate. The biggest issue with this hotel is that everything about it is expensive, from the coffee bar to the Sazerac bar to the valet parking. If you are on a budget, park at the lot next door. Valet parking is $40 per night. Food and drink costs are more like a New York City grande hotel than a New Orleans one.

We were with a large convention and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a business trip and pleasure trip for our family - my husband, me, and our daughter who turned 4 the week before the trip. From the moment we arrived we were in awe. The lobby is simply gorgeous, with some interesting history e.g. the Paris Exhibition Clock, the Blue Room - every time we walked in we were in awe of the beauty. Next, check in, which went quite quickly for our large group. We arrived very late at night and I think there was extra staff on duty because of the size of our group because most hotels would not have so many people working the front desk so late. The staff were all very friendly and efficient, and although some people in our group had mix ups with their rooms e.g. not getting a suite as requested, or getting a somewhat small room for a family of four, we couldn't have been more pleased with our room. It was beautiful and large - we seemed to have been given one of the larger rooms with a large bathroom and large walk in closet. The bathroom had a fabulous tub, great shower, double sinks with a large vanity and a large mirror - perfect for getting ready for our big events. And the toilet was in it's own little space on the side with it's own door for additional privacy. The beds, 2 king sized, were extremely comfortable with piles of super comfy pillows which thrilled me because I am picky about my pillows and like to have at least 2 or 3. We all slept wonderfully in the beds, it was quite possibly the best we've ever slept. In the main room there was a large desk with chair, 2 king sized beds, bedside tables, a large tv stand/dresser and another long end table, plus a bench at the end of each bed and yet there was still tons of room to move around/for our daughter to play. The view from our room was a roof below - not great. But we weren't there to stay in our room looking out the window so we didn't care too much. We really appreciated the heavy curtains on the windows, they were like blackout blinds, because they kept the bright sun out which meant our daughter slept in to a decent time in the mornings and had no trouble falling asleep for her afternoon naps. We also heard no outside noise when in our room. The location was ideal - so close to The French Quarter, right across from the street car station. I was worried about going out and about with my four year old by myself while my husband was working, but it was a breeze to get around using the trolleys as well as just walking e.g. to the French Quarter, the aquarium, shops etc. The one place I was not comfortable was at the McDonalds nearby - that whole area near it was somewhat sketchy and I do not recommend spending too much time in that area; it is only minutes from the hotel but what a difference only a couple of minutes can make!! The IHOP across the street was better, and ideal for our little one when we had a couple of morning meals on our own. The staff were amazingly friendly there but I will save that for another post. The beignets and coffee in the little cafe in the lobby were delicious! I wasn't a big fan of the Sazerac cocktail - a little too strong, not really my thing. We didn't try any of the real restaurants in the hotel, mostly because we found their hours to be inconvenient to our schedule, but the hotel catered the food for our banquets (which was most of our meals, including breakfast, lunch and dinner) and the food was unique and delicious, with great service too. The pool area was great, our daughter loved it. There was lots of room on the large patio and the pool and hot tub were both nice. Not a great view/ambience but again that wasn't important to our stay. We loved the nightly turn down service, complete with chocolates on our pillows, and also loved the morning paper and weather forecast which was always very accurate and thus helpful. The one complaint was that the insulation between the walls was inadequate. On our last two days/ nights we had a businessman staying next to us who was on constant business calls while in his room, and we could hear absolutely everything of his conversations loud and clear in our room. This really ruined our moods the last two days as he was up very early and on the phone most of the day which meant he woke us up, and also made nap time for our daughter tricky. If he had been beside us the whole 8 days it would have ruined our trip. Luckily the rest of the time we either had no one, or someone very quiet, next to us. When it came time to check out we discovered a fairly hefty phone charge on our bill, even though we had followed the calling card directions on the phone which should have made the calls free. Without any fuss, and in fact with an apology, the charges were immediately reversed when we expressed concern at the front desk. Great customer service! Our flight was not until quite late at night, and we were pleased that the hotel held all our bags in a secured back room for the day/evening after we checked out. Further, our daughter had a balloon animal made during one of the events, a large alligator, and the staff at the luggage desk took extra care of him to ensure that he was still in one piece when we came back - instead of putting him in the back room with the rest of the luggage they kept him at the desk with them so they could keep their eyes on him and make sure he didn't get popped. This meant the world to our little one! If I remember correctly the young man's name was Kevin who went above and beyond for us. He was unfortunately off shift by the time we left at night, but the next person was also very good and it took us no time at all to get all of our bags back and get a cab to the airport - it was the fastest turnaround time ever, from requesting our bags to getting into the taxi that he had called - we almost felt like celebrities getting whisked away via top priority service! And this was on a rainy night, yet the cab arrived in no time and the hotel staff loaded our bags into the car so fast I don't think they got a drop of rain on them! Overall this hotel was fabulous and we would highly recommend it. If we ever make it back to New Orleans, which we would love to, we would love to stay at this hotel again. The service was stellar, the decor was beautiful, the location was central, the food was delicious, the room was large and the beds were divinely comfortable.

When I made the reservation for The Roosevelt I made a note on the online check-in that it was our first time and we were hoping for a memorable experience and booked a superior room. Upon arrival at the hotel, my spouse and I were given an upgrade to a large suite, which was huge, well-appointed, and well beyond our expectations; it had a double door entry way, marble floors, bar, living room, hallways, bath, and separate bedroom - when I say huge, I am talking one bedroom apartment size suite. Everything you could think of was provided: toothbrushes, loofahs, robes, bottled water, shoe shine rags...more stuff than one could ever use. The downside one might ask? The cleaning staff could have done a better job. The bathroom lights had long, possibly female, hairs trailing off them, the very large sunken tub had smaller, black (pubic?) hairs in it. I brought this to the attention of the front desk before we went our exploring the city, with hopes it would be taken care of while we were out, and we were assured it would be. When we returned to our room much, much later that evening, we were surprised to see a nice hand-written note from the front desk clerk apologizing for the inconvenience and two complimentary hotel breakfast coupons inside as an added bonus which was great. What was not great? The bathroom still had the hair - it never did get cleaned. Had we been staying more than one night, I would have been more apt to have complained again, but as it was, we got a few hours sleep and checked-out the next morning. Would I stay again? Possibly. The hotel, it's character, charm, location and amenities were fabulous.

This last week I stayed at the Roosevelt for a conference. The first room I had was lovely, seemed very clean, and spacious. At turn down they gave me slippers, chocolates, the weather forecast, and a robe which was very nice. However, I noticed a small ant on the bed when I went to sleep the first night. I got up, got dressed, and went to my conference. Later in the morning I stopped in my room. The left side of the bed had about 30-40 tiny ants crawling all over it. I told the maid who called maintenance right away. When I came back later, the room stank of pesticides. The windows don't open so I asked for another room. They transferred me to another room and gave me a free bottle of wine. Sounds like they handled it ok right? However, the new room was not the same. The new room had a bathroom so tiny that they had to put the clean towels outside in the closet. Do you think to look in the closet (which is not right next to the bathroom) for towels? Me neither. Also, I had to put all my toiletries on the floor. The maid kept stacking them precariously on a tiny shelf that they had glasses on every day when she cleaned. When my husband arrived (they knew I expected him), the situation was worse in the bathroom. This maid tossed chocolates on the bed (almost fell off every day) and never gave us slippers or a robe. To add insult to injury, in the coffee shop, I waited in long lines every day for extremely expensive and very slow service. Finally, one day I waited, evidently behind the wrong people, in the wrong spot, and the guy waited on people that just walked up first - completely ignoring us (the counter is not very long so there is no way he could have not noticed us). I got so mad that I stormed out and found a nearby McDonalds. Which while a bit skanky - I recommend - it's right around the corner on Canal, WILDLY cheaper and WAY faster. Finally as we were leaving the room, another maid (this was not the maid that did my turn down or lack thereof) was getting berated loudly by another maid or supervisor outside our room.

It has recently been restored and is absolutely breaktaking as soon as you walk through the doors. When you stay at this hotel you feel taken care of. There were men with top hats who always opened the doors for us and of course the valet service was great. The red carpet that leads of the stairs into the hotel make you feel like you're royalty. I also loved the fact that this hotel was on Canal St. right across from the French Quater, making it very close to everything! Now, with all that being said, there is a reason I did not rate this Grand hotel an Excellent, a few reasons actually. First, the guestrooms did not come with refrigerators or microwaves. With a city where's there's food everywhere you are defintely going to need both and we were without either. You would think this type of hotel and with the prices a refrigerator and microwave should automatically be in each room. Both appliances were each $50 extra dollars for each night, ridiculous! Second, there is no complimentary breakfact of any kind with the price of your room. I don't understand why at these already expensive hotels, you even have to think about paying extra for this...it should be included as well in my opinion. So, with having two young little boys and having to go find breakfast every morning was a huge inconvenience as well as not having a microwave and refrigerator, which we sometimes used the mini bar to keep our drinks cold. But on a positive note, I did love that the rooms came with complimentary his and her slippers. I wish the wonderful bath robes were free too but of course they were $115 each. Furthermore, the pictures online of the pool looked extraordinary, but in person it's very, very small. With all that room, you would think the pool should have been olympic size, but yet it was barely smaller than a jacuzzi. All in all, I would consider staying at this hotel again, but next time I would ask for a free upgrade to a suite which I do believe, if I'm not mistaken, include those two applicances.

After being fine with my room (although much smaller than all my friends and colleagues there with the same rate room) and happy with the comfortable bed and beautiful lobby, I was feeling pretty good about the hotel. BUT... I went to bed at around 1 am hoping for a great relaxing night sleep but was awakened by a LOUD scratching noise at 5 am and jumped up from a deep sleep thinking someone was trying to get in my room or that there was a rat in the room. It turns out that a hotel employee was trying to put the bill under the door at 5AM and it got stuck so they kept crumpling it and trying to force it under! First of all- don't put bills under the door as early as 5 AM! I have stayed at fine hotels all over the world and have NEVER had this happen so early. MORE IMPORTANTLY- when it does not work , don't make a bunch of noise forcing it and wake the guest up at 5 am! It takes a lot of noise to wake someone out of a deep sleep. I was unable to fall back asleep until 8 am and then lost half a day of my trip. I called the manager and her offered me a late check out which I gratefully accepted. However, in retrospect he really should NOT have charged me for that evening. I was too exhausted to think clearly enough to ask for him to compliment the night but considering that they ruined my night and day, he should have offered. Most fine hotels would have offered. The Roosevelt is just under what I would consider a fine hotel but does have a lot of things to offer at great rates. I, unfortunately, had a bad experience. I would consider staying there again IF and ONLY IF- they did something to make up for the last trip AND they promised that NO ONE WOULD PUT A BILL UNDER OUR DOOR AT 5 AM and make a bunch of unacceptable noise. HOLD THE BILL DOWNSTAIRS PLEASE! All that said- I feel like I just had bad luck and a strange bad experience.

It just underwent a major $170 million renovation and it shows. The lobby is beautiful and elegant. The King room is beautifully decorated and new looking. The bathroom is very spacious with its own TV. I love the shower because it not only has a hand held but a \"rain\" shower head and back massaging spouts. The room comes with bathrobes and slippers. They leave you with 2 bottles of complimentary water everyday and even get your ice for you by the time you come back in the evening. Don't open the bar fridge though because I think it will automatically charge. Our view is nothing to write about ... the back of buildings and dirty parking lot. We were on the 8th floor but can still hear the occasional delivery trucks and police sirens. The TV is huge but there's often problem with the satellite signal. The hotel is located right off Canal street. It's 1 block away from the St. Charles streetcar where you can take to the Garden District. It is a nice ride on a hot day for $3 day pass. I'm not particularly impressed by the houses on Garden District. I was expecting mansions but most are somewhat run-down. The Roosevelt is also only 1 block away from Bourbon street (after you cross Canal St), and 2 blocks from Royal St. Riverwalk and Harrah's Casino is about 7 blocks toward the river but if you don't want to walk on a hot day, take the Canal St. streetcar which you can catch in the middle island of Canal St. Because it's located off of Canal, it is a little more quiet than the hotels facing Canal street directly.

We had a great long weekend in NO planned and I had read some of the reviews on this hotel and was not disappointed. I am a frequent business traveler and over the years have become a bit of a travel snob. When on leisure travel with my wife we like to stay at upscale hotels, but I judge every room on the basics of cleanliness, a comfy bed and a good shower. This hotel nailed all of these crucial areas. We had a suite which was not well described on their website but was well worth the upgrade. The room was meticulously clean, the bed was big, very comfy and the shower was simply AMAZING. Four heads great pressure, lots of control and lots of HOT water. (ignore the other review i guess) No tub, but I am not a bath-in-a-hotel type anyway. So not a problem for me but may be for you. The only issue we had at all with our room is that they did not restock the mini bar over our stay so the best snacks and drinks were gone by the end and they also didn't restock toilet paper which is not cool. But a call to housekeeping resolved theses small inconveniences. Outside the room the hotel is spectacular. The Grand Lobby is stunning, and there's bars restaurants, coffee shop, spa, concierge all on the premise as well as a John Besh restaurant Domenica.

We were staying in the hotel for a private event and really enjoyed it. Service is very good at this hotel, which you should expect if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to pay this much for a hotel. Easy valet, friendly check-in, quick orientation of services, and they had our allergy-free room ready from the get-go. Parking is $40/night (It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $10/night at a public garage a couple of streets round the corner on Camp, I think), but chances are you are ok with paying $$$ for parking if you can swing the cost of the hotel itself anyways. Likewise for the internet access that you purchase in 24-hour blocks and the tasty but pricey breakfast. There are so many wonderful places to eat breakfast or brunch in quick walking distance that it seems hardly worth it to stay in the hotel except that the service is so pleasant. The pool/patio area looks really nice, spacious, and nicely arranged. You can have room service bring you something to eat if the bar isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open yet. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really enjoy i, though others in my party did. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like it because the air conditioning units mounted on the top of the buildings were really noisy. Never mind, there are plenty of things to do in New Orleans, and the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location is really great. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely convenient to the French Quarter (2 min walk), near to a CVS and Walgreens, and both the Canal Street and the St. Charles street car lines. You can also easily walk to the aquarium and the casino (~5 min walk). The Saturday Farmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Market is nice, too, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a 5 min walk away. The fact that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so centrally located, yet on a quiet street means that when you want some quiet, or just a quiet night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get it. Our room was spacious and very comfortable, including a little flatscreen TV in the bathroom that we never used, but was novel. In-room safe, large closet, plenty of soft towels, nice soaps, fizzy bath tablet, fluffy bathrobe and slippers for your stay, make for a nicely pampered feeling.

We had a king bed suite with a half bath in the front hallway and sitting area with a desk, sofa and large LCD television. The sleeping area of the room is separated from the sitting area by a wall and had a king bed with a chair and another large LCD television. There was also a full bath with a small LCD television.

The hotel is right off Canal and provides easy access to the French Quarter with Bourbon Street being right across Canal. It was about one block to get to the St. Charles Trolley which we took to the Garden District. We did not eat at any of the hotel's restaurants, but did have coffee, light breakfast and sorbet at Teddy's Cafe which was very handy. It was only a 5 minute walk each night for dinner in the French Quarter. My only complaints would be the noise on Canal and $40 charge for the valet parking. There is a parking garage right next to the hotel and I hear it is $24 a day. We decided we felt a bit safer to let the valet just take care of our car and it was ready for us very promptly upon check out. Canal was very loud both nights we were there. We were on the 13th floor but my husband and I counted 10 police/ambulance/fire engine sirens in about a two hour period and just random street noise when the television was off. It literally sounded like the town was coming down around us, but I realize that is part of the city and the hotel can do nothing about that. The windows appeared to be older, possibly original so maybe they could invest in more soundproof windows at some point in the future. All in all those are mild complaints and we had a fabulous stay.

I don't like staying in conference hotels because it's so hectic. This hotel was a safe distance away. I did a lot of \"research\" in choosing this hotel and was very pleased with the choice. Lobby: This is the crowning jewel of this hotel. The lobby is beautiful. You feel special just walking in. The tile work is impressive. I've been to a lot of 5-star hotels and this one, while not 5-star room-wise, has a beautiful \"old school\" lobby. Loved it. Accommodations: I thought the room decor was a bit dark and it had no good view (although no room would given where the hotel is) but a friend who shared the room said it was the best hotel she's stayed in. She loved it. Bathroom had a tv in it and the requisite granite. Toiletries were fine but not remarkable. Bed was very comfy and quiet--all things I'd expect from a Waldorf Astoria. Eating: I didn't eat in the restaurant but did eat in the cafe several times which was perfect. I am not a big breakfast eater, so the bagels and fruit and coffee were great. Plus the lines at PJs and Starbucks down the street were just crazy (this was a conf w. about 20,000 people attending). There's an Italian restaurant that I wish I had tried--but with sooo many places to eat at in N'awlins, didn't have the chance. Location: The location is good, even for Bourbon Street. I walked to Bourbon at least 3 times while there...and once at (ahem) 2 AM. I felt safe. Internet: You have to pay for Internet in the room but not in the lobby. Parking: The valet-only parking at the hotel is ridiculously (about $40/day) expensive but you can self-park right next door for about $24/day. Shopping: There's a great little shop attached with all kinds of sundries and souvenirs...and the cashiers were very nice & helpful with ideas and restaurant ideas.

From the valet attendants outside to the front desk staff, concierge, bell staff, room service, and beyond, everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful. My room was spacious, clean, and had every amenity I wanted. The only challenge I encountered with the room was that my Verizon Mifi card didn't work (probably a result of the old building--lots of steel and cement for the signal to get through), so I did have to pay for hotel wifi. Once I did though, it was fast and well worth the price. The room service menu is complete, though a bit pricy, and you can order food 24/7. I found both the breakfast and dinner selections I made to be very good, certainly above the level of most hotel food. The business center is staffed during working hours, but available 24 hours, which certainly comes in handy. The fitness center is also well stocked, even with infused water and fruit, and open 24 hours. Generally speaking, this hotel is well-set-up for business travelers who may be operating with very full schedules, something I certainly appreciate. I did enjoy my massage at the spa, though I realized after the fact that gratuity was included in the price. I wish someone had mentioned that to me before I tipped an additional $35 on top of that, but my massage therapist was so nice, and my experience had been good, so I didn't call and ask them to make the change after the fact. Nevertheless, that is something they should tell you before you sign the credit card receipt, which is NOT itemized. The neighborhood is not awful, but right on the edge of the zone where things turn a bit sketchy, so if you're a woman traveling alone, I would take cabs most places. You are within walking distance of the French Quarter, but again, late at night, that can be a little dicey. Cabs will take you anywhere, and the valet attendants at the Roosevelt are wonderful about calling them for you. There's even a car service that works with the hotel, so if cabs are scarce, that is another option. Overall, I was a big fan of The Roosevelt during my stay.

Highlights would be the room size, decor, flat screen televisions (which seem to be missing in NOLA), and that it is not in the French Quarter (though it is right next to Walgreens on Canal, which is not necessarily a bonus if your trying to get away from the drunks). We had a deluxe room with sitting area, and it was spacious for our family of five. The couch in the sitting room folded out to a bed, which my toddler loved sleeping on. We had a crib for our 3 month old twin boys, but the hotel did not really go out of its way to accommodate youngsters. You might say NO is not a town for kids, but I would argue that Mid City Park and the Audubon zoo make it quite entertaining for them. Plus, the Four Seasons in Las Vegas (another questionable destination for children) gave us toys, toiletries and a diaper pail for our kids. Nothing comparable was done at this grand location. The hotel is very well decorated, probably the best that I've stayed at in the city, though I think the Ritz might beat it (have only dined there, though, so hard to say). It's nice to finally have a flat screen, though it's not necessary for me. The bars and restaurants at the Roosevelt, are also top notch. Besh's restaurant, Domenica is in the lobby as is the historic Sazerac bar. However, the posh feel, sometimes made me feel under-dressed at night. As for the location, it is great that it is not in the Quarter, unlike the Ritz. However, I prefer the Warehouse, Marigny or Garden. It's close enough to the quarter and Canal, that you catch some of the overspill from Bourbon. Plus, while it's nice to have a drugstore nearby, that Walgreens next door doesn't always attract the best customers. One last note, if you are driving, park next door and don't valet if you aren't coming and going more than once during the day. It's $44 to valet, which is steep to me, even coming from Chicago which is also not a cheap city to park in. Overall, I would stay here again, but only if the price was right.

They did remove it, but it was just the aggravation of having to go deal with it. 3) Housekeeping came by for turn down service at about 6 one night when we were still getting ready - I asked them to come back at 8.

The trip did not get off to a good start. We arrived at the hotel very late at night on the day of my birthday. When I started getting ready in the morning to go out and have a wonderful birthday in New Orleans, I discovered that I was missing a very important carry on bag. I packed everything in the bag that I didn't want to lose in case my suitcase got lost - my bible, medicine, make up and all of my favorite jewelry. I then remembered that I left it in the cab we took from the airport. Everyone I spoke to regarding getting my bag back gave me very little hope that it would be found or returned. I went into the shop to ask the ladies where I could go shopping to replace some of the items I lost. When I told them my story they were so wonderful - giving me hugs, told me they would pray for me and took me over to the hotel spa to get some help with replacing my make up. When I got back to my room, a bag tied up with beautiful ribbon was delivered to my room. It was from the ladies of the Emporium Shop and contained a beautiful cross necklace and a pair of earrings! I was so touched by their act of kindness and I'll never forget it. How did the story end? Due to the diligence of Peter from the transportation department at the airport, my bag was tracked down and everything was returned as I packed them. This was a miracle in itself as we had very little information to give him to help track down cab - no cab number, paid in cash so no paperwork to refer to and wasn't even 100% sure of the name of the cab company!

The room my boyfriend and I stayed in looked like a cowboy let loose with steel toed boots on. The bathroom door had a 1\" by 1\" piece of wood peeling off of the bottom of it, the walls were covered with giant scrapes and scuff marks, there were old drink spills on the walls and even a red mark behind the nightstand that resembled blood. Paying $200 plus a night for a hotel that was remolded not even two years ago should get you a room that hasn't been beaten to he*l. No matter what temperature you set the A/C on, the room still heats back up to a stuffy 75-78 degrees. It would get so hot at night that we would wake up. I don't like it when hotels regulate the room temperatures to save $. Housekeeping was intermittent at best. We had regular housekeeping the second day of our stay. The subsequent days we had to request service three times and one of those times housekeeping still didn't show up. The last day of our stay housekeeping did not come until sometime between 3 and 5 o'clock. The pool area is itty bitty and the pool and hot tub are even smaller. The vinyl sides of the pool are dirty. It clearly doesn't get regular cleaning. And, there is no pool bar. If you want food or drink you have to call down to the Sazarac and wait 25-30 mins and then pay nearly $40 for a Bellini and a rum and coke. If you spend any time at the pool and want something to drink, go to Walgreens and buy your own. My boyfriend and I would wind down our day relaxing by the pool before going out at night. The location is decent. The Ritz has a much better location. I am 22 and my boyfriend is 25 so we spent our days walking around the French Quarter and our nights eating dinner in the Quarter and enjoying Bourbon. It was a pain having to cross Canal Street every time you left the hotel or were coming home. The Ritz is on the Quarter side of Bourbon, which is much better. We found some great restaurants to eat at in the Quarter- The Courtyard of The Two Sisters and Arnaud's were two of the best. We also had a lot of fun listening to jazz music at The Funky Pirate. It is a low key crowd and very fun. Not crazy Bourbon Street stuff. Overall, my boyfriend and I spent $1600 staying at The Roosevelt and I think the hotel was only worth $600. We were not impressed and will spend our money elsewhere next time. ***The only plus, which most nice hotels will do this, is The Roosevelt accommodated a romantic request made by my boyfriend.

There was also a huge flat screen in the room to view from the comfy king size bed. The bed was so comfortable. We were on the 14th floor with amazing city views. The hotel had great soundproofing as were heard nothing all night. The concierge was very helpful in giving us a map and directions to where we wanted to go. My ONLY complaint about the hotel would be the wrist bands. During Mardi Gras you have to wear a wrist band to get in and out of the hotel. They were very strict about seeing your wrist band and I found it to be a little silly. I think showing your room key to get in should suffice. We were walking distance to the Mardi Gras parade location, French Quarter, Cafe Du Monde, riverfront, etc. It was a perfect location. Wi-fi is 13 bucks a day and valet parking 40 bucks a day.

I had stayed here twice back when it was the Fairmont. Grand old hotel. A few points: Hotel/location - Gorgeous lobby. The hotel offers a great little deli style place downstairs as well as two more formal dining options and the Sazerac bar. Great gift shop as well. Neat rooftop pool. Also has a spa and nice workout area. The location is good. You are across Canal from the French Quarter so it is nice if you want to be close but not necessarily in the Quarter. It is also a great option if you need to access the CBD. About a 20 minute walk to the Superdome. It is about 20 minute walk down to the convention center so if you need to get down there for meetings The Roosevelt isn't a terrible option but you may want to look for something closer if you need to go back and forth a lot. Rooms - My room was a tad small but not atypical for an older hotel. The bathroom was actually pretty large and offered a TV next to the mirror which was cool. Room was comfortable overall; great bed. Service - The front desk staff was average. I would have expected more from a Waldorf Astoria property. The valet service was short staffed. Waited over 20 minutes for my car because there was only one guy who was working his butt off retrieving cars and hailing cabs for folks. (You can park across the street but I had some issues with the garage so I just went ahead and used the hotel valet.) Hotel does have turndown service. There was a lady working in the gift shop who was an absolute jewel. She was extremely helpful and just as charming as she could be. Value - Rates were comparable to most other hotels in the area including the larger chain hotels and the smaller boutique hotels so I can't really complain.

The hotel also paid for us to attend the Sunday morning jazz brunch. We felt more than fairly compensated for our troubles.

That being said, we slept well. The views were nothing to write home about, either, but the hotels location right off of the French Quarter was perfect.

We had a huge brunch planned on Sunday in the Blue Room and had given this hotel plenty of business. When my guests began to arrive on Thursday afternoon, the hotel did not have rooms ready for most of my guests and asked them to wait in the lobby until rooms became available. Several of them had traveled from other countries with small children, including infants. Six hours later, the hotel started telling people that they ran out of rooms that night and would be bumping people to the Hilton Riverwalk, which is a MUCH lower quality hotel. At this point, I felt it necessary to intervene and asked to speak to a manager and was told there was none on duty. When I asked the \"person in charge\" why our guests were being bumped when we had a room block and reservations for months, he had no answer. When I asked why they couldn't be moved to a hotel that was at least as nice as the Roosevelt, I was told that there were no rooms in the city at the nicer hotels. I then requested that he call again IN FRONT OF ME a nice hotel - the Windsor Court and ask for availability. Of course, there WERE rooms available and he had LIED. Unfortunately, about 50 of my guests missed the first night's festivities because of the extremely poor treatment that the Roosevelt bestowed upon us and they managed to REALLY UPSET a pretty laid back bride and groom on the eve of their wedding weekend.

It was billed as a renovated, historic four-five star property to be a flagship of Hilton's new Waldorf brand. While I expected a stupendous, elegant, refined hotel with impeccable service akin to the St. Regis experience (as with Hilton rebranding their superluxe hotels as Waldorfs in homage to the Waldorf=Astoria in New York, St. Regis was Starwood's effort to rebrand their superluxe Sheratons into St. Regises in homage to the St. Regis in New York), what I found was a tacky hotel with mediocre customer service and a design that seemed to be done on the cheap. Let's start with the decor. The room amenities and furniture seemed to have been picked up at the local Target. While drapes from a distance appeared to be sumptuous valour, a closer look revealed them to be cheap vinyl drapes with graphics on them meant to look like they were valour. The furniture in the room was tacky. The lighting consisted of awful compact fluorescent bulbs that seemed to suck light out of the room- not what you would see at a St. Regis, Ritz, or Four Seasons property. The customer service was dreadful. I had the misfortune of checking in late in the afternoon. I was traveling solo and requested a king bed. They had none. They offered to \"upgrade\" me to a regular room with a king bed for $15. I felt that that was unnecessary nickle and diming that left me with a really bad taste in my mouth. The mention of any monetary amount less than $20 should never occur at a luxury hotel check-in! I declined to pay for the upgrade out of principle. Shockingly, when I expressed my surprised to the front desk manager about this I got nowhere. The lobby had the usual gilt and gold one would expect from a historic hotel. The location was dismal. It was down the block from a somewhat dilapidated main drag (Canal Street) that was filled with cheap pharmacies and seedy looking people. You had to cross it to enter the French Quarter. I do wonder why Hilton is rebranding based on the Waldorf in New York.

We had a luxury suite, which was quite nice for our family as our girls could share the pull out bed in the couch in the living room. Since the hotel is just across Canal St. from the French Quarter, it wasn't too loud, but it's by no means soundproof from partying and other street noise.

And each morning, the hotel had towels, water and fresh fruit for those of us returning from a run. Nice touch. It was still warm enough during the first part of the week to enjoy the rooftop pool. We enjoyed the well made espresso drinks in the coffee cafe on the lobby level and had two free drinks in the Sazerac bar, compliments of my HH Diamond status. My only real complaint is inconsistent cleaning service. We got no cleaning service after our first night, although they did try to do a turn-down service on our uncleaned room. When we called and asked for service as we went out for dinner, they didn't even bring fresh towels. Glass wear, if used, was not consistently returned to the room. We sometimes didn't receive wash cloths. And debris, presumably from another room's room service tray, stayed on the carpet in the hall outside our room the entire four days we were there.

We wern't asked if it was inconvienient for us not to be getting dressed and ready to go out we had to sit there in limbo chasing the workmen to find out when they were coming back so we could get dressed. The champagne we had bought for that night remained unopened. 90 minutes later the workmen finished, leaving us pondering how to salvage our plans. Day three... we awoke to a few ants in the bathroom... a bit worrying but we put it down to the work that had been completed the previously day.......UNTIL we opened one of the draws in the room to find it crawling with ants, (along with the second bed in the room).

After some research, I chose the Roosevelt because of its old world feel and the great AAA rate -- we booked a deluxe king room. I cannot adequately express how fantastic this hotel is. The lobby, as many have mentioned, is stunning -- it looks just as it does in the hotel photo gallery. The staff was incredibly nice -- we had requested early check-in but knew it was a longshot on a Sunday. We were unable to check in at 2 pm, but walked for a bite to eat (the French Quarter is 1 1/2 blocks away on the other side of Canal -- the streetcar stops are there, too -- close to the Quarter but not so close that you get all the noise) and the front desk called us at 3 pm (the actual check in time) to say our room was ready. My husband joked about being glad to know our penthouse suite was ready -- we returned to the hotel and were given our keys... to an amazing king suite -- to which they had upgraded us. (Ask for Room 11111.)(That is not a typo.) I have stayed in nice hotels, including Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton properties, which were all lovely, but never in a room or suite this nice -- it was breathtaking -- an entry hall, a beautiful, large living room with a desk, large sofa, large occasional chairs, there was a separate dining table (for 2) area and a bar, then a beautiful, large bedroom with a wonderful king bed, large chaise lounge, huge dresser, wonderful bath w/2 sinks and a separate shower/tub/commode room. Fabulous robes (nicest I have ever had in a hotel) also provided.Two large flat screen tvs and another small one in the bathroom (where the sinks were). All the furnishings were beautiful period reproductions. I was so stunned, I took pictures of the entire suite. I actually called down to the desk to find out what rate we were being charged as I was afraid my husband had signed something for a zillion dollars without reading it, but it was our original AAA rate. The staff was very nice and accommodating. Our luggage was delayed in being delivered from the bell desk, and when we called (it had been about an hour after we checked in, and we could have called sooner, but were enjoying relaxing in the suite), it was delivered immediately with very sincere apologies for the delay. The only other blip was that the shower (very nice with multiple shower heads) had a leak from the glass enclosure to the floor, which we had to soak up with all our available (huge, wonderful) towels -- so we asked for replacements when we came in from dinner and they were delivered in 10 minutes. The Sazerac Bar is a very cool place with all sorts of interesting specialty drinks and, again, a lovely staff. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. It is really a beautiful, beautiful hotel. My only regret was that we could only stay one night. With regard to what we did in NOLA, we had a wonderful dinner at Mr. B's Bistro -- very busy, popular place and the owners are part of the Brennan family, as is true of many of NOLA's finest restaurants -- and heard some interesting jazz at Snug Harbor on Frenchmen's Street (for the over-30 set, our cab driver told us, and we certainly qualified), the obligatory beignets at Cafe Du Monde (tasty and affordable) on Jackson Square, and a breakfast at the Coffee Pot, which we would not recommend -- surly service and the food was fine, but that's it. The WWII Museum is terrific and the film, \"Beyond all Borders,\" is tremendous. We had lunch at the American Sector (part of the museum), which was hip and cool to look at and sit in, but the food was a little pricey and fine, but nothing to write home about.", "Date": "October 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sarasota, Florida", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "Sparty2007", "ReviewID": "UR84963626", "Content": "This hotel didn't live up to the usual standards of Waldorf Hotels.

We along with a huge group of friends all decided to stay here for a wedding that weekend. The wedding rates were decent and considering how expensive it normally is, we all jumped at the chance to stay here. We knew it would be an experience to remember. Hotel lobby is absolutely gorgeous and pretty much anyone that works there greets you as they pass by. Hotel is far enough you don't feel overwhelmed by all the tourists/French Quarter, but if you don't like to walk or have health issues you may have to take cabs to most destinations. Our room was beautiful and beds were out of this world comfortable. Bathroom was also very elegant. Floor had gorgeous tile pattern and there was even a TV in there. I usually cannot stand the lighting of hotel rooms, but this was excellent. I could get ready and not feel like I was cooped up in a hotel room. Lot's of mirrors and decent closet space. Room also didn't have that \"hotel room\" smell some have, which to me is a great thing. I had brought my own hairdryer not expecting to find the room was equipped with the best hotel hair dryer, best hairdryer in general I have ever used. I know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not usually the highlight of someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay, but I know the brand and was so pleased to find that in our room to use! TV was nice but remote was a pain in the neck to use and seemed to never work. After talking to others staying there they had the same issue. Internet in the room wasn't free, I thought that was standard these days. My main complaint was the housekeeping. I mean, what housekeeping? If we didn't call to have our room cleaned, it wouldn't get done. We got there Thursday and had to call for clean towels Friday evening and then Saturday had to call just to get someone to make our bed. We had heard someone we were with had turn down service at night, we called to request this and that never happened either. Every time we opened our door from being out we were only disappointed to see beds hadn't been made, towels weren't re-stocked, and bathrooms hadn't been wiped down. Even when we called for service they didn't come. When they finally did arrive it was at a time we actually wanted to be in the room. I get that it's a big hotel and there is a schedule, but honestly if we hadn't called at all, which didn't even work every time, no one would have touched our room. That is pretty much inexcusable for a hotel like this. It was almost funny that no matter how many times we called they kept saying they would send someone....and no one would arrive. And in the end never did get any turn down service. They did try coming at 5:45 one evening for turn down service, which to me was a bit ridiculous. Considering they had just made our beds that day around 3 it was almost laughable that they would come back 2 hours later to turn down our beds. We had requested for them to come back after we left since we would be out all night. She even wrote down what time\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.and nothing. It was like they just wanted to get it done to say they did it, rather then do it at a reasonable time as they should and as we requested. It was more principle then anything that angers me most about that situation because I don't mind using a towel twice or getting into an unmade bed... I certainly don't get turn down service at my house, but the fact we called so many times and were promised every time to be taken care of and then not was absurd. Then at the end of our stay they had charged us a dollar every time we had called down to ask for service! Everything else couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been better, which is just a shame that what we experienced is what we remember the most about their service. The pool area was amazing. Pool was very clean and relaxing. The bar at the pool had football on for those who wanted to watch and the bartender and pool staff was very friendly and welcoming. Guest shop is totally overpriced. If you need a soda or toiletries you forgot, go to the Walgreens around the corner from the hotel. John Besh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant Domenica in the hotel is awesome. Very young, hip, wait staff with a menu to match. I had actually met the head manager out at a bar before dining there and when my family and I went she remembered me by name and came over to see how our meal and overall experience in New Orleans was. The Sazerac Bar is also a nice place to go for a drink, if anything it was cool to go just for the history of the bar alone. Despite what happened, overall it was a great stay. With all the other wonderful things there we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let it ruin our time. I just know how we all had been waiting so long for this weekend and to all stay there, that it was just such disappointment and almost shock. How could a place so nice have a total polar opposite approach to service? Anything that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to do with making sure we were satisfied was amazing. I knew going into this that it would probably be my only time ever getting a chance to stay in a hotel of this grandeur.

There are original paintings on the walls and the draperies add a rich sense of texture. The restaurant Domenica was fantastic...among the best we experienced in the city. One night we ordered takeout from Domenica and ate it in our room with a bottle of cabernet, which was very romantic. The Roosevelt far surpassed our expectations.

The suite was extravagant, with a large double door entry way, marble flooring, and beautiful furniture. The sitting room was narrow, but the 20 foot ceilings and large bay window quickly helped you overlook the actual square footage of the room. The suite included a large walk in closet, and a nicely sized bedroom with yet again another large window, and room for a small settee. The bathroom was AMAZING! The shower had 1/2 in glass doors, 54 jets, 1 rain head, and a hand held shower. Additionally the tub was so large that when I set in it the water came up to my chin before I even leaned back.

I will say that of all the hotels I have stayed at in New Orleans, this is the best by far! My partner and I booked this hotel at the last minute for a long Labor Day weekend getaway. I was surprised at how affordable the rate was -- $129/night. The hotel was running a special for Louisiana residents, and we were able to get this rate on their website only. I checked Expedia and other sites, and the rate on those websites were $159. Check in went smoothly. There were alot of people checking in with about 7 people at the front desk. There was a little bit of a wait, but it was not bad. I was asked for assistance with my luggage, but I kindly declined because I did not need the help of a bellman. The rooms were absolutely stunning and beautifully decorated. I am usually very picky with the rooms at any hotel that I stay at, and the room at this hotel passed my standards without any problems. Everything was new and extremely clean. I could definitely tell the quality difference of the furniture in the rooms compared to other hotels. The shower in the bathroom was AMAZING!!! There are 4 different shower heads located at different height levels, and it creates the most relaxing shower experience ever. Very nice Agraria amenities too. There is also a TV in the bathroom, which was a great addition (see picture). The tiling on the bathroom floor and in the shower were beautiful as well. The rooms also had 2 complimentary robes that my partner and I enjoyed. Turndown service was efficient. I will say that I cannot comment on services such as valet, luggage assistance, room service, the concierge, etc, because I did not utilize these services. I am just the kind of person that would rather do the job myself. But from what little I did encounter with the employees, they were very nice. Overall, this hotel is outstanding, and will be the hotel of choice anytime I am visiting New Orleans! *TIP* DO NOT PAY FOR PARKING! Parking at this hotel is ridiculous, charging $38/night + tax. There are numerous parking spots on the street for free. We parked on the corner of Poydras and Baronne without any problems. It was about a 5 block walk, but I would rather walk than pay that much to park. Just look for a spot that does not have a meter, and no yellow paint on the curbside.

The good: The staff was wonderfully friendly in an easygoing, southern way. The lobby was exquisite. Brunch Sunday in the Blue room was very good. On the other hand- I had stayed at this property when it was owned by another group. The desk clerk kept telling me that I \"wasn't goiing to believe\" the size of the rooms. Well, I didn't. The room was smallish and the bathroom was fairly small, even though I had an upgraded deluxe room. (The opposite of my room years ago). Service was slender, to say the least. I have a severe detergent allergy and the hotel was unable to re-wash my towels and blanket in hot water, something even 3 star hotels have been happy to do for me. (I have to take my own sheets anyway). As to housekeeping, we never had our soap replaced and, like the previous poster, a housekeeper took all out towels and left us with one hand towel. Also, some paper from their doilies stuck to the bathroom sink from being wet. In 4 days, they never cleaned or removed it.

The bad: Arrival experience is horrible. You pull up to busy side street and are ignored by staff. Then you get to shlep your bags up tall exterior stairs through narrow door. Only after you get inside do the bell hop staff show up to take your tip--- err luggage. Absurd. Hotel rooms can be noisy at night with sirens all over town. Our kids ordered room service one night for simple hamburgers and drinks (for 2) and the bill rang up to nearly $100. Hotel \"management\" was young and clueless. One guy stood at elevators and seemed stoned all the time. The ugly: Apparently the hotel has no concern about the ancient elevators. We got stuck in the very small elevator when heading out to town for dinner. It was horrible. We were packed in there with heavy clothing (it was February) and I thought I was going to pass out. Only input from hotel staff was \"they called the elevator guy\"-- who knows what that means. I got the feeling these elevators get stuck often--- and if you think that is a minor inconvenience try spending 15 minutes crammed is a elevator with heavy coats, little air and no room to move... and no confidence the hotel is doing anything to deal with your situation.... and we could have been stuck there for hours.

We did eat at Domenica, the low-key John Besh restaurant in the lobby, and it was reasonably good but missing something - the atmostphere felt like something you'd find in a large chain hotel, and had none of the charm and inspiration of his other restaurants. Terddy's Cafe was pretty much just a basic regular coffee shop - I would have welcomed a bit more luxury here, a place that would invite you to sit and relax after a day of shopping/sightseeing etc. The furnishings in the rooms were generally very nice, however our room was the smallest New Orleans hotel room I've ever stayed in. I think it was the standard king size room, and it was a corner room, but we felt really cramped - only about 2 feet of space between the end of the bed and the television, and then only a few feet on either side of the bed. Our bathroom mirrors and furniture were covered in dust, and basic things like hotel slippers were missing (not to be picky, but this is standard at most hotels in this class). Also, we had a package delivered to the hotel, and it was sent to the business center, which seemed to be closed the entire time we were there. After 3 trips to collect the package, we finally gave up. After a couple of days, the concierge was able to bring the package to us. The service at the hotel was generally good, but overall we were disappointed that this historic hotel turned out to be missing the magic.

This took me a little by surprise and off guard and not exactly polite or the most welcoming of introductions. I was not offered help to my room and arrived to my room which was pitch black and looked like it hadnt been stayed in for some time (there was a slightly musty smell to the room too) My room was huge - a suite complete with pantry, separate area for dining, and a separate bedroom walk in closet and two bathrooms. The bed was probably the most welcome part of the stay - it was fantastic comfy and just right level of softness. The bathroom had everything you needed - nice big spa bath, shower with multi heads and basins but it was basically arranged almost in a long narrow corridor and wasnt very well thought out. The shower didnt have enough pressure for me to use all the heads at the same time and would also take forever to warm up The paintwork in the room needed attention it looked like there had been a painting or something on the wall which had been removed and had left a mark.

I was sat close to the edge of the restaurant and unfortunately as a result of that had canned music from both the restaurant and the lobby which became annoying after a while. I can recommend their melon juice which was yummy and their eggs benedict. On my last day I visited the coffee shop and had a coffee, a pan au chocolat and a fruit cup. The coffee was high quality and the pastry was the freshest i had ever tasted. I also visited the Italian restaurant which is on the hotel premises. This is not quite as pricey as the main restaurant and a little less formal. I can highly recommend it, the food was fabulous and the whole experience was really enjoyable.

We had two queen beds, sitting area with sofa, two charis, tables and a large flat screen tv. Marble floors, big closet, nice mini-bar.

We vistied Teddy's Cafe each morning for coffee and danishes. The Roosevelt has obviously improved since all of the negative reviews were posted to this site.

We booked the AAA rate for $189 plus taxes which put this room over $200 a night. The online prepay was cheaper (~$10 night) but doesn't allow you to cancel your reservation. This was the most expensive hotel we have ever stayed at. Certainly the most expensive of our many stays in New Orleans. Because we waited for an air sale which didn't happen until March, we had a hard time finding a quality room for less than $150 because of the festival (which was outstanding). So we splurged and booked the Roosevelt. We had been to the famous Sazerac Bar August 2009 (expensive cocktails, so-so service, but nice to say you've been there), which was shortly after they had reopened the hotel. The girl at the front desk was the same at check-in and check-out and she was very pleasant both times and we did feel that we were \"special\" because she seemed happy we were there. Desk service at other hotels we've stayed at here was definitely questionable. Our room was surprisingly small for the price. But it was very, very quite. Our room was near the service elevator and before a change in floor elevation so we don't think anyone's room \"touched\" ours. We never heard the elevators. The furnishings were new and very nice. The bed was comfy enough but the pillows were not very soft. There was scratched off paint near the door but that was the only thing needing touched up. The shower was cool looking, but all the different nozzles are probably not environmentally wise if you want to save water, fortunately you don't have to use them. The shower doors are noisy glass. There is a tv in the bathroom. There is no counter space in the bathroom! When you flush the toilet you have to do it very slowly because it will splash out anything in the stool onto the floor and shower door. We didn't locate the hair dryer until the last day as it was hidden in the dresser drawer we never used. Didn't use the bathrobes but they looked soft. The air: it never got cold enough and 65 was the lowest setting you could choose, but it was definitely NOT 65 degrees, maybe 70. But the windows don't open for a breeze and there is no ceiling fan. So we also had the \"fan\" running on high for background noise and to circulate the air. We would wake up sweating. It was cooler outside than in our room. The hotel is beautiful inside and the lobby is very glamorous. We were on the 10th floor and the elevators are small but very fast and always available when we needed them. We requested \"privacy\" and were never bothered. We did not use room service for just the 4 nights we were there. The location is just a half block off Canal, across from the Quarter. The only store between the Roosevelt and Canal is the Walgreens (very handy). The problem with the location for this trip was that we were mostly down around the US Mint for the Festival so once we got down there it wasn't convenient to walk back to the hotel for a shower or nap or to drop off bags. But it would be perfect for Mardi Gras parades. Try your hand at priceline or similar to bid a great deal. If you have a lot of money to blow or a high maintenance traveler who is very picky then you will probably love the hotel. The rich and elite probably salivate over this hotel. For us, we don't need it. For that kind of money, I'd rather stay at the Hotel Monteleone for location. The best thing we liked was that it was quiet, but we've had quiet rooms in other New Orleans hotels. We would rather stay in a smaller, older, more historic hotel where you feel you are a part of old New Orleans and not so disconnected. If you're going to be in the Quarter doing a lot of walking you will appreciate a hotel more centrally located in the Quarter for easy access than the Roosevelt has to offer. If you are there for business you should be fine. Cost of the cab ride for 2 from MSY to the Roosevelt was $33 and took about 18 minutes each way. Cabs were readily available outside the hotel for our return trip, even at 5:45 a.m. Would we stay here again? If the room was equally as quiet and the air conditioning worked to cool the room, we would if we could pay maybe $110-$140 (we have seen these rates for other dates in the past).

While the Hilton Riverside and Doubletree were both available for 40,000 points per night, I decided to \"upgrade\" our hotel, and chose the Roosevelt for 50,000 per night. Check in was smooth - we arrived very early (around 10.30 am) and were allowed to check in immediately, and were even upgraded to a King Suite room. We were also given 2 drink vouchers for the Sazerac bar, courtesy HHonors. Nice spacious living room and bedroom but the bathroom was rather small (no space for a bathtub) 2 large flat screen TV's in the living area and bedroom, and a small TV for the bathroom as well, which was a nice touch. Liked the premium quality toiletries in the bathroom. Walking distance to the French Quarter ( just across the road), and a lot of restaurants in the area all within walking distance. Now the not-so-nice parts: We were taking a nap in the afternoon, when someone starts banging our door, and tries to open with a housekeeping key card. Luckily, the deadbolt was in place, and turns out, engineering is at the door because we complained that we can't open a door!!!!! Told him he's got the wrong room, and tried to place a DND outside the room, but couldn't find one in our room! The second annoying experience: Got the folio on the morning of our check out, with a charge for 2 nights!! This was supposed to be a stay using HHonors points, but looks like they goofed up. Well, no big deal - called front desk and asked for a new folio, only to be told \"We're sorry about that. I recommend you call up Hhonors at 1-800-HHonors and fix this\" !!!!! Told the Front desk rep that I don't think so, and things like this are resolved by the front desk usually, especially since I'm still checked in and calling from the room. Front desk rep probably checked with his supervisor, or someone who knew better, and I got the incorrect charges taken off.

This was on the Sunday prior to Mardi Gras and evidently a lot of the cleaning staff had not bothered to show up. We were not comfortable leaving our luggage with the bell hop.

The location was great for getting to the parades and bourbon st. Except for check in there was no problem with staff. There were a lot of silly rules that they had for Mardi Gras. You had to wear a wrist band for each day all day to access the hotel which turned out not to be a big deal. Also the rule was no coolers in the room and they said they would be charging people $2 per beer and $10 for bottle of wine brought in from the outside. Fortunately we never saw these enforced.

Upon check-in we were also informed that our room was upgraded to a suite, so we were totally stoked. The bell man that took our luggage to our room gave us a thorough tour of the room and amenities. The room was absolutely beautiful, it was the perfect beginning of our anniversary trip. However, that's where the good service ended. Day One: On check in we were not offered ANY of the Diamond member benefits. Day Two: The room was not serviced completely, trash was left in the room and all towels were not replaced. Someone tried to key into the room w/o announcing themselves.

I was able to catch security doing an audit on the lock and later was told it was housekeeping trying to do a turn down. I was told by the front desk people that if we required privacy, hang a sign on the door. I normally do that, but it seems that this hotel lacks those. I pointed that out to the front desk person who promised one for us right away. We never got it. Day Three:Still not privacy sign, still no contact with management, room not serviced completely. Used glasses, towels and toiletries not replaced. Day Four: Still not privacy sign, still no contact with management, room not serviced completely. Used glasses, towels and toiletries not replaced.

No one asked how the stay was on check out, and still no one from management contacted me. During the entire stay the concierge was pretty much non-existent, kept seeing a sign referring us to the front desk?

I would stay again if I could find a rate at $200 or less. For background, I have previously stayed at the Royal Sonesta, Westin, Hilton and Sheraton in New Orleans. The Westin is probably my favorite hotel simply because of the amazing river views. Cons: 1. I wasn't shocked because I did my research, but the $42/night (w/tax) parking really is outrageous, especially since some guests were having problems with it (we saw one guy being charged hourly and being made to pay when he took the car out; they couldn't immediately find someone else's keys). The highest I have paid elsewhere in NOLA is $38, and that was Royal Sonesta. The cheapest I've seen parking is $25/night. 2. Maid service is iffy. Our room was generally extremely clean, but there was some trash between the vanity and wall in the bathroom. One day they took our bath mat and didn't replace it, and also didn't replace the bath salts. 3. Walls are very thin. Thankfully, this isn't the kind of hotel that attracts loud college kids, so it isn't much of an issue. Pros: 1. The hotel is absolutely beautiful both in the common areas and the rooms. The Superior Room was HUGE for a NOLA room (or really anywhere). The bathroom was also huge, with a nice shower/tub combo, and a separate toilet area. All marble in the bathroom. The bed was comfortable - firm with a pillowtop. Truly effective blackout shades. Great tvs in the room and bathroom. Upscale toiletries and a tourmaline hairdryer (!). 2. Great location. Right across Canal from the French Quarter, but quieter and more accessible than the Royal Sonesta. I was attending a conference at the Sheraton and it was an easy 5-10 minute walk. 3. The front desk and concierge service was excellent. We had no problems with billing or anything like that. 4. The most insanely awesome and comfortable robes.

The location is perfect. You are close to everything but yet its away from the hustle and bustle...its only a block or so from the french quarter. Only a 3 min walk. The bellmen and staff were all very friendly. We ordered room service and the food was really good and they were prompt to bring it to us. The girl who brought it also was very courteous. Absolutely loved the layout of the room. Its like being in a luxury apt rather than a hotel so you feel more at home. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom had a seperate bathtub and shower and a seperate little room for the toilet area. Also the TV in the bathroom was a nice addition while getting ready or taking a bath. Like i said there was only a few minor things i would change....there was dust in several areas in the room that was not wiped, on the duvet cover on the bed there was something on there that to the naked eye while not in bed you would not notice but while lying in bed i saw it(again very small) so i can see how housekeeping would not notice it, and the last bath i took the tub latch to open the drain was stuck and i could not drain the water out(would have called about it but we were leaving so i didnt call to complain), the curtains were a little hard to close, and our view out the window was not the best in this rooms location. Please do not listen to all the negative reviews on here and give this hotel a try esp. the suites!

Before arriving to the hotel, I called to inform them that I would be checking in late but that my guest would arrive a few hours before me and I wanted to inquire to see if she would be able to check in without me. I was greeted rudely on the phone and told that yes, she could check in but that she would need to have a form of payment once she arrives for the $200 deposit that needed to be paid that I was informed of upon booking. I was NEVER informed of a $200 deposit despite the fact that I had called several times before my trip to get all of the details. The $200 deposit was not the problem, it was the rudeness of the receptionist. When I questioned her she stated \"That is a requirement at every hotel that you should be aware of.\" I stated, I have stayed in numerous hotels and have never had a $200 deposit requirement, and to that she stated \"Well that is a requirement for the Waldorf Astoria.\" Well if it is such a big requirement that is obviously common knowledge for the free world, maybe I should have been informed one of the numerous times I called double checking my reservation. She spoke to me as if I was an idiot and I soon realized that this was the attitude of almost all of the hotel staff. Upon arriving to the hotel, everyone was given a wristband and a set of instructions detailing the procedures for the Mardi Gras holiday which included guards at every elevator, and a wristband method for hotel residents and their guests. They monitored the wristbands upon going up and exiting the elevator. Each hotel resident with a wristband was allowed a maximum of 2 guests. This also would not have been such a problem if the guards didn't treat you like you were trying to escape from Alcatraz when exiting the elevators, or like you were trying to enter into the White House when trying to get on the elevators. It was definitely an annoyance in this so called high class hotel. It was also interesting to see that the older, obviously well-to do people were not questioned about their wristbands, but the seemingly less affluent and younger college aged looking guests were hassled every time like terrorists. Everyone in my group was around age 24 and we do look very young but in no way are we wild college students. One guard even asked my friend who was talking while getting on the elevator to \"be quiet.\" Excuse me?? I'd understand if she was being loud and boisterous, but she was not. I am pretty sure that regardless of your class or age, that we were all required to pay upwards of $300 per night for the rooms right? Hmm just checking. When we arrived in our room we were greeted by a big pile of dirty linens on the floor which were apparently forgotten. A mirror in the bathroom that was falling off the hinges and a hole in the ceiling. Even after contacting the front desk and letting them know that the mirror was falling off and that there were leftover dirty linens on the floor, they assured us that they would take care of it, but did not. They fixed the mirror and left the linens. We had to put them in the hallway ourselves. The maid staff was interesting. If they caught you in the halls they stared you down like they were part of the secret service downstairs as well. One maid was staring at us as we were leaving for the night and when we came back to the hotel we came back to one bed being made and the other left undone. I have never experienced maids coming to make your bed twice a day, let alone coming and only making up one bed and not the other. It seemed like she came in just to case the place. Very odd. If it wasn't the rude staff and elevator nazis, it was the nice refreshing luke warm and cold showers everyday. I realize that it is an old building, and that the hotel was full to capacity, but if I am paying over $300 a night for a hotel, I expect to have a warm shower. I even made sure that I was the first to shower each day, and it was still cold! All in all this was the worst hotel experience of my life. I was really looking forward to staying in a Waldorf-Astoria hotel for the first time, but after this experience I would not stay ever again. I would have rather been at motel 6 than this place, at least I would've had a hot shower. And I was not the only one who felt this way. After checking out and waiting outside for my ride, it was hilarious to hear almost every group leaving making comments such as \"This is the worst hotel ever!\" Please think twice about staying here, I wish I had.

Since this was the first trip to new Orleans for the four of us, it was important for me to find a historic hotel that carried the charm of New Orleans, hence why I chose against the W French Quarter. I was excited about the reopening of the Roosevelt under the Waldorf Astoria label and the fact that there would also be a Guerlain spa onsite, and since our trip was soon after the \"Grand Reopening\" we were able to get a great deal on a suite with 2 queen beds. My impression of the Roosevelt is that it could be great, but it is still a work in progress. The Great: The hotel itself has been beautifully restored, and the lobby is stunning. The staff at the concierge desk was incredibly helpful with finding us a replacement rental car after the Enterprise we had booked with was closed for no apparent reason. The concierge also helped map our our walking paths to specific stores, restaurants, and attractions. The cafe in the lobby had a wonderful fresh assortment of light sandwiches, fruit, and pastries every morning for breakfast. The Roosevelt blend coffee was so delicious that I bought some to bring home. The location was also convenient to walk to the French Quarter, and I must have gone ot the Walgreens next to the hotel 5 times during the trip for various reasons. The Good: The room was nicely appointed, though very small for a suite. The bathroom only had one sink and the room's only closet was in the bathroom. We went up to the pool area once, and it looks like it has the potential to be great with an outdoor grill and areas to lounge, but again it wasn't staffed and seemed unfinished. The signature Sazerac bar was empty when we first came in a Thursday night and the bartender seemed annoyed to be serving drinks at 1am, but was very lively the rest of our stay. We also had a nice lunch at the hotel's Italian restaurant.. The Okay/Not So Good: While I loved the cafe, I wish the hotel had late night dining options other than room service. The spa wasn't fully finished, and lacked sauna/steam room facilities, or even separate showers (guests have to walk over and use the gym's showers). My biggest disappointment though was the Blue Room Jazz Brunch. For $75/per person I was expecting a more expansive selection of food and better ambience (though idid enjoy the cooked to order bananas foster).

My experience at the Roosevelt Hotel New Orleans was the absolute worst hotel experience .... ever. This hotel is the length of one city block and has two large entrances. Only one entrance is the official \"entrance area\" with valet parking yet there is no sign anywhere at the other entrance stating arriving guests should go to the other entrance. Upon arriving, I parked at the wrong entrance and a hotel employee YELLED out the door, \"OTHER SIDE!\" (This is a Waldorf Astoria Collection 5 Star Luxury Hotel???) At the valet / parking entrance the welcome was \"less than stellar\" as four valet attendants were too busy standing in a circle telling jokes and laughing to take notice of my arrival. Only after I began pulling luggage out of my car did anyone offer assistance (This is a Waldorf Astoria Collection 5 Star Luxury Hotel???). The lobby of the Roosevelt Hotel is, indeed, beautiful and grand. Check-in was very efficient but not overly welcoming. And, the Suite to which I was assigned (a luxury suite) was, indeed, beautifully decorated and of good size. Then the \"fun\" began . . . When pulling down the sheet of the bed I discovered one sheet was stained with ink and one \"sheet\" was the wrong sheet (it was a duvet cover). I called Guest Services to request new sheets and spoke to someone named \"Arrianna\" who appeared to be less than interested in the fact that it was almost 10PM and no hotel ... let alone a Waldorf Astoria Five Star Luxury Hotel ... should place stained and incorrect sheets on the bed. Almost two hours later (after two additional calls to a very disinterested \"Arrianna\" in Guest Services) a young man appeared at the door with a duvet cover (which was not needed) and informed me there were no available clean sheets anywhere in the hotel. NO CLEAN SHEETS ANYWHERE IN THE WALDORF ASTORIA LUXURY FIVE STAR HOTEL!!!!!! I then discovered the hotel had not honored my prior request to place foam pillows on the bed rather than feather pillows. I again called Guest Services to be told there were only two foam pillows in the entire hotel (This is a Waldorf Astoria Collection 5 Star Luxury Hotel???). Finally, at 2AM, after remaking the bed to not sleep on stained sheets I was able to go to sleep. The next day, when returning to the room, I discovered housekeeping removed the dirty towels from the bathroom but failed to leave clean towels. It was necessary for me to place yet another call to Guest Services and after a long wait I was finally provided clean towels ... one of the most basic items in a hotel (This is a Waldorf Astoria Collection 5 Star Luxury Hotel???). The next day, when returning to the room, I discovered housekeeping did a great job of leaving clean towels .... but forgot to leave soap and shampoo ... yet another one of the most basic items in a hotel (This is a Waldorf Astoria Collection 5 Star Luxury Hotel???). I planned to dine in the hotel's \"Domenica\" Restaurant. However, after hearing another guest ranting and raving in the lobby about how awful the food was and given my already spectacularly bad experiences with the hotel my dining plans were changed to an offsite restaurant. Four aspects of this hotel truly perplexed me. First, this is a brand new property yet 75% of all guestroom doors appear to be scarred and scuffed with black marks near the floor. Second, the \"hot\" water in the shower was truly not \"hot.\" Though this did not bother me I am sure other guests would prefer water that is not \"lukewarm.\" Third, not one time during my stay was the mini-bar refreshment center restocked. Fourth, generally the front desk and housekeeping staff appear to be phenomenally disinterested in providing a welcoming and customer-centered experience. In fact, the general attitude from front desk employees was, \"We're doing you a favor letting you stay here.\" Finally, if you actually stay at this hotel ... take your Reservation Confirmation Sheet showing rates and charges and after you depart the property file it away until you receive your credit card bill. Further, if the hotel employees promise you something critical to rates and charges get it in writing. Several weeks after checkout the hotel charged my credit card several hundred dollars of additional unauthorized charges. It was a nightmare to get this matter resolved and the attitude from most of the front desk employees was one of not believing a word I was saying and even a Manager, Dennis, failed to follow through with promises he made to me. Fortunately, given my poor experiences at the hotel, I retained enough accounting paperwork after checkout the hotel did, eventually, issue a refund to my credit card.", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay - would go back.\u201d", "Author": "redskinfan78", "ReviewID": "UR53678491", "Content": "I flew down for the Saints playoff game with a friend and stayed here.

I was expecting a refrigerator in our room and I was told that would be $50 a night. It's often not what you say but how you say it that makes the difference in good customer service. After a few hours in our room which was suppose to be an upgrade we decided that our trip was tainted by the poor service and decided to check out the next morning. So I called the manager (Dennis) explained our disappointment and instead of trying to make this right he said he would need to speak to Catherine to confirm our story and then call me back. So his attitude didn't make me happy either but he did explain that a refrigerator would be $50 for the stay not per night which is much more reasonable. So when he called me back to offer us an upgrade to a suite at no additional charge for our entire stay (with a frig) we declined. When we checked out we paid in full for the one night stay that we used instead of the four that we had originally reserved. Dennis confirmed that there would be no penalty for the early check out. By the way, we moved to the Harrah's Hotel where they gave us free rooms that were very similar to our room at The Roosevelt. Two days later we noticed two additional charges from The Roosevelt on our credit card one for $1000+ and another for $1200+ for the rooms we didn't stay in. When we called we got the run around from the hotel. One person could only find one charge, another person found both and said one was for the entire stay and the other was for a no-show! A third and final person told us there was only one charge the other was a authorization that would dop off in a couple days and that she was going to have the one charge removed and call us back. Well, wouldn't you know we never heard back from her or anyone from The Roosevelt Hotel. I have not checked yet to see if the charges have been reversed. So while the rooms were nice they were not over the top and the customer service or lack there of was painful.

A man (who I later realized was the manager because his photo was in the book in my room) asked if he could help as we were forced to wheel luggage through a caroling concert in the foyer. I snapped \"why start now?\" The room was a lovely size. The gym was new and so all of the machinery worked and had television entertainment on command. We ate at Domenicas and that was superb! However the overall experience was just too marred: We waited on hold with the concierge for over an hour (we got ready and had it on speaker phone). He asked us if he could recommend that we go to Antoine's restaurant and to have a particular waiter - the restaurant was empty and enormous and the waiter ignored us and the food was tepid. We booked a segway tour in the French Quarter and were told upon arrival that they had phoned our hotel to bring the time forward half an hour and had therefore resold our tickets. (Incidentally, they had only phoned half an hour prior!!!!!!) And it was my husband's birthday. Mortified. The valet parking blocked in our taxi as we were trying to leave. The people who were trying to get their cars looked like they were in Dante's seventh circle of hell. It is obviously big business for the hotel.

Our first day there we got out to see the sites early (8:30 am) and when we returned to the room at 3pm it still hadn't been cleaned. Then the housekeeper came when we were getting ready for dinner. We asked for a late check out on the last day and they said no problem. However when we went to the room to quickly check out and head to the airport, our card keys didn't work. When we went to the desk, they said matter of factly that the key cards stop working at 1 pm.

We had a wonderful experience, rating this this hotel is pretty much perfect. We arrived in the wee hours of December 27, and the night clerk couldn't be more efficient or pleasant, and very attentive so late at night. We usually schlep our own bags, but we were exhausted from a series of flight delays due to the botched bomb attempt on Dec. 25 and were thankful for the prompt bell service. The lobby was stunningly decorated for Christmas and so much so we almost couldn't find the front desk! I had read in previous postings that the standard rooms were small, and so went for the 1 bedroom King suite -- a steal at $208.00 a night. The suite was more than gorgeous and extremely spacious, filled with reproduction antiques and a very comfy bed with high-end linens and plush pillows. Comparatively, we had a similar suite at an upscale hotel in Manhattan, and the same type of room with this type of decor would be close to $1000.00 a night. The sumptuous marble bathroom had a walk-in shower with triple shower heads (no tub), plus was extremely clean; bathroom amenities were lemon-verbena Agraria San Francisco products. Even though the lobby was busy with guests/ tourists, I found our floor very quiet. The windows are sealed well; our room was a corner room and street noise was very minimal My only complaints about the suite are the two small ottomans which are used for a coffee table -- makes it awkward for eating take-out or room service. Also, some spots on the marble floor are extremely slippery, and we ended up asking for an extra bath mat. Robes were mid-weight, made of silky material, and terry-lined. However, one of ours had some weird crustings on it -- I think it hadn't been washed properly and a new one was prompty sent up with apologies when we notified them. No slippers are provided. Slippers would be nice, taking into account the slippery bathroom floor. The room service menu is very small -- we were exhausted and decided to order some food. The food arrived hot and within 20 minutes. I had a very good omelette and can recommend that, but the chicken strips turned out to be a very thin, dry, chicken breast breaded and fried whole and cut into thin strips. Domenica on the ground floor of the hotel does take out while it's open and I would recommend phoning down and picking it up if you don't want to leave the hotel. We found the food at Domenica excellent, on par with major foodie destination restaurants in NYC or San Francisco. The hotel staff are amazing. Any requests we made of our housekeeper were done promptly and accurately. The concierges were great; friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and very accommodating. Anytime I was in the lobby, even in the wee hours of the morning, staff walking by always had a smile and a pleasant greeting. There is free wifi in the lobby and in Teddy's Cafe. However, I found the signal was extremely spotty. I was also at the concierge desk and overheard another guest complain about the weak wifi signal in his room, which he had paid for, and was none too happy. Another thing you have to watch for is if you are taking a tour, specify and reconfirm with your tour company which entrance they will pick you up from to save yourself a lot of hassle. Most tour groups will pick up from the Baronne St. entrance. We had a mix-up with our company and I noticed others had the same problem. There is a small, heated swimming pool on the roof with pleasant lounging areas which we did not use as the weather was unseasonably cool. There are also tennis courts, but we did not see them. We would definitely stay at this hotel again; the complaints I have are fairly minor. Yes, there may have been opening glitches, but even over the busy Christmas holiday, it seemed to me things ran very smoothly. In general, it's hard to find good service personnel in New Orleans, but the Roosevelt has snagged them.

I really want this hotel to succeed. I enjoy that it is very quiet in the rooms, the location is excellent, and the beds are incredible - hard to get out of at 6 AM each day. My check-in this time was, oddly, similar to the last two times. Even though my Honors profile says high floor away from the elevator, I was assigned a room directly across from the elevator on the second floor. When I pointed this out, I was abruptly told the hotel was sold out and no changes could be made; however, the young lady looked again and magically found a room away from the elevator on the 11th floor. (Why couldn't she start with \"Let me see what I can do?\") If they are going to pre-assign rooms, why do they not pay attention to what is in your profile? I had previously noted that I wondered if the hotel could keep up its new appearance, and my concern is justified. This time no sliver ice bucket and tray - just the brown vinyl Hilton ice bucket you are used to seeing. They must be getting stolen. I stayed on the 11th floor this time, and right by one of the elevators was a huge coffee splash on the wall. It was there the whole weekend. My biggest concern remains housekeeping. I think it all gets down to training. After the first cleaning, I was left with no clean glasses - just the dirty ones left by the bedside. The mosaic tile bathroom floors are obviously hard to clean, and they are attracting build-up in the nooks and crannies. The shelf where the towels are put under the sick was covered in dust bunnies. I received turn down service one night, and I have previously commented on its inconsistency. This time, I got the bathroom trash can emptied - nothing else. I spoke with a turn down attendant in the hall, and she said she had 50 rooms to turn down since the hotel was sold out. Obviously, she does not have time to do barely anything. How can Hilton call this a Waldorf and not staff it properly? I am still a fan. I love the beds, the quiet, and the new hotel smell. I just wish management would try to get this right.

The public spaces are no less than stunning. The rooms were beautifully and comfortably furnished. The restaurants and bars we frequented lived up to their classic reputations\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the Sazerac bar is truly a legendary experience. Besh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Domenica Restaurant served excellent modern Italian cuisine and the contemporary d\u00c3\u00a9cor was refreshing yet fitting. This is no Holiday Inn or Hilton Garden Inn. This is a fine hotel. We reserved a King suite and enjoyed a living area, small dressing room with a wet bar, bedroom and bath. I was disappointed at first because I was expecting the large \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great room-style\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd suite shown on their Web site, but it was actually nice having the separate areas. I know some have complained about the lack of bath, but Wow! What a shower! Multiple showerheads (rain-style, side-spray, handheld) were an indulgent surprise. The bed was extremely comfortable. I did not find it too soft, it simply had the feather beds and fluffy duvets that you find in most nice hotels. I know I am in the minority, but I found the two 42-inch TVs and the smaller TV in the bathroom to be overkill, but again we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t watch much TV, especially on vacation. We had no problems with noise from other rooms, but we were located at the end of a hall. The staff was professional, but I think the surroundings require a bit more polish and even friendliness. Perhaps because the hotel is newly opened, a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personality\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been established. This would go a long way towards elevating the hotel to the five-star rating I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure it would like to secure. The bellmen were the friendliest and warmest, speaking to you as you passed in the lobby. The bartenders in the Sazerac were great mixologists but not particularly friendly. The front desk folks were competent but their hospitality skills were lacking. When I mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary and if they had a particular suite to recommend (with a view, etc.), the reaction was that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d already assigned us our suite. OK, it was a nice suite but it was on a lower floor and there was no view whatsoever. In retrospect, I should have pushed but I hated to get worked up for potentially no reason. My biggest issue was with housekeeping and, more importantly, the lack of promised follow-through from management to make amends. We checked in around noon on a Wednesday and in the evening showered and headed out for the night. Upon returning, I noticed the turn-down service was basically tossing a few chocolates on the bed (which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turned down). The chocolates weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even placed with the logo facing up. Odd, but no biggie. The next morning, I realized they had not provided clean towels the night before so I called down to request them. After an hour, I had to call again. They finally brought towels and we showered and we headed out to a fabulous lunch at Commander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Palace. Upon returning mid-afternoon, I found our room had not been cleaned and called the front desk. By five o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122clock still no housekeeping. At this point, we needed to get ready for dinner so I asked over the phone and in person at the desk for housekeeping to clean the room after six. Hours later, we returned to find the bed made, but no room cleaning. No fresh towels. No fresh glasses (they had not even removed the dirty glasses from the side tables). No cleaned bathrooms. No emptied trashcans. I was very unhappy and called to express my dissatisfaction. I was told that it was unacceptable and that a manager would contact me in the morning to make amends. Three days later (and back home from New Orleans), I had yet to hear from anyone. We finally received maid service on Friday afternoon, after checking in Wednesday noon.

We were very impressed with the accommodations, service and the convenient location! We stayed in a two bedroom suite (1 king BR and a 2 queens BR). The living room area and the bedrooms were much better than we had expected. The rooms were attractively furnished with great decor. The bed linen was exceptionally nice and comfortable! We loved the bathrooms and towels (the televisions in the bathroom was a perfect addition). The service was great from the valet, reception/check in and assistance with getting settled into our suite! Everyone was very helpful and courteous/friendly. The Concierge Desk was utilized for everything (shopping, direction, places to dine).! The service at the desk was consistently great for the days we were there! great! We loved the convenience of the cafe in the lobby. Focus on housekeeping consistency is our one recommendation. We were there for several nights and it seemed apparent that the housekeepers don't have a check list on how to the leave the room after cleaning. An issue we experienced was a long delay in getting extra towels (several hours) and when they arrived they were given to us at the door rather than placed in the bathroom. While not a big issue, it warrants mentioning given the reputation of the Astoria collection of hotels.

Front desk is a mess\u201d", "Author": "pescuban", "ReviewID": "UR46401455", "Content": "First the positives. The rooms were fabulous. The rates are currently great. The lobby exquisite. Firstly the bell staff was amazing. Their services were exceptional. The guest services manager, Ryan went out of his way and went above and beyond expectations. The waitstaff also exceptional. Positive, polite and enthusiastic. The location is great and I do see great things in the future for the hotel if it is staff properly. I had a wedding reception there which turned out really beautiful. The food, the waitstaff the ambiance was perfect. I have nothing ill to say about that experience. The party was fantastic and I do thank the staff for making it wonderful for me and my now husband. The front desk however is a complete mess. I had a wedding reception there and many of my guests were staying there. They could not find people's reservations. Although I had pre-paid my room several months before arriving to the hotel they charged me for rooms while I was there. Also charged my roommate for another room. We explained our issues to the front desk during our stay several times and they said they would fix the problem. They never did after several discussions and the hotel promising to reimburse. We both ended up disputing it on our credit cards a week after we had checked out of the hotel. They made one of my guests who had pre-paid a room re-book and pay again giving some stupid reason that they didn't check in on-time. They had me and my room listed under another guest's name the whole week I was there. I would get keys for this other person's room rather than keys to my own room and phone calls etc. I went down to the desk everyday to tell them to change this to my name and that I was NOT the person that they had me listed under and they never changed it the whole week. Even the day of check out I was handed the bill I think for the other guest b/c it wasn't mine. Even the manager happened to be at the front desk and knew about the mistake the whole week. Nothing... The manger of the front desk, Treniese, is not management material which may be why her staff at the desk is less than competent. Rather than trying her best to fix our issues, and ensure a positive experience and good customer service, she spent more time projecting blame on her staff at the front desk who were \"new\" and didn't know how to manage the check-ins. As the manager she should be accepting responsibility and taking care of the issue that had been presented to her many many times. If the front desk staff is new and having problems managing the desk then the manager should be AT THE FRONT DESK, with her staff; training and troubleshooting any issues that may arise. Instead it was all about excuses and no action on her part and she remained behind the scenes except for some phone calls to us that never led to any resolution. After she had told us several times that we would be reimbursed, it never happened. Also they room was very hot and dry and I couldn't figure out what the problem was. After no sleep at 4am the night before my wedding; I contacted the front desk to explain that there was something wrong with our AC. I apoligized for calling so early in the morning too! The lady at the front desk was terribly rude. She abruptly hung up after stating that she would send someone but that I probably didn't know how to use the thermostat (it's not rocket science). After sending engineering up to the WRONG room he finally came to my room and said that in fact the heating system was on, not the a/c and he had to go into the ceiling of the room with a ladder to change the system. Again, not a big deal had the front desk treated me better. I realize things happen and the hotel is new but if you can't be nice to your customers then you will have none. I told them they needed to get their act together because a hotel as beautiful as the Roosevelt and who is carrying the Waldorf name should have customer service at the top of their priority list. I also explained to them that the front desk is one of the first services a guest encounters with when arriving to a hotel (aside from the bellman who were great). It is also a center for all other services during a guest's stay. If the front desk leaves a bad impression on your guests then it will leave a bad impression on the entire hotel for that guest. It's one thing to say you may have had a bad waiter one night and the reflection is essentially on that waiter. It's another to say the front desk had no sense of customer service through out a stay. Overcharging a person the way that they did can really be a problem for someone who is on a budget and can't afford to have those kind of mistakes. Also if you can't call the front desk and receive a pleasant voice then who can you call... I'm going to give it a thumbs down today b/c it was so costly for me and my guests due to mistakes but hope to give it a thumbs up in the future. I think it can correct itself with proper staffing and some customer service training.... Really I am embarrassed as well as the guests at my wedding spent the entire weekend complaining about the front desk and at least 3 others were calling their credit card companies to dispute charges. And I am the one who chose the place with good intentions thinking it would be fun for my wedding guests, instead it was hard for them :-(", "Date": "October 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LBR09", "Title": "\u201cThe Roosevelt will be the place to stay in N.O.\u201d", "Author": "LBR09", "ReviewID": "UR46326524", "Content": "Absolutely beautiful!

It rarely got more than lukewarm, and on Wednesday morning, was downright cool. A colleague staying in the Roosevelt confirmed that their shower was also chilly that morning.

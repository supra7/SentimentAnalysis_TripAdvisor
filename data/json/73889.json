Our key malfunctioned several times. This is a problem when you are standing in the 110 degree Phoenix heat. -This dump charges 25 cents for a bucket of ice. What hotels charge for ice? Answer: motels that you rent by the hour. -Lastly and for us the final straw. The carpets were dyed in the \"renovation\". We had over $300 worth of clothing damaged as a result of the dye bleeding onto our clothing. The owner agreed to refund our stay, but refused to reimburse us for our damaged clothing. He then tried to blackmail me into accepting the refund as \"hush\" money, but the inept guy did not realize that we were already refunded.

That same night, a group of about 8 seedy people moved in on either side of us, and they were LOUD. They stomped back and forth on the deck until 2am. They were letting their 3-year-old run around on the deck at 2am too. Talk about great parenting! On the 4th night, the noisy neighbors were still there. They were laughing and shouting, their kid was crying, their dog was barking.... and they all hung out on the balcony for HOURS doing god knows what. This went on from 5pm-12am. We finally called the front desk to tell them our neighbors were loud, and the front desk called to tell them to pipe down. Well, that made our neighbors get even louder. One guy even tried to open the adjoining door between the rooms and screamed as loud as he could. Needless to say, it was a frightening night. I know the noisy neighbors aren't the hotel's fault, but you have to consider the sort of clientele this place attracts. The next day, we'd had enough. My sister and I checked out 2 nights early. The guy at the front desk didn't care to ask why we were checking out early. If he had asked, we would have had quite a story for him! We did, however, tell the story to our cab driver on the way to our next hotel. He told us that the Days Inn was in the part of town considered the ghetto. I appreciated his honesty. Avoid this place... there are better options!", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingman, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat price for simple needs\u201d", "Author": "xeriscaping", "ReviewID": "UR79432478", "Content": "I liked the hotel mainly for the price.

Don't let the great price fool you, this place is a bargain not a run down hotel. It is by no means a luxury hotel and yes the basic structure is dated; however the rooms and common areas are kept very neat and clean. Where the truly amazing (above and beyond) service came in was with the complimentary shuttle this hotel provides. We never waited more than 5 minutes for a shuttle, most of the time we walked right onto the shuttle and they took us to our desired destination. Besides being very helpful EVERY shuttle driver had personality plus and really took pride in their company. Congratulations to the owner of this property, you can tell they eat, breath and sleep customer service and it shows. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Dallas area.

This place was very decent, clean & comfortable. It is situated not too far from a sleazy strip club in a bad location. I would recommend this place to a single business traveler who has no interest in seeing the nice parts of Dallas.

We were finally de-planed at Love Field and had an unplanned night in Dallas. Many of us from the flight booked a room at the Ramada Inn. While everything around DFW was booked, this hotel near Love Field had plenty of rooms and a shuttle. I booked a AAA rate for around $75 for two. It was a great end to a memorably bad day! The room was clean, and ours had a view of a nice outdoor pool. The beds were good, the shower was strong, and the internet access was free and reliable. After a good night's sleep, we had the hotel's continental breakfast. It included muffins and a waffle bar. Good coffee, too! It was nothing memorable, but there was plenty of food and it was kept clean by staff. The shuttle was great! It's free from Love Field, and we were charged $5 each to DFW the next morning (it was cheap because there were so many people from our re-routed flight in the van -- I believe he collected $35 total for the trip). On the way over from Love Field the night before, we asked the driver if there was any food near Ramada (the plane had no food), and he went through the drive-through at Whataburger, about a block away. Yup, it was that kind of day! The neighborhood didn't look all that great between Love Field and the Ramada, and we all quietly wondered what we were gettting into. But the hotel was terrific and exactly what we needed after a long day in the sky (and sitting on the tarmac).", "Date": "April 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baytown, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value and Clean Hotel\u201d", "Author": "cokerbud", "ReviewID": "UR4741035", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel and had five rooms.

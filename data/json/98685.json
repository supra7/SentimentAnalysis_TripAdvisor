The hotel is well maintained and the rooms are well kept inside. Very clean. The bed was firm, perhaps overly so. There was a microfridge and a large TV. Close to the Cottonbowl stadium and downtown Dallas. Close to Baylor Hospital which was why we chose it. Several discount rates for seniors, AARP, and hospital rate, Walmart etc I was told by one of the clerks and saw on the website. The Bad: The wireless internet was not strong enough to be reliable and there was no hardwired port in the room. My computer was useless in the room. Fortunately I had 3g wireless available. The breakfast which is hyped on the LaQuinta website was really kind of pathetic. Minimal or no protein. There is a Dennys adjacent to the property, but nothing to brag about there either. Be prepared to enjoy your bowl of cereal, lowfat muffin and toast. The coffee is good. Neutral: This is right off Interstate 30 and that is a busy and loud highway. I could barely hear the traffic inside the room, and with the room air turned on, it didn't really bother me. Others have noted that if someone is upstairs, you can hear them clomping through their rooms. The first night we had this with some children overhead, but soon they quieted down. They have an older style room lock, plastic key with holes. I have heard that the locks are not changed from visitor to visitor, so someone could keep the plastic key and enter a room. They should really upgrade this hotel to the newer electronic locks. I had some problems at check-in, the night clerk wouldn't give me the senior rate without an AARP card. I told him I signed up through the website at the Senior rate. I finally showed him the website on my iPhone (I love my iPhone), and he relented and gave me the rate. The day clerks and another night clerk had no problem and knew about all their discounts.", "Date": "July 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cclean but not what expected\u201d", "Author": "ArkansasMomOf3", "ReviewID": "UR29763557", "Content": "The location was convenient for our trip from Arkansas to the Dallas Museum of Art. The room was clean and the beds were adequate. I was not, however, expecting a hotel with exterior rooms, which is what we got. The walls are pretty thin and the building seems to shake when people were walking around. We were on the 2nd floor (top floor) and I definitely felt the room moving as I was going to sleep thanks to some 20-something men in the room next to us. The water pressure in the shower was quite weak and the manager seemed surprised when we commented on it. The \"high speed internet\" was advertised, but according to a card in the room, there was only supposed to be wired access in the rooms - however I was unable to locate anywhere to plug into. We finally got a very weak wireless signal, but it was not at all reliable or fast.

My husband and I were nicely impressed by this motel. We arrived in Dallas early in the morning, and check-in was not until 2 PM, but, wanting to make sure we knew how to get to the motel, we went ahead and drove over there. The first thing we checked out was the neighborhood, since we saw a warning about it in a review from back in 2005. Neighborhoods apparently change greatly over 3 years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it seemed like a nice place, with no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weird\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd people or happenings going on in the area. You might expect a lot of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seedier\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd people to be hanging around here, just because it is a much more inexpensive motel, but I did not see anyone or anything that would fit that description. From the outside, the motel looked very nice and well-kept. This is definitely an older property, but it is obvious that La Quinta has gone a long way to keep it up. The pool was very small, but it looked clean (we never used it - too busy). We wanted to go the Dallas Farmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Market, which we had directions to, but we needed directions to a bank first, so I went inside to ask for directions. The front desk clerk was immediately friendly and extremely helpful. She looked up directions for me on Google Maps and even printed them out for me. When I asked about check-in time, she informed me that she had rooms available right then, if I wanted to go ahead and check in! Of course, I did! The clerk gave me a nice, friendly welcome to this motel. We nearly froze when we walked into our room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a nice surprise, since that meant the air conditioning definitely worked, although we made sure to warm it up quite a bit. The beds are smaller queen beds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but plenty roomy enough for everyone to fit. The 2nd bed is right next to the a/c unit, but that is to be expected in a motel room. In other words, this is not the Hilton \u00e2\u20ac\u201c don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to have all the room of a house! That said, we found we had plenty of room, and we definitely had to take up room, what with our toddler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s play pen (plenty of room to open it up and not trip over it), the surprise refrigerator, and all of our clothing/suitcases. The vanity area is quite large by motel standards \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there was more than enough room for me to set up the motel-provided ironing board with a walkway to the bathroom. There is even a closet with folding doors for your hanging clothes. That is where you will find the iron and ironing board. The best thing about our room: Everything was Clean!!! I have stayed in many motels, and I often find dead bugs around the corners of the room (a hazard of having the door lead directly outside, I suppose, and a cleaning staff that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work so well). At the La Quinta Inn Dallas-East, however, I did not run into that problem! There were no bugs there for me to worry about my toddler picking up before I find them! Yes, this motel is right off the highway (I-30), so you will hear some highway noise, but it was very muted and did not bother us at all. Someone previously mentioned a train being nearby, but we never heard nor saw any evidence of that. Our room was very quiet. Although on the map this motel seemed a bit \u00e2\u20ac\u0153off-the-beaten path,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it is amazingly close (considering the size of Dallas) to most of the things we wanted to visit, like the Farmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Market and Fair Park. There are plenty of places to eat or get to supplies in the immediate vicinity, including a Denny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Exxon basically in the same parking lot, a McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Walmart and Staples across the highway (easy to get to because of the set-up of the streets), etc. If you want a nice, inexpensive place to stay, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fairly close to most tourist attractions, I would most definitely recommend this La Quinta Inn!", "Date": "August 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cclean, but with problems\u201d", "Author": "sammymd", "ReviewID": "UR5938572", "Content": "My husband and I stayed one night at the La Quinta 10/08/06.

We checked in early with a friendly receptionist, since a king room was not available took 2 doubles. For you with children, this was older smaller beds. One of the beds was right up against the a/c unit. This bedroom was one of the smaller rooms I have been in, but the bathroom, vanity area was good -sized. The room was clean, but this is not a good area of Dallas. I saw some rough people walking around, no one bothered us, but was not comfortable.

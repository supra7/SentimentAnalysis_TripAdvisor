We stayed again this past Labor Day weekend and were pleasantly surprised. 7 families stayed in the Timber Oaks cabins, we had a 6 bedroom and a 4 bedroom.

There was also a nice table set outside on the covered patio. These cabins were clean and well equipped for large family groups.

When we arrive it's better than coming home. They treat us like royalty. Even the rain and hot weather is tolerable when we are in this part of God's country. It's not the weather we come for it's the people and the hospitality. The cabins we stay in are 3 bedrooms or 5 bedrooms depending on how many of the family members go. The 5 bedroom cabins even have a washer and dryer. We've rented pontoon boats,golf carts,bought worms pop, shirts and other essentials. One night we even build a camp fire in the fire ring just to set and tell stories and fix s'mores. the fact that we didn't catch many fish didn't dampen our spirit's. There were to many other things to do. One year we hunted and found Geronimo. Later the next year we found old McGeezer. Even when we all scattered to do different things we would all meet on the patio to cool down and make plans and enjoy the company of other Tribesman's guest and have free snacks together in the afternoon.

Some of the negative reviews were surprising to me and I believe a result of consumers not fully informing themselves or being out of touch with what they truly want. We have visited Tribesman for the past two years staying in Timber Trace last year and Timber Top this year. I absolutely loved Timber Top!! PROS: Units have been very clean; no bugs, remnants of prior guests, or odors. Units have had great proximity to a pool and laundry Staff was quite accommodating when we needed something Boat rental was easy and flexible (one of our party was late and rental time didn't start until we actually began boating) There were ample towels available and an easy way to exchange them daily There are a variety of things available so that a large family with differing interests can all enjoy Proximity to Silver Dollar City and Branson attractions was wonderful. THINGS TO BE AWARE OF: Technology and decorations are not state-of-art. These are simple country cottage-like units. For us, this was perfect. We were able to enjoy the Olympics on the tv provided in the evening and catch the news. Otherwise, we enjoyed the family time and timeless activities such as fishing, boating, swimming, grilling, and visiting local attractions. Accommodations are sufficient for nurturing a family. If you are looking for luxurious bedding and expensive wall art, this won't be a good choice.

The Tribesman Resort is more, well, rustic in nature. Our goal is always to find someplace clean to sleep (that doesn't break the bank), as we are hardly ever in our room when we vacation. We stayed in the Timber Ridge section in a 2-bedroom apartment. Our room was definitely dated, with older furnishings & furniture - but it was spic and span clean. Even with food left out on the kitchen counters and table, I never saw one bug the entire time we were there. PROS: Roomy kitchen/living room area, full kitchen with full-size refrigerator, appliances all in working order, comfortable beds, hot shower with good water pressure. CONS: Wall unit A/C in the living area meant that the bedroom doors had to stay open in order to stay cool. Small vanity in the bathroom and no other available shelf space made it tough for 4 people to find a place for their toiletries. One of the highlights of the resort was the swimdock. We made it down there two times & the kids had a ball jumping off the dock and swimming around in the cove. We don't own a boat & didn't rent anything while we were there. We swam in one of the pools & used the hot tub while we were there. The hot tub was clean & well-maintained. I assume the pool was too, but we swam right after a storm so naturally there was a lot of debris floating around. I also liked the on-site laundry room, with free use of washer & dryer. We were lucky enough to be within easy walking distance of it. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Don't be afraid of the deposit that you have to mail in ahead of time; we got a refund check back in the mail within about a week of our departure.

The house smelled strongly of must and mildew - old carpet, old furnitrue, old beds, old everything. Cozy, but reminded me of cabins in Minnesota in the 60's. The problem was smells like this give my wife migraines. The rest of our extended family were in one of the new 6 bedroom houses -very nice. So we asked if we had any options for another similar small cabin/house - without the smell (and hopefully better all around). The owners were very accomodating and moved us into a 5 bedroom unit on the other side of the property, much better, as no smaller units were available. They also did not charge us any additional fees, which was very considerate. The pools near the newer houses are also better. The property is gravel lanes and dusty. The TVs in both the units we were in were old, not compatible with the new game systems that inevitably are a part of today's family trips.

Our room was divided into a lving room/kitchenette area and a bedroom. When we first walked in, there was a distinct scent of bleach, but not overwhelming. I actually was glad to know things were disinfected. The accommodations were comfortable. We had a big window unit air conditioner, which I loved. It blew really good, cold air and drowned out any noise from outside. There was playground equipment for the kids, an indoor pool and an outdoor pool, the lake, activities, free laundry facilities, ducks -- I could go on.

Check in was quick and pleasant. We had asked for and received a two bedroom/one bath in the Timber Ridge area. Had we known how dated this unit was, we would have reserved a different unit. One plus was that we were centrally located to everything for the most part. A down side was that the only pool close was an indoor pool which we don't care for. Our had dim ceiling lighting in all rooms but each room did have a lamp. The condo was clean, I felt okay about walking around barefoot. The bathroom was small. The shower was the pits, just about 12 little holes for the water to come out of. Someone with thick or long hair would have trouble getting their hair clean. The water pressure was not good coming out of the sink faucet. The window in the bathroom looked like it had not been cleaned in awhile. The same went for the windows in the bedrooms. By the end of the week, the tile grout on the floor was wet. It wasn't near the tub or toilet so there must be a leak somewhere. My husband's a plumber so he agrees with my diagnosis. The kitchen area is small. I didn't cook any meals but there were adequate utensils to do so. The bedrooms each had a dresser and one end table. The closets had no doors which was okay. But the shelves and hangers needed dusting badly. Also, there was quite a bit of noise generated by the air conditioning unit (window), dehumidifier and fans. Each bedroom had a fan in the wall to pull cool air in from the living area. All the noise did not promote good sleeping. And by the end of the week, the dry towels and bedspreads felt moist, so the dehumidifier apparently wasn't working real well. The grounds are well kept. Housekeeping comes around each day to pick up soiled towels and replace with new ones. You place your soiled ones out on the porch in a basket before 10 am. They also have a check list for you to fill out in case you need more things like toilet paper, paper towels, etc. We only had one issue with housekeeping. One day they did not pick up our dirty towels (we didn't put towels out every day). I went up to the office about 4:30 pm and asked if they were done for the day. When I was told that they were, I said that our towels had not been picked up and they had been out on the porch since before 9:00 am. There were three people behind the desk. One of them said \"If you will go back and get them, we'll exchange them for you\". Now I was on my way to our big reunion dinner, it was hot outside and I was not about to walk all the way back. Another one of them told me to walk over to housekeeping and get clean towels. Neither of those responses set real well with me. The third person must have picked up on this because she immediately called housekeeping and told them what I said. I found new towels when I returned to our unit. My husband said that workers had been back and forth all day past our unit and no one had bothered to pick up our towels until I said something about it. This last week was so hot there that we did not get out much and walk around the resort. Our children are grown so we did not participate in the children's activities that they have. We did get to see the newer, larger four bedroom/four bathroom homes. Four of them were rented by various family groups at our reunion. They are very nice and spacious. There was two pools accessible from that group of accomodations. We drove around to look at the outside of the other units. They all appeared full so the Tribesman is apparently satisfying a number of people. Would I stay there again? Only if I could have an updated unit. Would I recommend this place to other people? Yes, but I would tell them to be very careful on the unit/area that they requested.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Olathe, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cThe BEST Family friendly fun spot we could have found!\u201d", "Author": "momto5anahubby", "ReviewID": "UR72639292", "Content": "We reserved a week and would have loved to have stayed for two!

This resort has more reviews than other larger resorts in the area - and the reviews are a bit to positive.

One, because of the value of our stay for 4 nights. It was a very reasonable rate compared to others. Two, the activities that Tribesman has for children were amazing. Our little one loved doing a different activity every day. We all enjoyed the Ice Cream Social night, yummy!! Upon arriving at Tribesman, I admit I was a bit sceptical, because it was such a great rate and the many amenities they offer for their guests. We were greeted at check-in by a very friendly and accomidating staff. When we got to our room, it was very nice. Very clean and was actually nicer than I had planned on. The only complaint I have of the room, was the water. When you used the water in the kitchen sink or the bathroom to take a shower, the water had a rusty, metallic smell to it. Other than that I was very impressed by this resort. We had reservations at tribesman for 4 nights and on our last night we had such a good time, we stayed another night.

As I was checking us in at the front office, I mentioned to the young woman that was helping me, that we were planning on staying at the Horizon's vacation resort by Marriott, but then decided to come here after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor and AAA.com and that it was our first time staying her. She didn't say a whole lot and she looked annoyed, like she'd heard my story before and when she was giving me directions she was a bit curt and short. She definitley didn't impress me. So we ended up being in a small building just down the road from the office. We were located in apartment # 3. It looked very cute from the outside,as it had a lot of nice mature shade trees, a nice patio set where you could eat outside and a nice charcoal grill. Our building was also located right across from the indoor pool and one of the hot tubs. We were also next door to the customer laundry. When we got inside it was also decent looking, but UGH, the smell when we first opened the door was like a stale, moldy musty smell. That smell never did go away during the three nights/ two days that we were there. The apartment had two nice sized bedrooms, a small bathroom, a decent kitchen that included a full sized refridgerator, dishwasher, stove, microwave, toaster and coffee maker. They also had all of the utensils and pots, pans, dishes and glasses. The apartment also had a nice little dining area and living area. While there was a small store located on the resort grounds, we chose to drive ten minutes to Branson West, to the Super Wal-Mart to stock up on some groceries, that we hadn't already brought with us. That worked out well because we only ended up eating out twice while we were in Branson (once at the Mill all you can eat BBQ buffet at Silver Dollar City and that was DELICIOUS and a great value too because our two kids who are under 4 ate for free) and our kids enjoyed cooking out and having breakfast in our apartment. I do have to say though that when I called to make my reservation I had asked them if ALL of their units had central air and the person on the phone assured me that they did. Well our unit consisted of a wall type of air conditioner and if you dared shut the bedroom doors, you couldn't feel a bit of the cool air. So I think the central air thing was a bit misleading because that wasn't central air. I also didn't like the fact that the only ceiling fan was located in the living room above the couch. They need to install one in each bedroom above the beds, as those would work well at helping to keep the bedrooms cool. As for the five pools, there is one indoor, that came in handy the one day that it rained in the afternoon and four outdoor pools. The outdoor pools were small and not very clean. They had leaves and small bugs and feathers floating in them. They are also spread out all over the resort, so unless you're willing to shell out at least $35 to rent a golf cart to get around the resort, you will be doing quite a bit of walking to get to the different pools. I would have liked to seen more kid friendly water activities, especially for small children. Now as for the \"playgrounds\" that they claim to have, that's a different story. Those area joke. The playgrounds consist of a couple of different climbing structures located throughout the resort. There is one that looks like an old stagecoach, but is VERY rickety (probably because it;s at least 15 years old) that I wouldn't let my kids play on, because it appeared very unsafe. Also at this same spot are two horses that you're SUPPOSED to be able to rock on, well one was completley broke and the other one looked like it could come off it's spring at any time. So the playground claim is very misleading. I do not think that Tribesman should be advertising that they have a playground unless they're willing to invest in some new, safer equipment that includes swings and slides. The toyroom is also another joke. It is located in a building behind the main office. I had read an earlier review on here, where a person said that it smelled so musty and mildewey in there. Well I wanted to see for myself and let me tell you, that person wasn't kidding. When you opened the door to the toyroom it smelled like someone's old basement. The room was also very messy and disorganized and the toys didn't appear very clean. On a shelf in the room too were piles of yellowing Polaroid photographs from at least 15 years ago showing people at the resort doing various activties. That room really felt dated and dirty and gave me the creeps, so needless to say we didn't spend anytime there, We did pass the Stillwaters Family Resort on our way to Tribesman and it did look VERY nice, but a bit pricey for us at $299 per night during the summer. The resort also does provide towels for you to use while in your room, you have to bring your own for the pools and hot tubs and they will exchange your towels for clean ones, if you leave your dirty ones in the laundry basket that they provide, outisde the door in the morning. Our kids also enjoyed the small pirate trinkets that they received on Monday for Captain Kids day. Over all the resort was so-so. I was so glad that we decided to stay far away from the traffic and congestion headaches of Branson and Tablerock lake is beautiful. It was also very handy that it was just three miles from Silver Dollar City. The man who checked us out was also much better than the woman who checked us in. He was very nice and sincere. So if you're looking for a place that is a bit dated, but a decent price and is away from it all and is pretty family friendly, then this is the place for you.", "Date": "August 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hillsboro MO", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "lanelson1964", "ReviewID": "UR37311857", "Content": "This was our first visit to this resort and were very pleased.

The kitchens were stocked with dishes and cooking pans & utensils...something not all facilities include. The staff was very friendly, informative, and accommodated our requests. The indoor pool was clean (it was too late in the year for the outdoor pools), the children had a great time down by the water using the kayaks and peddle boats (very nominal extra fee for those), and the little children enjoyed the playroom. Everything was clean. The setting was very peaceful and we enjoyed watching the variety of wildlife. Many deer came out in the early morning and at dusk.

They also listed lots of activities for kids and seemed very friendly on the phone. Our actual experience was less than we had hoped for, however. My family has been coming to the area for almost 50 years - averaging at least one visit every year. One of the reasons we enjoy returning is because of the friendliness of the locals. Lately (with kids) we've been staying in Branson to take advantage of the preponderance of indoor pools - allowing our kids to swim in all types of weather since we come during all four seasons. I've missed the days when I was a child that our family stayed on the lake and fished. We always had very friendly hosts at every resort at which we stayed. That was, unfortunately, not the case at the Tribesman. I suspect that the owners are the elderly people we encountered. They need to step down and retire - somewhere other than the resort. They are the most sour, unfriendly people we have ever encountered in the Table Rock / Branson area in all the years we've been coming. You'd think if people hated their job so much, they'd quit and/or hand it over to others. Unfortunately, the younger people to which they might be passing the business are not much better. In fact, there was only one employee that was friendly - a man we only knew as \"D\" who worked on the dock. Besides the sour faces and behavior, my mother was treated like she was stupid when she asked a question of the (younger) woman at the front desk. Also, a (younger) worker at the dock (not \"D\") treated me like I had never seen a boat before (I'm 40 years old and have been fishing since I was able to pick up a rod and reel). He also tried to tell me that fishing licenses cost something other than what I just paid online a few nights before - like I didn't know what I paid or something. The worst, though, was the unprofessional nature of a particular conversation my wife happened to overhear. My son and I were at the office reserving a boat. He is very active and talkative because of his ADHD (or whatever it is) and also just because of his nature. Anyway, he was mostly just being friendly with the woman at the front desk while we were setting up the boat. Apparently, after we left the office to head to the dock, she called down to the dock hand on her walkie-talkie to have him get the boat ready. Unbeknownst to her, my wife and other son were on the dock. My wife said she \"warned\" the dock hand that a boy with \"special needs\" was coming down and that he was acting crazy and constantly talking. After my son and I arrived, the dock hand, when he wasn't treating me like an idiot, was very rude to my son. Admittedly, my son was excited about going in the boat (like all boys his age) and was in the way as the man was explaining things. There was no reason for him to be that rude, however. There are other good and bad things about the resort, but the unprofessional, unfriendly nature of most of the employees really ruined our stay there. Regardless of the features it offers, we will not be returning to the Tribesman. For those of you still considering it, however, here are some other pluses and minuses: + five pools, one indoor + two boat docks + campfire with free food on Saturday nights + free boat rental special (seasonal) + free danishes and drinks on Sunday mornings - older rooms are musty (spraying with air freshener helps) - water is rusty/metallic smelling and tasting - they seem to have a lot of rules - with consequences To be fair, they do have newer (more expensive) units if you like, and the first two negatives would probably not be an issue in those units. The excessive number of rules and nature of the consequences of disobedience made us feel as though we had to be careful with everything we did or we'd get charged for it. I'm still waiting to hear if they're going to charge us because we didn't empty the trash can in the dumpster when we left. There are too many resorts close to Silver Dollar City and the lake to waste time with the Tribesman. The indoor pool is certainly not worth dealing with the personnel.

We saw all kinds of wildlife during our stay including raccoons, chipmunks, squirels, rabbits, and tons of deer. There were thunderstorms the first half of one day of our stay, but that didn't spoil our fun becuase Tribesman has an indoor heated pool. All the pools were very clean and in pretty settings. Every section has it's own pool so they were never crowded. They had trails and a few play ground areas. It's a great place for families with children.

I called the front desk again and the person working gave us a different room. This was the handicapped room.

We were looking for adjoining rooms but at such late notice we weren't surprised that we couldn't get them. It was my husband & I, our 2 girls (6&3), and my mom and dad. When we got there, we were able to get 2 rooms (about 6 rooms apart) in the poolside building which was right behind the ocean front building, with a great pool right below us. So we didn't have to walk across the road to get to the boardwalk. They said the one room would have no veiw, but we were very happy with it because it was at the front of the building and we had extra railing space to hang our towels and the way the steps were we had almost a private balcony. We were on the 3rd floor and unfortunately did not have an elevator (my fault for not asking first, the tower building did have one). The staff was very friendly, the rooms were nice and cozy. The wifi worked great!!!! We tried out both pools and we loved them both. And the cafe was excellent also!!!! CONS: Cable blinked out a couple times but came back in a few minutes, and we had a big bright yellow light right outside our room (309) that came in around the curtains so our room was not completely dark at night. The only thing i would have liked better was if they had queen beds instead of double. After sleeping in a king bed at home, having to share a double was not comfy. I did love their pillows though.

We called down to the office and someone came up and swept it off. We had the worst cleaning lady ever. We had to ask for towels daily. And in the mornings when the cleaning lady would show up, she would ask us to bring her the trash and dirty towels. The one day we came back from breakfast, we noticed that the room had not been cleaned (vacuumed, trash taken out). I had a 2 year old at the time and between the sand and crumbs the room needed to be vacuumed every day. I called down to the office and they said they were going to call our cleaning lady. When the cleaning lady called back she told me that she was about to leave for the day and that she did not have time to vacuum our room. I am not a person that expects things to be perfect but I did pay almost $200 a night for this room and I feel that the room should be vacuumed daily.

The maid came everyday and gave us new towels. The furniture and bathroom were older, but they still worked well. There are two pools. Both are relatively small and only go up to 5 ft. The little kids tended to go in the peanut shaped pool in front of the Poolside bldg, so we kept to the pool in front of the Tower bldg. The pool was clean and few people seemed to use it. The motel was quiet overall, though people did like to hang out on the walkways. On a couple of nights, we found some older people (40's - 60's) having a little party out there, but they were pretty quiet and I couldn't hear them inside the room. There was a security guard present who you could call if someone was being disruptive. The location is great - on the boardwalk, but high enough up so you don't have a lot of crowds and noise.

Unfortunately, we chose to travel during one of the many \"Senior Weeks\" which I believe is part of the reason we had such a horrible experience at this hotel. Even giving this hotel, and its employees, the benefit of the doubt, I will never stay at the Sahara again. When we checked in, our room door was open and the TV was on. A little bizarre, but everything seemed ok in the room. We left around 8PM for and didn't return until 3:00AM. When we did return, we were on the balcony and approached by another hotel guest who was clearly underage and visibly intoxicated. The hotel security guard (and I use that term very loosely) was not worried about him, he was more concerned with us talking on the balcony. He actually said to us, \"I'm not concerned with them; my only job here is to keep the noise down.\" The night auditor was downright rude and disrespectful when we tried to get a key to our room we had been locked out of. He kicked my friends off property and made them wait in the street while we got their car keys for them out of the room because he said they were \"messing with the light [on the balcony] for 45 minutes\" which was completely untrue. Then he proceeded to tell us he had eight phone calls about noise disturbance from our room. That was impossible because there was nobody in the room from 8PM until 3:00AM. Unless, of course, whoever was in our room before we checked in came back to do a little partying... Everyone with us was adults. We all hold respectable jobs and have families. We should have been the least of his worries when there were illegal activities going on in his hotel. He treated us like we were obnoxious, drunken teenagers which couldn't have been further from the truth. I have never been so poorly treated by anyone, hotel employee or otherwise. The night auditor lied to us, treated us horribly, and refused to help any of us, then kicked us off \"his\" property. We tried to follow up with a manager later that weekend, but none were available. I understand this is a small hotel and we are hardly going to make or break their business by not returning.

This is a safe choice in motels...I've stayed at a few others through the years and I am back to stay with the Sahara for as long as it's there :)", "Date": "July 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cJust a Motel...No perks. General OC Info included.\u201d", "Author": "CozumelQueen", "ReviewID": "UR34026854", "Content": "We have stayed at all 4 properties within this group of hotels - (BEST -Beachmark, Executive, Saraha, Tides). This was the first time at the Saraha. While the other motels are further up the beach, they are pretty much the same, but a lot cheaper in price. The further from the boardwalk you are the cheaper the motels. We rented three rooms in mid June for a family reunion. No pets are allowed at this property. All rooms are non smoking. We stayed mid-week (Tue-Thur nights) - 3rd Floor Oceanfront. The cost of each room per day was over $200. The Good - Oceanfront, on the Boardwalk - direct access to the beach. Great view - get up for a sunrise!. Rooms were clean. Nice Pillows. Parking was good. Nice balcony. Couple of clean pools. The Bad - No amenities - simple plain room. Regular Key (no keycard) - deadbolt key does not work, but deadbolt does from inside room. No elevator. No safe. Ice machine at the bottom of the stairs is 25 cents per bucket. Two beds (hard mattresses) per room, small bathroom/ shower/ sink. 2 small bars of soap. No shampoo samples, no kleenex/tissues. The tub has a pop-up drain - be sure to push it down if the water starts collecting. Air conditioning unit is right as you walk in the front door at the sink - so the sink area blocks the A/C from going further in the room unless you blast it. NO COFFEE MAKER in room. Towels - 2 small bath towels and 2 wash clothes that were like sandpaper - especially if you had a sunburn! Maid service - if you wanted it - place card outside door - if you were in your room they would ask - one day we just asked for more towels. General Notes - For the price - at least we expected a coffee maker, so we ended up going to Bed Bath & Beyond (across the bridge in the first shopping center on the right) and bought a $20 small 4-6 cup coffee maker for the room. They also had them for $10 at the Dollar General, but they were sold out. Dollar General also had Folgers Coffee filter packs (4-6 cup) and cups. Five Below (a dollar store where everything is $5 or less) is in the same shopping center and you can get boogie boards and beach umbrella's for $5. On the boardwalk - they range from $15-$30. To save money, we generally ate breakfast and lunch in our room (stopped at the local grocery store when we got there)- the refrigerator is dorm room size and a small microwave. We ate out for dinner. Restaurants - Check out the coupon books (they are everywhere (hotel lobby/grocery store) for coupons). We are from Maryland and wanted to give our out of state family members a taste of the Ocean, but did not end up getting Maryland Blue Crabs - don't be afraid - they are wonderful! Lots of work, but steamed crabs are the best! The further south you go (NC for example - they boil crabs - yuck!) If you don't want to get messy - get a lump crabcake. To please the wide variety of guests and considering cost for a family of 5 (3 teenagers). The items marked with an * are excellent. We ate at the Panda Buffet in the same shopping center one night - $12.95 all you can eat chinese buffet with snow crab legs - standard chinese buffet - nothing exciting, but good food all the same - had a $1 off coupon per person. Dough Roller Pizza on the Boardwalk the 2nd night - excellent pizza! (they also have great breakfast!) Get the sweet peppers* on your pizza! ($2 off coupon for pizza) They are awesome! Third night we ate at Sakura Japenese Steakhouse in the same shopping center as the Dollar General - Can't go wrong with Sakura - entertainment and delicious food! Price range from $20-40 - depending on what you get... full meal - soup (miso/mushroom), salad (ginger dressing), appetizer of choice (mushrooms*, shrimp* or chicken livers), plain or fried* rice (get the fried, you won't be disappointed!), grilled vegetables, choice of entree. They have combinations - steak - sirloin or filet, chicken, lobster, scallops, shrimp, salmon. (Coupon for free Ice Cream in coupon book). Next door to the Sakura restaurant is a Smith Island Cake store. Smith Island cake is a multi layer cake (very small layers {1/4\"} of cake between very small layers of icing) traditionally made on Smith Island on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. It is worth a try. The traditional is chocolate, but they also had other flavors such as banana nut and berry and a variety of cupcakes. We ate at the Saraha Cafe one morning - similar to a Waffle House - greasy spoon. Service was good - restaurant needs to be updated - food average tasting but large portions for the omelets, etc. There is a Dunkin Donuts one block up (towards 18th Street) on the main road. Beach - the beaches are clean - no alcohol, no pets during May- Sept. no sleeping on benches or overnight on the beach - you will get ticketed! Jellyfish in late summer/fall - beware. You can also rent chairs and umbrellas on the beach. A day trip to Assateague Island is great. It cost $3 per person to get in . Senior Citizens are free. There is a visitors center with a bathhouse (toilets, shower, dressing area) along with a small cafe/grill (hot dogs, ice cream, fries). There are wild ponies on Assateague Island that you can take pictures of - do not feed them - sometimes you can approach them but you should use caution - they have been known to bite and kick. The beach is very nice - the waves are a bit larger (beware of the undertoe - riptide on all beaches) and life guards are on duty during the day. You can also camp here, but beware of the mosquito's and the green biting flies during the summer months. The Boardwalk - starting from the inlet - there is a museum and small shops at the end as you walk up the boardwalk there are many places to shop and to eat. There are restrooms on the boardwalk every 10 blocks or so. \"Playland\" is one of my personal favorite arcades- they have \"old time\" 10 cent claw machines with \"junk\" toys in them - but they are a part of my childhood so each time I go to OC I have to get a cup of \"junk\". LOL They also have pinball machines, air hockey and photo booths. There are two places to ride carnival rides - the first is right at the inlet - tickets are 50 cents each and each ride varies from 4-8 tickets. There is also another carnival area on the pier called Jolly Roger - you can buy individual tickets or a pass. Ripley's Believe It or Not - if you are interested. Certain food items on the boardwalk are a must - Thrasher's french fries - whole potato's cut and deep fried - add malt vinegar and salt. Fisher's Popcorn - with or without nuts - awesome. Dolly's salt water taffy. Dumser dairyland - great ice cream! There are many putt-putt golf places to play on the main road and a variety of restaurants and stores as you drive further north. You can also take the bus. Not sure home much the bus fare is, but it is cheaper than parking at the inlet for the day. There is a tram you can ride for $3 each way that will take you up and down the boardwalk. You raise your hand to get off at any location. Henna tattoo's are popular, piercing, etc. Lots of teenagers/young adults during the summer. Off season I think is the best (Sept-April). Not a lot of things open but a relaxing peaceful trip. Other restaurants to try - Embers or Bonfire Buffet ($24.95+), Popular resturant's with suggestive names - Big Peckers, Bearded Clam, Purple Moose, etc. Overall our experience was good. I would have like to have eaten at a bit more upscale resturants, but with a group and a budget, its hard to do. I don't think I would stay at this property again. The reason is due to the price of the motel, yet the location is great. I prefer to stay further up the beach (90th St. +) because it is cheaper for motels. You really don't spend too much time in the rooms during the day. If you want a \"nice\" hotel which will be much more expensive - stay at the Princess Royale or Sheraton, Holiday Inn, Dunes, etc.", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "pa", "Title": "\u201cbed bugs!!\u201d", "Author": "shanstrs", "ReviewID": "UR33845877", "Content": "My friends and I stayed here during tropical storm hanna.

In fact, I wore them the entire time of my stay, even when walking around the room because I did not feel comfortable with the lack of cleanliness.

So close to the ocean that you could be in the ocean in a few minutes! The boardwalk is even closer allowing you to visit several different types of clothing, beach and novelty shops.

After walking down the boardwalk and looking at other pools the Sahara was spotless. We had breakfast at the Cafe' once and it was very good and the price was just as good. It is in a great location a few steps away from the beach and boardwalk. Yet it did not have all the noise you would have when staying right on the boardwalk. I would recommend this motel to anyone who plans on visiting Ocean City. In fact we are looking forward to staying there again next year. So DO NOT listen to all those bad reviews, I am a extremly neat and like everything clean and the Sahara was just that, a bit dated but clean. And of course if you are like me you bring a can of lysol and spray the room down anyway, I would do that even if I was staying in a five star hotel.", "Date": "September 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, PA", "Title": "\u201cNot the Hilton, but Great Location and a Good Price\u201d", "Author": "czang76", "ReviewID": "UR8474071", "Content": "We stayed for the second time this year at the Sahara Aug. 6-10. Once again, the location is the best part of the hotel. Very convenient to walk to beach and boardwalk, but still at the quieter end of the boardwalk. Loved having the balcony and watching bikes in the morning and the crowds at night. We only moved our car once the entire trip. The rooms are a bit small and definitely dated. Our oceanfront room had water damage running down the wall and the balcony door stuck. Overall, the place is clean, maintained and safe, but very basic.

We ate at the cafe, and the food was great, and seemed to cost a bit less than the Dough Roller and other famous places. Definitely eat there - it's worth it. (No dinner though - they closed at 2:00 - in June anyway) We used both pools - they were clean and had enough chairs, etc. Being away from the \"center\" of the activity was a plus - especially at night, and when we needed to drive somewhere. Dunkin Donuts and Pizza and Liquor store and Dippin Dots were all right behind our building. Oh - and the price was unbeatable!

The hotel is old, but rooms are nice and big. There were few negative points: The building we were in was on the main street, so we could hear all the traffic noise outside. Also, we could hear people walking above us. The swimming pool is small and is facing the main street, so it is not very inviting. We haven't used it. Now positives: Location is great!!! It's in the end of the boardwalk, so you don't get any noise from there, but it is within a walking distance. There is a cafe right sownstairs that serves breakfast and lunch only and is very reasonably priced. There is also Dunkin Donuts rights across the street and few Seafood buffets within 2-3 blocks. Hotel is very reasonably priced compared to others.

I was a bit afraid because of the reviews it got but went through with our reservation.

The rooms did smell musty and were not cleaned very well. After retiring for the evening we were jolted from our beds by what seemed like a banging and vibration on our walls. We reported this to the office the next morning and the office told us it was the elevators mechanical room and too bad there was nothing they could do about it! Also, each time someone above us took a shower there was a loud cracking sound aside of our beds. Also were told too bad!

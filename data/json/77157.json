I found this place very pleasant. I had none of the unpleasant experiences a few other reviewers did. Or maybe it's improved a lot since then. I needed to be in Long Beach @ 2PM for my check-in to my overnight yacht stay. I have a terrible time getting out of my house. so stayng someplace nearby LB with an 11AM check out time is the best way for me. I used my Choice Hotels website and located this little hideout which is actually in Harbor City, Just south of Torrance. The in-room (meaning in the living area) jacuzzi was the selling point. I have had other Choice hotels with this option and it is a little bit of heaven. I got off the 710 Freeway @ PCH thinking I would check out the dining/shopping options along the way. This is an area around the Port of LA so it is somewhat industrial/small town along the way. The Inn itself is in a nice enough area (actually quieter than I thought it would be) well kept and well lit. When I walked into the room, I was taken aback a little by the sparseness. There are no bedside lamps. The trick is, all the lighting is in the ceiling. Bedside switches turn on nice overhead lighting. The electronic key card goes into a reader in the wall & accesses all lighting, you control the off/on for each light. This is great for me, because I consistently lay the key down and can never remember where I left it last. When you leave you pull the card out and a timer shuts all the lights off. When you return the key goes back into the reader and immediately you have light. Slick. The room itself was spacious enough (obviously uncluttered) and clean. After soaking myself till I was a noodle, I slipped in between the nicest, softest, crisply pressed sheets ever & crashed out. I thought I would drive into Redondo for some food & to buy a bottle of wine. Not 5-10 minutes north there is a gigantic shopping area which turned out to be Torrance. It was perfect-Trader Joe's, CVS, etc. Stopped by Macaroni Grill for some take out. Found a lively Happy Hour and ended up staying for Honor Bar Chianti & ended up eating there. Met some wonderful people and had an enjoyable visit. One of the long-time bar tenders was having a Birthday so the bar was filled with regulars & well wishers. Couldn't complain about a thing.

First of all, the room had a distinctive urine smell that we couldn't get rid of. And the double beds were more like king singles - prior to Rodeway we had also stayed at different low budget motels/hotels in the US but the beds were all bigger. The breakfast wasn't that great, we got a danish and the coffee was.. errr.. not like coffee - but I suppose we can't really complain as the breakfast was complimentary. The worst part of our stay is that I woke up with lots of bites on my limbs on the last day. The motel manager seemed to think that it was some sort of allergy but if it was, the red dots would have covered my whole body (I only got them on fingers, arms and legs). I do have to make it clear that I don't know if this was Rodeway's fault, I mean the bugs might have been hiding in my luggage so they could be from the last hotel. The manager was concerned enough about my well-being, and advised me to get some medicine from a local pharmacy store. Good things about Rodeway. Well, it is close to a petrol station and a few fast food restaurants. It is on a big road so not hard to find (having a GPS in LA is a must). Strong fast free wi-fi.

I was very curious to see if it lived up to its high ranking. After staying, I should say that it's a very well maintained motel even if it is not located in the best part of town. It's on a industrial section of a very busy highway with a rather seedy looking hotel to one side and a strip club across the road. We felt a bit apprehensive about safety initially but no had no problems whatsoever. Parking is a bit cramped especially if you have a bigger vehicle and arrive late in the night. The room was very comfortable and all appliances lwere new. The manager was very friendly and seemed very eager to keep his guests comfortable. Breakfast is nothing to boast of - just juice/coffee and a few take away items that you would get at a gas station.

The curtains and cornice were tastefully done. The wireless internet was adequate (the typical DSL speed). The flat screen TV had a great picture and a wide variety of channel selections. The room was clean and quiet. The water pressure in the shower was strong and the water was plentiful. When we had checked in, we had left our camera at the counter. We didn't realize the camera was missing until we were in the parking lot and about to leave. We went to the office to get a key to go search our room. Mr. Patel handed the camera to us and said he'd been trying to find the owner of the camera since the day before. He said he's got one valuable item he's held for 18 months, waiting for the owner to show up and claim it! The only things we thought might be improved were that there was some sort of smell in our room and the continental breakfast consisted of only coffee, orange juice and pastries in plastic wrappers. The area is not the best, but we never felt unsafe. Overall, it is an amazing place to stay if you are looking for a discount hotel in the South Bay/ Long Beach area of LA.

We arrived around 2:30pm and the first thing I noticed was how small the parking lot was. I thought that would be an issue later on at night but as it turned out it was just fine. Mr. Patel checked us in and he was very friendly and informed us about the rooms and there location. My wife wanted to stay on the 2nd floor but she also wanted to face the lot so we could have easy access to our car. Mr. Patel informed us that there were no rooms available on the 2nd floor that faced the lot but there was one on the first floor and we were fine with that. The inn faces the Pacific Coast Hwy....so needless to say there can be a lot of travel throughout the day from people heading to Redondo.....Manhattan.....or Hermosa Beach. All of these beaches are only a few miles up the road....and that was a definite plus in more ways than one. The room key Mr. Patel gave us was quite unique because it was designed to be plugged into a slot in the room to supply the electricity. I had never seen that before....but I did learn that due to California's energy problems.....a ton of hotels....motels....inns....etc....was using all sorts of methods to save and conserve both energy and water. Now be advised you can get an extra room key and just leave the other one in the slot...especially if you want to leave the air running in case it is a warm day. The staff prefers for you to take it with you....to save the energy in the room.....however we left in the slot most days and that seemed to cause some problems. The cleaning staff on two separate occasions took the cards out of the slot and then replaced them when they finished cleaning the room. This would cause our second card not to work and Mr. Patel was more than happy to recharge it for us so we could get into our room. Now while this was a little unsettling it is really the only bad thing I have to say about this locale. The rooms are small...which has been expressed in many of the reviews I have read for this location....however it was fine with us and the noise level from outside was almost none existent. Now I have to stress if you can get an upstairs room PLEASE DO....because some of the visitors that stay here don't know how to walk softly and the walls and ceilings are a bit thin....but not horrible. The breakfast is nothing special....coffee....danish.....orange juice. The also offer the daily L.A.times each morning for your reading pleasure.....LOL. The bed is very comfortable and we enjoyed our 4 night stay here.....there are plenty of restaurants and shopping near by.....along with the beaches I spoke of earlier. So get out early.....stay out late....but know when you return the lot may be crowded but there are parks even though the lot is very small.

I liked the hotel very much and would recommend it to anyone interested. The bed matresses' were very comfortable and I slept well after spending the day touring. Parking was easy and there are many spots available. Breakfast is just coffee, orange juice and little pre-packed pasteries - just enough to wake up to but you can walk to the McDonalds down the street for a full breakfast or drive to Denny's. There are a lot of small shops nearby where you can get everything you need. The inn keeper is amazing, very polite and kind. The hotel is super clean. My wife and teenage daughter enjoyed the room too. Wireless internet signal was excellent and fast. As for the noisy highway, it's true. It will get loud enough at 06h00 in the morning to wake you up if you are a lite sleeper. It's not loud during the night time but it does pickup in noise level starting at 06h00. Coming from Montreal, Canada the 06h00 a.m. LA time was like 09h00 a.m. Montreal time so no issue for me. But as I adjusted to the LA time, I did find it too loud for 06h00 a.m. But then again, you can't do much without a car in LA so get used to the traffic and noise.

TripAdvisor reviews were good, the cost was OK, so I booked it. Let's start with the good things. It's easy to find, not far off the freeway and right on PCH. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. And surprisingly the room was fairly quiet, at least from traffic noise. But let's face it, this is a little dingy strip motel, still hanging around from the days of automobile vacations. It's a bitsy two-level ell of a property with a small parking lot right on PCH. It's clear Rodeway recently purchased this property and slapped its name on it, as the handwritten reservation slip still had the previous name at the top in old-style script type. When I arrived in the evening, the front desk person graciously \"upgraded\" me to a suite, saying that's all that they had left, and that it mormaly went for $80. Oooooo. All doors open to the outside. Like I said, motel. My room was on the south/east end on the second floor. I think what made it a \"suite\" was the couch against the wall near the bed. The TV was decent and the wifi worked, although I had to get a sign-in at the front desk. The bathroom was tiny and the shower was just a shower, no tub. No counter, just a pedestal sink, which makes it a challenge when you're balancing a toiletry kit. The door is thin and I heard voices through it at times. The bed turned out to be more comfortable than I expected, and I awoke refreshed. When I checked out in the morning, I saw no sign of a breakfast. But later in my Long Beach stay, I had occasion to drive along another stretch of PCH and saw a different Rodeway Inn, a 5 or 6 story structure, modern and inviting, with trees around the property. A very inviting place. The Rodeway Inn where I stayed was on a hardscrabble stretch of PCH and the property itself had that hardscrabble feel, and no amount of renovations will change that. This definitely is the bottom of the barrel in terms of brand image. It's not a bad place for a quick night in a pinch, but then, I'm a pretty big guy and traveling alone. I'd stay away here if you're a single woman or a family. I'm not sure what the Rodeway corporation was thinking when they bought this property, but it's clearly not up to even their standards. Also, I have to dd that I'm not sure where the recent 5-star reviews are coming from. This is in no way, by any reasonable standard, anything close to 5 stars. Yes it's clean, yes it's comfortable, but it's also rather ramshackle, with virtually no amenities in the room or on the property. It gets 2 stars, and not 1, because of the free wifi, because the bed is comfortable, and because it seems to be free of vermin. But it cannot be reasonably rated any higher.

We had made the reservations the night before when we were in Santa Cruz. We wound up arriving very late, which I had my son call ahead to let them know and it was no problem. When we arrived, Mr. Patel was very friendly and quickly checked us in. We were only going to stay for two nights, but the kids wanted to stay a few extra days and it wasn't a problem. We found a local laundromat down the road and an excellent bakery as well which made our stay even better! Each night when we would come back from sightseeing, we would stop at the 7-11 pick up our snacks and head back. The only problem with parking was, if you got in to late, you had to park in the overflow lot which faces a \"seedy\" hotel. Everything is a short drive. I personally am not a big freeway driver, so we found all the backroads to get places. Venice Beach is about 20 minute ride depending on traffic and Knotts Berry Farm was 15 minutes away. The oil change place across the street was nice too. The only problem we had with Mr. Patel was he thought my son was smoking in a non smoking room. I told him that he was going outside by the ashtray and smoking and while we were there, we emptied the ashtrays for him, which it was the least we could do. Breakfast was ok, it was packaged Danish that you would pick up from Sam's Club, so if you have the chance, venture down the block to the little bakery and pick up a stuffed crossiant. On one of the nights, we had noise people in the room above us. I let Mr. Patel know and he said when we come back he will put us on the second floor. So if you want peace and quiet, request a 2nd floor because when you are on the first floor, you can hear everything! Parents should tell there children to be respectfull of the people around them, my kids are teenagers and still get mad at me when I tell them to be quiet because of neighbors.

This is important because I do not like getting two rooms if I don't need to, but we need two beds that are larger than twins. The hotel is nothing special, most of the reviews are accurate enough, so much of what I say has already been said. But I rely on folks adding their 2 cents here at Tripadvisor to make my decisions, thus it is only fair that I contribute as well. Basically the hotel is clean, the beds were comfortable, as I said the prices was reasonable and I have no real complaints. It is next to a fairly busy road but surprisingly the noise did not bother us at all. Part of that I think was due to the A/C, you know, your standard loud hotel unit. Not complaining about the A/C sound, just saying it helped cover some of the traffic noise. The door looked fairly solid as well and I think that helped with limiting the street noise. The surrounding area does seem a little rundown but no one bothered us and I didn't feel uncomfortable. There is a McDonald's right across the street and a Jack in the Box next to that. That's good because the complimentary breakfast is barren. Coffee and some packaged danishes. There was a grocery store, Albertsons, about three blocks down, we shopped there for some food. A couple of other cons: The parking lot was tight, there was no laundry on site (there was a laundry about a mile down the road) and it is a little far from downtown.

The room was really nice. Nice modern kitchen, nice balcony, nice master bedroom and 2 bathrooms. The beach? It's ok if you aren't picky. The last day we checked out Kaanapali Beach and it is nice and wide, not hilly but probably really busy. The problem was that we couldn't find a 2 bedroom on that beach so this worked. We never honestly went to the beach, it is really narrow and there was high surf when we were there so there's no way we were stepping in the ocean. It wasn't the least bit inviting because it rained and was chilly for the first 3 days of our stay. We ended up at the mall because there wasn't much to do. Lahaina the town is cute to shop in though and it's waterfront so take a trip to see that. We did the road to Hana as well, the weather was great that day. The 2 complaints I had with this property? The pool was cold, I'm pretty sure it's not heated and if they rely on the weather, the weather was pretty much not what you would expect for Hawaii. The Big Island was way warmer, humid and beautiful. The other were the Myna birds. From the time dawn hits for an hour these birds commune in the trees outside and squak unbelievably. We had to all sleep with extra pillows on top of our heads to sleep through it. Not my idea of a holiday, I'm sorry but too early to wake up. They do this again at dusk, who cares, it's noisy as heck but at least it's not waking you up. We stayed for 3 weeks in Hawaii, Maui for a week, The Big Island for a week at Kona Sugar Shack, see my review, amazing and Waikiki at the other Aston property, which was great. We never encountered these birds anywhere but here and it would be enough to sway me to stay elsewhere because of it if you want to sleep in past dawn. All in all, the property is great and the grocery store across the street sells everything, even boogey boards. The Italian restaurant was great too. There is a town towards the north shore that also has a grocery store and coffee shop and a great Mexican restaurant as well. Worth the short drive. Also, they charge you $10 amenity fee for wi fi and coffee. The wifi is rotten and you can only use it from the living room and the balcony. Wasn't worth it. They charge $9 for parking too. These are hidden fees that the Aston in Waikiki doesn't charge and still provides this plus the parking is valet. Just be aware it will be more than what you planned if you have a car and you don't have a choice about the other daily fee.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vernon, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Staff\u201d", "Author": "Cindy G", "ReviewID": "UR125863418", "Content": "This was our first visit to the Ashton Kaanapali Shores in Lahaina but my parents second.

Rooms are clean, well-maintained, and comfortable; most rooms have an excellent view in one direction or another, and in the spring if you have an ocean-view room you can sit on the lanai and watch whales blowing, breaching, and slapping tails and fins. Grounds are impeccably groomed and beautifully choreographed. If you love the ocean and the beach, you can't find anyplace more agreeable, anywhere we've been. You can't find Maui accommodations closer to the ocean: you can walk barefoot from your room to the north end of the incredible Kaanapali beach in a minute or two, then have an unimpeded beach walk (or go a few steps inland to the boardwalk) for almost two miles. Staff is cordial and helpful. Pool and spa are crystal-clean and the right temperatures. The feel of the place is family, with lots of kids around. Downsides: the restaurant is ok and convenient, but much of the food is uninspired and you'll get better value elsewhere. And our main complaint is the constant roar of the restaurant chimney, very noticeable from the lanai of some of the inner rooms.

Some people might find that attractive, but to me it was a little boring. The beach was mediocre also...VERY narrow and hilly: hard to relax on the sand. Housekeeping inside the units left a lot to be desired! One day they didn't show up at all, which was no big loss because I think the only thing the housekeepers do is make the bed. They certainly didn't clean the bathroom! The worst thing, though, was that the bed was SOOO uncomfortable, that I was in pain for days after staying there. The last 2 nights I slept on the couch. My poor husband was stuck with the bed and was miserable. Sleeping apart put quite a damper on the romance aspect of our stay. Still, if it was possible, I would have given 3 1/2 stars.

They are much louder in our first room (479?) than the second (209?) as they are in the trees in the garden. Out toward the ocean you don't hear them as much. Myself and two sons stayed for ten days beginning 2-2. We arrived just after sunset, parking and check-in (and check-out) was easy and quick. I was not impressed with our first room, though it had a beautiful garden-view (which is what we booked) but with high windows in the bedroom which faced the parking lot at the front of the hotel. I spoke to the front desk early the next morning about what I was unhappy with and asked if there was possibly another room we could move to. They did not have anything available for two days but were graciously willing to move us then. I asked to see the room the day we were to move and they provided a room key to check it out which was not necessary as they were cleaning and the door was open. It was ready two hours sooner than they had promised but we were in Lahaina when they called to let us know and had even offered to move our things while we were gone but because I had left the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign out they had not entered. The second room was larger (though with a smaller kitchen), still garden view, but able to see some of the ocean. Much quieter and I was very happy. King size bed was VERY firm. Staff was very helpful, friendly and cheerful. Do attend the island orientation downstairs every morning if you are a newbie, very helpful and lots of info I didn't get anywhere else. I even called back to Expedia Concierge on my cell phone from around the island with questions they were able to help me with and they booked our surf lessons and whale watching. Lots of families, pool was nice. Lounge chairs start filling up by 8:30. Shop the sale items at Times Market and Safeway in Lahaina to save a shopping trip in Kahului, same savings. Nice to have free dvd rentals for the boys in the evenings and on one day of bad weather. Go whale watching on a raft with Pacific Whale Foundation or another conservation group and support the work they are doing. If I could change anything I would paid more for ocean front and above the second floor. You really can watch whales breach from your lanai, bring some binoculars. They are beautiful. Also bring water shoes. The beach in front is not as gentle or smooth as on Kaanapali, it is rocky, though there is some swimming and snorkeling on calmer days. Also, you can walk all the way down to Black Rock and all the way to Lahaina if you want, but there is not a boardwalk you have to cut into the resort areas and it would be difficult coming back in the dark if you did. One complaint I did make to the front desk and the hostess at the pool is the smoking on the boardwalk along the beach. The woman at the pool said people can only smoke ON the beach and the woman at the desk said the boardwalk didn't belong to Kaanapali Shores, so they have no control over what happens on it. Either way, four to five smokers at a time is very annoying cigarette smoke, even in the open air. The grounds are beautifully kept and a conch shell is blown every evening at sunset and the torches lit.

My husband and I especially enjoyed the long (several miles) of walkway along the ocean and we took a nice walk every morning. We were glad to have the nice kitchen area and used it mainly for breakfasts. It was nice to be able to keep beverages cold too. We saw MANY whales from our balcony and also went on a Pacific Whale Foundation tour which I would highly recommend. We enjoyed being in the raft instead of the big boats because we felt you could see better and taking pictures was really easy. Another suggestion would be to take a tour on The Road to Hana instead of trying to drive. We had many people tell us this since the driver doesn't get to see much since they are concentrating on the hairpin turns and one lane bridges.

This was actually a one bedroom condo. Also could see whales from balcony. I have no complaints about our visit. The room was nice and it was cleaned everyday. All employees we encountered were pleasant and said hello. As mentioned in other reviews there is a $10.00 daily resort fee and another $9.00 daily parking charge. I knew about this before hand so it was not a problem or suprise. Other resorts we considered staying at had $25.00 daily resort fees plus parking charges. We were on our honeymoon which was stated on the reservation and on our second day a bottle of champagne and box of chocolates were sent to our unit. Very nice!! We did not use the onsite restaurant so I can't comment on the food there. We left the resort everyday to explore other beaches. Other reviews also mention about stopping at Walmart or Costco by the airport for groceries before heading to the resort. Bad idea in my opinion. We landed at the airport at night and not knowing the area, spent an hour looking for Walmart. We finally found Walmart, which you should know is not a super Walmart, so there were very limited groceries available. There is a Times Marketplace right across from the resort which has everything you need at resonable prices. There is also an ABC store one block away that has the best sandwiches around. To the left of the ABC store is a small shop to rent snorkels and boogie boards, etc. The cost was only $5.00/day for snorkel and $4.00/day for boogie boards or $8.50/wk each. They don't try to sell you pricey trips either. We went to the Hyatt Regency Luau which to me was way over priced ($115.00 preferred seating)with average food. Drinks and wine were included but cheap quality. The red wine I was drinking came from a bottle that I can buy back home for $3.99 and the labels on the liquor bottles look like they came from 3rd world countries. But I realize this is really about the performance and that part was good. Besides, you have to go to a Luau once in your life. This was our first trip to Hawaii and the biggest point I want to make is our stay of 6 days was not long enough.

We brought some food from home to keep the cost down of what we spent at the grocery store...food and most everything is more expensive here...over $4 for a gallon of milk. The beach was nice, maybe a little smaller than what I am used to for a resort. The water was warm and beautiful. Once in the water you could wade out to about thigh deep before running into rocks and reef. But then, if you wanted to swim out further you could walk further down the beach to the south and there is more beautiful beach with the reef out a lot farther. We saw tons of whales!!

We were allowed in to our rooms and a steward brought our luggage up. We stayed 11 nights. I was sad to go home. There was well appointed, well everything. We didnt think we'd use the washer dryer, but did, and loved it! Our room was spectacular. I cannot say enough. I will for sure be staying there again. Nice to have a little gift shop that had milk and such, as well as t-shirts and shorts! Bought a few souvenirs there myself. NIce freebie show on Wed nights, get there early for a chair. Awesome beach access, if you can find a chair. Loved the 2 pools, and ironically, spent more time at the kiddie pool b/c it had less kids! Nice to have a fridge, and ice machine, for filling our coolers for picnic lunches on the wayside rest stops. Snorkeled right outside out hotel, although was a bit rough there. Great view of both Lanai and Molakai (sp?) Saw whales from my balcony, and from the restaurant! We ate most breakfasts at the hotel restaurant,but loved to get away once and a while for a trip to the Gazebo! There is a Times Grocery store just across the street, as well as a great ABC store about a block away. We went there a few times to have sandwiches made. Great time saver! A few must do's while on Maui in my opinion. Go see Lou at the Expedia desk by the Banyan tree, (not the one in Kanaapali shores) he is a good friend we met on our first trip to Maui years ago when we bought all of our tours through him, and go see him everytime we are on Maui, as well as send all of our friends and clients to see him. He works M-T & W 9-7, he is GREAT! Go see the Warren and Annabelle Magic show, I go every time, and its different each and every time. Book it early, he sells out almost every single night. Eat at the Aloha mixed grill, and at 5 Palms. Spectacular! Also, superb Italian food, go to Basil tomatoes (not far from hotel) if you get there between 5-6pm, and pay cash, all the food is 50% off. I went to the Old Lahaina Luau, which was great, but really liked the Royal Lahaina luau better simply for the fire portions of the acts. Go to Crazy shirts, if you go to the one at the wharf (by the huge banyan tree, and Lou) Lou can give you some coupons, and you get 20% off! He has a coupon book that has coupons for all the stores at the wharf. Also, there was a FANTASTIC Indian restaurant in the back of the Wharf, bottom floor, called Monsoon India. Great owner, great chef, I highly recommend it. Go to Ono Gelato on Front St, pineapple sorbet, that's all I need to say! Great breakfast (cash only) go to Sunrise cafe, they are just off front street, also by the banyan tree. Great yogurt with granola and fresh fruit. Finally, if you want to book any tours, like whale watching, dinner cruise, snorkeling. I used Lou of course, and Pacific Whale foundation. Our family has a membership, so we get 20% off all of our excursions that we book through them. If you must go to Costco or Walmart, be prepared. Its busy. Also, Maui gave up all plastic bags a while back, so either bring your own, or you can buy one at most places. I came back on Jan 16th, and have already tried to book again for 2014! No prices avail for that far out yet, or believe me, I'd have my deposit down on it already! Cannot wait to go back.

I chose this property for its value, because I was able to ge it as part of a package including car and also for the condo amenities (full kitchen, washer/dryer), etc. I've traveled to Maui at least 5 other times and typically stay in Kihei out of habit. I like knowing the neighborhood and usually my goal is to spend less on my lodging and more on all the fun that Maui has to offer. That said, this time I chose to stay in Ka'anapali because the hubs has never seen Hawaii and because I was unfamiliar with the area, it was ilke staying somewhere new for both of us. We stayed in Room 528, overlooking partially a parking lot, partially a grassy area and with a limited view of the ocean. The balcony was a nice size and included a chaise lounge and a small table with two chairs. We didn't spend any time lounging on the balcony, truth be told, but would have. It was pleasant and I really didn't need a fancy schmancy beachfront view. The side of the resort we were in was quiet. The living room was furnished \"tropical\" style, like most Maui condos, but was not tacky in any way. The couch was L-shaped and comfortable for lounging. The wireless internet was nice, and included in the $20/day resort fee (at first I was ticked about having to pay the fee, but most hotels do charge for parking and internet and such, so it made sense. I liked the free DVD rental program too, and the hubs checked out several movies during our time). The full size kitchen was nice - we didn't do any cooking per se but we did store lots of drinks in the frigo and appreciated the automatic ice maker. To me, the best part of a condo is being able to get dirty and wash clothes when needed. The bathroom was a decent size. The shower's water pressure was not to my liking - I like a lof of pressure, but it did the job. The shower didn't run out of hot water. However, it was EXTREMELY annoying that the tub drained very slowly so we ended up standing in several inches of water while showering. Just annoying and felt dirty. The bed in our room was king size and very comfortable. There were plenty of pillows. The lighting in the condo overall was not satisfying. There were two small bedside lamps in the bedroom that cast hardly any light. The bulbs were compact flourescents and annoying! Overall, I believe all the bulbs in the condo were this sort. I'm all for energy efficiency but I can't stand not being able to see! The bathroom had good lighting, though. The resort grounds were nice. The beach was pretty reefy so it wasn't a great swimming beach but perhaps the snorkeling was good? We didn't spend much time at the condo's beach. Staff here was great - I particularly liked Sheena at the front desk and Andrea at the Expedia activities desk in the lobby. The sundries store in the hotel was convenient for postcard stamps and a quick bottle of water. Mostly, though, we bought sodas, trinkets, convenience foods and beer at one of the ubiquitous ABC stores nearby. We would absolutely stay here again. If you're like us and more interested in seeing the island of Maui and experiencing all it has to offer, and less interested in staying on property, this is a terrific option for a comfortable, affordble place to stay. If we end up having a kid as a result of this honeymoon, we'll be back as a family, too. By the way, we casually mentioned at check in that we were on a honeymoon and they sent up a bottle of champagne. Nice! Fabulous vacation in Ka'anapali! A few other notes: Fleming's beach up the road a piece was a wonderful place to chill out, boogie board and relax. The Gazebo restaurant at the Napili Shores was terrific!! The food was wonderful! They do not take rez so you'll probably have to wait. We ate here twice and our average wait was about 30 minutes, but again, we weren't on a schedule so it was no problem to us. Amazing banana mac pancakes and wonderful fried rice! Lots of flavor- the 1/2 order of rice is huge!", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Thomas, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWedding and vacation of our dreams!!!\u201d", "Author": "butterfly666", "ReviewID": "UR123563216", "Content": "We stayed here for a week and enjoyed ourselves emensly.

The pools and spas are closed from 10pm to 8am. There are lots of small charges (e.g., parking, activities fee, extra laundry detergent). The most troublesome aspect is a dangerous rip current at the south end of the beach. There is a warning sign at the neighboring property, but unfortunately we didn't see it. My wife and I went out for some casual snorkeling and got pulled out well offshore. We began to tire and would probably have drowned except for the kindness of some surfers who noticed our distress and guided us to safety on their boards. We later learned that another tourist had drowned at the same location last year. When we notified the hotel of our experience and suggested that the hotel should post a more visible warning, they replied that \"the ocean out front (of) our resort is no different than anywhere else on the island\" and \"hundreds of thousands have enjoyed the ocean fronting the resort over the past 30 years with no incident.\" Apparently appearances trump guest safety.

May be I am a little spoiled by other places. Nevertheless, the Aston Kaanapali is a nice enough of a place and I would recommend it. The weather did not cooperate. Can't fault the hotel on that. The hotel was doing some rather noisy (the drilling, specifically) construction work for a new parking area. I can't fault the hotel on that either although, for customer relations, it should make some type of gesture to make up for the inconvenience. The room we (my wife and I and our college son on winter break) had was nice and spacious enough. It is on the 7th floor with a partial ocean view, a kitchen with microwave and frig and dish washer and more utensils you would need unless you plan on doing some crazy cooking (why?). They clean the room and provided fresh towels and a new supply of tasty coffee every day. The services are good. Quick response to request for extra towels. They also printed our airline boarding passes for our departure flights. However, the extra fee ($19 ? a day) for parking and internet seemed a little high and unnecessary but don't they all do this sort of things nowadays? The pools and the beach area are a little small though. Not quite enough lounge chairs either. Our son took a 2 hour-surfing lesson on the hotel beach although he had to stop after 1 and half hour due to the rain and the cold. \"Turtle\", the surfing instructor, is a good guy. You should pay for the lesson at the towel shed and save about $20. We didn't. The most important item, for us anyway, is food: The hotel restaurant is too too expensive. There is a small shopping area with a grocery store and a couple of small restaurants directly across the hotel. You can pick up breakfast stuff and pre-cooked foods and sandwiches from the grocery store. (Don't bother with the sandwiches, mine was not editable). There is another small shopping area less than half mile left of the hotel with a breakfast place (\"Soup\" something) and a Chinese restaurant. The Chinese restaurant looks barely approachable but the food is much better than we first thought. Wished we had discovered it the first night. There is another larger shopping area about two miles right of the hotel with a food court. The stuff doesn't look appetizing. We drove north of the hotel along Rt-30 for about an hour until the road was a little too narrow and windy. Great views even though it rained on and off. We did not venture to Hana due to the weather and the long 4 hour (?) drive although we probably should've. I was told the view of the seven pools on the way is just incredible. As to car rental, yes you would definitely need a car. The next time I will try someone else rather than Avis because this is at least the second time they charged me extra fee ($46 more than the cost of my original booking of the travel package for 4 days) for tax and what not that the person at the counter couldn't really explain and I didn't want to waste time after a long flight. All in all we had a nice time. Would I go back to the same hotel again?

We were supposed to be checked out at 12 on our last day and our flight was at 11pm. They let us stay a few hours extra free of charge so we could enjoy the pool a little longer! You could see the ocean from our room as well. Food was great the restaurant at the hotel, however, it was a little slow. But that certainly would not change my mind to going back to this hotel!

The kitchen has everything you need in terms of dishwasher and plates. There is no salt or oil for cooking so all of that you will have to pick up yourself.

I didn't spring for a ocean view as I was going on the cheap but I got a fantastic view of the ocean and the pool (521). So maybe you will get lucky if you decide you wanna go on the cheap. I do have to say waking up and having a mimosa on the balcony while looking at the ocean would have been a shame to miss. The birds....ahhhhh the birds. They ARE pretty loud. The loudest being when the sun sets or rises. My room was pretty close to where they were having their little bird party but I didn't have trouble going to sleep. A lot of guests I spoke to did say that the noise annoyed them, but it didn't really bother me so I guess its about your personal tastes. If you think you will not be able to take it I would make sure they put you away from the birds. I also know some people things the birds where cute. But they are little rats with wings trust me. Make sure to use your screen or you will find them trying to eat all your food. ;) The pools were ok. Nothing to write home about, or to you about. I will say that there were really laid back friendly people, and the families all seemed very nice. There is a daily drink that is on special at the restaurant by the ocean front pool. And they have a drink happy hour. If you walk down the beach to Dukes, they also have a happy hour with some food on special. It was fine for a snack. I liked the rental system they had for DVDs. It was pretty awesome to check out flicks for as part of the fee. The gym is also pretty good. If you stay at the hotel you get to use it for half off. So the daily fee is $5.21 with tax. They have a weekly rate you can get for about $20. So its not that bad of a deal at all. The hottubs were nice and welcome because it was very windy during my stay here (I am writing this review from my room) They also are letting me check out an hour after check out which I thought was nice.

The unit was ocean facing, had a nice kitchen, not as much kitchen equipment as I would have liked, but was do-able for the week stay and saved a ton of time and moeny to be able to prepare meals there and not eat in restaurants every breakfast/lunch/dinner. Overall, the staff was super friendly, they unloaded our car and even had a grocery cart to take our weeks worth of groceries up to the room. They even put our cold items in the fridge!

We were provided with dishes, baking pans, cooking pans, etc. We had a full size refrigerator and dish washer. This is a GREAT feature for families who want to stay in and cook or for honeymooners, like ourselves, who want to have quiet dinners alone. The living room was extremely spacious with a pull out sofa bed (good for a large family). We had a balcony that had enough room for a chaise lounge and a table and chairs. There was a hallway with a washer/dryer (amazing feature for anyone!). The hallway included a full closet and the bedroom had an additional closet and some drawers. My husband and I had plenty of room to get ready every day. The bathroom was a great size with a good amount of storage space for all of your toiletries so you didn't have to clutter the sink. We basically moved in and felt right at home. The housekeeping service was extremely friendly! They cleaned our entire condo daily. We were very pleased with our room. On site there was a barista (coffee) and a convenient store. We probably used the store every day. It had everything from frozen pizzas to medicine. There is a seating area with t.v.'s and a mini library (take a book, leave a book or just read it and return it!). Also, the on site restaurant was a great place to eat. We ate in for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Sometimes we ordered take-out. It overlooked the pool and the ocean. The staff was very friendly. The bar can be accessed from inside or poolside. We used it daily from the pool. There also was an Expedia travel guide right at the pool that can help with any activities you would want to plan. If you go through this place a lot of the activities will be discounted. We booked two weeks worth of activities and they were some of our best memories. There are two great pools along with lounge chairs and beach access. Across the street are some restaurants for a quick bite (Subway, Mexican, etc.) or places to have a sit down dinner. Next to that is the Times Grocery Store. It was really convenient to be able to walk to the grocery store. Also, the bus stops right outside of the hotel whereas other places you have to walk a little ways to the bus stop. Overall, everyone was so friendly and very welcoming.

The bathroom was very nice as well, same granite countertops. Bedroom wasn't very big but had plenty of storage for two people, in room safe and the bed was very comfy. The staff was friendly and helpful. Called maintenance twice about very minor items, and the responded very quickly. On Wednesday nights, you can enjoy a free \"hula\" show down by the big pool. Speaking of the pools, the are very clean and well maintained. The beach area at the condo was great! They have lounge chairs and a handful of covered cabanas if you need to get out of the sun. The sand is like walking in baby powder and the water is not that cold. Perfect size waves, not too big. There are also tennis courts and a shuffle board area on the property.

They stayed at this property two years ago and liked it, so we decided to stay there as well to be near them. For comparison, the last time we stayed in Maui a couple years ago, we stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Kapalua. So it's not the Ritz, but it is a very nice condo unit and very reasonably priced. We paid $230/night for a 2BR garden view that actually had a really nice ocean view (unit 354). Our friends were in 356 and they had an even better ocean view. If you can get in that building (I think it is all 2BR condos) on the left of the property, all of the garden views have a pool and ocean view, no need to pay more for the ocean view. The rooms were extremely clean and well kept, very updated in terms of furniture and all of the needed kitchen appliances and gadgets to make it a comfortable stay. We had a large lanai (balcony) where we moved the dining room table to eat each evening, large enough for six people. They had maid service that came in each day to change the towels and empty the garbage, changed the linens every third day. We were there for 9 days. Most condos we have stayed at in the past didn't offer any maid service at all, so this was a nice plus. The pool was quite nice and they had a decent hula show each Wednesday at 5p. There is also a restaurant on property which we did not try, but our friends did, and said it was decent food at decent prices. It is located right next to the pool, making it convenient for those lounging around the pool or not wanting to cook in their condo or go out for the evening. On the downside, the hotel is not actually on Ka'anapali Beach, at least not the Ka'anapali Beach that most people think of, which is south of Black Rock. This resort is about a mile north of Black Rock. So you don't have the wide beaches and sandy bottom, the beach is smaller, more slanted and quite rocky. Be careful going in, even with water shoes. Almost everyone I knew who went in ended up with cuts on their legs and/or feet. It would have been nicer to have the barbeque grills in a more accessible location. They are located between the tennis courts and the parking garage at the front of the property, near the main road. While there are picnic tables in this area, it's not a great place to gather for dinner. And they are so far from the units that food would be cold by the time you walk back. Several reviewers commented on the bird noise. We loved the sound of the birds, they were not too noisy to be disruptive. The one noise that did bother us was the drone of the kitchen fan in the restaurant, which was at about the same sound frequency as the ocean waves roaring into the shore, so we missed hearing the sound of the waves.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Penticton", "Title": "\u201cPretty Good\u201d", "Author": "turtlepics", "ReviewID": "UR119692562", "Content": "The Resort was very nice, the room was more of an apartment ( huge) .

We stayed in room 543 and it was fabulous. The booking stated that this was a \"One Bedroom Garden View\" but I'm not sure if there is a bad view in this place. I'm sure it helped that we were on the fifth floor but, our \"Garden View\" room had an excellent view of Molokai and the turquoise ocean. The condo has a bedroom in the front of the hotel which faces the West Maui Mountains (which you can see by walking out your front door), a narrow bathroom (with enough room to move around for two), and a main living area split into a full kitchen, dining area and living room area. The back of the condo has a simple lanai with a lounge chair and a table with two additional chairs. Amenities These included a washer, dryer, dish washer, refrigerator, microwave and oven. There was even dish soap and a couple of packets of soap for the dishwasher. Glasses, pots and pans were stocked in the cupboards. Bed The bedroom was probably the most disappointing portion of the condo. The bed was stiff (not firm) and was a little damp and smelled musty as described by my wife. Meals Honestly we did not spend very much time in the room other than for breakfast and for getting ready to go out to dinner. It was convenient however having the fridge, stove and microwave making it easy to warm up leftovers and keep our pineapples fresh. If you are looking for a great meal on the island, try one of Chef James' establishments. I'O had the best meal that we ate on the island and its sister restaurant Pacific'O was even more crowded and highly recommended by friends of ours. Maui Exploring the island was our main goal and even though we set aside a beach day every other day, we felt like we never got to relax. A word to the wise, try to balance exploration and relaxation. A big reason our beach days didn't feel as relaxing as they could have was that we tried to hit most of the major beaches. Our favorites ended up being Kapalua (laid back, barely any waves, good for snorkeling) in the north and Makena in the south (\"Big Beach\", big waves, wide, no resorty feel). Kaanapali where the Aston is is pretty nice with a spectacular view of the two near islands, Lanai and Molokai. The sunset on the day that we arrived left us speechless standing at the edge of the property. The view is really beyond description. We had been to Kauai last year and never seen anything like this. The offshore islands give a dramatic backdrop to the already gloriously sparkling ocean. Other Take note that parking is $9 a day. The \"Island Orientation\" on the first morning was mostly a rehash of everything we had already read and planned from Fodors Maui. The food (pastries, fruit and juice) was really fresh and tasty but we probably would have rather gotten up earlier and gone to Haleakala for a sunrise because the time difference has you waking up at 3am which would be a good time to leave in order to get to the summit. The garden or courtyard in the center of the resort was well kept and very beautiful for a man made garden. All in all, I would recommend the Aston to those on a budget. I'd only be concerned that you may not be as lucky to get a condo that was as well kept as ours but if they are all kept up to the same standard, I would not hesitate to book a room at the Aston.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunnyvale, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay, close to beach\u201d", "Author": "Machar S", "ReviewID": "UR117956295", "Content": "What we liked: - Beach access - Swiming pools - Towels provided - Beautiful garden - Kitchen in condo - Clean room What we did not like: - amenity fee of $10/day extra - internet is slow for anything useful, some DVD's do not work properly (besides with beach nearby DVD's are not needed anyway) - parking fee of $9/day extra", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oriskany, New York", "Title": "\u201cWe loved our stay here and would highly recommend it\u201d", "Author": "Tracy J", "ReviewID": "UR117885032", "Content": "Excellent service.

One thing that truly stuck me about this hotel was the customer service from the staff. When checking in I shared with the front desk staff that I was celebrating my Birthday during my stay. The next day I received a box of chocolate covered macadamia nuts! Also upon checking in we received a postcared that said to join a Expedia Local Expert presentation the next day. My husband and I thought it was a timeshare gig so we decided not to go. Later we saw a poster in the elevator that advertised the Expedia Local Expert presentation and it stated it was not a timeshare presentation. I decided to go with our son to see what it was all about besides it was a free breakfast if anything. Andrea Wallace gave a presentation on all of the adventures you could do in Maui. From helicopter rides, submarine rides, walking to the beach, which beach was awesome, just everything to do in Maui. She had the experience in each tour she was talking about and a passion about Maui that was contagious! There was no pressure to book anything so that was nice. But what a lot of information packed into less then one hour! We booked through Pili Sundin, a Expedia Local Expert, the Atlantis Submarine ride and the Molokini Snorkel tour. WOW he was great to book through. Thorough with questions to ensure that we had chosen the right tour and what would be good for our 8-year-old son. No pressure, no gimmicks just excellent customer service and knowledge! Throughout our stay we would run into Andrea and Pili and they would ask us how we were doing and what we had done that day. They remembered all of our names and what genuine smiles and questions they had. We honestly felt like family with the staff upon leaving to go home. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how Andrea, Pili and the staff at Kaanapali Shores made us feel. I would go back in a heartbeat! While in Maui for six days we did the Molokini Snorkel Tour, Atlantis Submarine Adventure and the Old Lahaina Luau. Each adventure we did was excellent!

We originally booked seven nights at the Hanua Kai through vrbo but our trip was delayed with our one year getting sick. So we had to split our holiday with four nights at the Hanua Kai and three nights at the Kaanapali Shores. First and foremost the Hanua Kai is exquisite. We had a one bedroom suite and we ended up paying $200/night (before taxes). The room was modern, the grounds were well kept and the employees were helpful. I called the Kaanapali shores the day before my check in to request if I could arrive early since I was already on the island. The lady who answered the phone said it shouldn't be a problem. She made a note in my file and said to call the next day to confirm. The next day they weren't as nice. I explained that I had a one year old and that I would greatly appreciate if they could help. She told me to come to the hotel right away to complete all the paperwork and then maybe something will open up. When I got there she said to call back at 12:00pm and that a room should be available by then. At that moment I realized that I booked a studio with a kitchen instead of a one bedroom with a kitchen. I asked for an upgrade and she said that wouldn't be an issue but to call back at 12:00pm. When I called back I talked to a very rude lady that told me there wasn't a one bedroom available and that I wouldn't get an early check-in.

It was perfect for our family of three. It was nice to be able to eat in if we wanted and having a washer/dryer was really sweet. Food in the restaurant was good and service friendly. There's also a good espresso stand in the foyer.

Below are our comments: The room was great. All new granite and tile and appliances. Everything was in working order. The bedrooms were nice and beds comfortable. The pullout couch was perfect for our two 17 year olds. They provide a PS2 along with access to a RedBox like kiosk to rent games and movies for \"FREE\". However our PS2 was not working very well and we felt a little disappointed in that we weren't able to watch movies during the evening hours. The TV is also the old CRT kind, but was perfect for our needs. We had a garden view room on the 5th floor in section 43, and we had a clear view of the ocean as well. There were two pools, the one by the garden is only 3 feet and the one by the ocean is up to 6 feet. The jacuzzis were nice and warm and always working. Definitely try the lava flow at the bar. We couldn't get enough of them. The beach is rocky right in front as everybody has noted and there were quiet a few waves that made swimming interesting. Beach chairs are right there and available for all to use. We tried snorkeling and saw some small fish, but the current was very strong and there wasn't a true reef to see. We didn't take a snorkel cruise, but did get some advice from locals to try McKenna Landing for snorkeling. Key Suggestions for Lahaina 1) Hit the costco after you land. We stocked up on Bacon, English muffins, Eggs, Alcohol, and Milk. It was much cheaper. Go to Times Supermarket across from hotel and get butter, cream cheese, salt, pepper, and paper towels. 2)Hit the Expedia seminar the first morning. There's free continental breakfast and they have some good recommendations on activities. 3)Do the Maui WaveRiders surf school through the Expedia desk. It was only 50 per person. 4)Don't do the Maui Zipline at the plantation. It's a waste of time and money. We did the Skyline Eco Adventures - Kaanapali. It was a blast and had a good lunch as well. Don't wear anything nice, the red dirt is everywhere and doesn't come out. 5)Places to eat Ona Kau Kau - right outside the hotel to the left. Great chinese food and big portions. Pizza Paradiso - Across the street. Great pizza, everybody's right. Jawz Fish Taco (Kihei) - about 20 minutes south of the hotel. Great food and atmosphere. They owner was way nice and gave us free sodas. 6)Hang around the tiki torches at dusk. When the guy comes to light them and blow the horn, he'll let the kids light the torches and it's a great picture. 7)Hit up the Longs Drugs at the Canner Mall. They had great deals on Maui and Kona coffee for souvenirs. 8)Saturday near the Kahului harbor by the college is a swap meet. Great chance to get souvenirs. 9)Sunday in Kihei across from Jawz fish tacos is a little souvenir cluster. Got a great deal on coconut bras and grass skirts.

It worked out great; I loved having a full kitchen and washer/dryer. The unit was updated with slab granite and it was clean. The only thing missing from the unit is storage containers, so bring some small ziplocks and gallon sized baggies. There are also 3 grills you can use (near the tennis courts). And, yes, there are some really annoying birds in the back center courtyard area. In general, they were noisy from just before sunset to sunrise. There have also been a lot of gripes about housekeeping, but we didn't have any problems (they do come at inconsistent times during the day, though). It was our first visit and I was worried about getting a bad unit (I booked our air/hotel through Travelocity, not VRBO) so I printed off a picture of the hotel (# floors, rooms numbers, configuration) from the 'Maui Revealed' book website. At check-in I asked what unit she had us in, I looked on my picture, decided I didn't like the unit location, showed her my picture and asked for something better. She was very nice about it and made the change right away. Also, the Maui Revealed book has an IPhone app that only cost $6, and it was really helpful to have as well as we explored the island. We stopped at Costco (next to the airport) on our way to the hotel. The bellhops carried everything up for us and later that night we went to the 'Times' grocery store across the street to pick up smaller quantity items. The hotel was full, but it never felt full on the grounds or at the 2 pools. The ocean next to AKS is okay; you can swim a little or play in the waves, but Kaanapali and Waliea beaches are a lot better. We rented boogie boards from Boss Frog's down the street (to the left as you leave the hotel). It cost $15/week instead of $25/week at the resort. My husband and I liked to take turns running; if you go to the left out of the hotel, you can run on a nice sidewalk through a residential area.

The mattresses in both the fold out couch and the bedroom were of a high quality. The kitchen has granite counters, white appliances and looked like cherry cabinets. Basic kitchen stock such as pots, utensils and plates were included. (For those who travel with children know that eating breakfast in your suite saves the big bucks.)

Bought groceries at Times supermarket across the street--both quick and reasonably priced. Restaurants not to far from hotel. Had lunch at hotel once and it was good.

Not totally fabulous, but nice. The pools leave something to be desired - they could be more luxurious/larger but they aren't bad. The beach is fantastic. I wish they had a cocktail server or at least someone serving soda/water on the beach. They have signs that you can't bring down cocktails to the beach - why not? I can see not bringing glassware to the beach but everything they serve is in plastic. The drinks they make at the poolside bar are really really good though and the staff is pleasant. We were in one of the hotel suites with a kitchen. It was clean and was fully equipped. The bed didn't seem like a queen bed - seemed slightly smaller, but it was really comfortable. They have a no-smoking policy in the rooms, and that includes the balcony (which, as a non-smoker, I loved). A guest in the balcony below us was smoking and our room would smell like cigarette smoke when we were trying to get the nice island air in. I called the front desk and the smoking immediately ceased - most likely due to the fact that if they didn't they'd get fined big time (if they catch you smoking it's about a $400 fee added to your bill!). So I was pleased with how responsive the front desk staff was. The restaurant is not exactly gourmet. We ate breakfast there and the waiter was nice but the food was boring - I've had 10x better breakfast at Denny's or IHOP. Don't know how the lunch and dinner services were, because after that breakfast we decided to go elsewhere. My biggest gripe about the hotel is the housekeeping. When our room wasn't done by 2:30pm I called and the lady who answered wasn't very polite and told me that their services don't end until 4:30pm. I've never heard of housekeeping not finishing rooms until 4:30pm! That seemed somewhat ridiculous to me. However, I asked for towels and they were immediately brought up, so that's a plus. The town of Lahaina is only about a 7 minute drive down the street, which has plenty of shopping and dining, and Whalers Village is just up the street, about walking distance. Overall it was nice, not a 5-star resort but the grounds were beautiful, the staff was pleasant overall, the room was clean/well kept, and the beach is wonderful.

A total of 6 of us spend a week at Kaanapali Shores and shared a 2 bedroom suite. We arrived after a long plane flight from the mainland and a 26 mile car trip from the airport at about 10PM local time. The young woman at the desk greeted us warmly, wished us happy anniversary and handed us a complementary bottle of white wine (which was pretty good by the way.) She also upgraded our room to a full ocean view \"Aston Suite\" from the partial ocean view we had booked. What a great way to start off our vacation. When vacationing with 4 teens and 2 adults (4 girls, 2 boys) space was a major concern. We need not have worried. The room was huge! The master bath alone was bigger than many hotel rooms I've stayed in. There was plenty of sink space for the girls and the second bedroom had a standard totally independent bath and shower. The older girls literally had their own bedroom and bath. There was a spacious kitchen and a wrap around couch in the living room with a pull out sofa. Even with the sofa pulled out there was plenty of room. A fair sized dinning area was somewhat separated from the living room area and made meals in the room easy. The master bedroom was cozy with its own TV and private access to the balcony. Speaking of the balcony area... it was simply amazing! The view is unsurpassed facing westward over the white sand beach and clear waters of the pacific. The sunsets are breath- takingly beautiful! There is a reef literally yards offshore that is totally visible from your chair on the higher floors (we were on floor 7.) The balcony wraps around the end of the building and at that point faces inland toward the green cloud clad mountains in case you get bored of the blue water vistas of the ocean. I am not over- exaggerating when I say that the balcony at this resort is was one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. I could spend hours out there and never tire of the view. There is impressive snorkeling right off the beach out the back of the resort. Lots of fish and gentle surf. The hotel itself breaks the winds that rush from mountains in the afternoons and makes lying on the beach comfortable at all hours. Staying anywhere in Kaanapali is smart since it is on the \"Dry side\" of the island and you are more likely to have sun for your trip. It is less lush than the wet side but that is a small price for the perfect weather. Wind is an issue sometimes but the protected beaches around the hotels are rarely effected much. The hotel is a little isolated being on the North side of Black Rock although you can walk to the main strip in 10- 15 minutes along the winding \"Beach Walk\" (that sometimes randomly goes through the middle of some condos or on the parking lot of a hotel and not just along the beach as the name implies.) This was not a bad thing for my family but may be an issue for those who have to be \"in the middle of everything.\" Also the grounds, while lavish enough, are not as over-the-top as some of the most modern of resorts. There are no \"Lazy Rivers\" or Water Slides. The restraunt is adequate but not a 5 star kind of place either. Kids 12 and under, however, do get their lunches for free (too bad for me.) To sum up, Aston Kaanapali Shores is not the newest or most centrally located resort. It is an incredible place with amazing beaches, a reef perfect for exploring, friendly staff, easy parking and fantastic weather.The Full Beach front \"Aston\" 2 bedroom suites are totally worth the extra money, especially if you have a large family or group who value space. The extra space and those amazing balconies with the unbeatable views are the best value you will ever get for your vacation dollars. Splurge a little.

The pluses include: - A great area of Maui just minutes from Lahaina and Kaanapali attractions and shopping. - The staff is attentive and good, housekeeping does a great job. - The Expedia folks do a good job at the morning orientation (optional, of course, but worth the hour or so). - The food at the restaurant is also good, informal, and reasonably priced. - The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. - The furnishings were decent and well taken care of. The negatives: - Wireless Internet access was half the speed of 10-year old dial-up (I tested it four times during our week-long stay. The slowest I've experienced in years. Pitiful to say the least. If getting online is a priority, find another place or tether your 3G or 4G phone to your computer. It will be far faster than what the hotel provides.) - The property is pretty dated. We had a \"rear\" one-bedroom unit. The bedroom - in the back of the unit - was dark and dingy. Because it's next to the \"back\" walkway, you can hear everyone who walks by - no matter what time of day or night. - The television is a 25\" (or so) CRT TV (tube TV) of 1980s vintage. - The king bed was good, although somewhat hard. The bedding was fine. - The pool towels were ratty \"old\" bath towels being reused as pool towels, and so most guests grab two in order to get what one pool towel would normally do. - Our unit had a washer, dryer, full kitchen and everything worked just fine. - There are two pools - both are far too small for the number of rooms at this property. If lying around the pool or in the pool is in your plans, and if the property is busy, good luck getting a space in or even near the pool! Swimming won't be an option. Most other properties have two to three times the pool space as does the Aston. If you're planning on being out and about each day, then this shouldn't be a concern. - The beach is nice but there are no lounge chairs, chase lounges, umbrellas, or any furnishings of any kind on the beach. We saw guest lugging around chairs and lounges from the pool deck out to the beach, which looked like quite the hassle. Most other properties have all kinds of seating/lounging on the beach. Summary: If you're looking for a median-priced, clean, comfortable, family-oriented hotel, the Aston would be a great choice. If you're thinking Westin, Marriott, Hyatt - something more upscale (and more expensive) - you'll find the Aston a little disappointing primarily because the property is getting somewhat dated and it shows. You do need a car if you want to golf, shop places like Whaler's Village, or have more restaurant choices - even in the area. A grocery store, however, is right across the street - handy if you have a kitchen and want to prepare some (or all) of your meals. On a scale of one to five, five being as good as you can get, I'd rate the Aston a 2.5. It's clean, comfortable, is home to a great staff, the grounds are nice, and it's a few-minute drive to all that the Kaanapali area has to offer, which is a lot.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cWould return to the Shores!\u201d", "Author": "zacaramarketing", "ReviewID": "UR115050261", "Content": "We were here for a wedding/vacation for 8 nights and had a great time.

Everything was very clean and even though we didn't get an ocean view, we could still see the ocean from our room. After reading other hotel websites reviews, this hotel is definitely a good bang for your buck. There were a few drawbacks, but none that were too major. 1. First off, the place was crawling with kids...it's great if you want to bring your family because you can definitely save money with the kitchen, but the kids were a little annoying at times. There are 2 pools and they both were pretty busy. The garden pool was a little quieter, however, when the kids took over with rafts and pool toys, it got a little overwhelming. 2. The restaurant at the hotel was awful. We dined there numerous times and the service is bad (waiters are really slow), and the food is pretty average. The only plus to the restaurant was the happy hour which had mai tais for 4.50! 3. The beach is very narrow in this area of Kaanapali. The amount of space of sand was very short and it got really crowded near the hotel. you also couldn't take long beach walks because there were rocks that prevented you from going past a certain point on the beach. 4. If you don't get an ocean view room, the bedrooms are kind of noisy. The windows of the bedrooms share the wall with the hallway to the hotel so if people walk by at 6am, you hear every step they take and every word they say. With drawbacks aside, I thought this resort was a great deal and I'm happy I was able to experience it. I'm not sure if my husband and I were to come again that we would stay there since it was so family oriented, but if you are bringing your kids along, you should definitely consider this place.

Perfect location, perfect company, and perfect weather! I should have written a review sooner, but here we go! It doesn't matter if you are traveling with family or just a couple looking for a romantic get-a-way, Aston Kaanapali Shores has all you need and more. It's located on the far end of Kaanapali, adjacent to what I consider the most beautiful beach on Maui. The Beachclub restaurant serves breakfast, lunch and dinner and the food is very good. They have a day camp for kids that is perfect for allowing the parents a day of relaxation! The workout room is very nice and clean with upgraded equipment. You can enjoy a massage on property as well as a full service beauty salon. Across the street is a little shopping mall with a very large grocery store, a few little restaurants and more. It's a short stroll across the street! Wow! There are so many positives about this property I could go on for days. From the moment you arrive you will feel the Aloha the the friendly staff extends. It's obvious that management takes care of their employees and that the staff is genuinely happy! The rooms are very clean, spacious with all the amenities of home and the beds are super comfortable (that's coming from someone who is very picky about her bed!) Nice spacious lanais with breathtaking views of Molokai and Lanai in the distance. The beach is beatiful and snorkeling is amazing. It is also a great place for body boarding and surfing. If you are in to long early morning or sunset walks on the beach, it's a two minitue walk across a parking lot to Kaanapali's \"Airport Beach.\" Back when I lived in the area, the beach was overtaken by Kiawe trees that prohibited you from walking the full stretch of that beautiful beach. It has since been cleaned up and you can stroll on the beach or utilize the boardwalk. Be sure to wear your swim suit as the water is so gorgious you will want to jump in at some point. Oh, and bring your snorkel gear. There is lots of coral and fish on the north end and in the middle it sandy and you will most likely see some Manarays! Can you tell I love this place!

The beach itself is very short and there are some rocks in the water which was fine for us, but if you are looking for a large beach you should probably go further down.

We originally had a garden view room, realized it was facing a parking lot and immediately paid the extra for the upgrade to ocean view. The room we were then given had a breathtaking view and it made our whole trip. It isn't even that much more really, if you compare it to other hotels.

We've just booked another trip to Maui for the end of April. We thought about looking for a different place to stay, but just couldn't give up the Aston Kaanapali Shores. Getting a condo-style room allows us to save a ton of money as opposed to a regular hotel. The washer-dryer combo means we don't have to pack as much clothing, which makes a big difference in airline baggage fees. The full-service kitchen allows you the option of a home-cooked meal or just sandwiches and snacks, meaning you can save even more instead of eating out for every meal. The lanai was one of my favorite things about the Aston Kaanapali Shores, as I could lay out on it and read while hearing and smelling the ocean on the warm breezes. The room, bed, etc. were pretty standard. Nothing spectacular, but not a problem either. The only real negative we saw between the first and second stays was the beach. I remembered it being much nicer the first time we stayed. On the 2010 trip, it was rocky and kind of inhospitable compared to most of the beaches on Maui. The one bright spot about the beach was that we were able to do some whale watching from the pool on the spring trip. They also have activities for kids and a free Hawaiian show while we were there. Oh, the parking can also get expensive, but I believe that would be the same at any hotel. Overall, if you don't have a budget to worry about, I'm sure you can find some better options. But, if like most of us, you don't have an unlimited amount of money to spend, Aston Kaanapali Shores helps make a Maui vacation a bit more affordable.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "WI - A long drive/flight to everything", "Title": "\u201cGreat overall resort\u201d", "Author": "rocknut", "ReviewID": "UR103082063", "Content": "Beautiful grounds, koi pond and stream are unbelievable.

Very clean and beautiful room(2 bedroom,2 bath, ocean view 823) perfect view, Gorgeous updates granite,stainless steel,vessel sinks, stone tiled floor,flat screen tv's in all our rooms. We usually spend a lot on a hotel but we decided to go down one grade to have money for all the very expensive excursions we wanted to do. With 2 teens and one 11 year old, its all adult prices for almost everything. My daughter had stayed with friends before at the 5 star down the beach and said our room was just as nice as the other hotel, almost identical. Very beautiful grounds,clean,very friendly staff. Ate at restaurant for breakfast,(amazing bananas foster pacakes) and for lunch a couple of times. Great food everytime. Pools (2) were smallish but during our spring break they were surprisingly uncrowded. Always found 5 chairs next to each other. They do ask that you don't chair save, there is no need. They do let you take pool towels off the premisis to any tour. I hate sneaking towels and here you don't have to. Hotel shops sold almost everything you might need. Very pricy however. If you are fine paying $5 for a quart of milk its very convenient. We ended up shopping across the street for groceries, a very short walk. Small strip mall has a very good grocerie store-big and clean,normal prices. Same strip mall has a good pizza place-pizza paradiso-AWESOME super friendly guys in there, and another restaurant Java Jazz-crazy eclectic decor-dim romantic lighting, naked barbies hanging from everywhere, interesting original artwork and hundreds of polaroids cover the walls!! The kids were looking around like this is the weirdest place they have ever been in. Really friendly staff with great food. We went in this place often. Loved it!! Open earlier than anything (6:30)for coffee and breakfast--Amazing fresh Kona coffee. In same strip mall,Great nail salon, my 2 daughters and I one afternoon got mani/pedis-$40 combo price. The only negative with this hotel I can mention, but it is simply a personal preference, is the beach. My teenagers would rather be in the ocean, out in the waves. The beach directly in front of the hotel is splattered with lava rocks. ranging in size from 12 inches long to massive boulders every 10 feet or so. You just can't boogie board or swim deep very safely. Younger kids were having fun and even playing with the rocks moving them around. We decided to go a little further down the beach in front of the other hotel where things are less rocky. We took the surfing lessons there and had a great time. We all stood up the first time! We also did the free SCUBA in the pool instruction(available everyday starting at 9:30) and then liked it so much, did the one hour ocean dive after. $70 per person but worth it. The kids did this 2 days in a row (not just for adults- my 10 year old who is a very good competitive swimmer was allowed to participate) they all loved it , fish and tons of TURTLES. Amazing photos taken by the instructor available to buy $40 on CD after your dive. We went down the beach, too long to walk,4 minute car ride, to whalers village. Really nice shopping area. Upscale(Louis Vuitton, mixed with lots of food choices and fun t-shirt and souv shops. ) Went there often. One day we just went to Whalers area in the morning and went to the beach there. Now THIS is the gorgeous beach we were hoping for. Big, clean all sand no rocks, big waves. The kids had a blast. Bought sandwiches and ate lunch on the beach. Spent lots in the shops. Very beautiful 5 star hotels here. Maui Westin and Ka'anapali Alli. Would recommend those 2 hotels for the beach and grounds. We also did the Westin's Polynesian Luau. There are so many luaus to choose from. This one was one of the more expensive ones. I liked the family style table service this one offered. I just didn't feel like the massive buffet line of the other luaus. Pricing for this one for age 12 and over includes all alcohol. It would have been nice to have a kids price ages 12-20. Also right on the beach with the beautiful sunset. We did the premium seating which was front row. I think it was worth it. So many other tables were very far back. Not sure what kind of view they had. Good food. good show. It got breezy and a bit chilly through the evening(bring a sweater) Overall had an amazing vacation. The kids loved it. The area is not cheap. I don't think you can do Maui on a budget really if you have older kids, want to do all kinds of sporty adventures and eat out most days I Would, however,highly recommend this hotel and area of Maui to any family.

The reception areas of the hotel were very nice but i was a little disappointed with the corridors which accessed rooms and shops. They were in need of a little TLC but it certainly didnt taint my opinion of the hotel. In general the hotel was very clean. Whilst i thought the gardens were very nice i didnt quite appreciate in the photos before i booked just how many balconys would be over looking it. Not a great hotel if you like a little privacy. We ate in the restaurant once and the food was fine but the happy hour cocktails were definately a winner. The 2 pools are relatively small but the children still loved them. Our room - 606 - one bed, was a great size with a big enough kitchen. Our king size bed was very comfortable and the children had aqueen size sofa bed in the lounge which was also very comfortable. The balcony was a great size. The hotels rooms are at an angle to the sea so part of our view was the staggered room infront and then the sea. If completely uninterupted views are what you like then this possibly is not the hotel for you. We chose this hotel because of the reviews on trip advisor and i feel that they were 100% spot on. Kaananapoli is a very busy resort with lots of big hotels on the sea front. The hotel is situated about a 30 min walk along the beach to the main shoppiing area. Lahaina is a lovely twon, 10 min drive away, and well worth a visit. It has a quaint feel to it with lots of great arty shops to browse among. If you are going to Maui to see the whales then you only have to open your curtains (with sea view) to see them. There are said to be 6,000 in the waters between Dec and April and we saw loads. We also took a boat trip to snorkel in an extinct volcano crater (Molokini) and we swam with sea turtles. If you are prepared to to a time share presentation (2 hours of hard sell) then you can make a good saving in trips. All along Lahaina strip shops are selling trips at a great discount. Make sure you know what you are lettiing yourself in for - we saved about $300 by doing this. We hired GyPSy sat nav from Steve in Lahaina for our road trip to Hana. It was like having our own tour guide in the car along with history and stories of where we were going. It also told you the best things to see and where to park. Fantastic. We also took the helicopter trip around the island. Sadly it was too cloudy to see the volcano (book early in day as clouds come in more as day goes on) so we ended up vising neighbouring islands. An amazing trip but next time would leave my 5 year old behind as she fell asleep for half of it. Be prepared to spend a lot of money in Maui as it is not cheap.

First impression is an attractive mid-range hotel, nicely landscaped, about 10 stories. All the rooms are actually privately owned condos from what I gathered, which the hotel manages and rents out. We did not notice a large difference in the furnishings or decor of the rooms we saw. We stayed in room 636, which is in the rear wing. We looked out over parking lots and trees to the neighboring condo bldgs, which were lower in height so there was a small glimpse of the next island. Definitely not an 'ocean view' room, but at least a very green view. It was spacious enough for 2 - entry hall, with bathroom to the right with an outer sink and then door to tub/toilet room; then kitchen on right with lots of counter space, cabinets, full fridge; kitchen open to rest of room which had a bed right next to the kitchen counter, facing a couch, TV hutch, and the balcony. We did not notice much noise except for the birds and occasional car noise, and were able to keep our balcony door open all night for fresh air and breezes. I did wear ear plugs as I'm a very light sleeper, but I usually do when traveling anywhere. My partner did not and slept fine. Two friends stayed in 909, a 1 bedroom, which faced in towards the open garden/pool area of the hotel and had awesome views of the ocean and the whales that were very active during our trip. 909 had a large living room, kitchen, and balcony. Nice room. Unfortunately, our two other friends had a very bad experience with their rooms. Both got non-kitchen rooms on the lowest 2 floors. They had only 1 small window which opened just a few inches, and air conditioners that were mounted INTO the room, so the noise from the units was loud all night. They had no fridges, and the hotel did a terrible job helping them with this. One of them asked to at least have ice (there was an ice bucket in the room) but the hotel has NO ice machines! Finally after one friend went to the housekeeping office and asked for ice, a housekeeper took them to a recently vacated room (apparently still a mess with stuff everywhere) and let them get some ice from that room's freezer. Both friends said they felt like they were in basement rooms; one described it as a 'dungeon'. Other than that, I would rate the service as variable - the lady who checked us in was not friendly, but the gentlemen who checked us out was exceedingly nice. We did not use any other facilities or the restaurants. Parking in the hotel parking garage is $9/day. The beach is steep and narrow in front of the hotel, not that great for swimming - see my other reviews for better beaches. We also did two boat trips (whale watching out of Lahina and snorkling out of Kihei) and I will review those, as well as the different towns we visited - Lahaina, Kihei, Pa'ia. Overall, it is a nice hotel, comfortable, but make sure you get an upper room for a view. Kitchen-equipped rooms are nicer from what we saw. This area is a 'hotel zone' with hotel after hotel for miles along the coast, so if you want to see more local areas of Maui plan to drive somewhere else.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent First Impression\u201d", "Author": "momtravelswith3", "ReviewID": "UR98292183", "Content": "This property offers a very good first impression as soon as you drive in the driveway. It has a very welcoming lobby area and beautiful landscaping throughout the property. It has a real tropical resort feel. Check-in was friendly and they even have a TV over the check-in desk with your name on it welcoming you to the resort. The front desk here is operational 24 hours. There is a free Polynesian Show by the pool once per week with fruit punch. This resort is very family friendly, an active resort, still serene, but can feel very comfortable here with kids. I had a gardenview (partial oceanview too) 1 bedroom condo. I was very happy and satisfied with my condo, it had been updated recently with new counters, appliances all appeared brand new and furniture was very pleasing. Kitchen was fully equipped with dishes, soap and diswasher. My room also had a washer and dryer. A Condo is a tough thing to specifically comment on in Maui, as Aston manages the property but most of the units are individually owned and it really depends on the owners and what they have done to keep the unit up. Some are very updated and some are not. I suppose the one good thing about booking with Aston directly is that if you receive a room you are unhappy with you can ask to change to another, but we were lucky and were thrilled with our unit. The Lanai was spacious with a table and 2 chairs and a lay down lawnchair. Having coffee and breakfast on the Lanai each morning was a highlite of our trip. There is a $9 per night parking fee. Fee for safe was $1.50 ish / night. In room high speed is FREE, I found it quite good except early morning when I am guessing a lot of people were checking email and overloading the server. No bother, I just waited a bit and tried again. Expedia is onsite to book tours and offers new arriving guests a free presentation with a nice continental breakfast on their first morning. I enjoyed this being my first time to Maui it was quite informative and not pushy in any way. There are two pools each with a hot tub. The garden pool is really pretty and quite shallow, but not heated. Close by there is a large open grass space with lots of sun loungers to enjoy the outdoors. The ocean pool is deeper and is heated, which my 9 year old very much appreciated! By the oceanpool is a bar and the restaurant. Did not eat in the restaurant, but checked the menu and it looked appealing and reasonably priced. Drinks were overpriced at the bar $7.50 for a very small cocktail. I did not see any BBQ's at this property. The beach in front of the resort is fairly narrow and rocky, a short stroll south gets a better beach. It is too far up to walk to Blackrock or Whalers. There are tennis courts that looked very nice, quite possibly recently resurfaced. Across the street, easy walk, there is a grocery store, pizza and Mexican Restaurant. I really enjoyed my stay at this resort. It is a little farther north on Kaanapali Beach than I would have liked, but I would still stay here in the future as I loved the property and all of the extra amenities.", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Astoria, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cSpectacular location!\u201d", "Author": "Nade70", "ReviewID": "UR98150365", "Content": "This is our second visit to Kaanapali Shores and I can say the location can't be beat.

I would say our experience with booking through Costco was better, it afforded us with daily maid service, the private owner did not without additional cost. There are two pools, we only used the one next to the beach, small, but did the job. As stated, the location really can't be beat. From the pool area, you can see the ocean, and if lucky enough, the whales passing by! You can lay on the beach, walk, run, swim and boogie board all within a few minutes from your unit. I would recommend requesting an updated unit whether searching from a private owner or a company. The units have fully equiped kitchens, washer/dryer, wi-fi, and balcony's. There is a grocery store right across the street and down the street a market with organic foods, a great coffee company \"Kick A**\" coffee and a place to rent your snorkel/boogie boards.....also a park right across the street on the water. Great location for your morning walk/run. The staff at the resort are pleasant and always ready to assist you with your needs. We brought our children ages 18 and 10, they both had a blast and were able to enjoy the ammenities the hotel had to offer. My only complaint is that they charge you a daily user fee for the fitness room, I think 10 dollars per day or some deal you can do for a full week.

There are 2 stores on the property that sell everything from snorkel gear to refrigerated foods. The only criticism we had was the food at the on-site restaurant wasn't good.

I would suggest booking a snorkel trip to Molokini from the Expedia concierge located at the hotel by the pool.

We trusted his opinion, so we booked Aston Kaanapali Shores for our visit. We had such an amazing time we decided to find a way to return in 2010. From all this, I am in a position not simply to report on how wonderful Aston Kaanapali Shores is, but that the comfort, kindness from their staff, facilities, pools, cleanliness, hospitality, views, and so much more, is consistent. From the moment you arrive and see the beautiful facade, you know you are in for a treat. When you go to the front desk and are treated in such a special way, you immediately begin to understand what aloha really means. Once you walk into your accommodations, you know you are in for a comfortable stay. As you make your way through the lobby and into the gardens, you sincerely get blown away by the wow factor. There are many extra touches as well that I can't imagine you would find anyplace else. For example, every evening at sunset, many of the guests meet outside by the beach to share in the breathtaking site of the sun setting in one of the most beautiful environmentss the world has to offer. The experience is not unlike when all the angels meet for sunset in the movie, \"City of Angels.\" And to capture that perfect moment, Security Guard Michael is usually close by to photograph the experience with your camera so you can remember the experience for a lifetime.

I used to think ocean view would mean uninterrupted view of the ocean, but was told by the front desk that at AKS, ocean-view meant you would be facing the ocean but the view would also include some buildings and trees. But this didn't turn out that bad because the beach is 5 min walk and so, one can basically access the beach easily enough. 3) Good clean restaurant serving quality food ... and it wasn't that expensive either. And the restaurants don't charge for kids. 4) Staff were generally helpful and especially the expedia guides that help you get tickets for the luaus etc. 5) Not far from FRONT STREET ... that little shopping area is amazing. Lots of restaurants and shops ... felt like Europe. 6) For people with kids, there is a big grocery store across the road from the complex ... very handy. 7) Beautiful tropical garden they created in the middle of the complex. Some of the downsides are: 1) Beach not very impressive. Don't get me wrong ... it is very nice but lacks a few features. For one, it is rocky, so going into the water is not easy. Secondly, there are not a lot of cabanas and ones available are also a little expensive to rent. 2) Small pools - they have 2. On the whole, it was a pretty decent resort.

Front desk service was good when we checked in or when we had questions. Plase was pretty clean. Small resort but had what's needed. The 2 pools aren't very big but it wasn't busy at all during Septemer and pretty much had access to it at all times if we wanted. Though, I have to admit we spent most of our time beach hopping and checking out the island than at the place. Fitness centre was decent. Internet would cut out now and then so if you're going for business, probably not good for you. Sleep accomadations were decent. Room was garden facing but that refers to the balcony off the living room area, not the bedroom. The window in there was more a sky window you can't see out of and since that faced the front of the hotel and beside the resort next door, it was noisy at times but bareable. Again, we weren't planning on spending much time there. Beach small but since majority of the beaches on Maui are public access, we were planning on checking out the other beaches anyways. Kitchen was adequate with everything you need. Grocery store conveniently across the street. We intentially picked a condo resort not only because it's cheaper but so we can make our own breakfasts and pack lunch/snacks to bring on the road when needed. Microwave above the stove didn't work, including the vent/fan for the stove. They did provide a 2nd microwave though. Washing machine leaked once with soap suds and all but we didn't even use it. Must have been a leak in the pipe from one of the suites either above or below us. Called it in and took several hours for them to come but was done by the time we left and came back after dinner. Resturant onsite was convenient but service was REALLY slow so don't go if you're in a rush. Overall, a decent place with good value for the price you pay, clean and comfortable.

We ate in the restaurant a few times and the food was good (coconut coleslaw!) The pools were very clean and always lots of lounge chairs available, but there was not much shade. Grocery store right across the street and Farmers Market on M/W/F mornings just down the road made it easy to eat in the room with our 2 year old. The beach is a little small, but that was fine for us. It was easy for our 2 year old to walk to water to splash in the waves.

Maui Grill at Whalers Village and Bubba Gump Shrimp Co in Lahaina are both very family friendly (lots of strollers and toddlers) and have good food.

Our first visit was in April 2008, the door to my bedroom would not close. We phoned the front desk to get it repaired but no one ever came to fix it. We had an ocean view and it was great because we were able to see the whales. The second year we stayed there was in September 09 and the room we were assigned again had an ocean view which was spectacular. Only real problem was that the room we stayed in must have been converted to a two bedroom and the door locked automatically from the inside which made it difficult since we both didn't go to bed at the same time. The second bedroom the windows didn't open and it was always hot in there. This year we went in September and we were really disappointed. Our flight arrived earlier than we had expected so we picked up our rental car and a few groceries. By the time we got to the resort it was after noon and we had to wait to have our room cleaned supposedly. When we got into the room there was still hair from the previous tenants on the bathroom floor. The carpet was filthy and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a long time, the sliding glass door didn't close completely, one of the pillows to the chairs had a rip in the side of it. Housekeeping started coming in at 9 o'clock while we were still there. Later on in the week they would come later and they did a poor job of cleaning. All they pretty much did was replace our towels and throw out the trash and make the beds. They left sand on the floor and hair was left on the floors and in the tub. It was disgusting. Next year we will be staying somewhere else. Other than that they have great accommodations although I wouldn't recommend the restaurant unless you're too tired and don't want to go somehwere else to eat. Although there's a great pizza place across the street that we would highly recommend Pizza Paradiso, otherwise make arrangements to cook your own food or eat somewhere else.

The only thing about the room I would complain about is the carpet...it was in desperate need of a deep steam clean, but other than that, it was great! Hotel location is pretty decent for most of the happening places on West Maui. The beach off the resort was \"okay\"...but we didn't even spend any time on it. The waves were a little too rough for our taste and there were some rocks and things in the sand.

You have to pay to park at the hotel. You have to pay to use the fitness center. You have to pay to use tennis rackets. The beach at the resort is terrible once you get into the water. The beach is LOADED with rocks. These rocks hurt your feet! It is REALLY bad. The hotels to the left and right of you are the same way. The pool was ok, it could have been a little warmer. My dryer in my room broke and took two days to fix. The toliet clogged twice and the first response time was 40 plus minutes and the second time they came in about 20 minutes. The internet was very slow and shut down a few times during my stay. The water was turned off for 90 minutes while I was there. This happened right in the middle of my childs shower, so I had to use our drinking water to rinse her off. The hotel staff ergency was not there. The bellman were slow bringing your luggage to the room. Once I got back home, I was offered a big one night free stay at their resort(s)! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!? I live in the midwest. I'm gonna fly all the way to Maui and stay there for one night?!?!??! NOT WORTH MY TIME!

It is a great property, casual enough for families with small kids, but with enough amenities to feel like you are getting the full resort experience. Our room (2bed, 2bath condo, 9th floor, full ocean view) was slightly worn, but the view was so amazing, it didn't matter at all. My hubby and I travelled with our two kids (1 and 4) and my mother-in-law. What we loved best: --the grounds: beautiful! Definitely has the \"old Hawaii\" feel. --the pools...two of them, one just steps from the beach --the restaurant (the fact that there was one, the food was so-so) --the people (the staff was sooo nice. On our final day the security guard saw us attempting to take family photos and offered to take them. What we didn't like: --can't think of anything... Recommendations: --walk to the Ka'anapali Beach Club next door. Their restaurant is fun (live music) and the food is very good. If you have toddlers, they also might like a ride up the glass elevator. --If you decide to do the \"Sugar Cane Train\" maybe have one parent take the kids and the other parent can have some relaxation by the pool. It is a fun train ride, but the scenery is nothing special (it runs parallel to the road). --go to the park that is on Ka'anapli Beach and next to the Westin Villas. There is free parking and the beach is awesome. There's restrooms and a grassy area, also some shady spots on the beach. --in Lahaina, Bubba Gump's (i know very touristy) is fun for kids and the service was excellent and the food was very good ...better than the other places we dined on Front Street. --for souveniers...hit an ABC store. Prices are competitive and the quality seemed better than Hilo Hatties.... --try the fruit sorbets on sale at the restaurant at the resort. We enjoyed them as our almost-daily snack. --don't miss the hula show by the pool at the resort on Wednesday evenings. A free show! Beats paying $100 for a luau (in my opinion). --Safety. Always felt safe at this resort. If I had teens and pre-teens, I would have let them run free on the resort grounds. Overall, a great resort.

Here's the good, bad and ugly of our opinion: GOOD: Staff was incredibly friendly. We always had our questions answered and even the friendly servers in the on-site restaurant helped us with tips on tours and such. The pools are great. There are two. One is chlorinated and the other salt water. The salt has a great view of the beach and is deeper. The \"garden pool\" is shallower and perfect for small children and parents. The atmosphere is wonderful in the garden area as well. There are small stores on site, but a short drive toward Lahaina and you'll find a Safeway if you're looking for food and other needs. BAD: They are currently doing renovations, but even some of the \"renovated\" rooms need some work. We don't expect anything but a clean, well-kept room... frills aren't necessary, but we were disappointed in the limited housekeeping tasks each day (made bed and took out trash, new towels in b'room). Vacuuming seemed to be on the \"extra\" list. And having a toddler who loves Cheerios called for vacuuming daily. We didn't get replenished coffee packets so we could have coffee each morning, just the first day. And surfaces were not wiped down. During the day, we had to nap with our toddler and heard no ocean waves... just the pounding and sawing of the renovations, also the condo next door had interesting people in the middle of the night making noise. Advice: get an ocean view room no matter the cost. UGLY: The bathtub. They said they recently put skid mats down on all the tubs during renovation, but one of the corners wasn't sticking and I saw what was underneath. Ugh. Needless to say, we showered with our little one the entire week. I wouldn't put her bottom on the tub floor. They claimed it was glue, but I know of no black glue out there. It looked like mildew. I put in a service call and never got a response other than an explanation. No one came to fix it. I have to say the vacuuming goes in the ugly category as well. And PLEASE vacuum UNDER the bed as well. Another ugly. It is definitely basic and a money saver, but Maui does nickel and dime you with fees and such here and there at the hotel and about town. We probably won't return to this particular location, but it wasn't a totally negative experience at all. Great beaches, snorkeling and activities and the people are very friendly.

We had 25 people--ages 3-84--spread out in 8 units, so we got a real feel for the facilities. My folks had the Aloha suite, and we all ate in it 5 nights (paper plates and sharing utensils, chairs and such.) One night, we even had a party with a hula dancer and a singer requested by my stepfather and the space was worked really well. (Henry Allen did the old Hawaiian songs like Beyond the Reef and Tiny Bubbles--message me if you want the reference). Several of us had rooms right next to the Aloha suite, so we kept our doors propped and wandered from room to room as needed. Pros: Perfect location for our group. Close distance to great snorkling (Black Rock south and Napili Bay and Honolua Bay north) and boogie boarding (Fleming Beach). 2 hotels down started the great beach path for the runners and walkers. Nice to have a good beach out the door for families. Great to have reasonable (by Hawaii standards) grocery store across the street, along with Snorkle Bobs, video store, etc. Close to Kaanapali for the luau, shopping etc and 10 min from Lahaina. Facilities: Three year old loved the pool. Older kids spent more time on the beach. 18 year old hung out in the hot tub every night with other college age kids. Parents loved the happy hour. Everyone enjoyed the onsite hula show on Wed evenings. Great views from the condos. All of us used the washer dryer units. Service was friendly and helpful. Big enough so there was something for all of us, but small enough so we could let the older kids and teens wander without worrying. Cons: Yes, the hall carpets are stained, the internet is slow and you can't always get a beach chair. We would lie on our towels or go in the water and soon one would open up. The Aloha spirit is the most important factor of a Hawaiian vacation---so don't forget to catch that after you arrive or you have missed the best value on Maui. :)", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay, excellent service, great value.....will be back for sure.\u201d", "Author": "purse-n-pass", "ReviewID": "UR73988241", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Aston Kaanapali Shores and had a wonderful time.

Most of the units were recently renovated, however the hallways still had the same old stained carpet that had been there for years. Our unit was pretty worn out and way overdue for a remodel, but it did have a great view over the pool and of the ocean. We chose it because it was close to $100 less per night than renting direct for a similar view. There were other units rented direct throught the owner that looked very nice. The main pool was quite small. Most days, however, it didn't seem overcrowded. The beach was nice and sandy, but at high tide it got a bit small. The beach in front of the resort nexxt door was much larger. This resort was overall great for kids. There is a decent place to snorkel right from the resort if you don't want to drive somewhere to find snorkeling, also in front of the resort next door.

We thought the one bedroom would be adequate when we booked, because we weren't sure about the friend coming. When we arrived for check-in, we asked for an upgrade (we were willing to pay for it) and were told no upgrades were available until the following week. We then were given a first-floor room. I asked if there wasn't another room available on a higher floor because I was worried about privacy and bugs getting in the room. I was told to come to the front desk in the morning. That made no sense to me. So we get to the room fully intending to call in the morning for a different room. We had room 110, which is on the side facing the other resort. Opening our lanai door, we were about 100 yards away from the ocean and had a beautiful view so decided to make due. The kids gave up on the sofa bed because they could feel every spring. We called in for a roll-away and it was a little better. They opted to sleep on the couch most nights. On the other hand, the bed in our bedroom was very comfortable. When we first got in the room, the toilet started overflowing. We called the desk and they sent a security guard with a plunger and he waited outside while I plunged the toilet. I thought they should have done this for us. We have stayed here once before. Last time, maid service was much better. This time they were in and out in less than five minutes and came very late in the afternoon except on the last day when they came in and threw out all the rest of our food before we even checked out. This was about 11:00 and check-out is at 12:00. My husband was out BBQing lunch. They didn't sweep our floors very well if at all, so there was sand everywhere. They would leave us 2 towels every day, so I had to call for more towels every day. They won't throw the dishes in the dishwasher either, which surprised me. When we first got in the room, the dishwasher had been run, but all the clean dishes were still in the dishwasher for us to put away someone else's dishes. The condos do have dishes and silverware, but not very many pots and pans and very few cooking utensils. With the five of us we cooked a lot so it was inconvenient. We used the BBQ grills over by the tennis courts. They are pretty far away. It was nicely set up though. The grills were small but there were 3 of them. We stayed at other resorts where their BBQ areas were in beautiful locations. This is back behind the parking structure. They have so many grass areas it would be nice to have the grills out there. My guess is they don't want to take business away from the restaurant. Speaking of the restaurant, we have eaten here several times before so were looking forward to it for a meal or two. We ate breakfast there one day and husband ordered buffalo wings at the pool and it was just alright. Didn't find it necessary to eat there again. Their drinks are way overpriced. I highly recommend that you do the free scuba class that Mike Drazkowski has at the pool every day at 10:00. This allows you to do a resort dive with him. We dove with him for about $80 a person for about a 45 minute dive. He is an awesome guy and really took care of us. He has a really cool camera that takes amazing pictures that he puts on CD for you and brings back the next morning. I can't remember how much it was for the pics. I believe it was $40 but worth it. We didn't rent one, but the cabanas by the pool and beach are only $20 per day. They have a snowcone machine by the bar so when I went to buy a drink, I saw it and made one. They about came unglued. I apologized, but there was no sign saying not to use it. Would I stay here again? It was adequate and reasonably priced with the kids, would have been much better in a 2 bedroom.

In short, you will not find a better value anywhere on the Ka'anapli/Napili coast. We booked a two bedroom unit (413) and it was beautifully updated with new bathrooms, new appliances and granite counter tops. All of the one and two bedroom units here are complete with in suite washer/dryer which means you can pack light. Our family of four has no trouble doing a two week holiday with 3 medium bags. The kids love having their own room, and the two bedroom units have two twin beds in the second room which is important for our kids. The free internet could be faster, but hey you are in Hawaii, get out of the room and enjoy paradise, you can surf the internet at home, in Hawaii you can surf for real! We normally book a garden view room, the garden here is a lovely collection of native plants and palm trees that attract native birds that \"sing\" every night at sunset. My children are 9 and 11 and they love the garden pool which is more for the little kids but they also felt comfortable in the large pool by the ocean. The grounds of the complex are beautiful and are perfectly manicured. The beach club restaurant (on site) has amazing and reasonable breakfasts for the days when you are just want to relax and just have someone cook for you... The bacon cheeseburgers are some of the best I have had anywhere. (hint Hawaiian beef is local, free range, and really good) The beach at this part of Ka'anapli (the northern end) is rather narrow and at high tide is all but gone. But this is not a problem, you can actually walk to Black Rock (its a long way but the kids and I did it) or you can drive for 5 minutes to one of literally dozens of perfect beaches: Napili, Kapalua, DT Fleming, and \"A\" Beach are some of our favorites. This complex is in the heart of everything, you are across the street from shops, restaurants and a supermarket, It is a 5 minute drive North to comfort food and the arts and crafts fare in Napili and a 5 minute drive south to the fancy shops and fine dinning in Whalers Village.

A few things I was unable to find out that I would like to point out for others. LOCATION: This hotel is North of Black Rock and the Whalers Village. I called the hotel, but all they kept telling me is they were a part of Kaanapali beaches. You cannot walk to Whalers Village Shopping area. You can drive there in about 5 min though for the great beaches, food, and shopping. BEACHES: The beach at the hotel is beautiful & sandy, HOWEVER once in the water, it is very rocky. You need aqua socks and they conveniently sell them at the hotel store. The beach is two hotels long. Plenty of room for family and snorkeling. THE HOTEL: The hotel does have a nice little kitchen; however, it did not have all of the cooking utensils needed, but enough to get by. There is a grocery store across the street you can walk to with reasonably cheap prices so you can cook meals in the kitchen, much easier than stocking up at Costco/Walmart near the airport. The hotel restaurant is open until 9:00PM and you can call \"to-go\" orders and the prices are great! Also they have really good food. We were able to get a crib within 5 minutes of checking in for our baby at no-charge! HOTEL SERVICE: The maid service out-right sucks as you have read in other reviews. But if you stay on them, you can get towels and soap daily from a reminder phone call. (I made 4 calls in 7 nights there). Very Friendly, just not quite on top of things. The hotel personnel are very friendly! They did have construction in the room above us that started at 8AM every morning so no sleeping-in. They do have a fitness center at $10/day or $40/week. Parking was $9.00/day as well. SWIMMING POOLS: The pools were great; there are two, and plenty of towels and sunshine.

Picked up a couple of door dings on the rental car. Had to climb in/out the passenger side a few times. Wireless service is horrible. I don't think they are aware of how many people travel with computers these days. ShakaNet, their provider, has all their routers set to channels 1 or 6, which is wrong. There are 11 channels, why not use them all or distribute them for non-interfering 1, 6, and 11? The place is showing its age. Many areas could use a good power washing.

Only staff can use the baggage cart. Either pay them or haul luggage yourself. Other resorts have plenty of baggage carts for guest use. Carpeting in room was stained and dirty.

This was our sixth visit to Maui, and our fourth stay at AKS, going back some 27 years to 1983. I was pleasantly surprised to find that AKS is currently in the best condition I have ever seen it. I had reserved a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deluxe Ocean View\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd two-bedroom condo via the Internet on the AKS website for $254 per night plus tax. When we arrived, the desk clerk was very nice, and asked if we would be interested in upgrading to an ocean front two bedroom suite for an additional $150 per nigh plus tax. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to spend the extra money, but decided to look at both rooms and then decide. Our original assigned room was # 723. It was a nice room that had been remodeled fairly recently, and had a decent sized balcony (aka lanai in Hawaii) with a nice view of the ocean, as well as about 100 yards of hotel grounds in between the room and the beach. We were told that the room was 1235 square feet in size. We decided to just look at the other room, although those dollar signs were flashing in my eyes big-time. Well, all it took was a glimpse of the ocean front room (Room 501) to convince us that it was worth the extra $150 per night (plus tax, of course). It was a beautiful 2005 square foot suite with granite counter-tops in the full kitchen, a big living room, two full baths, a great master bedroom opening onto the balcony, and a good sized second bedroom. Both bedrooms had king-size beds, and I assume that the sofa in the living room was a convertible, although we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need it. When we took a look at the view and the huge lanai, we were sold. The unit is a corner unit on the southwest corner of the building with a huge wrap-around balcony that is probably 200 - 250 square feet by itself. The unobstructed view began at due north, and swept around the entire 180 degree beachfront to the west, over the pool area to the south, and over the rest of the AKS grounds, ending at the lush green mountains to the east. Around 5 PM almost every evening, we watched a rainbow form in front of the mountains to the east, and then turned west to watch a beautiful Maui sunset as the big orange ball set over Lanai. ASK has two buildings. One building, the much smaller of the two, which is south of the larger building, has two ocean front rooms per floor (ending in 61) along with seven other rooms per floor. I believe it has five floors. Those two ocean front rooms are 1233 square feet each. We were in the larger building (9 floors). There are two ocean front rooms per floor (designated by the floor number followed by 01 and 02), and approximately 50 other rooms per floor. Rooms designated -02 have views to the north and west, and the rooms designated -01 are to the south and west. Those two ocean front rooms are called the Aloha Suites on every floor, I believe. I personally think the -01 rooms have the better view over the -02 rooms. Both have better views than the ocean front rooms in the smaller building. Our final cost per night for the room including all taxes and the $9.00 daily parking fee was $463.17 per night. Obviously that is quite steep, but it was for a two bedroom apartment, and by Hawaii standards, it really wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t terribly high. Plus, we received a $125 \u00e2\u20ac\u015350 plus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd credit against our mai-tai bill for being old! Unfortunately, the bar bill was considerably larger.... The food in the Beach Club restaurant is OK, but nothing to write home about. The bartender makes great mai-tais, and happy hour is from 3:30 to 5:30PM I think. The pool is big enough , and there are ample chairs for guests to expose their bodies to the ever-present UV rays. There are a number of Mynah birds that think they own the place, as well as any food you might be munching on, and on occasion, they might choose to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drop-in\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on you while you dine or sunbathe. Unfortunately, that seems to be the case no matter where you go in Hawaii nowadays. Finally, if you book a room at AKS, be sure to request a recently remodeled/upgraded room, as there are apparently some rooms there that have not been remodeled for many years.", "Date": "June 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salem, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cAmazing, exceeded our expectations!\u201d", "Author": "grandmapooh53", "ReviewID": "UR69089726", "Content": "We just spent our 16th wedding anniversary at Aston Kaanapali Shores.

Maybe it was the time of year?? It seemed just right for us and is a lot nicer than other areas on Maui. We preferred this beach over Kapulua (Ritz Carlton beach).

Its a beautiful walk along the beach and you can have dinner under straw cabanas w/ lit tiki torces. We made it down there a couple of times.

Even though we had paid for our room upfront, my husband put his card down, however as he was directed by me before we left Australia to let Westpac know we would be travelling overseas he did not, result, card blocked, which was very annoying as the front desk rang about 10 times to get another card no, this was ontop of Hertz wanting a $200 credit card hold, so all foreigners travelling to Hawaii, have some cash up your sleeve, so you are not embarrased the way we were. I tried to put the Hertz $200 onto my ANZ visa, but because it was still in my maiden name and I had no photo ID for that card, turned out to be a huge problem, especially when you are sleep deprived after 20 hours on the go.

Overall, we were very pleased with our stay. If you tell them its your honeymoon, they're likely to send you up a free bottle of champagne.

I would definitely recommend staying in West Maui if its your first trip to Maui, that seems to be the most happening part of Maui and is close to anything you need. We stopped at Walmart near the airport after we arrived for the week to save money on food expenses. There is also a grocery store across the street that you can walk to. The beach there is not one you would want to spend much time on, other than to catch a nice sunset at the end of the day. However, there are TONS of great beaches in Maui, and plenty within a reasonable driving distance of this condo. Downtown Lahaina is about a 10 minute drive, and definitely worth a visit. Don't forget they DO charge for parking.. I think it was about $9/day. I think that's common though among most hotels. We also stayed one night in Hana during our tour of Hana Highway. We stayed at Joe's place for $50. Its definitely not luxurious, but a place to sleep if you're looking to save money. Hotel Hana is super expensive. We did splurge on a convertible rental car, though, which I would highly recommend to anyone as you are going to be doing so much driving and the scenery is just beautiful and its so much nicer with the top down. I would HIGHLY recommend anyone vacationing in Maui to get a travel book because there are so many beautiful sights and places to go that you should definitely plan your trip ahead of time to make sure you fit in everything most important to you.

The garden pool was great because one of us could swim in the pool and the other could kick around a ball with my 2 yr old and still be close to each other. Staff was very friendly - especially Mike, the security guard who took some AMAZING family pictures for us on our camera. CONS: The beach on the other hand was disappointing. VERY narrow and rocky. If you walk a bit to the left, you will find a bigger beach, but still VERY small, quiet, and quite frankly BORING. The \"boardwalk\" along the beach that takes you to Whalers Village (shopping center) doesn't begin at this hotel, so you have to drive there. Also, on Tuesday night the restaurant/bar by the pool closed at 8:30pm!!!! Overall, my husband and I (who are both 30 years old) found Maui to be really BORING. We have been to Waikiki twice before and both choose it over Maui any day. Oahu has everything that Maui has (beautiful beaches, snorkeling, tourist attractions, luaus, etc etc) AND it doesnt completely shut down after 9:00pm, which is what we found all over Maui - (while in Maui last week, we stayed in Lahaina, Kaanapali, Kihei and Kapalua). Yes, Oahu is busier, but if you like that sort of thing, like we do, then Oahu is the place for you.... oh and we were the youngest people (besides some small children) that we saw at the hotel. Everyone was very old - no offence. Yes- I would recommend this hotel to a friend if they wanted to go to Maui.

It was our second time at this resort; the first time was in 2007 for our 20th anniversary. At check in-we upgraded from a garden view room to an ocean view for about $300. It was well worth the price. We had a great view from the 7th floor of the ocean, beach, and pool from every room in the condo-including the kitchen. The staff went out of their way to be friendly and courteous. The security guard even offered to take our picture together numerous times throughout our stay-it is nice to have pictures of us together. The pools and grounds were beautiful and well kept. At night they light the tiki torches which make the grounds beautiful. The sunsets on the beach in front of the pool area can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beat. They have happy hour at the restaurant by the pool from 3-5 with $4-$5 drink specials, which was nice. The hotel next door, Kaanapali Beach Club, has a great happy hour from 5-7 which is a quick 1-minute walk on the beach or walkway. We did this numerous times. They have built a walkway that begins at the Hanoa Kai resort (about 3 hotels away) that goes all the way to Whalers Village and beyond. We walked every morning from our resort to Whalers Village which was about 5 \u00c2\u00bd miles total. What a beautiful walk! The only negative that I can think of is that the beach in front of the resort has disappeared! Three years ago, the beach was about 40 feet wide and we sat on the lounge chairs every evening to watch the sunset and drink mai-tai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. This time, there was only about 4 feet of beach. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure what has caused this. All in all, this is a great resort and feels like home within a couple of days.

It was good but the waiter seemed to be a little annoyed that we only ordered an appetizer to share. It was late and we just needed a snack before bedtime. Maybe he was just having a bad day!!

We were looking for something that would be beach friendly for the kids. The hotel is situated right on the beach, and the views are incredible. The lobby area is very pretty, and the staff were very nice. We had a \"garden view\" one-bedroom on the seventh floor, which also looked straight out over the ocean. The sunsets were beautiful. The room was clean. My husband and I slept in the bedroom, while the kids had the couch in the living room area. The bedroom was right against the walkway, and we could hear everything and everyone who went by. Also, the pillows were extremely uncomfortable, as they were the little square pillows as opposed to standard size. A good portion of the resorts are in Ka'anapli. The beach area in front of our hotel was beautiful, but the water was a little too rough and rocky to go snorkeling. Also, it seems because the Ka'anapali area is a bit more northerly, it gets more rain than the areas that are farther south. At least it did in April when we were at the hotel. The hotel has a fitness center, which actually looked quite nice. However, an additional fee of $10/per day/per person seemed rather ridiculous on top of the room rate. Also, the hotel does charge for parking, per day. It just seemed like a way to nickel and dime guests.

I choose this property based on price and positive reviews. I had arranged for a garden view room for the 3 of us as this was a working holiday. The smell in the first room was like someone had cooked fish in the room. I tried to switch rooms but none were available. We slept with the patio doors open all night. To be fair, the smell was only in the kitchen and did get better (somewhat). Though I doubt it would have fully disappeared. We moved the next day from the 5th floor to the 4th floor. This room looked much the same. On the positive side, the condo's are spacious and the bedding clean. However, when we returned from a long day of planning, we found cockroaches in the kitchen. There were about 15 roaches in various stages of death. They had obviously sprayed or contacted some sort of poison. There were roaches in the dishwasher. I realize that tropical locations have bugs but I didn't feel like spending part of my time cleaning up dead bugs and not feeling like I could use the kitchen. We moved to the Royal Lahaina and were much happier. Overall the hotel is dated and the outside could use a cleaning. It is painted a dark yellow and the area near the elevators was a bit depressing. There are dark hallways off the main outdoor hallway leading to your room. These too could use a cleaning. The staff seemed disinterested in their jobs. When we went to check out (5 days early), the staff did not say anything although they must have been aware of the problems as my travel agent had arranged to move us. Lastly, there is no real beach. I have children coming to the wedding and it is more of a small walking strip of sand than a beach. I cannot comment on the pools except to say they looked o.k. and people were using them. I talked to another gentleman at the orientation meeting and he mentioned the elevator was broken on his side of the hotel. The birds were loud in the mornings starting at 3am. This is more of a problem if sleeping on the pull out bed in the living room and yes... you can hear the delivery trucks in the morning although this is not terrible. On the positive side, the rooms seemed, ironically, otherwise clean. The breakfast was o.k. and my mother loved the coffee. The grounds were beautiful. There was free wi-fi though it is slow. Parking is 10 dollars but it is the same at the Royal Lahaina (no free wi-fi but it is much faster at the royal lahaina 10/day) If this is all you can afford, perhaps you wish to take a chance as others seem happy in other reviews.

The room I was in, 910, was palatial with a splendid view.

That meant I could pack fewer clothes and not end up sitting in a hot laundry room watching them spin around. All the big things are right with this hotel and most of the little things.

Do expect strong trade winds, like 50 mph gusts, if you go at the end of March. Maui is very different from the Waikiki scene.

The ocean at that point is a little rocky as you go out a little ways so it is not the best beach on Maui, but laying out is a joy and you can get in the ocean to cool off without any problems. I believe most of the rooms have kitchens which is one thing we like. We usually get groceries to save a little money rather than eat out all the time which can get very spendy. I have been very impressed that the resort has recognized our name as a return customer and has tried to put us in the same room each time which we have enjoyed thoroughly.

We always get a warm welcome as we check in, and that feeling continues for the entire time we are there. It is a genuine attitude by the staff. The smiles are real and easily given.

Overall, this is a decent hotel for a decent price. Pulling up to the hotel, you get the feeling that this place will be a slice of heaven. Parts of it are, some not so much. Upon checking in, many of the staff seemed to be just going through the motions, barely looking up at you. The front desk is off to the side so you are really looking at some of the beautiful flowers and garden areas. We were told that we were upgraded from a standard room to a studio. The only real difference is a small kitchen area with no lighting. The only light came from the range hood. If you were here with a family and looked to save a few dollars by eating in a little, this would be just fine. Our view was of a parking lot, a irrigation ditch and another property. The loud noises from trucks, and service people was a distraction. The restaurant on site is nothing major to talk about. A bit overpriced in my opinion. As for the bar - I don't drink but my friends stated that the drinks were weak, overpriced and that the service was not friendly. The oceanfront pool was nice and the view was great. The small beach was nice but the shoreline is very rocky. I would not recommend going out into the water from the beach. One nice thing is that you can walk along the beach down to other properties including Ka'anapali. Other items about the hotel - Parking is a bit expensive but with in and out privileges, it's not that bad. The hotel is just a few minutes north of downtown Lahaina which makes dinner and shopping easy. I liked the fact that it is a Non-smoking property and didn't come across anyone smoking. There are shops on the property for almost anything you might want, from clothing to sundries. The free wi-fi is very spotty and can be a hassle at times.

The mattresses in all of our units were very uncomfortable; we had to buy foam pads to sleep on them. We had to firmly request the allotted every-third-day cleaning and re-supplying of dishwashing detergent (no more laundry detergent allowed, no matter now long you stay - but hand soap works fine in washer). If we didn't remind them of the cleaning schedule, and insist, all the housekeeping staff would do was change the towels and sometimes sweep. Contrary to the name and to what they tell you at booking, the Aston Kaanapali Shores IS NOT on Kaanapali Beach. You have to drive south to get to that beach. There were no activities (except a mai-tai Wednesday - we don't drink and non-alcoholic drinks aren't free, so had to skip it) when we were there, so I'm not sure what other reviewers are referring to with references to lei-making, etc. Would have been fun.... Who doesn't love lei? We were supposed to have a free upgrade, but that didn't happen. We were supposed to have an ocean view, but we weren't granted that, either. The gardens are beautiful, however, so the view was lovely, regardless. There is waterfall, which is lovely and sounds peaceful; it's surrounded by brilliant flowers. There is a lot of noise from delivery trucks very early in the mornings if you are facing the condo properties on either side of this Aston, so the middle section is best to avoid excess noise. There is entirely too much smoking. All around the perimeter there will be clusters of smokers. There is no way to get to the beach without being assaulted by cigaretter smoke. A better system for the rabid smokers needs to be established and enforced. Michael was great. He has detailed maps and lots of advice for sites to visit. He was the best asset the AKS has. Some of the front desk staff were nice; some were not. (So, try again later if the first lady you speak with won't accomodate a simple request.) The restaurant was so-so (both food and service) and rather expensive. Great views of the beautiful ocean, though. The promised free in-room Wi-fi rarely worked. So beware. The pay-for-use Shaka net downstairs didn't work either. Staff refers you to an 800 number for both issues; no human ever answered. The units were nice. Some were more updated than others. Basic kitchen equipment was provided. Better, less rocky beaches are to be found elsewhere. This one has high surf and reefs, so it isn't ideal for kids. The beach and mountains are beautiful. This is true no matter where you stay. There are more brilliant shades of blue and green on Maui (and the rest of Hawaii) than we had ever seen. You would want to have a car. The parking fees are annoying, as the condo owners already pay for that service. So renters are paying again. You can opt out of the safe fee. Expedia activities - shop around. Most things are available cheaper elsewhere. Overall, I would guardedly recommend this property to friends, subject to notice of the above issues, if they could get it at a really good price. Otherwise, look farther south. It's great to have the extra room a condo provides.

From the beach you can see 3 bouys out in the water, which makes most people think 'great place to swim to'. If you walk to the adjoinging property, they have a sign up warning that this is a riptide zone. A young man from our hometown disappeared there this year. There is a cairn set up right under the warning sign. Needless to say...we opted not to use this beach the entire time we were there and never saw anyone swimming during our stay. The waves were high and the rip was so obvious that you could watch it from shore. I'm not usually a paranoid mom. So....the snorkelling was fabulous at Honalua Bay, just a 5 minute drive north.

First, I went alone. As a woman, I had to learn to travel by myself when my first husband passed away. After a couple of times, it became easy...in fact, I do enjoy traveling alone. You don't have to worry about other people wanting to do things that you don't care about and vise versa, etc. Maybe that's a little selfish but, I find it both refreshing and rewarding. Besides, I've never felt lonely on a solo trip! Anyway, when I was choosing a place to stay, I was interested in being able to make my own food if I wanted, and location was key as well. Oh, and the price...Maui can be pretty pricey and I was looking for a bargain. The Aston Ka'anapali Shores fit the bill perfectly. I chose the standard studio with kitchen. I didn't really care about having an ocean view because I planned on being out and about. But, I was pleasantly surprised when I got to my room after check in! I had a lovely view of Molokai. What a treat to sit on the Lanai, early in the morning, with my coffee & papaya breakfast, just enjoying the fresh air and the beautiful view. Sure, I did also have a nice view of the rooftop of the condo property next door, but I honestly didn't 'see' that. I only saw the ocean and the island. Heavenly. The hotel staff were all just wonderful - friendly and helpful at all times. They do charge for parking, as do all the resorts in the area. But, I have to say, they charge less than any other property I was interested in, so that wasn't a concern for me. The room? Clean, crisp and fairly larger than I expected. The kitchen - I really expected more of a kitchenette - was nice! Full sized refrigerator/freezer, electric range, microwave oven, coffee maker (also, full sized!) and had all the utensils, table ware, etc. Very, very nice! Right across from the Aston is a Star Market - great for picking up Maui or Kona coffee, milk, cereal, fresh fruit and Island specialties like poke (including Korean-style with chili & kim chi...yum!) from the deli. Perfect location! The bed was comfortable, the bath was pretty standard with a tub/shower combo...but, again, everything was clean and spotless. I did not use the pool, but the beach right in back of the property is beautiful. I haven't been swimming in the ocean in awhile and I had an absolute blast! I had forgotten that it was so much fun. They provide lounge chairs and a shower to rinse off the sand, too. There's a small workout room off the lobby, a sundries store, a place to pick up 'resort wear' and a restaurant: The Beach Club Restaurant is on the property and has a beautiful view of the ocean. It's open and airy. The staff are all very friendly and courteous. The prime rib dinner was said by a couple of people (staff) to be the best and best value on the Island. I decided to try it and was disappointed but, then again, who goes to Hawai'i for prime rib? I think I'll stick to Vegas for that from now on. For eating out, you're really close to Lahaina Town (don't miss the Old Lahaina Luau!), Whalers Villiage, etc. All in all, I would recommend the Aston Ka'anapali Shores to anyone looking for a nice place, close to Lahaina Town, etc. It would be perfect for families - you can save a lot by cooking for yourselves rather than eating every meal out. It was great for me, a solo traveler.

We had a one bedroom suite near the beach end facing west. The room was just as represented, clean and comfortable. All staff were great. We are ocean swimmers though so were disappointed that the ocean in front of the hotel is very shallow reef. However by walking along the beach just south of the property there is a sand channel. It is marked by 3 large bouys. This is actually a public access beach/ocean area. It is also a potential DEATH TRAP!!! If you were to enter it from the top side and were reading the signs very carefully you would learn that the buoys indicate a Riptide area. The sign is very specific about the danger and what to do if you are caught in it. BUT,, this sign is not visable if you enter the beach area or water from the Aston Kaanapali property. Upon check in you will be required to initial that you are aware that it can be dangerous to swim in the ocean. The hotel should give you a copy of what the sign reads and get you to initial that and give you a copy to have. We are excellent swimmers and did not run into any problems but only had to deal with extra current and not an actual riptide undertow which unfortuately for one 20 year old snorkeler took his life while we were there. For me this area provided the best body boarding I had anywhere on the island. The current took me out without having to bash through any breakers and then by just paddling south out of the channel 60 - 80 feet I was right in the path of crowning swells that would give me a great ride back to the beach. Public surfing lessons are also run from this location, although they would only go out into the water a short distance. SMOKING is my only compaint towards the hotel. The designated smoking area is north of the beach but in reality the entire beach area has smoking on it. The hotel has placed large sand ashtrays for their butts, I would guess to stop them from being littered in the sand but it does send the message that smoking is permitted on the beach. I would suggest that the hotel split the beach area 50/50 and enforce the non smoking side. My largest compliment goes to the hotels relaxed beach towel program.

After sending in the deposit I was informed that the Kaanapali Shores is now a condo located north of black rock on a substandard beach, full of rocks and coral and completely unsuited to swimming or boogie boarding. Since we had committed 2 nights deposit at the Kaanapali Shores, we arrived there prepared to have a good time. The resort is relaxed, with little kids teeming from every angle.

I later spoke with Kim, the manager of the property, who went to our room to personally check out the safe. By that time it was empty. I filed a police report with Lahaina Police, who basically told me I would never get my necklace back...I hate so say this, because I am a social worker, and a democrat, but the only people in our room after my husband and I was the housekeeping staff...room 613.

The televisions are in rather poor shape. Our kitchen \"In-Sink-Erator\" was not working. The hood fan over the stove was not working (although a second, working microwave was in the room).

We had three bedrooms, two bathrooms and gourmet kitchen. We had booked a two bedroom ocean view and as my mother is vision impaired, I called ahead to speak with Tiffany, the reservations mgr, to book a ground floor unit or a unit close to an elevator. Unfortunately, all units were booked. My second choice was a loft unit and Tiffany came through with flying colours! Thank you Tiffany for your kindess and extra care - so much appreciated. The complex is very well kept, the gardens are exceptional and all staff are kind and willing to assist. Our first unit was 458 and on our second day the appliances (all top of the line) began to fail. We knew these situations can happen and pointed no blame to the management. Each time we called the front desk a maintenance person was sent immediately to assist (within 10 minutes). After the third incident, I visited the front desk and another unit was immediately offered. Within 30 minutes we moved to unit 454, another loft. We were very happy and pointed no blame for the appliances failiing - it could have been us as they were pretty fancy. I have to say that the complex has not changed much over the past years and the management is working very hard to upgrade. There are units still in need of renos, therefore I would suggest calling ahead and requesting an updated unit. If I were to offer any suggestions, I would say the hallways, especially near the sundries store, gym and Beachside Casuals require new carpet. Unfortunately, they are old and worn-out and give the impression the entire complex is out-of-date. The beach is wonderful and there was always a lounge available. There are points of entry where there is coral, however, the entry point between the KS and the Beach Club is sandy and great for kids and seniors as waves tend to break around this point.

It's located just north of the main strip of hotels on Kaanapali beach. We booked a package deal (air, room, car) for a studio with kitchen. The room was huge (room 430)! In fact, I asked the bell man if it was a studio or 1 bedroom. He confirmed our room assignment was correct. It had a full bedroom (queen bed), closet, living room, dining table, 2 flat screen tvs, balcony, washer and dryer in the unit and a full kitchen. Wireless internet was free. There is a charge for parking. The garage was right near our room, so it was convenient for us. The kitchen was modern with granite counters, smooth top stove, oven, microwave, dishwasher, full sized fridge, toaster and coffee maker. Dinnerware, silverware, cooking utensils, pots, pans, glasses are all included. In fact, there was coffee, dishwashing soap, paper towels and laundry soap in the unit, too. It was so handy to have the washer/dryer. All of this made our eight day stay very comfortable. As for maid service, they service the towels, garbage, make beds and do a general cleaning every day. Bed linens are changed every 3rd day, I think. Toiletries were replenished daily. The pool area is small, but clean. The hotel is right on the beach, so that's the best place to be anyway. We ate at the hotel restaurant twice and the food was fine. They have a few shops on the property (real estate office, sundries store, clothing store, coffee/breakfast kiosk). Take advantage of the free coupon book they give you when you arrive. There is also a magazine in the room that has several coupons. We got a bunch of free with purchase items, including two beach towels, two T-shirts, earrings, a discount on a boogie board purchase and food discounts in the local area. Speaking of food, there is a 24 hour grocery store across the street. Their prices are less than Safeway (we made a few comparisons). Next time, we'll bring a few staples from home like peanut butter, canned items, cereal, pasta and rice. Prices are pretty steep. Another option is to stop by Costco as you leave the airport to stock up on the basics. Overall, this is a very comfortable place to stay for a reasonable price.

We spent 8 glorious days in Maui earlier this month. Upon arrival, we decided to book some shore excursions through what we believed to be the hotel. The kiosk location is in the lobby of the hotel. There were four of us traveling together and between us, we purchased approximately $1,000 in activities. We were told by the concierge that we could save $100 per couple by attending a 90 MINUTE timeshare presentation at the hotel next door. We were reluctant at first, but decided that it was worth 90 minutes of our time to save $200. The name of the timeshare company is Diamond Resorts International. Upon arrival, we told our salesperson that we had no interest in buying a timeshare unit as we have children in college. After suffering through the disorganized presentation by the salesperson, the 20 minute movie, and a guided tour of 2 rooms, we again told the salesperson that we were not interested. She would not take no for an answer. She brought her manager over and we were treated very rudely by him. We had fulfilled our end of the bargain. We had already wasted 2 \u00c2\u00bd hours on this presentation which we were told would only take 1 \u00c2\u00bd hours. Holds had been placed on our debit and credit cards for the $100 should we not attend. After two days, the holds fell off. A full week after returning from the trip, the $100 was placed back on the debit card with no explanation. Phone calls to the resort were immediately forwarded to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Expedia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who we then discovered ran the kiosk located in the lobby. The female manager, Lillia, was rude, unprofessional and disrespectful and she only returned calls after she was called approximately 5 times. When she reluctantly admitted that we had in fact attended the presentation and should not be charged the $100 fee, she agreed to refund the charge. Quite to the contrary, she charged it AGAIN, and now the account had been debited by $200. Although she denied ever having made the second charge, bank records clearly indicate that a second charge was made and it was confirmed by the bank. Wire fraud, plain and simple. Unauthorized debits to a guest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s checking account. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sickening feeling to think that someone thousands of miles away can remove money from your checking account with no permission to do so. The only way to see that no future unauthorized charges were made from the account was to cancel the card and have a new card issued. Phone calls to the manager of the Aston Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Shores, Mark, were never returned, although I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m 100% certain that a response from the hotel will follow this review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an empty, unsympathetic apology at best, if even that. We spent a lot of money on this vacation and a good portion of that money went to the Aston for our accommodations. We expected more from them and they should stand behind their guests, even if their vacation has ended and they have gone home. We will be back to Maui next year, although we will not stay at this hotel because of this experience. Maui is paradise. Should you wish to take a helicopter tour of the island, we would recommend Blue Hawaiian. Nothing compares to the breathtaking scenery you will observe while flying over this beautiful island. The Road to Hana is a must. Allow plenty of time and stop frequently to take in the gorgeous waterfalls and stunning scenery. Lahaina is a very fun town, full of unique gift stores and restaurants. Bubba Gump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is a delicious and affordable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and ask for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ben\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to be your waiter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he is top notch. Should you wish to snorkel or just want to go for a boat ride, we would recommend the Maui Magic. The crew is wonderful and will see to it that you have an amazing trip and show you plenty of interesting things while on your tour. We did a luau at the Royal Lahaina and were disappointed. We heard other guests commenting on how much they enjoyed the Old Lahaina and the Hyatt luaus and we will definitely see one of those next year. If you have not purchased the book Maui Revealed, do so soon. It contains unbiased articles, photographs, maps and tips for your stay. Maui is truly heaven on earth. Do not waste one minute of it sitting through a time share presentation, especially one with Diamond Resorts International.

The king sized bed was extremely comfortable, and storage facilities ample. The grounds are immaculate, very neat and beautifully landscaped. Plenty of room to run around on the lawns, or park your sunlounge under a swaying palm for some shade. The pools are great, the main pool is great for all ages, with ample shallow end and a good deep end for floating with a mai-tai during happy hour. The garden pool is quite and child friendly with a secluded hot tub near by. Had dinner at the resort, as well as several light breakfasts. The keiki (children's) menu is adequate, however some veggies would be appreciated! (Fries not included...) The beach has been commented on in other posts about the rocks. If you have young children (under 12), the beach in front of the resort is fine. Even at low tide, there was at least 20 feet to swim or snorkel in. As other people have commented, go for a short stroll up the beach and you will find a clear space to go out further. Views of the adjourning islands are spectacular, shade available and sunsets have to be seen to be believed! The facilities surrounding the resort are great. The Star Market will supply everything you need (but is a bit pricey), there is an ABC store 2 minute walk away towards Napali, and the fish supplier is worth trying.

That said, there's some great snorkeling right off shore (we saw a lot of fish and a couple Green Sea Turtles up close and personal). We loved that fact that all rooms have complete kitchens, this made our stay much more reasonable since we didn't have to eat out at every meal. We had the unique opportunity to experience both the Studios and 2 Bedroom Suites. Both are comfortable and roomy. They are slowly making over the property so be sure to ask for a renovated room. The studio my wife and I shared was 'pre renovation' and while the kitchen was functional the cabinets and appliances were date and in need of an upgrade. The two bedroom was very roomy and comfortable. We had the upgraded kitchen and it was a much nicer experience. Overall, the quality of the units are what you might expect in a standard apartment complex, not top of the line but functional and practical. The two bedroom is roomy enough for a family to stay comfortably. We shared with another couple and they pushed the twin beds together to make a queen...not the greatest solution but it worked. Free Wireless Internet was a nice plus. Some of the amenities, like the Wedding Gazebo and Spa are functional but not luxurious. Good alternatives if that's what your budget can afford. My biggest beef was that they charged us for parking...I understand that they need to charge for parking otherwise non-guests might take advantage of their lot but when you're already charging me over $140 per night, do you really need to hit me up for another $9 to park my rental car? I was not pleased to see that on my bill when we checked out.

Given the alternatives in Kaanapali, the price we paid was very much in line with our experience. Let me start with the good stuff. First, the hotel staff (front desk and housekeeping) were very nice and very accomodating. If we needed something they were all over it. The room was adequate. Since we were outdoors most of the time, all we needed was a place to sleep, eat breakfast and do our laundry. In that sense it was very good. However, I definitely would not buy a time share here. The construction seemed cheap and the walls were thin. When housekeeping rolled a cart down the hallway our shelves shook! We weren't planning to live there, though, so that wasn't a show-stopper. We had an ocean view, which was great. A lot of reviewers complain about the birds but that didn't bother us a bit. They're noisy when they roost in the evening, but only for about an hour. Not a big deal. We loved the $100 credit for hotel services. The pools were nice and the hotel is across the street from a market, which was very convenient. On the not so great side, the grounds need upkeep. We noticed missing tiles in the hot tub, missing grout around the pools, etc. Also, the beach in front isn't the best. If you walk up the shoreline it gets a lot better. Again, not a big deal unless you have small children and don't want to hike with them. One thing to watch out for is the \"orientation\" they offer on your first full day. They push hard for you to show up for the continental breakfast and free drawing. This is basically a pitch for different island activities. We purchased a few and later learned that we could have purchased essentially the same packages for much less in Lahina.

Once again, we rented directly from an owner. The complex is basically shaped like a horseshoe. I was originally set on an ocean front view, but ended up with a good deal on a 1br condo which is at the farthest point from the shore in the U of the horseshoe, #933. KS has a very nice landscaped courtyard with two pools, numerous trees, and even a mini walk-through tropical path. There is a waterfall and 'stream' in this sculptured landscape which provides a constant sound of running water directly under the lanai. In the morning and evening the mynah birds create quite a commotion in the trees just over the waterfall. There is also a wedding gazebo within these trees. btw, some rooms' view might be compromised by these same trees. If view is important to you, ask for 7th floor or higher.We were on the ninth floor which gave us a great view over the courtyard and out to the ocean and the sunsets. The walk to the pool and beach through this courtyard was quite pleasant. The lobby is open and is nicely decorated. The advantage, in my opinion, of dealing directly with the owner is that you know exactly what room you are getting rather than spinning the wheel to see what Aston will give you.. After reviewing some listings and pictures, I called the owners. After talking with the owner, I could tell which owners I would want to rent from. By the way, with the down economy, you may find that individual owners are much more flexible with their pricing. The resort management companies, like Aston, will probably not be. In addition, they pose as owners on vrbo.com but it's easy to spot their listings because they have no specifics or personal feel. The unit itself was up to date and everything worked well. The kitchen was well equipped with any utensils you would need for cooking a meal. We had a problem with the a/c but this was resolved by the building management fairly quickly. The main queen bed was an extra, extra-firm, the sofa sleeper a little on the soft side. For those of us with older eyes, I found the bedroom lighting ( two low-wattage lamps ) to be insufficient. At the KS, don't expect great wireless internet which is useful for looking up places to go etc. You had to be in a certain place in the room to get good reception but even then it would just drop mysteriously and then come back. For one dinner, we visited the KS restaurant. We found the prices about normal for a hotel in Maui. I had a fresh Mahi-mahi dinner for about $25. There were lots of families at the KS. The pool area was active during the day and so was the beach. They also have a seperate shallow pool for the little ones. There are two hottubs, one at the main pool, the other in a semi-secluded area. Many guests used the restaurant for lunch and dinner. During the day, you can make orders poolside. The restaurant faces the pool area. There is a $9/day parking fee. In general, I despise add-on fees such as these, but the $9 isn't bad when compared to $20 'resort fees' charged elsewhere. Because we rented directly from the owner, there were no other fees. There is a garage which is open to all guests which is a plus during rain or if you want the car cool when you get ready to go somewhere. We were initially concerned about the arrival of Tropical Storm Felicia so we went to Haleakala on our first full day and were pleasantly surprised by a clear mountaintop and an unusually warm 61. But by the time we left it was clouding up. Best time to go is in the early morning ( or sunrise if you're really determined ). Take water, jackets and a full tank of gas. When Felicia finally meandered into town, all we really got was an afternoon of heavy drizzle. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at KS.

Restaurant food quality does not justify the high prices. Very small beach in front of hotel. No onsite coffee available until 6:30 am. INSIDER TIP #1: Book directly with the hotel by phone and negotiate to get the lowest rate instead of using online agents. We booked through Expedia and were sold an Oceanfront 2 bedroom suite, which has the largest floor plan n the complex. However, when we arrived, we learned that all of these 2000 square foot units were out of service for renovations, thus ending up with our family of seven in an oceanview room that realistically could only accommodate 4 comfortably. No upgrades were offered by the staff, saying that nothing else was available at the time. The management told us that Expedia booked the largest room available at the time of booking, a subtlety we would not have known when we booked. INSIDER TIP #2: Book the resort dive course. The divemaster, Mike, was amazing, friendly and masterful. The dive was fabulous, right off the beach with seat turtles, small sharks and lots of fish. Worth every cent, even if you never dive again. And this is coming from an advanced certified diver with > 25 years of diving experience who took the course to get his 13 year old son a first look at scuba. INSIDER TIP #3: As first-time Hawaii visitors, we were drawn in part by the purported friendliness of the native islanders. Reality check: it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist. Whether it is due to cultural issues or to long term exposure to mainland tourists, we were almost uniformly treated by islanders with faint hostility and at times overt hatred, even towards our young children. As native southwesterners, we are used to easy friendliness, accommodation and genuine good manners in our home state. These no longer exist in Hawaii, as far as we can tell. So, the Aloha stuff is just a business pitch to get you on the island. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a reason not to go to Hawaii, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a hula-eyed native to place a lei around your neck when you step off the plane. Instead she may just try to strangle you. Do expect a plump, surly, mean eyed airport traffic-lady to tell you that she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care what your question is, just get your rental vehicle \u00e2\u20ac\u0153off-property\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd now! And do expect many service people to do the same, from parking lot attendants, to store clerks to security guards. Makes you wonder if your are in New York City! It's the same attitude towards mainland Americans that I've encountered in many Caribbean nations and in many nations in south Asia as well as Europe.

We arrived to a very nice renovated condo on the 2nd floor w/ a full remodeled kitchen, pull-out couch, washer/dryer, and 1 bed 1 bath with a view of the garden. Its really not worth the extra money for an ocean view because the grounds and gardens are absolutely gorgeous and the resort is right on the beach. The maids do come every day and clean the rooms. The staff at this resort is very aloha-friendly and will help you with any problem that arises. The pools at the the hotel are nice, but can be a bit crowded during the afternoons. The beach in front of the hotel is a bit rocky but if you travel down south on the beach in front of the pink hotel there is some great swim and snorkeling spots. Remember that Hawaii is very expensive and the restaurant at this hotel is no exception. We recommend that you shop at the Star Market or one of the many ABC Stores and try to eat in your condo for breakfast and lunch and go out to eat for dinner. We also reccomend to go into Lahaina for lunch and dinner on Front Street, there are many great restaurants like BJ's, Bubba Gumps, and Hard Rock Cafe. Also, go to the orientation breakfast the hotel holds on your first morning, they help you plan out your week at a discounted price thanks to Expedia local experts. There is also a very helpful Expedia Local Expert by the main pool who also offers discounts and great advice on what to do in Maui. Its true that Kaanapali Shores is no Ritz-Carlton but fun activities are right next to the hotel and, at least for our purpose in this vacation, you only spend time in your room to sleep and eat. Definately recommend for the budget family/traveler. Here are some travel trips if you do visit Maui: 1) Snorkel. We recommend the Pacific Whale Foundations snorkel tour to Molokini Crater and Turtle Arches. The water is amazingly clear even 50 ft down. 2) Go on a helicopter ride. If you can afford it, definately take the time to see the beauty of Maui and Moloka'i from the air. Unforgettable views. 3) Rent a car. Everything is 1000 times easier and more accessible if you rent a car. We had a nice convertable (recommend) 4) Do a luau. They are a great experience and a must when visiting Hawaii.

Our first room on the south side of the resort looked like it badly needed upgrading, and had a broken sofabed which was needed because my in-laws had tagged along for the trip. When I called the front desk, they immediately moved us to another 1-bedroom room on the North side of the resort, where the rooms were newly refurbished, with new appliances, cabinets, clean washer/dryer, internet, Ironing Board/Iron, Hair Dryer, safe, etc. This room was fantastic, and quite large. The beach was ok, but had a pretty good undertow that was a bit much for young children, but then again, the majority of the beaches in the Kaanapali/Lahaina area are very rocky, and there are very few sandy beaches (this being one of them). The food & service at the hotel's restaurant were both well above average, which was a pleasant suprise. The food was fresh, and served within 10 minutes of ordering. I had to carry my tired 3-year old so my wife could eat, so our waitress was kind enough to put a heat shield over my plate to keep my food warm, and placed the au-jus for my prime rib in an insulated cup, all without my knowing or asking. Great service, and great food. The housekeeping staff was also very attentive and helpful. I called the front desk to ask for 4 more sets of towels, and it was delivered to our room within 15 minutes. I called again the next morning to swap out our towels, and again they were delivered in less than 15 minutes. Again, great service. Regarding the other complaints people have had: -the $9/day parking: You are advised of this cost up-front on their website and when you check-in. All the other hotels charge more for their daily parking, so what's the problem? - Cost fo the food: This is MAUI - everything is expensive. If you want to prepare your own meals, there is a Star Market across the street and a Safeway Market down the road. There are also tons of small eateries in Kaanapali & Lahaina. -Condition of the rooms: I would agree that the rooms on the south side of the hotel are very dated, and the walkways are very dark at night. If you can, ask for a room on the North side of the hotel, which are all newly refurbished. The difference is night and day. -View from the room: What can I say? It's either going to be mountain/parking, garden or Ocean view. You get what you pay for. -Traffic: This is Kaanapali. One way in, and one way out, through the most visited areas on Maui. Unless you want to drive North through 250 winding turns through Kahakuloa, which I wouldn't suggest. -Bed comfort level: The bed in the bedroom was very comfortable. The Sofa bed wasn't very comfy, but the point here is that it's meant to be a sofa, and not a perfect bed. Put the sofabed mattress on the floor for better support. Other Comments: The 2 pools are clean, uncrowded, and great. We didn't have any trouble finding open loungers. The bell desk attendants were very helpful, and went out of their way to assist us. Highly recommend this resort to everyone, especially families with young children. Large, well-manicured garden/lawn area next to one of the pools where kids can run around and not get into trouble.

We had an unbelievable view of the ocean. Our room was tastefully decorated and very bright. The beds were very comfortable. We could not be happier. However, the first night was horrible. It started at the front desk where they kept on trying to sell us an oceanfront room for only $120 extra per night. We said we were not interested. The person at the front desk then showed me on the resort map where the room I had booked would be. I told this person immediately that that room could not possibly be ocean view. It was far away from the ocean, on too low a floor, and did not even face the ocean. I was told that if you can see the ocean from the balcony, it was ocean view. Once again they tried to sell me the oceanfront room, showing me the difference on the map. I was skeptical, but we went up to our room anyway. It was dark, dreary, and dingy. It was updated, but it looked like they had just put a ton of ugly granite in a thirty year old room. The carpet was stained. The second bedroom had windows in it like a basement where no light came in. Yes you could see the ocean. You literally had to go to the edge of the balcony and see a flash of blue through two palm trees. It did not match what the Kaanapali Shores showed on its web site as an example of an ocean view room. I travel a lot and have been to Hawaii several times. I do tons of research on the Internet before I book a room. I have always been happy with where I have stayed. We usually splurge on ocean view rooms because we like to sit out on the balcony and watch the waves, so we know exactly what to expect. To Kaanapali Shores' credit, I called the front desk and said that we were not happy with the room. They said they could move us, but not until the next night. The beds were terrible. One of my boys slept on the floor. The other slept on the couch. The resort was nice enough to move us to a great room the next day, but not until 3:00 p.m. This room was higher up, not ocean front, but with a beautiful view. The beds were great. This room had exactly the same furniture as the first. I think the view, new carpeting, nice beds, and a sunnier location made it seem like a million dollar room. So, I cannot recommend the Kaanapali Shores if you do not know where you are going to be located. Obviously it depends on who owns the unit and the care they put into this unit.

I paid extra for a oceanview unit. I got a free upgrade to a 2-room unit on arrival. However, the unit was on the building as the main entrance. It was probably 200 yard away from the beach. There were a garden, two swmming pools and a restaurant between our building and the beach. Eventhough we were on the sixth floor, we could only see some ocean from the lanai. I learned that the \"Oceanside\" units are the ones with the real view. Like other reviews pointed out, there were a lot of birds in the garden in early and late hours. You need to keep the window shut if you don't want to be awaken with the bird noises. Everything was clean and in proper working order inside the condo. Having two bedrooms, two bathrooms and washer/dryer turned out be really convenient. The kids swimming pool is reasonable big. However, it did get cold in late afternoon when the sun was blocked by surrounding buildings. It was very windy in the Kaanapali area late afternoon during our stay. It was too cold for us to swim in the pool or the beach after 5 pm. The beach was very nice. The sand was soft and not too crowded. The width of the beach is a bit narrow especially in high tide. For swimming and snorkeling, you have to walk 50 yard south to find the opening in the rock/reef. Snorkeling was good especially for beginner. What we like most was the surrounding area. It was pretty laid back compared to Kihei. We could get good value foods and groceries within walking distance. There is a good pizza/sub place, a large groceries store and a snorkel gear rental shop just across the street. 5 minutes walk north, you can get fresh poke from the fish market, good fusion chinese/hawaiian/western takeout and fresh produce from the farmer market.

It is located on a west shore beach within a walking distance to a convenience store. This was very handy as we had to buy food and supplies for our small children almost everyday. 2. Recently renovated rooms are very nice. Of course there is a chance that you may not get one when you check in. 3. Great view even from garden view rooms. We did not expect much from our garden view room, but upon arrival we were surprized to find out that the view was great and we could easily see the ocean from our rooms and from the balcony. 4. Clean and nicely landscaped hotel grounds that include 2 pools, hot tubs, small ponds, grass lawns, etc. 5. An excellent snorkelling place called \"Kahekili Beach Park\" is relatively close. It is about 20 minutes walk or a 5 minutes drive from the resort. 6. There is a free wireless internet access. Cons: 1. The parking fee is $9 per day and there is a fee of $2.50 per day for using the in-room safe. 2. Hotel does a regular room treatment against cockroaches.

We had to 2 - 2 bed/2 bath condos. They were on the 2nd floor. The condo I stayed in was very old. The kitchen needs a complete renovation. The stove had to be from at least the 80's as well as the cabinets. Our bathrooms looked even more dated and worn out. To top it off we saw several roaches, so we had to call the front desk and have the room fumigated. The other condo where the rest of my family stayed at had pretty much the same outdated look, but no roaches but we did come back one day from being out and my father's bed was on the floor. We called housekeeping and within 10 mins a maintance man was there to fix it. The bedframe had broken so he immediatley went and brought back another one. Also the bathroom door in the masterbed kept falling of the hinges, so that had to be fixed as well. In general, i would recommend this resort.

The larger pool next to the ocean/ restaurant is warmer than the kiddy pool. The garden is very nice if you want to hear birds chirping and not feel the sun beating on you. House keeping is very friendly. The pool next door to the Kaanapali Shores is really awesome and huge...it even has a slide that my two year old went down solo that lands into a kiddy pool. BBQ grills by the Tennis courts are a plus The Cons- 9.00 a day parking is a burn. Drinks are too expensive and watered down. Beach in front of hotel is rocky. Some rooms are in need of upgrade and repair. Kids eat for free policy is a joke. Overall, our stay at this resort was not pleasant There is a no smoking policy on the resort grounds...which is good, but the only people you see smoking are some of the employees who do it in the parking structure our crouched behind parked cars out in front of the Hotel. A plastic (two foot by two foot) bathroom tile from the ceiling feel and hit my two year old in the face causing a slight laceration. Another tile fell and hit my wife while in the shower...no damage to her. We asked for a different room but was given the response of \"we only have rooms that you will have to pay extra for left\"...which I doubted because tourism is way down in Maui and is evident at this resort by the few numbers pf people. Kids eat for free between 11:30 AM and 4:30 PM but here is the catch, you have to eat inside the restaurant, that is connected to the pool, and with a paying adult. The kids meal is not free if you get it delivered outside at the pool like everyone else does between the hours of 1130 and 430 pm when pool activity is greatest. You cant get the kids meal for free if you want to take it back to the room. So, I thought maybe we would sit down and get our meal delivered to the table, pay, ask for to-go boxes and then go outside to the pool to eat...no dice. Server said she would charge us the kids meal. I argued that if we eat here then take some to go but walk out a different door towards the lobby she would not charge us for the kids meal? she then said yes she would not charge us. This policy is insulting as a guest who intended to to take advantage of the kids eat for free program. I think the resorts intention was to make this program as inconvienent as possible so you would not dine at the restaurant and therefore not allow kids to get a free meal. The Air Conditioning did not work properly for our first two nights at the resort. I sweated it out the first night but on the second day I asked for it to be serviced. By the time we got back from a night of local shopping, we returned to the room it still had not been serviced. I continued to wait until the third day and finally they came and fixed the A/C.

This facility is probably the best value for the buck on the entire island. The rooms, especially the renovated ones, are very nice and the beds are extremely comfortable. The grounds and common areas are impecably maintained. And the staff is friendly and attentive. Diane in the bar is awesome, and Myron in the restaurant is hilarious! A word about the restaurant...it is somewhat expensive, but quite a bit less so than at the other nice hotels. Dining in Lahaina, depending on where you go, is not going to cost much less. So if you're tired and don't want to hop in the car, the food is quite good and reasonably priced by Maui standards. The last reviewer commented on a very narrow beach. We were here in October and the beach was at least twice as deep from the property line to the water. I suspect the winter tides have sucked alot of the sand away, but it will be back in a few months.

The hotel was easy to find and the grounds were very well maintained. Check in was a breeze and due to low occupancy we were able to upgrade our 2nd floor garden view room to an ocean view room on the 6th floor - room 606, for an additional but discounted fee. We told the person at the check in desk it was our anniversary and he sent a bottle of champagne to our room later that afternoon - a very nice touch. We parked the car and took our bags up to the room. The condo was nicely furnished, and appeared to be recently remodeled. The furniture was comfortable and there was plenty of space for all of our things. The lanai looked out over the north side of the building, so no sunset views, but we were close enough to the water\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s edge that we still had great views of the water and the lanai was very private. The property just north of the Kaanapali Shores is a 3 story, apartment-like property that we partially looked over. We were able to sleep with the lanai door open at night and could hear the sounds of the waves from our bedroom. The bath was nicely apportioned, with amenities provided. Our only complaint about the room was that it took me 4 days to figure out how to pry the bedroom window open so we could hear the sounds from the ocean better at night! The staff was friendly and efficient. Our towels were replaced daily and the room straightened and the bed made by the cleaning staff. The room was fully cleaned with the trash removed on Wednesday. The compact washer / dryer came in handy and we purchased additional laundry soap from the sundries shop on the ground floor as needed. We had one dinner and one breakfast in the hotel restaurant and the food was good quality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not spectacular, but not bad either. The wait and bar staff was very nice and provided very good service. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any evidence of rodents or bugs our entire stay. Again this is not a 5 star hotel and for the money I think it was very good value. The strip mall just across the road from the hotel was in easy walking distance. We went grocery shopping there several times for breakfast items and once for dinner. We also ate at Pizza Paradiso one evening. The pizza was good and reasonably priced \u00e2\u20ac\u201c again not spectacular, but reasonable value for the money on Maui. The grounds were well kept and the pool clean. We attended the Wednesday 5:00 PM hula on the pool deck and again it was nice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not spectacular, but entertaining. We did not use the gym as $10 per person per day was a bit much, but we did experience a couples massage on the beach. It was not the most relaxing experience we've ever had as it was quite windy that afternoon and the tent we were in - with flaps closed for a smidge of privacy - seemed at times like it would do it's best 'Wizard of Oz' imitation and fly away. We stayed grounded and enjoyed the massages as best we could.

I was a little worried since the price was one of the lowest out there. After doing a lot of research and reading through countless reviews, I took the chance. Boy am I glad I did. Not only is this place a great price, but our room was AWESOME. When it says living room, one bedroom and a full kitchen, they are not lying. Plenty of room, a home away from home. The bed was comfortable, the kitchen looked like it had all new appliances, and there was just plenty of room for this family of 5. The Internet connection was at 100% and I never had an issue connecting. The main pool was warm, and the kiddy pool was great for the kids (little cold). This place is located right on the beach, everyday we would walk to the ocean without any shoes on any of us. The beach was clean and the views were spectacular. You did have to walk a little way down to reach a sandy entrance to the ocean, but it was great snorkeling (albeit I am a beginner). The lobby and the grounds were immaculate, right down to the nightly tiki lighting. The restaurant there was adequate, and the food was decent. I miss sitting on the lanai and seeing the sun set.

I loved the fact that they never ran out of beach towels, and we didn't have to deal with signing them out, or making sure to return them by the end of the day. Don't miss the huge Koy fish in the pond! The 2 pools were perfect for all ages. One was kidney shaped with a depth of 3 ft all around, the other was 3ft-6ft? gated and more for adults, although they also had scooba lessons in there during the day. There were 2 hot tubs, one on the side of the kidney pool (a bit too hot at times), and the other right next to regular pool (perfect temp). There was also a short-grass open lawn area where you could lay, relax, or run around with the kids. By the evening both pools were warm and very pleasant after being out in the sun all day. Beyond the pool, a few steps took you down to a narrow strip of beach where the water was a bit rocky. But, just 200 feet to the left there was a more sandy area where you could walk out, swim and snorkel. I saw 5-6 varieties of fish and was still able to stand (about 4 feet in). While they rent out eqipment, it's smarter to just drive to Lahaina and buy the snorkel gear. They have 1 restaurant and we went there for lunch twice. Everything was good, I recommend the fish tacos, coconut shrimp salad, and the amazing Rum-soaked Bread Pudding. But, if you order a pizza on the kids menu, you may get a Hot Pocket instead. From their Snack manu, the eggrolls and both chicken wings were also very good. The staff was friendly and accomodating. We had 2 cribs for the babies in the family.

Also, we went to the Mexican restaurant in the small plaza across the street and was not impressed at all - food was mediocre, served on paper plates, and very small portions.

The hotel is almost connected to this great boardwalk that you can walk all the way up to Whalers Village on. You can connect near the Mahana from the beach. It was hard to swim in front of the hotel on the beach, but Kaanapali is so long that you don't have to walk far to find a nice spot, and it isn't very crowded at all. The restaurant was pretty good and it had a nice look and feel to it, including a great view. The poolside service bar was under construction when we were there so we heard some renovation noises while at the beach pool. Some of the suites are undergoing renovations as well, so sometimes you hear some noise. There was a large skip below our room where we could hear tradespeople dumping old toilets and whatnot into. At first I was a bit annoyed, but it wasn't noisy all the time and I understand that renos are needed at this hotel. I saw two cockroaches but they were both already dead so no big deal.

The location of the property is relatively well situated, with a short drive to Lahaina. We found this property to be very windy, it appears to be on a point of sorts and the wind howls alot of the day. We were at different properties closer to Lahaina during those windy days, and it seemed to be distinct to the Shores as the other locations weren't nearly as windy. As is well documented here, the birds at this resort can be unbearable and you can almost set your watch to them daily. However, when we moved to a 2 bedroom unit closer to the ocean, they didn't seem to be as bad. The pool area is mediocre, it fills up very quickly during the day with lots of kids and families. The beach here while close, is very rocky and swimming isn't great here either. The restaurant was ok, but nothing to write home about. However they were very accomodating when we needed to store a large cake in one of their fridges. It was great to have bbq facilities on site, and we made good use of the bbq area on a few nights - a nice touch. The fee for parking is outrageous and quite ridiculous really. Not sure why that would be and seems like a total cash grab. The rooms were nice, it was enjoyable to have the use of a large, (and in our case - updated) kitchen with most amenities. The two bedroom provided enough room for the 6 in our party. Only thing i would change for the rooms, would be a bigger couch in the living room. Not that one watches a lot of TV in Maui, but there were a plethora of channels on the tv here. Nice large changing area in the master bedroom and quite comfortable beds. Overall, after a few days here, we realized the resort definitely caters to families and to seniors. Our group of twelve were 4 50-somethings and 8 25-35's. This resort lacks a good bar to enjoy a late evening cocktail in, it seems everyone retires to their rooms after dinner, and it would have been nice to have a place to go instead of the room for a drink. The bus service into Lahaina is great, but the concierge doesn't really seem to be well versed on the schedules or much about it...this was frustrating. It was somewhat annoying to have to transfer at Whalers Village and pay yet another dollar to get into Lahaina, I realize this doesn't have much to do with the resort itself, but more about it's location. A one way taxi into Lahaina is about $22 - a little steep for a short 10 minute ride. We were able to visit other properties closer to Lahaina, and when we return to Maui, will most likely give them a try. We enjoyed the large, open pool areas of the Marriott, Westin & Hyatt, and the varied bars also offered at this location. We realize the price will certainly reflect these amenities at these specific properties, but after staying @ the Shores, we realized we were looking for more of a ''resort'' feel versus what is a strong family oriented resort at the Shores. Mike from Scorpion dive school was excellent and the free pool side daily lessons was a real plus. He was a pleasure to learn from. We paid $79 for a walk in sea dive, which was good value for money.

No, it doesn't have a fancy water slide. But it is a great, low-key place. The service is friendly. The one bedroom suite has a king bed, and a pullout sofa in the living room.

You can pick out a coconut and they will cut it open for you so you can drink the water (very fun for kids). They also sell local fruit, awesome guacamole and other treats. It is not something you will find in Kaanapali. When we shopped there, we felt like locals. The other new thing is that due to the construction of the Westin Villas, there is now a boardwalk/path that you can use: I was able to take great walks every morning, with a beach view, stopping to whale watch.

First of all, you need to get your expectations in order. This place is not the Ritz- Carlton. Some people expect it to be and then get disappointed. This is a first rate resort, but it's not priced or advertised to compete against the luxury resorts. Having said that, this resort is very nice indeed. It has all the amenities you would expect from an upscale resort. There is a gym (for a fee, unfortunately), 2 pools that get somewhat crowded during the day, a sauna, a decent restaurant, a beachfront location, tennis, and barbecues available for grilling your own food. Rooms: We had a 2 bedroom condo with a kitchen. The rooms were owned by someone else who rented it out while they were not there. I would say the rooms were on par with a Hilton Garden Inn or that type of hotel. Some rooms were upgraded with granite counters but ours was not. The rooms are comfortable and spacious enough by most standards and came with a washer/dryer which was convenient. Service: Service at the resort is very good. Housekeeping was responsive to our requests and we were greeted by staff members if we saw one in the hallway. The front desk staff were courteous, helpful, and cheerful. We're not demanding travelers so I guess that's why we were so satisfied. Location: Fantastic. The resort is in Honokowai, just north of Kaanapali. Across the street is a super market and some decent but not spectacular restaurants. It was a quick 10 minute drive to Lahaina. The hotel was set back far enough so that you couldn't hear the street noise. I really liked this location a lot. Value: If you can get a package deal and the 2 bedroom condo, it's perfect for families. Cooking in the room and doing your own laundry will save a few dollars for a nice night out later on. Overall, we had a great time and would recommend this resort to others. I don't give many five stars except to Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton, etc. so this says a lot of about how I feel. Pros: Location and value. Internet was free, but it wasn't high speed. Cons: Service can be slow at times. Pool occasionally gets crowded. Quite a bit of nickel and diming, but it was expected so I can't complain much. Ex: parking fees, gym fees, room safe fees. Note: The reviewer has a family with 2 young kids. They travel twice a year and have stayed in the full range of resorts from crummy to five-star so they generally know what they are getting into.

The reason we choose this hotel is simple; It's a great location at a great price with great amenities. By choosing a suite you get a comfortable bedroom, living room, kitchen... and most importantly an in-room washer and dryer. This makes packing a lot easier (and cheaper considering the weight limits the airlines are enforcing). The staff has always been Excellent. Very friendly and helpful. Our rooms have always been clean and nicely kept. The grounds have also always been well maintained. The hotel is located on Kaanapali Beach, which is breathtaking. Each day we would walk the beach as the sun rose, and each day we were able to see whales from the shore (Traveled January-March). From the beach you also have a gorgeous view of two other islands - Lanai and Molikai. It is very romantic - and the best way we've found to unwind from our hectic daily lives. The hotel is minutes away from Lahaina - a fun town to shop and dine in, and where most whale watching and other tours originate from. Also, for convenience sake, it is across the street from a grocery store, Subway, and pizza place - something which came in very handy. it was nice to be able to just walk to these places. Maui is one of our favorite places, and the Kaanapali Shores is the perfect place for us to stay. The convenience, price, service and beauty of the place make it a natural choice for us.

We had two separate one bedroom condos not too far away from each other. The rooms were to be expected for a 3.5 star hotel, a bit older, but clean and had a comfortable king size bed and great pillows. The hotel staff were very friendly and gave advice about what to do and how to get to there. Our party rented a car from the airport and went to Costco to buy our week's worth of food before we set off to find the hotel. There is also a grocery store across the street from the hotel (which was convenient for grabbing a few things) although the prices are much higher then Costco. We went to the morning presentation which we did find informative, although do not expect too much of the breakfast because it is donuts and fruit and if you do not get there in time for the food it could be ate up. It is true about the rocky beach in front of the hotel but we found that our water shoes worked great. One thing that I wished we did the first day was rent the boogie boards (we waited and rented them later but to get the full use out of the rental you should rent them right away and they help when you are swimming with those big waves. You can rent them for a cheap weekly price across the street at the strip mall right next to the grocery store. Our second night we went to the Old Lahaina Luau. It was a beautiful setting, had great food and impressive dancing. I would suggest if you want to learn more about the culture and the history of the islands go to this luau, you will not be disappointed! There are a number of beaches not too far away that you can just drive to from the hotel. I suggest for your first trip, drive up around Kahana. If you want a great beach with parking, bathrooms and great waves for body boarding go to D.T. Fleming beach. Also if you continue up highway 30 there are a number of look offs and beaches to stop off at, great little drive. The whalers village is about a five minute drive from the hotel and if you want to walk it is about an hour. Park in the parking lot but make sure if you eat or buy anything there get your parking validated. There are two excellent shore front restaurants at the village to eat at and the prices were reasonable. We personally found that shopping along Front street in Lahaina was the best and cheapest. Also, along these shops are booths that book trips, the prices were much lower then the prices on the internet or through the hotel; we had already booked our trips so we did not investigate those but it might be worth while to look into during your first few days, prehaps you may save some money. We booked our Molokini and Turtle snorkel cruise through the hotel and it was great. We were booked with Pacific Whale foundation, which is an eco friendly operator and monies go to the non profit pacific whale foundation. The staff, food and drinks were great. And the trip to turtle arches was great, saw a number of turtles, one came so close I could have reached out and touched it. You could check them out on-line and see if the prices are different then offered through the hotel. The road to Hana...well it is an experience and a beautiful one at that. But it is a full day adventure so be prepared to go for the whole day. Make sure you pack some snacks and drinks for the ride and fill up on gas before you go. The main attraction about the trip is the road itself and the views. We brought a map and was hoping to easily find the stop offs indicated on the map but that was not easy because the road does not have any signs on it indicating were things are until closer to Hana. Therefore I would suggest buying the Road to Hana CD, I read that it gives you suggestions on where to stop and it will also be good to have something playing in the car because we could not get any radio stations to come in. Black beach is great near Hana and we all really enjoyed the Lava Tube walk. There are a number of golf courses near to the hotel that are beautiful. Prices are a little over two hundred dollars for the morning but if you book a twilight rate (after 1:00pm, the price drops quite a bit). Overall the trip was awesome, loved Maui and after driving around the island we all agreed that this hotel and its location was the nicest on the island.", "Date": "January 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, OR", "Title": "\u201cGreat Escape\u201d", "Author": "livetwotravel", "ReviewID": "UR23812171", "Content": "We booked a last minute trip through vacation-maui.com in mid-December and had a great time.

We took the Four Winds to Molikini and ended up trying snuba, which was fun. We ventured out on our own many days-Big Beach-near Wailea- is great, especially if it's a bit rainy in Lahaina, and Honolua Bay provided ok snorkeling. We drove from Kapalua around the North of the island to Pa'ia town, via the help of our Maui Revealed book, for nice stops (banana bread and the 'Iao Needle) and great scenery. The one lane road is an experience! If you can splurge, DO NOT miss Mama's Fish House in Pa'ia town for a meal. It is truly a culinary experience. We also went to Warren & Annabelle's dinner/magic show in lieu of a luau. Entertaining and good drinks. Good trip, but not long enough.

We had a wonderful time in Maui! This hotel was recommened to us by a friend and we booked our trip through a travel agent. We stayed in a 2 bedroom oceanview suite (room 714). The general setup of the hotel was perfect for us, however there were some little things that amounted up to something bigger that bothered us about it. I've listed below everything in Pros and Cons. Pros: -The washer/dryer in the room was a lifesaver for us! Yes, it was old and noisy but it worked and was better than going to a laundry mat. -The staff were very friendly. -Having the two pools was nice to choose from. There were lots of lounge chairs and they were kept clean, as were the grounds. The landscaping was very nicely done. -Being right on the beah was great. We walked the beach in both directions and the Kaanapali Shores had by far the nicest kept beach. -It was nice to have the convienience of Expedia on-site. -Having wireless was great. However, the best reception was out on the lanai, so we either had to use our laptop out there or very close to the sliding glass doors. -The convienence of having a grocery store right across the street was wonderful. Cons: -The pool towel service was very poor. Half of the time there weren't towels and when there were, the towels were either dirty or stained. They were actually very gross to use. -The maid service was inconsistent. One day it was early in the morning and another day we came back from time out at the beach/pool around 4:30 to find the maids just arriving at our room. We were wanting to get ready to go out for dinner. It would have been nice to have it done at the same time each day. -The construction/renovation noise! The hotel was undergoing renovations while we were there. My husband works as a general contractor and his comment was \"If I wanted to listen to a skil saw, I would have stayed home.\" -Speaking of renovations... we were able to see from the outside all the rooms that had been updated. However ours was NOT one of those nice rooms with granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, beautiful millwork for cupboards. We were in a room that looked like it was straight out of the 80's. The carpet was dingy and old. The kitchen appliances were older. The microwave didn't work. The only thing that looked new was the tile surround in the bathrooms. However the tile on the floors was moldy. The shower drain in the ensuite bathtub didn't work. And TWICE we had to call maintenance when the toilet in the main bathroom overflowed. All the shelving in both the kitchen and bathrooms were basically plywood that had been painted. -We were booked into an \"ocean view suite\". Yes we had a view of the ocean, however it was more like a \"garden view\" because our room was right outside the garden. It was a beautiful garden though! -Parking was $9.00 a day We booked this trip back in May of 2008. After spending all that money and having been reserved into that type of room that far aheah, I would have liked a newer, updated room. I have read some of the management's responses, and I don't feel that I should be penalized for booking through the safety and security of a travel agent (and my friend!) as opposed to if I had booked straight through ResortQuest. Plus, my travel agent had a better deal than what ResortQuest could offer. All in all, we had a wonderful trip. We made the best of it. I would recommend this hotel to family and friends on the condition that they ask specifically for an updated room.

We booked 3 condos in all -- 1 for us and 1 each for both our sons and their families. There were 11 of us in all. All units were supposed to be gardenview, our sons' were 2-bedroom units because of their families. I read many of the reviews before we left and was somewhat apprehensive. Upon our arrival, I did not feel well because of some bad airport food and more or less fell into bed. By morning, when I felt better and looked around more, it was obvious, we had not been given renovated units -- but ours seemed sufficient , though dated, and very clean. The view from our balcony was very pretty. When our second son arrived several days later, he was given the choice of an upgraded ocean front renovated unit for what seemed like a nominal fee or the unit his family was originally assigned. He and his wife looked at both units and decided to spend the extra money and took the ocean front renovated unit. It was beautiful and we could see the vast difference in renovated and non-renovated units. I checked with the desk later to see if our other son's family could also get a renovated unit and there was no problem at all getting them moved, and there was no charge. They were moved up higher up above the trees, so they had a partial view of the ocean, and their unit was beautiful also. Housekeeping was wonderful and very cooperative about helping them get moved. All we had to do was ask. Since I didn't intend to use the kitchen much anyway and our bathroom was just fine, my husband and I stayed in our original unit, but I'm sure we could have been moved if we would have asked. It was Christmas time, so Santa was there for the children. Pictures could be taken with him and the kids could decorate their picture frames. We were given lights to decorate our balconies however we wanted. Some people were very creative! We were treated to egg nog and cookies one evening. The lobby and grounds at the resort are just as beautiful as described by others on this website. It was a pleasure to walk through them. We ate at the restaurant occasionally and thought it was pretty good and wasn't any more expensive than most of the restaurants in the area. Kids only eat free for lunch! We enjoyed the beach, but there are reefs but you can learn to look out for them. It's not as traumatic as some make it out to be. Fleming Beach is just up the road about 10 minutes and there are no rocks there. The pizza place across the street is excellent and there is a MacDonald's 5 minutes away. The Star Market is good if you need something on the run, but Safeway's prices are much better. Kaanapali Shores is great for kids. Our grandkids loved it. They could swim and run and play. Beach chairs are at a premium, so you need to get there early in the morning if you want anywhere to sit for the rest of the day. Beach towels were abundant. We stay at timeshares frequently and never have maid service. What a treat! The staff is so nice too! If I'd change anything I'd include the parking fee in the room charge rather than making it separate. I'd also replace the light bulbs with a higher watt bulb. The dark shades, especially in the bedroom make it difficult to see. All in all, I don't know why I was so worried. I guess some people are never satisifed.

Signal was * terrible *, and considering I was there for work it was essentially worthless. Forget staying connected to your corporate VPN. In addition, the company that runs their internet support (which I called twice) had me on hold for 20 min both times, and I never even got to speak to an agent. Appliances looked run down, and like they were purchased in the 70's. 2 of the 4 oven burners were worthless as they were too off-balance to use.

The plastic knob that adjusts the water temp in the shower was broken so that I was stuck with the temp of the water, which fortunately was at least luke-warm. Both the shower drain and the bathroom sink drain backed up each time I used them. There were lots of little bugs, the gnat-y kind that you see around rotten fruit. They were incredibly annoying and ubiquitous. You had to pay $9/day for parking. The hotel tries to convince you this is a great deal by telling you \"you can come in and out as many times a day as you like\" All-around tacky and out-dated design. The birds! Oh my god, the birds! The numerous trees in the courtyard of the hotel apparently attract THOUSANDS of birds in the morning and evening hours, and the cacophony was so loud that I literally had to close the sliding glass doors to have a conversation on the phone. I have never heard such a loud assembly of birds in my life. Luckily my bedroom was on the opposite side of the room from the courtyard, or I would not have been able to sleep past whatever time in the a.m. they started to congregate. Now, to be fair, there was a few positive things about the hotel: Nice lobby. Friendly staff. VERY conveniently located across the street from restaurants, coffee shop, grocery store, dive shop, and bar. All in all, a very disappointing experience.

The owners were very detailed in their explanation of the room and resort, so we knew exactly what we were getting. They provided everything we needed for the week. The room was perfect for us, with a bit of an ocean view. It is not on the sunny side of the building, which was fine because the room stayed cool, a definite plus in this climate. The restaurant had good service, but the food is just o.k. The restaurant at the resort beside (The Beach Club) is way better. The staff is helpful and friendly. Servers will walk around the pool to serve food and drinks. They have small shops where you can buy food, alcohol, bathing suits, clothes, hats, gifts...etc. They also have a salon for hair and nails. You can walk along the beach for miles. We definitely recommend this place, but if you book through the resort, ask for an updated room. The Old Lahaini Luau was excellent. Go early to enjoy the activities, including a lesson on how to dance by one of the beautiful dancers. The road to Hana was fabulous. Take a motion sickness pill if you get car sick. We went all the way around which we recommend. The newly opened road was great. The helicopter tour was pretty good. You see the crater from above and many waterfalls. Our favourite restaurant was the Pacific'O in Lahaina. Right on the water, the food and service was perfect. Bubba Gumps was fun for lunch.

We were celebrating our 25th anniversary. This trip turned out to be one of the best vacations we've ever had. I was a bit nervous about having to find our way to the hotel from the airport on the north side of the island at 12:00 at night. We picked up our Mustang convertible at the airport, rolled the top down and a leisurely 45 minutes later, we arrived at the hotel just as they had reassured me we would. Resortquest Kaanapali Shores turned out to be a perfect match for us. The one bedroom oceanview was clean and comfortable with a nice big king size bed. The kitchen had everything you needed, stove, frig, microwave, coffeemaker, kettle, pans, utensils, etc. The washer/dryer combo was handy too. Our maid service everyday was great. Lots of big fluffy towels always supplied. Room was always spotless. Very nice ladies. One little glitch though, you have to make sure that the sliding balcony doors are locked and pushed all the way to the left side to get the air conditioner to work. You'll hear it click on after a minute. The Star Market across the street is so convenient. It was not worth it to drive to Lahaina to go to the Safeway store there. The beach was very nice. Be careful of the rocks in some sections of the water. You can walk in quite easily if you go to the left of the beach and enter where the chain of red buoys are in the water. We toured the whole island and found that we were quite happy with our choice of hotel. Some of the other hotels I had been looking at would not have had as convenient beach access. Of course, there were others that looked fantastic too. We went to the Old Lahaina Luau, the most authentic luau on the island. It was a terrific show with great food and drinks. It is one of the most popular shows and you should reserve your seats a couple of weeks before you arrive. It doesn't apply to the 2 for 1 luau offers but it is well worth the extra money. Next door to the Lahaina Luau is their sister restaurant, The Aloha Mixed Plate which serves typical Hawaiian meals at really low prices. Great for a little snack with a seaside setting. For more upscale dining, we enjoyed Sansei restaurant and the Plantation Clubhouse in the Kapalua golf complex and Kimo's in Lahaina. The Hula Grill at Whaler's Village is great too with a fantastic setting for sunset dinners. There was great snorkelling at Black Rock - had a huge sea turtle come right over my shoulder there. Best spots are close to the rock walls and around the tip of the outcropping. Be careful of the waves though, visibility can be low when it's not calm and there are lots of coral and rocks you can get pushed into. Another great place was Honolua Bay near Kapalua. It's a rock beach though but well worth it. It was very calm and clear when we went there. Lots of tour boats take snorkelling groups there. The best area to see fish and coral is on the right side of the bay, north side. There isn't a sign to indicate where to stop for Honolua bay but you'll notice a lot of cars parked on the road and in a small parking area in a really lush valley near Kapalua. The bay isn't visible from the road, you have to follow a nature trail down to the water. Don't miss Iao State Park, Haleakala crater and the road to Hana which you should leave really early in the morning for. You don't want to drive back in the dark on all those hairpin turns. On the way to Lahaina, not far from the hotel there's a place called CJ's Diner in the Fairway Mall. They will pack a beautiful picnic lunch for you when you go on these long drives. For $5 they will supply you with a styrofoam cooler to use while you are in Maui. You just drop it off when you're done and get your deposit back. It's really convenient since some of the places can be a bit remote with no food or drinks available. We had the best vacation ever. We felt safe at all times.

From the first when we pulled up after a long day of traveling and late flights, we were welcomed with warm smiles & what we've come to understand is the true Aloha spirit. This genuine hospitality continued throughout our entire 10 night stay. When our daughter became ill, and we needed to delay our departure for several days the hotel staff responded with flexibility and compassion. They allowed us to stay on in our room at very short notice even though the hotel was booked to capacity (including our room). They gave us the best possible rate for the room during our extended stay as well. These were real ways that that a big resort owned by a big corporation showed that they cared for us as guests and valued our business. Very impressive! The day to day care from housekeeping, front desk, grounds keeping, restaurant staff, bell desk were all exceptional as well. At no time were we ever made to feel like we were inconveniencing staff, or that we were an interruption to their day. Quite the contrary, we felt like we were the reason they were there; to give us the best vacation time possible. The resort itself was perfect for us, a family of five. The condo rooms were spacious and well appointed without being stuffy or formal. The full kitchen was a real treat to have at hand, and it was stocked with all the hardware needed to prepare and eat meals. There is also a full grocery store across the street, and shops on the hotel's ground floor offering whatever a vacationing family might need at reasonable prices. This is a wonderful place for families with kids from very young to teenagers. There is quite a bit of information right at the hotel about what to do while in Maui. Especially recommended is the orientation breakfast your first morning there. Yeah, it's a bit of a sales pitch, but if you're new to Maui you'll get some important info & discounts. The resort grounds are beautiful, tastefully done and conveniently arranged. The moment we pulled in the driveway we knew we had made the right accommodations choice. Luxurious, easy on the eyes and easy-going would be a good way to put our first impression. The pool/garden/restaurant area between the high-rises was also a delightful place. Walks along the well manicured lawns with little streams, waterfalls and the abundance and variety of trees and shrubs are some of my favorite memories. Add 2 pools, 2 jacuzzi, the amazing beach and a gorgeous sunset and you have a pretty well wrapped package. Another little thing that I liked as a husband and father was that I never felt afraid to let my wife and three teenage daughters roam around the grounds after dark.

I was tired and frustrated so I did not argue. When I got to my unrenovated room on the 5th flr I was disappointed. We were overlooking the back parking lot and the appliances/furniture were outdated. I called the front desk and asked for a room on a higher flr--I was told that it would take a few days to move to a room on a higher floor. We survived in our room and later moved to the renovated room for the last 2 days of our trip (the renovated room was amazing) However, the entire time I regretted canceling my reservations at Aina Nalu. So, while I will be back in Maui next year (it's that amazing) I will not be staying at KS--too much money to gamble with the chance of KS not honoring a request for a renovated room. I will instead stay at Ainu Nalu where all the rooms are beautiful. I wish that KS, resortquest more specifically, would attempt to do more to please their customers. We all know that a trip to Maui is pretty expensive. A room can make or break a vacation. And Btw--I've realized that a stellar review will usually pop up after a not so good review.

Overall it is a beautiful hotel with great grounds and excellent beach access (crystal clear water with great snorkeling right in front of your hotel!). This time around however we are fairly disappointed to put it lightly. Upon entering our room we noticed a musty smell throughout. Brushed it off as needing to open the windows and doors (which bedroom windows do not open in any of the rooms apparently) to get a little cross ventilation through out the hotel room. We gave it 2 days and in the evening of day 2 after my daughter and mother in law sleeping in the musty room had aquired runny noses, headaches and hacking coughs we said enough and called the front desk. My husband and I both are general managers in the service industry and here are our main points of contention: 1. The guest comfort and safety should be a priority. We were not listened to and were definitely not a priority. 2. Your word should be followed through on. When you say someone will help to move our 6 bags of luggage and 4 bags of groceries to a different room, it should be followed thorugh on. Instead we waited for a new room for 9 hours. Were not called but instead rushed out of the original room only to be told to \"call us when you are out\". No follow through and again poor customer service. 3. Although we did get another room (seemlingly smaller than our original), we had then spent 9 hours waiting in the same musty/mildew ridden room. The bigger issue is that the manager should have addressed it with us the guest after the 4th time that we contacted the front desk. Instead when we walked down to the front desk, the manager sat in the back office and allowed the same front desk gentleman to tell us we will contact you when it is ready, but it will be somewhere around 3 p.m. No one ever did call our room. We were alerted when housecleaning came up to clean out the original room. An appology and a simple sense of urgency is all that was needed. We spent the beginning of our once a year family vacation waiting for a hotel room that should have been fine from day one. We were made to feel as if they were doing us a favor!!! 4. In addition, the carpets really need to be steam cleaned. We could not walk on the floors unless wearing flip flops due to the soles of our feet becoming covered with dirt from the carpet. It would be our hope that in the future the guest is their first priority and that such issues would be taken more seriously. Guests should be listened to and management should have better follow through and not allow guests to feel as if they are one on a list of 15 to \"deal\" with that day. Even if they in fact are. That follow through on commitments made should be the rule and not the exception. And finally that upkeep on the rooms in the hotel go beyond everyday cleaning as the air in the first room that we stayed in is not suitable for any person(s).", "Date": "September 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cMEMORABLE EXPERIENCE!\u201d", "Author": "Zampa-Aiea", "ReviewID": "UR18936825", "Content": "I surprised my husband for his birthday with a Hawaii Superferry ride to Maui and a weekend at the ResortQuest Kaanapali Shores!

It was a short drive to our Luau at the Hyatt and the Trilogy sunset cruise. The beach was short but very pretty and clean. The pools were nicely kept and there was always a chair available. The rooms were spacious and clean with a comfy bed! We were in a unit that had just been remodeled. The only trouble we had with the room was a closet door came off the hinges. We called the front desk and it was fixed the next morning. It was a great convenience to have a washer/dryer in the unit. We did a lot of hiking and it was nice to wash our clothes immediately. Our room included a $100 credit at the beach club, the on site restaurant. I read some poor reviews about the restaurant before we left. We experienced great meals and service at a reasonable price. We ate breakfast there twice and lunch three times for a little over $100! The macadamia nut pancakes and kalua pork are delicious! I would recommend this resort to anyone who wants to be away from large crowds of tourists but close enough to enjoy the activities on Kaanapali beach. If you are taking a sailing trip I would recommend spending a little extra and go through Trilogy sailing company. They are very personable and they do not over crowd the boats. We did a sunset cruise and it was just breathtaking. They serve delicious hearty appetizers and you can bring your own bottle of wine! If you book a tour before you leave you can save 10% by booking on line. If you want to attend one of the more famous luaus be sure to book a few weeks before you leave. We ended up using a buy one get one luau coupon from our resort. I called the resort to make the reservation for us the week before we left. We went to the Drums of the Pacific luau. It was fabulous. The narrator told the history of the island as the performers danced. The food was good and the mai tais were watery but the pineapple rum drinks were excellent. We had an amazing time on maui!

I feel that this was a terrific value for the $. Following are the goods and bads in my opinion. I felt that the GARDEN AREA was fantastic- traditional-coy pond two standard pools, 2 spas walking trails that travers the area. I'm understanding that they may be removeing some of this for an up-to-date swimming park; I hope not. Next on the list of good things was the at RESORT SHOPPING--They have several small stores on the lower level which include everything from groceries to clothing. All items were very competivly priced. There is shopping across the street but the prices are about the same although drinks were cheeper across the street. The last good value, was the RESORT RESTURANT. The food as compared to other high end resturants was fantastic-everything from fresh fish-n-chips to catch-of-the-day with fresh veggie and 5 star sauces--the price, better than outside resturants. burgers to fancy meals, 11 to 25 $. We eat out several times but we seemed to always go back to the resort resturant. Sorry to say there were some issues with our stay. First, our room was in the (left side as view facing the beach) wing of the resort (7th floor); garden room. It had a nice view of the beach that was a plus, but the AC DID NOT FUNCTION the entire time--no biggy as the room had a small window on the parking lot side and a very large lani sideing door window on the garden/beach side. The problem was the NOISE. The noise on the pool side just echoed between the two wings, and for whatever reason the parking lot noise just seemed to jump into that small window; not sure why. Second not so good item was the beach. It was OK to average, but from the water line out was mixed rocks with sand. You must have water shoes and watch the knees; you will come back with skin up knees. It's fine if you just want to wade to cool off, but forget body suring and be careful if boogie boarding. The last item of issue was our arrangements for a suttle ride back to the airport. Sam (bellman), did great job arranging a taxi van for what they call the \"SUTTLE RATE\". The problem was that instead of the quoted price of $75.00 for four adults at the end of the 40 minute drive, the driver (who by the way was not the registered licensed person), tried to charge us $94.10. He claimed the he didn't understand english. We even asked him when we got in the van that this was going to be $75--he just knodded. When we got to the airport, it was not until I took his hand-held radio and tried to contact his boss before he excepted the $75. It seemed to us that he was using some elses van and was trying to get the metered rate instead of the quoted rate. Lesson learned verify with your driver before you load up, the actual cost of the shuttle.

I could live there no problem..First of all the bedrooms have one king and one queen even though the web site says they only have twins in the spare.. We went as two adult couples so this was very important.. The bathrooms are nice and big and the kitchen was stocked with all your needs.. So in the end keep in mind as far as rooms go they aren't all perfect so make sure you either pay for the better ones up front or as we did you can always risk it and hope for the upgrade if it is available when you get there.. If you book through the hotel you can make sure you specify you want renovated rooms only and we suggest you ask for 737.. Thanks to all the staff at the shores for making our stay so wonderful..WE WILL RETURN!!!!!!", "Date": "June 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central California", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed the Aloha Suite\u201d", "Author": "RelaxWhenPossible", "ReviewID": "UR16884771", "Content": "If you are able to book an aloha suite you will find great views and plenty of room.

The free hula show on Wed. nights is also a special treat. I thought the beach in front of the hotel was just fine. There was a very wide, sandy area, free from rocks for swimming. One of my only complaints is that they nickel and dime you for everything. Parking is $9 a day, use of the safe is $2 a day. Charge for any call outside the hotel, local or not. We tried to make coffee one day but the unit did not have a measuring spoon to measure the coffee. They do supply you with one single use packet but we used that the first day.

The hotel is located close enough to whaler's village for restaurants and shops and most amenities are close by - STAR Market was good (across the street from hotel). Clarify which room you want and I would suggest trying to get 4th floor and above with garden views as most have reasonable ocean views regardless (unless you want the full ocean view). We originally were given a standard room with terrible smells from the canal as well as loud construction noises, and the hotel lobby staff was LESS than sympathetic. So after 1 night we decided on paying for the upgrade; which was on the south side and the trade off was no smells but a lot of outside early am noise with tour busses and garbage trucks in the early A.M. The other family with us had no problems with their room (north side garden view 5th floor), but again the cold response from the front desk upset us. The renovated rooms are nice, but having tried both, my reccommendation would be to work on location rather than renovation. Overall, pools were cold (!) with the lower pool being slightly warmer. The ocean/beach was considerably warmer, and as others have noted, partially sandy with rocks - but the kids had fun. Clean towels in the pool area were hard to come by for the 1st 2 days but they got better. Late checkout was a pipe dream (I stood behind 2 others asking the same thing) which was probably more about departure timing, but they make you wait until 8:30 the night before to get a response. Again, front desk was not at all sympathetic about our plight and I walked away understanding why they couldn't give the room, but more irritated with the cold response I got from the staff - Though they did mention other showers, travelling on a 9PM flight with a 5 year old could have been made easier with an afternoon rest. Overall not a bad spot for first time families with young kids, but not sure about others unless you want to drive everywhere for restaurants, etc. (hotel parking is $9$/Day) Kids club was mediocre and we were with 3 kids 5, 7,9 and none wanted to go back a second day. Gym is just ok, but for $10/day I would have expected something slightly better than old treadmills, 2 elipticles, 2 bikes and no ventilation.

Our kitchen appliances were pretty old, but they worked just fine. The room was clean and comfortable. We had an ocean view, only partially obstructed by a building. We were on the top floor (9). We also had a great view of the courtyard area and one of the pools (the quieter one, thankfully!) The pools (2) were nice. The pool nearest the beach was heated and fenced in, and therefore was the most crowded (lots of kids). The farther back pool was much cooler. Both pool areas had jacuzzis. This was definitely a family resort. If you're looking for a very quiet, couples-only hotel this may not be the place for you. As others have reported, the beach right outside the hotel was rocky. We wore water shoes, but you still had to watch your step and go slowly. While we were there, the ocean was kind of rough (at least for us midwesterners!) so we didn't do much ocean swimming there. The beach was a great spot for sunsets and whale watching. One night we saw a whale breach 7 times just about 100 yds out! Across the street was a mini mall with a grocery store and a few restaurants and shops. We ate at Java Jazz a few times (yummy). We did drive to get to most other things. It was about a 5-10 minute drive to Whaler's Village, and about 15 mins to Lahaina. We kind of liked that this hotel wasn't in such a crowded area. There is a restaurant/bar on the property.

The bar and restaurant staff were very friendly, professional, and a delight to talk to (even when our daughter decided to show us again what she had for lunch all over the floor). Your support staff are also extremely professional, friendly and helpful. I would appreciate it if you could pass my compliments on to your staff, as they really did an excellent job. I would also like to thank you personally for arranging the later checkout from our room, it made the trip back to Houston with the little ones so much less stressful.

The palm trees will block that view that you're paying extra for, if you stay under the forth floor. Ocean view rooms are FAR from the parking lot. If you begin your trip at Costco (like we did) or have a lot of luggage, drive directly to the front of the hotel and let the bell hop take everything up for you (money WELL spent). The beach in front of the property is rocky. Bring water shoes. Or, walk to the beach in front of the next-door property (about a 30 second walk).

We stayed 4 nites in an 2- bedroom ocean-front condo booked through VRBO and five nites in a 1-bedroom ocean-view condo booked through the resort. The VRBO property was the better deal but was only available for part of our stay - it was actually less expensive even though it was bigger, had a nicer view and had a closet full of boogie boards, snorkeling sets and beach toys. It pays to check around. Condos: Yes, as some of the reviews have pointed out, certain parts of the condos seemed a little dated and worn, however both were clean, spacious and comfortably furnished. Both had nice lanais and beautiful views - we watched humpback whales every morning. Restaurant: Food was good although some items seemed a little pricey for what you got (skimpy appetizers especially). But it was convenient, consistent, fast (which is nb when you travel with a child), and the $100 restaurant credit helped. We liked the fish dishes in particular. We usually ate breakfast in our room so mainly used the restaurant for the odd lunch or dinner. Grounds/Pools: The grounds are lovely as are the two pools and hot tubs. We hung out at both pools. The only downside is that the chairs get taken quickly in the mornings, but we usually found a place to settle. Rented the shaded cabana chairs one day which are nice but the resort should really invest in new chair pads. Beach: The beach was nice to walk along, but had too many rocks in the water to go swimming, so we checked out different beaches around the island and in particular liked Wailea and Kaanapali beach (south of the resort). We also liked 3 beaches north of the resort which have calm bays with kid-friendly waves - Napili Bay, Kapalua and D.T. Fleming.

For the same price, there seems to be many other higher quality resorts around. We went with a group that had two condos - one was a 2 bedroom oceanfront and one was a 2 bedroom garden view. To begin with, even though the rooms were booked about 5 months in advance, by the same person, under the same name, they were on opposite sides of the hotel, not even in the same building. I was lucky enough to be in the ocean front room, with an absolutely beautiful view and plenty of room to spread out. We were on the second floor and quickly learned that renovations were being done on the first floor, which began with drilling and pounding at 7 am. While the first day or two was manageable, as we were still on mainland time, this quickly became old, and very aggravating when you spend a large amount of money to have a nice relaxing vacation. Every time we went downstairs, we had to check to see whether to take the stairs of the elevator because inevitably, one or the other was blocked by equipment, etc. The view from the room was beautiful though. The garden view room had a severe cockroach problem. With at least one being killed in the room daily, and several more spotted in the hallways. This room was also missing several kitchen utensils/appliances. The beach at this resort is sandy and long, but very narrow with a steep slope down to the water. The water was warmer than any other beach we went to, but not very suitable for swimming. In addition, there is a bad current of some sort, marked by two bright orange buoys that we were warned to steer clear of. The service varied at this resort.

This was awesome and super convenient for our kids; they just walked out on the lanai and on to the huge grassy hotel grounds where they could hop on over to the pool or beach, look for geckos and frogs in the bushes or pet the cats that seem to live there. Our suite was very comfortable and plenty big enough for our family of five and I loved having a washer and drier. The restaurant is decent and we were given a $100 credit there when we booked. True, the pools are much smaller and less elaborate than some fancier hotels (check out my photos and review of the Westin) but my kids had a great time in them just the same. Housekeeping service was spotty but we were out so much enjoying ourselves that we didn't care. Very quiet at night except for the rattling air conditioner but it wasn't that big of a deal. Gorgeous grounds and lobby, great little store on the main floor. I highly recommend you attend the free breakfast/information session in the lobby put on by Expedia once a week. We learned a lot about the island from the presentation and got some very good deals on excursions by a very knowledgeable booking agent. A couple of things I didn't like about the hotel: - you are charged $6 a day or thereabouts for the safe in your room even if you don't use it. What's with that? Many hotels provide this for free. - they also charge $9 a day to park your car there which is also crazy. The Westin lets you park for free or will have the valet do it for that price. - the beach at the hotel is not the best. The waves are quite rough, there is a bit of a dangerous shorebreak, and there is lots of sharp coral right under the surface. Too rough to snorkel and too much coral for boogie boarding. We tried to do both several times and finally gave up when my son cut his foot badly on some coral. There are so many great beaches nearby that I recommend you go elsewhere (DT Fleming for boogie boarding/surfing or Honolua bay, Black Rock, Turtle Arches, or Napili Bay for snorkeling for example). Another word of caution: unless you are very interested in buying a time share, do not get sucked into going to the presentation even if they offer $100 off on your excursions. We caved and went to the timeshare thing; BIG mistake. The first thing the guy said was that it wasn't a high pressure sales pitch and that he would accept no as graciously as yes. Well, we sat there for the required 90 minutes and said no, and as soon as that happened the guy got annoyed and called over his boss and she tried to get us to sign on. When we still said no, they both got quite rude and accusatory and it all ended badly with us marching out and them not even saying thank you or good bye. I guess this is what all those time share presentations are like but we hadn't been to one for a long time. We learned our lesson. It is not worth your 90 minutes or the $100 credit, especially when there are so many other things you want to do with your time when you are on the beautifuly island of Maui.", "Date": "January 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cTotally Spectacular Stay!!\u201d", "Author": "jboydcalifornia", "ReviewID": "UR12606756", "Content": "We stayed at the resortquest Kaanapali shores from 12/28/07 thru 1/2/08.

I had read some poor reviews, not very many and most of the reviews were ALL good, but I was still a bit worried. I was VERY VERY happy when we got to the resort. It was all and MORE than we expected. We had 4 condo units with ocean view. Rooms 737 and 752 were remodeled and were very luxurious.

She did a fantastic job, and was very resonably priced. She also helped us get tickets for the Warren and Annabele magic show. That show was amazing and it is at the top of my list for things to do while in Maui. None of us could figure out how he did the things he did and to top it off, he is incredibly funny. This show sells out weeks in advance, so you will need reservations. The pools were very spacious and clean. There were a lot of people there, but we never felt crowded. The bar/restaurant are right beside the big pool and are good about coming to check and see if you want anything. The bar also has a tv and a lot of the guys were watching the football game.

Now I ALWAYS book travel myself online and I NEVER use a travel agent, but surprisingly, the travel agent was able to get me a better price for a flight/car/hotel package than I would have gotten online. That being said, I have a tendency to always try to book the finest hotel out there, but when I began to research prices, I just didn't want to spend $500/night at the Westin or Hyatt for the 5 star experience. Many of my friends have stayed at the aforementioned, however for the same total price, I was able to stay 3 or 4 days longer for the same total price, which I would highly recommend. When I originally booked the hotel, I was a little confused how the place operated since they are supposedly individually owned units. Let me tell you that this place is a HOTEL. The lobby is gorgeous, the landscaping is unreal, the staff is over-the-top, there is housekeeping, a concierge, and you have the ability to charge meals and services to your room... From a guest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perspective, the place operates no differently than any other resort. We checked into the hotel at night, after a LONG flight from Buffalo, and after a quick and easy check-in, we were shown to our 6th floor studio room. I did offer the check-in clerk $50 for a room upgrade, but he told me the hotel was booked, which was understandable considering it was early July. When I booked, I opted for the studio because it was cheaper, and since there were only two of us, room size was not an issue. We entered the room and were extremely impressed. Hardwood floors, new Tommy Bahama furniture, much nicer than a typical hotel room, and larger also. The kitchenette was well equipped, and although we had good intentions at the outset, we really didn't put it to use. The bed was a Murphy bed (pull down from the wall) and was reasonably comfortable. The screened in balcony was nice, and although it wasn't considered a premium view, it wasn't a bad view. Housekeeping came everyday to sweep up the sand, make the bed, and deliver new towels. We didn't take advantage of too many of the services at the resort although there were plenty (salon, gift shops, massage, gym) we did however spend a fair amount of time at the Beach Club Restaurant. I must say that this is not your typical hotel restaurant. My wife and I went there for breakfast almost everyday. The food was EXCELLENT and INEXPENSIVE. Breakfast for the two of us averaged about $20 for the both of us. There was a cheery waiter by the name of Myeron who often served us, and some of my best Hawaiian memories are of looking out at the ocean, eating French toast with coconut syrup with my wife at the Beach Club. We never ate any other meal there, but I did sip many a Mai Tai (nice happy hour specials) from the Beach Club bar while hanging at the pool or beach, which is just steps away. The beach here is PERFECT. I read a few reviews here that the beach is rocky and such, but I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nonsense. This stands up to any of the beaches in Florida, and I think some people just need to find a flaw. The beach isn't extremely deep, but it never felt crowded. It is the beach you think of when you think paradise. There are two pools here, one in the courtyard, closer to the hotel, and another pool between the beach and the Beach Club restaurant. I never went to the first pool, only the second, and it was great. I was afraid because of the price there would be a ton of obnoxious kids, but surprisingly there were few. Waiters came around to take drink orders which was nice as well. In terms of location, the hotel was in a nice spot. There are two stretches of Kaanapali Beach; one North of Black Rock and one South of Black Rock. This hotel is North of Black Rock. This is definitely the quieter stretch. The fancier hotels (Hyatt, Westin) are on the South stretch as is Whalers Village. There is also a nice path that stretches along the South stretch in front of all those hotels. I have to admit that it would have been nice to be on that stretch, but not that nice that I would have paid more to be there. It is a two minute drive there from the North Stretch, which we did a few nights. You cannot walk to that stretch along the beach for various reasons. In terms of where to stay on the island, Kaanapali Beach/Lahaina is where you want to be. We spent a lot of time exploring the island and believe me, there is a reason why Kaanapali is the older section; if you had the undeveloped island to yourself, the most desirable place to build a resort would be Kaanapali, hands down. There is a reason that all the newer developments are in Wailea, because that is the part of the island that nobody wanted. Still nice, but nothing compared to Kaanapali. Do yourself a favor and stay away from Kihei and Wailea. NO DOUBT, I will go back to Maui and stay at the Kaanapali Shores, no doubt. Not the finest hotel on Maui for sure, but the cost savings will allow you to extend your stay, and you'll be glad you did. This is as nice as a hotel I have ever stayed in, and I have done a good amount of traveling. I'll finish up with a few DO's and DON'T's for your Maui stay: DO's: Do stay at the Resortquest Kaanapali Shores Do eat breakfast at the Beach Club restaurant Do purchase the book Maui Revealed. The restaurant reviews are spot on Do snorkel at Black Rock. Park at the Sheraton, rent the gear at the shack on the beach for $5 or whatever and snorkel Do the road to Hana, just don't stay there (see my review of the Hana Maui Kai) Do rent a convertible Do eat dinner at Roys, Plantation House, David Paul's Do Bike down the Volcano. I understand that they have suspended that trip, but if they continue it, do it. My wife hasn't rode a bike in years, she was nervous, and it turned out to be the highlight of her, and my, trip DON'T's: Don't stay anywhere else but Kaanapali Don't do the snorkel to Molokini trip (see my review of the Pacific Whale Foundation Four Winds II) save your money and snorkel at Black Rock Don't eat at Cheesburger in Paradise.

We all loved this condo. It was a huge 1 bedroom condo about 1000 sq ft with a large lanai with beautiful ocean view. We were upgraded to penthouse ocean view cuz our plane was late. Our luck. The condo is dated but very adequate and functional. What do people expect for the price which was very reasonable. The kitchen is formica not granite but fully equipped with dishes, pots and pans and glasses. The furniture is Hawaiian bamboo wicker chic but we like that, we are in Hawaii!! We found the staff very friendly and accomdating. I called for a blender to make my pina colodas and housekeeping brought it in 5 minutes. The lobby staff were very helpful and friendly. Our last day they let us check out late at 2 pm and held our luggage and gave us shower priveleges at 5pm after swimming to catch our late flight. We only ate one meal. breakfast at the resort and we loved it. I had the mac nut pancakes and portuguese sausage for 8.95 and my husband had eggs benedict for 11.95, we had excellent drinks by the pool for $6 and on wed nite they had a nice hawaiian show with $2 rum drinks. We were busy every day with sight seeing and did not spend that much time during the day enjoying the condos but did enjoy the pool and jazucci at night to relax. We all talked that next time we would like to enjoy the condo more but we wanted to see all of Maui. We usually cooked our breakfast each morn and packed picinic lunchs and cooked simple bbq 2x in the condo, they have grills by the tennis courts. My husband and son loved the tennis courts. We shopped for groceries across the street at Star Market and at Safeway and Foodland in Lahaina; they were higher than here but I expected even higher prices. Shop what is on sale and what the locals eat and drink. Diary and sodas were high, the hawaiian brand soda and pog juice was cheap but no diet drinks on sale. Beer was $7 a 6 pack, pineapple and mangos cheap. The lobby and grounds were beautiful. The beach was nice with lounge chairs but there were other beaches in Maui we liked better. We walked to both condos on either side and liked this one the best.Walk across the street to Java Jazz for good music at nite.

Great room, a comfortable one-bedroom condo on the 9th floor. Lots of space and a decent kitchen. View of ocean, beach, and the resort to the north. The noisy side of the resort, it seemed. Most of the units faced into the quiet and pretty courtyard, with its gardens, 2 pools, hot tub, and beach. Weather: a lot of wind, a little rain each day until the last two. Pleasantly warm through our week. Hotel has a single, minimal bar, unlike the Mexican all-inclusives we've done in the past. Everything costs extra, of course. The restaurant was a disappointment on the first night. Our calamari appetizer was cooked in a bread-crumb coating, unlike the batter-fried style that we love at Greek restaurants. It was served, not with seafood sauce, but with a generic pizza-tomato sauce. The ahi tuna appetizer, au contraire, was delicious. The biggest disappointment was the pathetic wine list. As dedicated winos, we found the California wine selection at the Star Market across the street wonderful, and at prices generally less than what we pay in BC. Furthermore, one can do take-out from the hotel restaurant! Try the opakapaka (pink snapper, I believe) - lovely in your own room with a nice Sauvignon Blanc from the market. The \"Japanese-named seafood restaurant 2 blocks to the north\" (mentioned by a previous reviewer) seems to be gone. Still across the road is the Mexican establishment, where we had a great breakfast on day one. We meant to try dinner there, but ran out of days. Our activities included a bus tour to Hana ($120 each) and a snorkeling trip with the Whale Foundation ($80 ea). Both were worthwhile. Downside is that one feels obligated to accept the $100 rebate which is offered in exchange for a 2-hour time-share sales pitch. The Aquarium is worth a couple of hours.

The kitchen was perfect and we had everything we needed. The beach is nice for sunning or playing on the beach, but not really for swimming. The pools are very old looking. The grounds of the place are immaculately maintained and are beautiful. I cannot recommend the restaurant whatsoever, as the several times we tried it, it was consistantly awful. Even the drinks were bad. I guess this probably does not sound like a great review of the place but I would recommend it if you are travelling with children. It is perfect for families. Also, it would be great for anyone who can get a good price and if you have a car and don't mind going to other places to enjoy other activities. There are two great take out places nearby. As you exit the resort, make a left and go about 2 blocks and in a strip mall, you will see 2 little places, one of which the name is japanese (but the food is grilled fish, pasta, etc) and the other is the Maui Fish Market (I think that was the name.) We got a lot of our meals from there and took them back and ate them on the balcony since we have a toddler and dining out with her is rough.

The condo was nice in a bamboo/tropical decor, the gardens/grounds were BEAUTIFUL and everything was very clean. The kitchen had everything needed to prepare meals but we didn't do any cooking- just stocked the fridge with drinks and fruit and of course had my coffee on the lanai every morning. The location was good and a friendly staff. The Beach Club restaurant was reasonably priced and had pretty good food. We got a great package deal from Costco that included a $100.00 restaurant credit so that was helpful. The pool by the restaurant and beach was always packed but there is another one closer to the main courtyard. They are a bit small but hey it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Maui so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather be frolicking in the ocean anyway! The hot tub was very small for the size of the resort and always full so we never bothered to enter it. We enjoyed the beach but there were alot of leaves and twigs that washed up on the shore a couple of days so we explored some other beaches like at Kapalua Bay. Kahekili Beach is very nice too- it's just south of the resort (but north of Kaanapali beach) with an ample FREE parking lot, restroom and showers. It was our first trip to Maui so we tried to see and do alot but also made time to enjoy the beaches. We rented snorkel gear at Boss Frogs up the road and the guy tried to get us to sign up for a time share presentation. What's that about? Next time it's Snorkel Bobs! Be warned most places in Maui hit you with paid parking but many shops/restaurants will validate for 2 hrs. (which isn't very long to do anything!) After attending the morning continental breakfast/Expedia presentation for helpful hints about activities we booked the Royal Lahaina Luau@ $63pp which we really enjoyed. We also booked the Skytrek trip, which is a van-tour that takes 6 people on the road to Hana, included a picnic lunch at Hana and then a helicopter ride over Haleakala crater. This was way overpriced at $279.00 pp. The Expedia expert made it sound like a really fancy luxurious trip for $279pp which we would NEVER normally spend but since it was our 26th wedding anniversary and our first nice vacation in years we went for it. The \"luxury\" van was just a van with leather seats, the weather wasn't very good so we didn't get to swim which wasn't a big deal but they don't mention the MOSQUITOS everywhere! I had about 15 or so bites which I got to enjoy for the rest of my vacation. They also walked us through what was supposed to be a flower farm but was really just a path around some trees and a few flowers and lots of moquistos with a tiny shop with overpriced lotions and trinkets and the end. The \"gourmet\" lunch was really terrible cold food and not enough of it (we are NOT picky eaters!). Our driver was kind and full of information about the island and pointed out alot of interesting things. You may not enjoy the Hana experience without a guide to give you some history.The helicopter ride was terrifying for me but my husband loved it and overall we were actually glad we did that part of it. Just be warned this trip isn't what it's cracked up to be AT ALL so save your money and book a cheaper tour or drive it yourself with the help of a guidebook like Maui Revealed- I found that very helpful on our trip. We hit the Maui Ocean Center on our way to the airport- great aquarium though a little spendy at about $50.00 for both of us with tax.

We arrived at Kaanapali shores in Maui after having a wonderful time in Kauai and was looking forward to continuing our experience. There were 4 of us in our party and we had asked for a one bedroom with a king bed and a queen sofa bed. When we arrived, they said that our room is facing the parking lot which we were not that happy about. But, without realizing, that's what we had actually booked. We thought we booked a garden room. So that part was our mistake. The front desk guy Ali really needs to work on his people skills. He had none. His attitude basically was that we were lucky enough to be staying there. They have made their entrace area really nice, but the rooms are really old and the doors and the walls make you feel like you are in a prison. Anyway, we asked Ali if there are any other rooms available and his answer was that we had to pay $100 extra to get another room. No apologies, nothing about sorry that we can't accomodate you....we were very turned off right from the start. Then, we got to our room and found that we got a very small place with a full size bed instead of the king that we requested. I called the front desk and they said that it was a queen bed and that although we requested a king bed, it was just a request, not a guarantee. We were pretty sure it was just a full, b/c we compared it to the sofa bed and the sofa bed was bigger. They said we would have to stay there that night and that they could see about moving us the next day if something opened up. The view from this room was really to the parking lot and nothing else. The balcony was so small that two people couldn't sit there comfortably (not that we'd want to look at the cars anyway). At this time, we had it with the place. I called my travel agent (pleasant holidays) and they were so nice to book us a room for the same price at Royal Kahana with an ocean view. At Royal Kahana, we were allowed to go look at our room first and ofcourse, we immediately liked it and took it. We came back to check out from Kaanapali Shores and we got Ali again.

It's a great deal for people that plan on spending most of their time away from the resort.

In fact, we didn't feel any cold air coming out of the vents when we put out hands over them! Instead we had to keep the windows open the entire stay which was less than ideal in one bedroom that faced the parking lot. Second, don't expect to be doing much more than email while at the resort. The wireless internet while free, provided frustratingly slow internet. For example as I write this review it took me about 3min to open up the \"write a review\" page. Also, one of our bedrooms had a light switch with no light attached. I tried all of the sockets to plug a lamp into, and none of them were on the circuit.

On our FIRST DAY, before he had even gotten waist-deep in the water, my son cut his leg badly on the reef/rock getting into the water. The cut required 6 stitches AND he was unable to swim in the ocean or pools for the rest of the week due to the risk of a staph infection. It was a major bummer for him and the whole family...it didn't ruin the trip, but it put a huge damper on it (he had to just sit and watch us swim and snorkel!). I know tons of kids snorkel and swim at that beach without incident, but honestly, the snorkeling was MUCH better anyways 2 lights south at Kahekili Beach (also called Airport Beach)...it was actually recommended to us as a better beach by some of the staff at the hotel...it's a prettier beach, many more fish (and turtles), and easier access into the water without the rocks/reef.

Marriott). We travelled about and swam at many other rock free beaches. You can swim there, though. You just have to be careful. The restaurant was good. Diane, the bartender- serves a mean mai-tai and at HH they are $4.00. The resort next door also has a good menu and drink, too- and bigger bar- with outdoor eating. Keep in mind the prices for food on Maui. We ordered two large pizza pies- one w/ sausage from the pizza place across the road and it was $46.00 !! Milk was over $8.00/gallon.

The property is certainly close enough to enjoy all of the tourist attractions available. Contrary to what I had read in other reviews, I found the beach to be great. Not crowded, during low tide you can walk a considerable distance. If so inclined you could make it all the way to Blackrock at the Sheraton. Watch what time of the day it is, give your self time to walk back before the tide comes in. My only complaint would be that the pool area needs an update, not much to brag about but certainly pleasant enough. It is not quite large enough to handle the amount of guests during the high travel season. I would definitely stay at this property again. One other thing to mention, and this should be addressed to the hotel industry overall. Flights out of Maui seem to be scheduled in the late evening. Due to the fact that check out times are usually noon, it would be nice, even for an additional charge, if there was an option to have a late afternoon/early evening checkout.

But they put in a great room the second time. Except for this, which could happen anywhere, the staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were comfortably furnished, with an excellent bed. Sound proofing was very good, with little noise coming to the property, even though there is a large property under construction a couple of blocks away. You have to slam the door to close it. The door does not self close and lock like most hotels due to warping in the door frame. This means that you'll hear doors slamming late at night from close by rooms. A small annoyance if you go to bed early like we do. Overall the property was very well maintained. We had an ocean view condo, set back a little from the beach with a view of the grounds. We loved getting up at dawn and having breakfast on the balcony watching the clouds roll into the bay between the shore and the next island and seeing the sunlight change the view of the water and the hillsides. There is a strip mall across the street from the condo. There is good sized market that can supply what you need. It is much more expensive than the Safeway closer to Lahaina. Go there if you have a car, but be sure you have a Safeway card to save money. Food is very expensive in Hawaii, and at Safeway a lot was on sale if you had the card. The Paradiso Pizza House had very good food in the strip mall. We used it twice for carry out. The hotel has an Expedia Fun activities desk. We used them for a last minute reservation at Ulalena--a great show directed by a former member of Cirque du Soleil. The tickets had a small discount and were front row seats. The beach is small, but it wasn't crowded. There isn't much to walk to. The neighborhood next to the hotel didn't look the greatest. So we went to the Whaler Village and paid to park and walked along Kaanapali Beach. There is a long concrete sidewalk that is is great for walking there. To save money, you can drive to the public park at the end of the beach and walk a short distance across the sand to the beach. The water in front of the hotel has a lot of rocks in it. You'd be well served to buy surf shoes. Many people were snorkeling in a small channel through the reef. The water is clear and was warm. There is a cut rate dive shop nearby that rents snorkel gear for $1.50 per day. There is also a Maui Dive Shop in the strip mall. We used them for a drive trip to Molokini. Neither my wife nor I were certified, but we were able to to have an introductory dive to 40 feet. More than enough for a first dive.

While it wasn't totally up-to-date as far as style, it was comfortable and everything worked. Kitchen was a little small, but we weren't in it very much. We loved the grounds - 2 spas, 2 pools, lots of palm trees and flowers. Very pretty and well-kept. A couple things we didn't like: the beach was not very wide, faced uphill, so was hard to walk along. It also didn't have a sidewalk along the beach hotels the way the hotels do right on Kaanapali Beach. (This is at the far north part of Kaanapali Beach.) Anytime we wanted to go anywere except the little strip mall across the street (grocery store, pizza/ice cream place, etc.) we had to drive. But it really was no big deal. One cool thing was a little luau show right on the property in the middle of the week. All in all it was a great place for a family. Oh, husband and I had the king bedroom, the 2 girls had the twin-bed bedroom and 2 boys slept on the pull-out couch. Worked fine! If we wanted to spend more money would go farther south on the beach, but if you want a great deal, so you can spend your money on all the expensive side trips, stay at the Kaanapali Shores. A couple good trips were the snorkeling to Molokini, and the road trip to Hana (that one takes all day, though). We did the north part of the island on our own.

This was our first time to Maui and also our first time doing a non all-inclusive resort. We had friends who stayed here a few months ago so booked this place on their recommendation. I am an extremely picky person and only stay in 5 star plus resorts. While this is a definite 4 star, we were extremely pleased. We stayed in room 331 which was a one bedroom garden view. All the units have had the bedrooms and living rooms updated and they are soon starting on updating the kitchen/bathroom areas. Our unit was great. The kitchen was nice to have and we made a lot of our own breakfast and lunches. Yes the cupboards are outdated but are clean. It was also great to have our own washer/dryer. I was apprehensive about staying at this place after reading some of the negative reviews on this site. I have to admit I'm shocked by some of the comments. Yes we were there at the same time when the AC went out. We received 3 messages on our phone with updates on the progress to fix it. That week it was very windy due to trade winds that had come in. We found that by opening the window in the bedroom and opening the lanai doors we had a great cross breeze going through. As for the lights, yes they were a bit dim in the bedroom but I had no trouble finding anything and they were great for reading. I also had no problem reading in the living room either. All our lights were great. We found the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful. We had one problem with the toilet not working properly, so we called and they were there right away and fixed it. The daily maid service was also great. Our last day there, we had to check out at noon and our flight wasn't until 10:30 p.m. They stored our bags in a locked room and we used the Hospitality room. We had no problems there either. The grounds are magnificient. Well manicured and beautiful flowers everywhere. We did have a couple of lunches and one breakfast at the Beach Club restaurant. The hamburgers there are great. We shopped across the street at the Star Market and they have everything you need. While bread and milk are quite expensive, we found everything else was fairly normal pricing. (Liquor is extremely cheap there). We did quite a few tours also. Note: For the best Luau, Old Lahaina Luau, you have to book this well in advance before you go there. You can book online and it is quite safe. Unfortunately we found this out after we got there. We did The Feast at LeLe which was excellent. We also did the boat tour to Molokia which was fantastic. Great diving and snorkeling. We also did the tour to Hannah which is a must as well as other things such as shows, etc. Another note, unless you are going to go for lots of day trips afar, you don't really need a car. We rented a car for 3 days and that was more then we needed. They have a great bus service right outside the hotel that will take you into Whalers Wharf ($1) and Lahania ($2). They don't operate very late in the evening though, so if you want to stay in town late to party, you would have to take a cab back ($22). To get back to the airport, you can get a shuttle ($56 for 2 people). Another place I discovered was a great market almost next door. As you are walking out of the hotel, turn left at the street and it is about a block from there, just before the ABC store. The best t-shirt prices on the island. Really good quality for $7 - 8 or 3 for $21. Some of the great restaurants we dined at were Roys (excellent scallops), The Fish Company, Bubba Gumps (best key lime pie), Kimos' (best shrimp) and Rusty Harpoon, to name a few. We paid before tip anywhere from $66 to $105 for 2 people which we thought was reasonable for drinks, appetizer, seafood and dessert. My husband is also a very avid diver and he has been everywhere in the Caribbean, but said that this was some of the best diving he has done. Saw lots of sharks, man-a-rays, sting rays, whales, dolphins, sea turtles, etc. This is a great family place. We did happen to be there during spring break so there were quite a few children, which isn't our thing, but the place is very spacious and we weren't bothered at all. The only downside of this place (for me), was the bed. It was hard. My husband thought the firmness was great for himself, but I would have preferred it a bit softer.

Five years ago, my husband, 3 year old son and I had stayed there, and were quite pleased with it as a family resort. This time there were 4 of us (8 and 4 year old boys) plus my husband's parents. We were overall very pleased with our stay. I had phoned the resort directly to book. Although it was more expensive to book through Resortquest, it gave me the ablility to cancel without penalty 72 hours prior, which was important as I have an elderly relative that may cause me to make last minute changes. Plus, the units I did check out were booked for the Easter week anyway. We could have moved part way through but chose not too. I called the resort a few days a head of time to request a renovated unit, and to note that we were return guests and were traveling with seniors. We were very pleased with the unit. It was a ground level 2 bedroom in the separate building which is on the right side of the resort if you are looking at it from the beach. I think any rooms in this part are wonderful. At ground level, our kids could play on the grass and directly access the beach and pool without moving around the parking area. Our unit was beautifully renovated with granite, new bathrooms and furnishings. The owners obviously used the unit themselves and it was well cared for. The restaurant had really good food - pricey, but so is all of Maui. They have sunset specials from 5:30 - 6:30, which give you a break on the prices. There is a really good grocery store walking distance, which had decent prices. I agree that the beach isn't the best. But is was great for the boys to play on and do a bit of body surfing without worrying about huge waves. As long as they had on their sand shoes, they were fine. There was actually decent snorkelling around the buoys that are marked off the beach. My husband even saw 2 turtles at the white buoy on the right side as you look out to the ocean. We did several other beach trips to Napili, Maluaka, Kaanapali, and a couple others in South Maui which were spectacular. But, it was nice to have the Resort's beach there on the days we just wanted to hang out. The gardens are lovely and the property is well maintained. All the staff were pleasant. The other thing I liked about booking directly with Resort quest is that you get daily maid service. We must have tracked in pounds of sand every day, so the daily vaccuuming was really necessary. The only down side was that the air conditioning went out in the entire complex for the last 2 days. Night time was unbearable! I think the people on the higher floors were okay, but at ground level it was not good. We also found that this area had a great deal more wind than other areas. I don't know if that is usual, or what we just happened to get. One last thing we did to make our holiday better, was book in for an extra day. Our flight left at 10:30 pm, so we had the whole day at the resort and didn't leave until about 7:30. Last time we were there, we had to check out at noon, and that was a long day with a kid and no room to use.

I don't know the price of these things, but my husband got his hair cut at this salon and it was $20. That was pretty reasonable. They also have a nail and pedicure salon there, too. The gym was nice. The two souvenir, clothing stores were nice and the prices weren't too terribly high. They have a convenience store inside which was really nice (food, drinks, souvenirs, books, magazines, etc). The class of people here were mostly middle to upper-middle class.The best decision we made was going to a free continental breakfast \"welcome- aloha\" session. We were worried it was going to be a time-share type thing, but it wasn't. It was great! We had a free breakfast, drinks while a man who is a specialized tour-specialist talked about what different activites are available for tourists to do. He discussed what past tourists have liked and what they have ranked as being their favorites. My family of four ages (38, 39, 14 and 11) took a chartered trip to Hana (discover hidden hawaii) , snorkeling trip to Molokini and Turtle Bay, helicopter tour of Circle Island and went to a Royal Lahainian Luau. They were all great activities. For the four of us to do all of that is was about $1200. The rooms were nice at this condo, but they were a little outdated. The rooms are spacous and it is great having a kitchen and your very own laundry facilities. It was very clean and the housekeeping service was great. The beds were very comfortable. We had a one bedroom garden-ocean view room. The beds were very comfortable. The only main negative thing that I can say is about the beach. It is very narrow and lots of rocks are in the water and if you don't have water shoes to wear in the water, you won't be able to walk out into the ocean. There are tons of rocks. I was disappointed about this. Some of the other beaches I heard were better. There are a lot of public beaches close-by. We saw a lot of surfers at other beaches. We saw a lot of whales every day! We saw them outside of our condo balcony, while we were driving and while we were on a snorkeling boat. It was awesome! The whales don't come up close to the boats. I felt extremely safe in everything I did except for swimming out in the ocean. The waves were strong and the under-tow was strong, too. It you like to just lay out on the beach, then this beach is fine for you.... and also if you have smaller children that don't want to go out into the ocean, except up to their knees - this beach would be fine for you. The pools are really nice if you do not like the beach. I loved this resort and will definitely stay here again. You get a lot for the money here. I researched a lot before we booked and this was the place for us. It is a little off the beaten path, but it is only about 10 minutes from Whaler's Village. It was a great shopping mall. We had dinner there a couple of nights at Leilanis and Hula Grill. Beautiful atmosphere and great food.... expect to pay $20 a person for a nice dinner though. There is also a grocery store and some souvenir shops across the street from the resort. That was great. I strongly recommend this place! This place is about 45 minutes to an hour from the airport. We had an awesome time! Hope this review helped. We just got back from there for our spring break!!!! Maui is GORGEOUS!

Everything looks like it hasn't been renovated in years and years but evidently it was renovated very recently-someone just had bad cheap Motel 8 taste. Our room faced the back of some condo's but that was ok since we spent little time in the room. The room also had a kitchenette which was great for making a few meals ourselves to save money(P.S-going to Costco if you're going to be there a week or more for lunch and breakfast stuff is a great idea!-ALSO for alcohol!!). One problem was our fridge froze things on the top shelf-froze them solid, and although we called several times to have it fixed it never was. No biggy though.

The grounds and pool area were very nice with palm trees everywhere and tiki torches at night. The beach in front of the hotel was not that great compared to other areas of the island. We went down the coast a little bit to the main beach at Kaanapali and up the coast a little ways to Napili Bay. We also loved Big Beach (Makena Beach) in south Maui.

We're in our early 30's and have our first baby on the way in June, so we wanted something nice yet affordable for our trip. While there are several luxury resorts on Maui that are a lot nicer than this hotel, you will likely pay a couple thousand dollars additional to stay there. Kaanapali Shores is everything they appear to be on this site. Our one bedroom condo was very clean and all kitchen appliances were in working order. The appliances and furniture were a little dated, but it added to the overall charm of the place. Our bed was a little hard, but that's about the only negative I have about the room overall. Our balcony faced the ocean ,and we spent each morning eating cereal and spotting whales closely off the shore. The grounds are very nice. Again, you won't get lost in amazement like in some neighboring resorts further south of Black Rock, but everything is very beautiful and well-kept. The two pools were very clean. The beach was a little narrow and a bit slanted, but the view of Molokai in the distance more than made up for it. Keep in mind this is a family friendly resort, so if you hate kids, don't stay here. The Beach Club restaurant was pretty good, although we did only eat lunch there. I highly recommend the steak teriyaki sandwich. Be sure to stop at the Walmart after leaving the airport or the Star Market across from the hotel to load up on cereal, snacks, etc as the kitchen will save you a lot of money. The strip mall across the street also has a good pizza place with cheese steaks and ice cream. The location of the hotel was a little off the beaten path, but yet still very close to all that Kaanapali offers. It's about 3 miles north of the crowded area of Kaanapali but a very short drive to Whaler's Village and the other bigger resorts. Kapalua is about 20 minutes north of the hotel and the airport was about a 45 minute drive (but who cares.....you're driving the coast in Maui!). In summary, if you want to stay in a somewhat inexpensive, yet quality resort, Kaanapali Shores is a solid choice. If you have the money to upgrade to a luxury resort like the Hyatt and are used to a pampered lifestyle, this may not be the place for you. We would definitely stay here again. (PS - Be sure to pick up the guidebook \"Maui Revealed\" and read it before you arrive. We followed the detailed instructions for hiking and saw some amazing things that normal guidebooks wouldn't lead you to.

I am one of those people that talks to about 4 different travel agents, spends months reading, researching and planning a vacation getaway.I checked tripadvisor constantley reading people's reviews about numerous hotels and finally went with KS. Please disregard any negatives...really! It really is a beautiful resort. Being in Hawaii you want to feel like your in the tropics and this place has it all. The gardens are gorgeous, both pools are great and the beach is even better. Compared to the hotels next door (papakea/emabassy suites/maui kai/mahanna) KS has the best beach. There were plenty of beach chairs to lay out on as well as cabanas you could hide in when the sun got too hot( no extra charge). None on the other hotels really had chairs on the beach. The beach front pool was really nice too. It has an out door resturant and bar. For those of you that are sports fans...you can lay in the sun, grab a beer and watch a game all at once! At night they lights tons of tiki torches which makes the place look incredible. We booked a studio view. Room 840 to be exact. Unexpectedly we had a great ocean view. The room was very spacious and clean. The kitchen did not have the most updated appliances but that really didn't matter. The stove worked just fine and the fridge did a great job keeping the food cold!!! Maid service came daily with fresh towels and made our bed. If your like me and debating on where to stay, i truly believe anyone and everyone would be happy here. I almost booked The Whaler and after going to Whaler's Village and be crowded by too many people it was wonderful making it back to KS. I also looked at The Mahana, not a great looking place. Yes, all rooms are ocean front but the beach is shaded by the building for more than half the day and there is no way you can swim in the ocean in front of the hotel (it's like hard, granite stones in the water). To be honest you never saw anyone laying out in front of the hotel at all. Hope that's enought info for now.

The 1st week we spent in Honolulu (Hilton Hawaiian Village) but this week in Maui is what we were really looking forward to. Come with me now as I recap our wonderful experience on Maui & at the Kaanapali Shores (here on out referred to as RKS). After flying 6000 miles to get from NJ to Oahu I couldn't have been happier to be taking a 35 minute flight. Open seating, you get on, strap in, get some guava juice or a coke & you land, that's it! Of course you still have to get to the airport 9 days before you take of to go through screeing but hey, that's the world we live in now. When we pick up our luggage you exit the terminal I was a little confused, there are car rental buses that are going by but not stopping, so you walk 100 feet to the right & there are the car rental agencies. You get there & a sign says if you have a reservation then go back to the terminal & board a bus to pick up location??? Anyway right behind this sign is a pick up location that everyone gravitated to so we went around & it was very crowded for Enterprise (lowest rates). We kinda made it to the front of the line by approaching from the right hand side but we felt like we cut the line we waited for a bus to fill up & just took the next. Note: people who just came off of 9 hour flights are a bit cranky & will easily demonstrate this on line, especially that little Southern Belle who became the pack leader of the line & insisted we were cutting when we politely waited for an entire bus to fill up, but we just came off a 35 minute flight so we weren't. We get our jeep & it was yellow! Yellow? Yes, only in Maui would I ever be cool with this so Hakuna Mattata, we left for RKS. Being to Maui once before I vaguely remember how to get to Kaanapalli but it came back pretty fast, it's not hard at all. Now for RKS, we arrive & check in & our room isn't ready, not a big deal it is 2pm though, but we get free drink vouchers (yeah) & head to the pool. Bartenders & staff are very nice. The drinks here are CHEAP. I mean price not quality, especially coming from Oahu where you had to take out a 2nd mortgage for happy hour. $3.50 for a beer! $6.50 Mai tai's etc. The Met's are losing to the Cardinals back home & everyone looks really cold (he-he) so we head back to the desk & our room was ready & we got a honeymoon upgrade. Thanks to the dude behind the counter who hooked us up! We get to our room & it's kinda far from the beach but it's huge, it has a kitchen, a huge lanai (balcony), it has a partial ocean view & it's a good deal so we are happy. We also got a $100 food & bevg credit which we wiped out in one meal there but it was a nice little perk. The room: reading other reports I can confim this: it does have a slightly musty smell, nothing major, the bedroom faces the parking lot & there are thin walls there but no where else in the room, the kitchen has some antiquated appliances but they all work, the AC was pretty weak & it was also pretty loud on high. They make up your room around 3pm each day, a little late & they don't do much more than the bedroom & bathroom but no big deal. What I didn't like about the room: TV in living room had volume that would change drastically when you changed the channel, the tub had a drain that had to be pulled out completely to keep from filling up the tub. These were minor things to us though. I would go back there in a heartbeat. The grounds: Could not ask for more, spacious, huge pool with an actual deep end & a bar right there. Beach looked much bigger when we were there then I remember seeing in pictures so that was good, too rocky to swim right there though. Pool has a glass fencing around it b/c it can be windy, nice touch. We used Expedia desk to book a tour without incident & it was competitively priced, sundry shop there was way too expensive! $9.00 for cereal?? Shop across the street at supermarket. Lot's of parking, just go into 5 level garage if you can't find any in front. This place is very nice, very pretty has some mileage on it but the people are friendly, the price is good & it's a great location so feel free to stop having any concerns about here unless you are the type that has a problem with how much evian spritz they give you poolside at the 4 seasons. Activities: We did sunset cruise, not really worth it booze was really cheap quality & pupu's were lame, besides you don't really feel like drinking after you are on board for more than 20 minutes. Helicopter tour-A MUST! We used Alex-air & had a one hour tour, beautiful! Snorkel Tour- the afformentioned Expedia desk-we went to Molomini & Turlte Town-MUST DO! Totally worth it, Pride of Maui crew was very nice. Luau-Make sure you do your homework & pick the right one. The cheaper they are the more you suffer. We did the Feast at LELE. It was PERFECT! Had our own table instead of farm tables, no buffet, we had servers & show was really good. Food was interesting so go with an open mind, drinks top notch. Only thing that bothered me was they take your picture & you can buy them affter but they have 4 sizes of the picture & you have to buy all of them or none. Road to Hana-we got there a week after the earthquake, got up early & were at Hana by 11 am. Great pace, however 4 miles past Hana a little rinky-dink bridge was out so we could not go all the way around. I almost cried (no not really) b/c that meant I had to drive 3 hours back the way I came & now against traffic across all of these 1 lane bridges & hair pin turns while people coming from the other way were'nt really paying attention. It was a tough drive & I was fried when we got done. But no sacred pools, no Tedeschi winery, oh well. Dining-RKS reataurant was pretty good, didn't eat there after we used our credit. Ruth's Chris-great steak, great wine, great scott, the bill! Longhis-Very good Italian food. Moose McGillacuddys-go there for burgers, wings, beer for lunch, dancing at night. A word on pizza-Being from NJ I know good pizza, it is impossible to find good pizza on Maui, so don't expect it ok? Can't remember the others but pick up a book on where to eat & you'll be fine.

We asked to change room so we can be right across the children's pool. Although we had to wait 3 days for a room, she was able to do it for us. The day we can move, our things were waiting for us in our new room when we got back from the beach. Yes, the kitchen and the bathrooms are a little outdated but it's no big deal. We never had any problems with the parking. You can also take the bus to go to the Whalers Village or to Front Street. Just ask the bell desk for the bus schedule. There is a very entertaining free hula show on Wednesdays. They serve rum and punch for $2 a glass. The Star supermarket across the street is very handy. Most of the nights, we stayed in and got food from their deli. We also stocked up on drinks and snacks. Restaurant recommendations: The Gazebo at Napili Shores (for breakfast; their pancakes are worth waiting in line for), Leilani's and Rusty Harpoon at the Whaler's Village (for lunch or dinner), Cilantro's (Mexican fast food) and Kobe (for teppanyaki dinner; call ahead to make reservations). The best luau is Old Lahaina (no firedancers but very good show and food).

If you want a fancy hotel and will be spending most of your time at the hotel, the Sheraton, the Westin or the Marriott would probably be a better choice for you.

It's a short drive with parking at the Whalers Village if you make a $10. purchase (easy enough with a Borders in the shopping complex... a good time to buy your Iz Kamakawiwo'ole CD if you haven't done that yet) Accross the street from the hotel is a Star Market where expensive groceries can be found (this is what the locals pay!) and a great coffee shop, Java Jazz. The unit was large which the children loved. The bed was comfortable and the housekeeping service was very good. I thought the kitchen area was poorly designed and the appliances old and worn, the refridgerator was quite noisy. It's too bad they chose the bottom line of appliances, floor tiles and cabinetry when they designed the units.", "Date": "September 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, CA", "Title": "\u201cA bit better than OK\u201d", "Author": "cjk4", "ReviewID": "UR5701923", "Content": "We just returned from Maui. 8 days at the Kaanapali Shores condos.

We got reccomendations from our friends regarding this resort/condo. We opted for the slightly expensive option of taking the sea side view. It isnt really next to the sea shore (about 50-100 yards away), but there was no obstruction in our view. First day we got up and saw two whales going across :) simply magical, but nothing like that happened in the 5 days after that :). Our views were the lovely ocean in front of us and mountains with clouds rolling down the slopes whenever we left the room. The hotel service was excellent. They offered one day free if you book 4 days and gave us a 100$ coupon in the restaurant/dinner thingy that they have downstairs. Really helped as far as breakfast was concerned. I would highly recommend the jacuzzi (can get crowded occasionally) and a mai tai. The beachfront itself in front of the hotel is pretty small (about 5 yards) at high tide. But this hotel location offers quick access to the tiny beaches northwest (kapalua bay was lovely) and downtown Lahaina. I guess Hana and kihei are a little far off from here, but the last thing you want to do when you go to hawaii is spend time rushing from place to place. Just sit back on the beach, relax, read a book, just absorb the natural beauty around you. I would certainly stay here when we go back to maui/hawaii.

I chose this place over the ResortQuest Kaanapali Villas based on reviews here and comments from a travel agent. Overall the resort is nice and met expectations. We had a garden view one bedroom condo. The grounds are very nice; I believe I heard that the property was recently renovated. There are two pools and two hot tubs. The pools are your average hotel style pools; no waterslides or \"lazy river\" features. The pools were used mostly by younger kids, and the hot tubs seemed to have a mix of later teen to early twenties people when I went. There is a large lawn area where kids/families can play. There are a lot of birds chirping (sounded like hundreds of them\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it was actually kind of loud) in the courtyard in the evening, but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us. The beach is average to nice. There is an actual beach area (unlike some properties), so if laying on the beach is what you want to do then you can do it here. The waters are nicely swim-able but no decent snorkeling or surfing here. For that you'll need to take a drive. Keep in mind that the Kaanapali beach area from Black Rock (the Sheraton) and south just past Whalers Village is where you'll find good snorkeling, surfing lessons, shore scuba diving, and parasailing. If you want to have those activities without driving, then you may consider going the expense of staying at a property in that area. There is an activities desk at the property run by Expedia. I was disappointed with their service. I called ahead to book a luau. The Old Lahaina Luau was booked, so I booked the one at the Hyatt (Drums of the Pacific) through the activities desk instead. Just on a whim I called the Old Lahaina Luau directly and found that I could be put on a waiting list. It turned out that an opening came up during the time we'd be staying and we where able to go to the Old Lahaina event. The activities desk people never offered to be put on a waiting list. Then, when I checked in for our stay, the front desk people gave me a coupon for what appeared to be a pretty good deal at the Hyatt luau, and the activities desk people didn't mention this offer on the phone with me. The condo was clean with ample space. Cookware was minimal but we got by. I wish the room included a blender. The maids come every day to make the bed, restock towels and take out the garbage. The linens are not replaced every day (I think every other day). You have to do your own dishes - there is a dishwasher and some detergent is provided. There is a $9 per day parking charge with unlimited ins and outs. I knew this when booking the trip so I just accepted it. Our stay included a $100 credit for food charges, so that was a nice addition to the trip. I have the feeling everyone gets this but you might check to make sure. The onsite restaurant is very nice. The hotel staff (excluding the Expedia desk) were friendly and helpful. There is a strip mall across the street with a Star Market (grocery store size), Maui Dive Shop, and other smaller restaurants like sushi and pizza. There is free WiFi on the property in certain areas. From our room I was only able to connect twice and the connection speed was too slow to be usable one of those times, so you should plan on going to the lobby area for a better connection. There is also a computer room where people can access the internet on rented computers for around $1 for 15 minutes or so. This was a big hit for our two MySpace junkie kids. I think this property as with the other condos in the area are more suited for families than couples looking to get away or for honeymooners. Would I stay here again? Well, I would shop more by price if I am staying anywhere other than that prized strip of Kaanapali Beach south of Black Rock. I would stay at this property again if the price was close to other properties in the area. A quick overview of the activities we did: - SCUBA diving through Lahaina Divers. I did my advanced open water certification and one kid did his open water certification, plus additional dives for the kids. I highly recommend Lahaina Divers for diving (perhaps not for snorkeling unless you are in to free-diving). - Old Lahaina Luau - The best luau I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to so far (my third). - Surfing lessons with Island Style Adventures Surf School - the kids were satisfied with them. - Downtown Lahaina - I recommend Top Cats for a burger lunch. Other than that one walk up and down the strip was enough for me. It is fairly touristy compared to the towns we visited last year in Kauai. I think Lahaina is geared more for the cruise ship crowds.", "Date": "August 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cAwesome for Us\u201d", "Author": "cyndiLouWho", "ReviewID": "UR5537164", "Content": "We spent nearly a week at Kaanapali Shores 7/16/06 - 7/22/06.

I traveled with my mother, 65 and daughter 5 and our stay was perfect and we were very pleased with our visit. The property is absolutely beautiful with a lobby that is both comfortable and sophisticated. Our one bedroom unit was recently remodeled and worked out perfectly. The kitchen was much larger than I anticipated and the beds (king in bedroom and queen sleeper) were both quite comfortable. The only real noise came from the flocking birds and an occasional car alarm in the parking lot. (disarmed quickly) The property has beach front which some have said is too thin a strip but it was more than adequate for my 5 year old to boogey board and build sand creations until her hearts content. The pool near the beach seemed a bit more crowded but we have a pool at home and only used the garden pool occasionally. There was always plenty of space at the beach and pool and one really nice feature is there is some shade near the beach which my mother really enjoyed. We also had several meals at the on site restaurant which worked out great for days we wanted to spend most of the day at the beach or if we had been touring all day and wanted something convenient. The mahi tacos and crab salad were terrific and my 5 year old was hooked on the grilled cheese. There is a Star Market right across the street, which I found to be on par price wise with the Safeway, had a hot food bar as well as a good wine selection. Java Jazz in the same plaza makes one of the best mochas I have ever had and has a very nice selection of breakfast pastries. The $9 parking is not an issue at all just know that the cost is added on before you go.

Get some bartenders that like people, and have enough of them to handle the crowd (you'll make more money too!). Otherwise, everyone else on the staff seemed very friendly.

When we arrived, we were offered an upgrade to a studio for $60 more a night. After viewing the studio, we decided to stay with the hotel room, opting to spend the extra money on activities and dinner. Hotel Room The room itself was small (as expected) but reasonable for 2 people who weren't planning on spending much time in the room. The furnishings were modern (wood with pineapple style decor). The room had a vanity that was separate from the bathroom/toilet, making it convenient to get ready in the morning. The bathroom was sufficient (decent water pressure and a unique platform next to the tub to place toiletries or sit), but was very dark. The room offered a large closet and lots of hangers, but only one small dresser under the tv. My main only minor complaint was that the lighting consisted of old flourescent panel lights that were outdated. Our room was on the 9th floor (referred to as the Penthouse) and offered a perfect view of the gorgeous sunset each evening. We were surprised by how loud the birds in the lower jungle like courtyward were in the early evening and mornings (when it sounded like 100's were squaking). Service The staff here were pretty quiet and tried to stay out of the way. Maid service was virtually invisible throughout our stay and did a good job of keeping our room tidy. They seemed to come later in the day (2PM) but it seemed like that was because we were on the top floor. The front desk staff were friendly when approached and were able to answer our questions when we had any. We attended the island orientation to learn more about acitivities available (highly recommended). We used the prices provided at this presentation to shop around (we got better prices at Boss Frog's down the road). We used the hotel concierge (who actually work for Expedia) to book 2 of our activities. We ended up missing one of the excursions because the concierge told us the wrong meeting point- but they quickly apologized and rebooked us on another day. The concierge also failed to mention that second activity we booked (a Waterfall Hike) required participants to scale a 20 foot banyan tree to see the waterfall. Overall, though, it was convenient to have the activities desk in the hotel. Pools/Beach The 2 pools were average sized- very clean. I prefered the ocean front pool with a great view of the sunset. Pool towels were always available and we were always able to find a pair of chairs. With June being a busy month for family vacations, the pools were packed with lots of kids. It would be nice if there was an adult pool or if they made one of the 2 spas adults only. I was disappointed by the beach in front of the hotel (didn't spend more than an hour there). I found it to be rocky and very tiny. We walked down to the left of the resort and found a better strip of beach which looks like it will soon be developed (there were several cranes nearby). Don't be confused as I was- this is not the same Kaanapali Beach as the one the Marriot, Hyatt and others are on...it is on the other side of Black Rock and not as nice. Restaurant The most pleasant surprise of the trip was the Beach Club restaurant at the resort. After trying the breakfast buffet at the Embassy, we opted for the Beach Club every day thereafter for great breakfasts (try the portuguese french toast with coconut syrup or macadamia nut pancakes). We also ate there for a couple of lunches and 2 dinners. The sunset dining was amazing and the service was exceptional. This restaurant is a hidden jewel for Maui! Amenities I made use of the oceanside massage service. After tracking down the therapist to schedule an appointment (inconvienent appointment scheduling process), I was treated to an amazing ocean side lomi lomi massage. The price for a 50 min massage was $95 but well worth it. The hotel also offered a well stocked sundries shop (very expensive but convenient), gym (pricey at $10 a day), flower shop, salon and souvenir shop. Parking was reasonable ($9/day) and offered plenty of spots and in/out priveleges. The attendants were very friendly and willing to help provide directions. Overall Thoughts The Kaanapali Shores was a great home base for all the activities we had planned. It was convenient to Lahaina and great beaches (Kapalua, Fleming). A word of caution to honeymooners- this place is crawling with kids and families. I would highly recommend it for family reunions, but it is not the place for a quiet, romantic getaway. The facilities were great, but it was tough to find a quiet place on the property to just get away from it all...Some day in the future when we have children and return to Maui, we will definitely return to Kaanapali Shores.", "Date": "July 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Not So Nice Service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5431678", "Content": "It's my first visit to Hawaii, and and after so many great reviews from Friends, and reading them online, I decided Muai was the place to go.

From the moment I approched the Reception desk, I was treated very rudely by the person who was working the night shift. My plane was delayed and we arrived at the hotel at 12:30 AM. I believe his name was Harry. and the first thing I could think of was, Number one, it wasn't his priority to make guests feel welcome, and Two, he seemed really bitter, and just like he hated his job. It was the worst welcoming experience I have ever received. I have received better service at the Motel Six in my younger days. I couldn't believe this Four Star rated hotel had someone like him working the front desk. When I arrived at my room I was suprised to see that the Extra money I had put in for the Ocean View was very little ocean view. There was a big wall next to my Lanai, and I could see merely a fraction of the ocean. However it was a wonderful view of the Gardens. I called the front desk to complain about this, and obviously, he wasn't helpful at all. In fact, when we first checked in, my mom was with me. It was her birthday and this trip was a special treat for her. My mom had mistakingly asked Harry, \"and thats an ocean front rrom right?\" He quickly snapped back, rather coldly and Rudely \"NO ITS Not!!!! Its an Ocean View, and even with that, you'll just see some of the ocean.\" Word of Advice to management: GET RID OF HIM I really wanted to enjoy my stay in Muai. I was going to call the management the next day, but decided to not stress out and make the most of it. The grounds are indeed beautiful and the beach is nice. The restaurant was suprisingly good, and that was where I received the best service. There were many families, and it was rather quiet at night. The room was big, we had the one bedroom suite, and although it did look a little outdated, I just figured that was the laid-back style of beach culture. Parking was not the best, and it was always packed. The beach was jammed pack with Rocks in the water, and made it almost impossible to go inside. I did enjoy my stay here, but the service is questionable. I wouldn't consider this a four star hotel, I agree with other reviewers who have said this is more like a 3 star hotel. and the biggest reason for that is the level of service.

It was perfect for our needs, and we had a WONDERFUL time, but I could see where it might not be for everyone. We had a one-bedroom, garden-view condo. The furnishings were fine -- they were in good shape; the TV units both in the living room and the bedroom looked pretty close to new; the carpets looked newish, the paint was fresh. The kitchens were in good shape, though the appliances were old-looking (an avocado-colored stove!), they worked well. Similarly, the untensils were just fine; the bathroom was just fine; the towels/linens were just fine. Since we were there with our two elementary-school age children, this was exactly what we wanted -- clean, functional, no fuss. But if you're the type that wants fancy appointments, nice scents, fresh-cut flowers, etc., this place might not get the job done. (PS -- as we were there with a family reunion, I had a chance to see a bunch of different rooms (two-bedrooms, ocean-view, studio) and they all were similar. The grounds were terrific -- lovely jungle-y garden in the back, great green lawn in the middle. The pools were like the rooms -- very well kept, clean, convenient, easy to use/get to, plenty of towels, etc. But, again, not fancy - one bean-shaped, one rectangular, no diving boards or slides or fake waterfalls or whatever. Lots of kids in both (great for us, but if I were a honeymooner....) The gym had a pretty good supply of weights and weight machines and cardio, but it was two-storey and kind of cramped. There were a couple exercises I couldn't do because of the way a weight machine was positioned in the room. Also wasn't nuts about having to pay a surcharge to use the gym. The beach, as others described, is pretty sloped and narrow right in front of the hotel. But it's pretty and the view of Molokai and Lanai is spectacular. And, walk 100 yards in either direction and it widens out and levels out. What's more, really unbelievable beaches are a short drive away (I highly recommend Kapalua). Service was fine. The staff was reasonably attentive; the maids were reasonably efficient; they kept the place clean. But you had to go looking for service, as opposed to somebody following you around anticipating your every need. One thing I really liked was all the food choices. The Beach Club restaurant did a nice, basic, affordable breakfast; had good choices for lunch by the pool; stiff $3 mai-tais at happy hour (3 p.m.-5 p.m.) and a surprisingly good dinner. Ate there with 12 adults and we all ordered different things (fresh seafood of various types) and everybody raved. Wine list is weak, but you can't have everything. Directly across the street is a strip mall that has pizza, sushi, Mexican, a very cool soup/coffee joint, and Star Mkt, which is a full-size grocery store for stocking up for the room. And Lahaina has a good number more choices, and is maybe 10 minutes away. Bottom line -- if (I hope WHEN) I go back to Maui, I'll try to stay here again, if I'm bringing my whole family. If I'm coming with just my spouse for a romantic anniversary or something, I might try something fancier. Two tips -- One, don't go to the Sunset Luau at the Sheraton Maui. The food was good (mmmmmm-piiiiig!), but the show was unimpressive. Second, if you have elementary school-age kids, book a room on the ground level. Your patio opens right onto the grounds, so you can sit on your patio with your morning coffee, the kids can run around the garden in your plain sight, and when you come back to the room from the pool or the beach or wherever, you don't have to bring noisy, dirty kids into a lobby or an elevator or down a narrow hallway.", "Date": "June 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Coast, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat for families!\u201d", "Author": "AnonymousMe", "ReviewID": "UR5358415", "Content": "We stayed at the ResortQuest Kaanapali Shores from June 10-16, 2006. \"We\" consisted of two adults, one teenager, one pre-teen, and a four-year old.

I had to pay an extra $500+ to upgrade to an oceanfront room during our stay. Our oceanfront wasn't one of the top-of-the-line rooms ending in -01 that you read about in previous posts; it was one of the \"standard\" oceanfront rooms. We had 1,100 square feet with 2 bedrooms, 2 baths, full kitchen and washer/dryer. We were on the ground floor, so could walk out our large sliding glass doors to the patio, a small yard with stepping stones, and on down to the beach. For the most part, the room was very comfortable. The master bed and bath were decent sized and well laid out. This bedroom had a color tv, and two safes in the large closet. The second bedroom was smaller, with two twin beds and a large closet. This room didn't have a view, except if you count the walls of the large pink Embassy next door. The kitchen was good sized, with older appliances. There were plenty of dishes, utensils and glasses, but the selection of cooking utensils was pretty basic. Bring or buy your own plastic wrap/plastic bags, as none were provided. They did provide an initial supply of dishwasher, clothes washer and dish soap, but did not automatically replenish once you ran out. We had to keep picking replacements up at the front desk. Housekeeping came in once a day and performed pretty basic services like making (not changing) the beds, sweeping and vacuuming, and cleaning the bathrooms and kitchen counters. There are two pools on the property--one is right on the ocean, with the restaurant and bar right next door. It's a reasonably sized, but not large, pool. The second pool is in the center of the property and is more geared for kids. Most of this pool is 3' deep with the middle section only 4' deep. There's a large grassy area around this area for sunning or playing. There is a beach, although it's not the white sand beach that I was dreaming about. It's rather small and a lot of it will vanish at high tide, but it's still very nice. It drops off rapidly once you get in the water. There's some good snorkeling farther out. At low tide, take the kids off to the right, where they can find little crabs, lobster, and all kinds of sea life in the little pools on the rocks. Location was nice. It's not in tourist central, but not in the boondocks, either. There's an ABC store if you take a left out of the driveway. Take a right out of the driveway, and there's a shopping center across the street with a Star Market, which will have just about everything you need. You can also shop for groceries at the Safeway in the Lahaina Cannery Mall. The Cannery has a Longs Drug Store, which had some food items for less than you will pay at the supermarkets. Longs also had a good selection of local baked goods and Asian snacks and foodstuffs. And best of all, Longs is open until midnight! All in all, a good property. It's great for families and groups, but not for very picky princesses. We would stay here again, especially in an oceanfront room. Here's some recommendations for activities based on our experiences: --Baby Beach, which is north of downtown Lahaina. It's beautiful, protected and perfect for kids. It has some great snorkeling for those just starting out. We went there on the second day, so the older ones could get some snorkeling practice in before hitting Molokini. They had a great time and spent hours snorkeling. The little one loved the beach, warm water and gentle surf. We returned several times during our stay. --Took a snorkel boat run by the Pacific Whale Foundation to Molokini and Lanai. I'd recommend a big boat like this if you have small ones. But for those of you who don't have little ones and plan on maximum snorkeling, you might want to consider the new covered hard bottom \"rafts\" that are going out snorkeling. They're more expensive, but faster and can get to places the big boats can't. It took 90 minutes to get from Molokini to Lanai, which drove me nuts. I was envying the faster rafts! --We went to the Old Lahaina Luau. This books fast; if you want to go, make your reservation online before you get here. I made our reservation over a month before we arrived and most nights were already sold out. It was fine, but a little spendy at $89 for people 13 and over, and $59 for children 12 and under (lap babies are free). The after-dinner show was great and the kids loved watching the pig being unearthed from the imu. --We went on the zipline tour run by Skyline Ecoadventures--a must if you have preteens or teens! It has limited spaces and books up very fast. Again, book this online in plenty of time before you leave. --Took surfing lessons with the Royal Hawaiian Surfing Academy in downtown Lahaina. We took surf lessons the week before in Santa Cruz, CA and I thing the pre-water, on-board instruction by Royal Hawaiian was far superior. This resulted in most people getting up on the board on their first try, and everyone was able to get up consistently. A great value and a lot of fun. They have a professional photographer who will take pics and give you a cd for $15--definitely sign up for that beforehand. He got some wonderful shots we could never have taken ourselves.", "Date": "June 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary,AB", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Hotel\u201d", "Author": "calgary_traveller_7", "ReviewID": "UR5353916", "Content": "This hotel was great!

The hotel was only a few minutes from Whalers Village and about 10 minutes from Front Street in Lahaina. We spent almost every night on Front Street and we loved it. Front Street was not your normal tourist shops and cheesy crap. It had great views, a beautiful Banyan Tree park, unique galleries and lots of great restaurants, which all seemed to have an ocean view. Maui itself is magical. We have traveled to alot of beautiful places, but we agree that Maui is at the top. The climate and geographic landscapes are all so different throughout Maui. One day you are on the most beautiful beach ever, the next day you are driving through a bamboo forest, the next day you are in a rain forest, the next day you may be on a crater, other days you might be driving through sugar cane or pineapple fields.

The grounds were very nice and the hotel was kept clean and lives up to the 4 star rating. The staff is extrememly helpful and provide service with a smile. We were there on our honeymoon and on our tight budget, the hotel really pleased us both. We will never forget our pleasant stay there. Full Review Hotel staff ( Excellent) - One of the most nicest hotel staffs we have ever dealt with. The front desk crew was very helpful and always smiled and it seemed like they really cared for our happiness. Even if they were faking it, I enjoyed it. Room (Above average) - We were very surprised by the room. We had a one bedorom on the 7th floor with a partial ocean view and a full view of the garden. The balcony (lanai) was awesome. The living room was really nice and comfy. The bedroom with a king sized bed was very comfortable and spacious. The dissapointing part of the room is the kitchen and the bathroom. Both of these need to be renovated. The bathroom looks so old but luckly it was clean. The kitchen, well sorry folks but I did see one roach there and the tiles and overall kitchen look was so so old. But once again, the housekeeping staff is awesome at cleaning our kitchen and bathroom so that it was atleast clean. So bottom line is that the room was above average to us and the kitchen was super useful. Parking (Neutral) - what can I say, it costs 9 bucks to park here daily. I thought this was reasonable considering the fact that the parking is close to the rooms and seems to be safe. Hotel Location (Above Average) - we felt that the hotel was nicely located and close to a market (across the street) and decent restaurants (subway, pizza, coffee) all just a walk away. The beach in front of the hotel is very nice to enjoy the sunset and for morning walks. I saw a lot of people snorkling in there and they said their experience was just as good as taking a full day snorkling trip on a boat. Pools (Neutral) - If you are looking to spend a lot of time in the pool, I am not sure I would recommend this place. The pools are small. There are two of them and both were clean and fairly empty. But later in the day, they are unkept and the area around the pools fills up with trash people leave behind. We didn't like that part. We went into the spa in the evening and there were drink cups littered all over. Kinda dissapointing. Summary Best Parts of staying at Kaanapali Shores - staff is very helpful, polite and friendly - rooms are clean and kitchen, laundry and balcony are very useful and a must! - parking is close and ample - beach front is amazing specially in evening when sun is setting - garden is soothing and very cleanly kept - hotel restaurant has good mahi mahi as well as pina colada's - cheap eats located across the street, a walk away Only negatives - bathroom and kitchen need renovation - they are clean but really old looking - pool area is clean in morning and afternoon but by night fall, not kept clean - fitness center charges a fee of $10 per day per person - killed 1 roach, did not see any others", "Date": "May 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary AB", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5026383", "Content": "This resort is perfect!

It was a gorgeous view, but it wasn't the room I saw in the pictures online. After one night, my wife and I approached Malea at the front desk and asked her if we could see a unit in the high rise building. Malea graciously accomodated and gave us a card key for room 604. It was huge and it had a great ocean view, but still not the one I saw in the pictures online. Malea then gave us a key to unit 401 because the previous guests had just checked out. My wife and I went up to look and oh my goodness this was the one. Our hearts were pounding because it was a two bedroom with huge sofa that folded out into a bed. There were lanai doors on every outer wall of the unit that you could totally open and have that openness that you see in the lobby of most Maui resorts. We ran back down to Malea and she told us that unit 701 would be available the next day. She told us to pack our stuff and the bellman would be up to transfer our bags. We left that morning to go to surf lessons and, upon our return, our bags had been moved. We had not told our four children that we got this unit and when we walked into it with our kids for the first time, their faces were like those \"priceless\" commercials. We didn't even want to leave this condo because the view was so beautiful. And it was whale season which I thought would be no big deal but, let me tell you, seeing a whale for the first time is an instant hook and you will be an avid watcher during your entire trip. Sitting on the lanai was the best view of the whales and they were out of the water all day every day. We saw dozens of them, no lie. We kept the lanai doors open all the time. Two walls in the living room were nothing but sliding glass doors. The dining room wall was a sliding glass door. The master bedroom wall was a sliding glass door. It was so much fun to open all doors and just walk in and out of any one of them for a beautiful view. The lanai had lots of chairs, tables, and loungers for anything you wanted to do out there from eating to relaxing. The view of the ocean from one side of the lanai was supplemented by the view from the other side of the lanai of the pool and the gardens below. I loved positioning my lounge chair at the corner of the lanai so I had the pool/garden/ocean view all at once. The pool was always crowded but never to the point of being uncomfortable. Ordering drinks from the pool bar was easy and quick. Towels were always plentiful. Lounge chairs were always plentiful for either pool, the grass area, or the beach. The beach had sun or shade under the trees. Beach was rocky, but still fun. The poolside restaurant was very nice with good food and great views. The stores at the Shores were filled with fun stuff and there was plenty to keep you busy. The lobby area was beautiful. Parking was never a problem. $9 a day to park, but that was not a problem at all. They add it to your bill at the end of your stay. Our daughters signed up for the lei making and it was fun watching them make beautiful lei's to take home. The entire grounds were gorgeous with the pools, the neatly kept grass and flowers, the waterfall. We will absolutely be back to the Kaanapali Shores. It was easy driving down to Whaler's Village and parking for the day while having fun on South Kaanapali. It was easy driving to Lahaina and parking was not tough at all. All in all, we all gave the Kaanapali Shores and our trip to Maui a 10 out of 10. Do all the touristy things - surf lessons, luau at the Old Lahaina Luau or the Hyatt Luau, helicopter ride, snorkeling, snuba, sailing, and don't forget - December to April is whale season so there's no jet ski's or parasailing during that time.

I was disappointed a bit by the room for the price. Our room was nothing like the rooms shown on their promotional website. It's basically a very small condo type unit. $ 388 a night for 2 adults and 2 teens (under age 17 so they were supposedly free) - We had a one bedroom partial ocean view room - the king size bed was very comfortable - but the girls had a sofa bed in the living room. It was clean, but the unit was showing wear and tear- especially the bathroom. It's hard for 4 people (especially 3 girls!) to get ready with one very small bathroom -There was no other place where one of us could blowdry our hair or put on make up, etc while another was showering or getting dressed. There are no mirrors anywhere else in the room to do so. We had small ants in our bathroom also. Having the small kitchen was nice/ refrigerator, but again, they provided one complimentary package of coffee the first day, after that you were on your own. At $388 a night, I think they could spring for daily coffee supplies! It was nice to have a washer/dryer unit as we were on a two week vacation and enjoyed being able to wash our clothes conveniently in our unit. Our light above our dining room table didn't work upon arrival. We told the front desk about it, and it was never fixed the 5 days we were there. The grounds are beautiful, and the pool area is nice except I don't like staying at places where I have to rush down to the pool at 8am or earlier just to get a lounge chair because they don't have a reasonable number of them for the number of guests they have. The beach area is VERY small, and VERY rocky which was not enjoyable and made swimming there virtually impossible. My 13 yr old cut her foot on the rocks just trying to cool off from sunning. One of the mornings there were no lounge chairs by the beach area, so me and the 2 girls had to lug chairs from the grassy area to the beach which was no easy feat! At $388 a night, I don't feel I should have to do that. We did eat at the restaurant- once for lunch and once for breakfast. The food was good and reasonably priced, but the male waiter who claimed he worked there for 15 yrs was slow and poor waiter. He forgot to bring out some of the items we ordered, and when my husband stopped him to ask for the condiment that was supposed to come with his sandwich, he didn't bother to ask what my husband needed, he cut him off and said, \"I'll be right back\" and then didn't return - he came back out and was doing other things and ignored our table until we finally stopped another waiter and asked for the condiment to be brought out! The drinks and drink specials were reasonably priced which was nice and wonderful to have that right by pool and beach. The bar tenders and the activity staff were all very friendly and helpful. Overall, a decent place, but the rooms still need some refurbishing and the pricing should be more reasonable - I would say it was a $200-250 a night type place tops.", "Date": "March 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cGood value!\u201d", "Author": "Pucmeister", "ReviewID": "UR4717224", "Content": "Great value for the money.

We had breakfast at the restaurant near the pool and that was good.

The beach at Kaanapali shores is nice but small. If you don't get out there early you probably wont get a chair. We would go out there about noon and it was too crowded so we drove a couple miles to the beach which we didn't mind. We moved to Grand Wailea for our last night and its a good thing we waited until the end to go there. It definitely made Kanaapali Shores pale in comparison but that is comparing apples to oranges.

However, my wife and I (with our 17 month old child) had a great time. We stayed in room 822 (one bedroom suite) which had a view of the ocean (albeit far off) and it was about 800 square feet. We had absolutely no complaints about it. Granted, it's not a suite at the Venetian or the Bellagio (Vegas) but you can't expect that for the price. The negatives: - The pools and hot tubs aren't awesome. By that I mean, no slides or waterfalls to swim under. - In reality, it's not on the Ka'anapali beach that everyone knows about. Both this and the Embassy Suites next door are really in Honokawai which I'm sure is the reason the Ka'anapali Shores is less expensive. What this means is that you have to drive to Whalers Village to get to the real Ka'anapali beach where all the other hotels (Westin, Hyatt, The Whaler, etc.) and activities are located. If you stay at one of those hotels you can walk along a longer sidewalk, have a wider/deeper beach and you have more choices to dine and shop (Whaler's Village is essentially an outdoor mall). That being said, if you do choose to stay here, I don't think you'll be disappointed by the rooms. Also, the Ka'anapali Shores has a Wed night Polynesian show in front of the pool just off the beach. It's nice for families. We essentially chose it b/c we wanted a large suite with a kitchen, washer/dryer, didn't need an awesome pool area and didn't want to pay an arm and a leg. Also, there is a supermarket literally across the street where we bought groceries. And be sure to try out Honokowai Okazuya & Deli just down the street and get the Maki Maki with lemon capers.

Stayed there for 7 nights starting from October 1. Overall - The property is accurately described in some of the other reviews. Room - We stayed in a 1 bedroom ocean view room. If you can spend a little bit more, the ocean view is well worth the difference. Both the living room and bedroom have ocean views. Otherwise, in the garden view room, your bedroom might face the parking lot. The room had everything needed including a washer and dryer. Room was clean and the furniture was fairly new. Pool - Depending on what you are looking for, the two pools are \u00e2\u20ac\u201c two pools. They are not spectacular in anyway, but functional. There is an evening hula show at one of the pools that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth checking out. Restaurant - Our package included $100 food credit at the restaurant. Though there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any room service, the restaurant allows takeout. (The view from our 8th floor was much better than the view from the restaurant.) Fairly typically hotel/restaurant menu and food quality. Though the turnaround time for orders was excellent. Location - The property is located on the North side of Kaanapali beach. Out of everything the beach was the most disappointing part of this location. I previously stayed at the Westin (located near Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village) and that part of Kaanapali beach is very nice. This part is very steep, a little narrow, the surf is a little rougher and has a slight undertow. The beach itself had a lot of seaweed. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t my ideal Maui beach. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind walking about 10 minutes south along the beach, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find it to be much better. Since we had two young children (2 & 4) in our party, we ended up driving to Lahaina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s baby beach and Kapalua bay a few times. Lahaina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s baby beach is located behind some houses. The surf is very calm, so kids won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get knocked down. If you want a good beach for toddlers, ask and get directions. You won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be disappointed. Kapalua bay is located between Napali and Kapalua. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good beach for playing in the sand and snorkeling. It also has public parking and restrooms. Other amenities: A small strip mall is located across the street with a Star market. Star has most everything you will need, but if you plan major cooking, stop at Safeway in Lahaina. The Pizza place is decent for a quick bite. Going north there is an ABC store, past that location is a great little coffee shop and a snorkel shop. Final thoughts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c If you are looking for a condo, with good amenities consider the ResortQuest Kaanapali Shores.

Based on previous comments, I was a bit nervous about staying at Kaanapali Shores, but I called ahead and requested a renovated 1-bedroom ocean view suite on a high floor. We were in Room 930 on the top floor, and looked out over the parking lot and a canal along the side of the hotel. However, since we were so high up we basically looked out over the ocean towards Lanai. It was quite beautiful. We might not have enjoyed a room on a lower floor with the same view. I was pleased to see that the room was very clean and we loved the washer/dryer unit! The front desk was quite helpful and efficient. Initally, when I found out that we didn't have a room facing the garden/pool area, the front desk was happy to let me visit a couple of other rooms facing the garden. We ultimately decided to stay in our room so as to avoid another move. Housekeeping cleaned every day and were very nice. We just had drinks in the beach club area and each visit took a very long time.....We decided not to have any meals there based on previous comments, and once there, determined that, in any case, service there would take too long. We did enjoy wonderful meals at the Gazebo in the Napili Shores Resort, CJ's Deli, Leilani's in Whaler's Village, and of course, Cafe O'Lei. I'd say Cafe O'Lei and Gazebo were the best followed by Leilani's. Bad --- Coffee, just north up the street from the hotel, makes great Lattes (better than Soup and Nutz across the street - although their breakfast is very good if a bit slow in service). Pizza Paradizo across the street was overpriced and had mediocre food in my opinion. Avoid the Star Market across the street - its overpriced and hardly has anything- and do your shopping at Safeway and Longs Drugs in Lahaina at the Cannery Mall. There's an ABC just north of the hotel as well. I hurt my knee and needed to see a doctor during our stay. There is a clinic at Whaler's Village that saw me right away and takes pretty much every medical insurance. They faxed in my prescription to Longs and I thought the whole thing was very efficiently handled. I can also recommend the Four Winds II Snorkeling Trip to Molokini. We took it two years ago and again this week. There is also a great beach just two streets south of the hotel - Kakekili Beach Park - it has restrooms, picnic benches, a grassy area and a pretty wide and clean white sand beach that was not very crowded.

The beach behind the hotel is small and the swimming is not that good. Just off shore is a bit off a drop off and before that it's rather rocky. If you're going to swim, be sure to pack water shoes. We took a quick drive south of the hotel to the Sheraton and I was surprised at the difference between that end of the beach and ours. It appears that where the Sheraton sits, and north of it, is the 'real' Kanaapali. The beach is much wider and the water is better for swimming and snorkeling. This is alos where you'll find parasailing, kayak rentals, and the like. The Beach Club resaurant/bar serves food all day. They also have drinks of the day and happy hours which, for a resort bar, are very reasonably priced. We didn't try the food. This is a value property. I'd say it's best suited for families. Hindsight being what it is, if we head back to Maui, we'd stay a bit farther south at the Sheraton, Whaler, or one of the properites in that vicinity.", "Date": "July 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Langhorne, PA", "Title": "\u201cHONEYMOON IN MAUI at a GREAT HOTEL/CONDO\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3610858", "Content": "Wow, We really can't complain about a think at the Aston Kanapali Shores. Upon checking in to our room, we thought it looked a touch outdated, but the view was GREAT! We called the lobby and they switched us to another, more updated room...all you have to do is ask! I think most rooms have a view of the ocean as long as you're above the 3rd floor or so. Housekeeping did a great job of new sheets, towels and empyting the trash every day. The size of the room is much larger than a regular hotel would be - plus you get a full size rridge, stove and microwave. The courtesy desk does everything for you including booking t-times for golf, and arranging all of your sightseeing tours (we loved the snorkeling trip to Molikini and road to Hana via the $109.00 tour---probably would skip the Atlantis submarine next time though). The desk is open every day (I think) and there is always someone at check in if you have a question. We also had the $100 for credit and got 3 meals out of it for the 2 of us. You can also take the food back to your room, or grab a pizza from across the street at the strip mall and eat it on the beach. The stores and supermarket across the street are a short walk, but nicely hidden from the resort. The resort has a peaceful \"away from it all\" feel, but its only a short drive to the happening town of Lahina, which is where we spent most of our time.

We stayed at AKS for 5nights and everyone that worked at the resort was very very pleasant. As I hear all the rooms are up for remodeling and should be completed if not already done. Our room was just absolutely perfect. We were on the PH (penthouse) floor and we had a 1 bedroom o/v suite. Our room had new everything from the appliances in the kitchen to the pictures and sofa in the living area. We took advantage of using the kitchen by buying breakfest items so we could get up and lounge at our leisure and relax on the lanai. We had 2adults and 2 children (ages 9 and 7). The garden pool was perfect for the kids and we never had a problem getting towels or lawn chairs. The beach was fine w/nice waves however a little rocky. The kids wanted to get seashells however very limited. We walked down the beach and we did notice other hotels and even checked out there pool however the AKS maintance and grounds keeping was much more noticeable than the others. So we stayed on our turf. We also had fun doing the lei making class which was great. If you plan on doing any activities while staying at the hotel make sure you reserve your spot as soon as you get there or adleast 24hrs prior to event. One day there was a hula show that was very nice. The AKS offers a program for kids. Stay play and eat for free. Yeah kids stayed for free however the hotel didnot honor the eat for free w/the restuarant that was on property. You had to go else where to take advantage of the promo and there is also a kids club that is on property and there is also a fee along w/that. There were a few attractions that honored the promotion but it was very limited. I don't think the promotion should be advertised eat/play for free if the hotel doesn't let it's guest benefit from the venu at hotel. As you can see that was the only thing that didn't sit well with me. Other than that this hotel was top notch. If you have any doubt in your mind about the accommadation or the Customer service you have nothing to worry about this place was absolutely wonderful. Would I return to this hotel again?

Never had problem with noise...This unit had been renovated with a king size bed, a queen sofabed, and a nice bathroom and kitchen (no bugs there). Enough space for us (4 adults and a baby). Ground unit are really convenient especially with a toddler. We stayed one day at the hotel beach, nice beach (although you can find better on the island), easy to swim and large enough... We did enjoy the $100 credit at their restaurant and were glad it was free (we had breakfast there-so so, and did get few cocktails..on the house!)

We had requested a crib, and I was ready to argue for the fees (I saw on previous reviews that they made you pay for it...but on different websites like expedia they say it's complementary...did not have to pay- they did not even charge us) No problem with the front desk either: we requested a crib and it came within 5 minutes, same with towels or dish soap... We had a late flight, so we asked to check out later, they allowed us to keep the room until 1pm and gave us access to a hospitalily room to take shower in the evening...That's where I found out we were lucky with our unit...I finally understood why some people were complaining...The hospitality room was really old, I wouldn't want to spend my vacations in there....So I guess your vacations really depend on what unit you will get...So don't forget to ask when you book your room that you want a remodeled unit....

Now, we have 3 small children and grandma to consider, which made it difficult to stay at a 5-star resort because we would have had to rent at least 2 rooms (not even a suite would accomodate us). We chose the Shores. It is definitely not the Kaanapali Beach we were used to. The beach is small and we really spent zero time there. The pools are lovely, especially the garden pool which is more quiet. The foilage, trees, and grass surrounding the garden pool provide a lovely setting. The ocean front pool is nice, too, but can get a little loud with the restaurant/bar being right there. Not always relaxing. We never had a problem finding a chair, but towels were often hard to come by. We waited on several days for fresh towels. The restaurant was not somewhere we enjoyed eating. We thought the food was sub-par given the prices so we drove to other lovely restaurants around Kaanapali and Lahaina. It was nice to have the market across the street, and Safeway (a bit cheaper) was not too far to drive. What disappointed us the most was the fitness center. The fitness center mentioned on all web sites and advertisements was not included with the room rental, was rarely open even during posted hours, and was a disappointment. The staff seemed nice, but the housecleaning staff was rushed. We decided to rent a large, corner unit with a full ocean view and wrap around lanai. We are not sorry about it. The view made up for any other complaint we had. The sound of the ocean crashing and seeing the other islands was so lovely we could have just lived out on the lanai entirely. Being on the second floor had some drawbacks, especially noise from people out on the beach or the area just below our room. The unit we had, room 202, was not updated. The beds were awful (we're still suffering with sore backs) and the decor was sad. But, we just looked out at the gorgeous ocean and our complaints melted away. We loved the family time and most of the other families we met were very nice with good, well-behaved kids. We are disappointed that we had to listen to sanding, pounding, and other assorted construction noises, which we were not advised of at the time of our booking. Also, it is hard to be next door to people who smoke on their lanai when your family does not smoke. This resort also allows smoking at the pools which is disgusting when you do not smoke and are trying to enjoy the sun. We are not sure if we would stay again, but we would definitely not settle for anything less than a corner unit with 2 bedrooms, especially with 6 people. We enjoyed it!

I had read some fairly bad reviews and was worried about the place not meeting my expectations. I was pleased to see that it was very very nice. Immaculate grounds keeping and a nice restraunt facing the ocean. My one bedroom condo room had a great ocean view but was on the cusp of needing renevation. I'd be surprised if they booked it again prior to remodeling. The furniture and appliances were tired looking and dated circa 1989 or beyond I would imagine. The drywall near the toilet base was peeling and the toilet would run all the time. I lifted the lid to check on the guts of the thing and a few parts disintegrated in my hand and the handle fell off into the tank. Maintenance came quickly after I called and fixed the problem but it still cycled on and off a bit. Had a nice chat with the repair guy while he fixed it. Nice guy willing to please. All the staff was very accomodating. Other rooms were much nicer as I could see from my balcony. I could see much nicer furniture. But I'm a single guy who was on vacation alone to check out the Hawaiian islands. Therefore I didn't mind these imperfections. It made for some humor when I called home to friends from time to time. But had I had a girlfriend with me, or had I been on my honeymoon, I would not have been so forgiving. I would have insisted on an updated room. One thing Aston should have done differently is relocate the restraunt so that the kitchen fans aren't the prominent sound you hear all day long in the middle of the courtyard. On at about 4:45 am and off by 10:30 pm everyday. Big design error I'd say. Great restraunt location but terrible fan placement. I'd rather hear the waves at night while falling asleep. The Beach is rocky. Wear sandles if you use it for swimming. But nice and private which I liked. Great place for not a ton of money. No bugs or mold in my room. No bad smells. Nice and clean. Just dated early 90's decor. I'd return, not alone (too lonely with so many sexy women strolling around) but with a girlfriend or wife and I'd insist on a renovated room.

My husband and I were on a budget and went through Apple Vacations to find a good package deal since we didn't want the extra stress of putting a vacation together. I was worried when I read some of the reviews on here. But I honestly thought the hotel was very nice, especially in it's price range. A few years ago I stayed at the Embassy Suites (the pink hotel right next door). I really thought the Shores was a better place for us. We used the kitchen a lot. We went to Safeway to buy most of our groceries and went once across the street to the Star Market (As a side note the nice gentleman in front of us in line asked if it was our honeymoon and then bought us our groceries-I just want to say thanks to the generous people that care!). We made a lot of meals at the hotel instead of eating out every meal. Some nights we even stayed in a rented a movie on the TV at the hotel. Our hotel room number was 209 and it was already rennovated and everything was updated except some of the appliances in the kitchen. But everything worked just fine and we had no problems with anything. The grounds are beautiful there. The gardeners must take their job seriously because everything was trimmed to perfection. We took a lot of beautiful pictures at the hotel and when I brought them back to show people in AZ they were like 'This is beautiuful, where is it?'. The beach isn't that great but we went on so many excursions and mini trips on the island that I really didn't care about the beach at our hotel. If you are looking for a really nice beach you will want to travel a little bit. The pools there weren't very busy and we always made our nightly visit to the hot tub. Other than that the pool area was kept clean. We had a $100 food credit that we used at the restaurant. We took some omlets up to our room a few times and sat down to eat twice. We also used some of it to buy us a few Captain/Cokes and some Lava Flows. (Don't get the coconut shrimp there. A big rip off, 5 little shirmp for ten bucks...Bubba Gumps or Outbacks are much better.) The orientation the first day you are there is helpful. They were honest and we were pleased with all of our activities, they even told us not to book any whale watching trips because the whales were pretty much gone even though they could have easily booked us all trips just to make a few extra bucks. We didn't think we would sign up for everything our first full day there but we did. It made it so much nicer than trying to call everyone and plan out your trip. Just let them do it and I don't think the prices were too bad either. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the room. It was hawaiian but not tacky. It felt like home while we were there. We never had any problem with housekeeping. They always did their cleaning when we were out and about. We did find one roach when we first opened the door but that was the only one and it probably snuck in from the balcony. No big deal though, never saw any other bugs in all eleven days. Tidbits of activites booked through the hotel: *ZIP LINES were so fun and the best thing I tried in Hawaii, I'm scared of heights but I LOVED it! You won't regret it! It's awesome! *Hapa Papa's Road to Hana Tour-worth the $109.00 per person to have the whole trip narriated by a local and everyone gets their own window seat in a deluxe van *Molokini/Lanae snorkle tour on Pacific Whale Foundation-great because profits go back to preserving the islands and wildlife *Bikeride down the volcano wasn't my thing, I got in the van about half way down *Dinner/Cocktail cruises=really cheap alcohol *Atlantis sub eh...so so but neat to see below surface because we don't scuba Overall I really recommend this hotel. I did type a lot of info but reading the comments of previous guests was the best way for me to find the right hotel. I'm glad I chose this one. It really felt like home and for the price I was able to do a few more activies on the island rather than pay double for an expensive hotel.

Eat the local produce and you will not be disappointed! The farmer's markets are the best places for fresh fruit as well as island ambiance. The crafts fair at the community center is fantastic and we always find good bargains there! It's on Sundays....

But we would not stay at this hotel again for one reason and one reason only: The noise in the bedrooms! We stayed in a 1 BR suite/condo. The suite was decent size and they recently updated the furniture and carpet. Kitchen hadnt been redone yet nor had the 1980 microwave oven but no big deal. The one and only problem was that the bedroom location in each 1 br suite is adjacent to the hallways. The BR walls are very thin and because of its location to the hallways you can hear each and every person walk past your bedroom all night long - flipflops hitting the hallway floor, people talking, workers, the elevator bell (5 rooms away), and every car that parks at night. Dont forget the occassional party folks that stroll in at 1 or 2 am and make noise all the way to their room. Thats fine with them, thats their business, but I dont want any part of anyone elses noise when I try to sleep. The only saving grace was that things quited down after 1am and from 1am - 6am you it was quiet enough to sleep. We are not light sleepers either. I recommend the resort fix this or they will lose more and more customers which is unfortunate because the rest of the resort is decent. I would not stay again because I enjoy a good night sleep and I enjoy privacy of my own room. Who wants to be cranky all the next day on their vacation because they were tired and didnt get a good night sleep. Each room also has a 2 inch open gap under their main door and that also lets alot of noise in the room. If you stay here, take a look at the 2 inch gap. I read this on the website before we went and looked. It was true. Kind of strange too as the hotel loses costs on its air conditioning bills. I was surprised bugs didnt make use of the 2 inch opening - we did not see any bugs at all. The overall bldg is a 1960s nostalgia type with some old hallways and unattractiveness to it but they are making efforts to redo all the rooms and grounds to make this a nice place. Dont expect a nice new hotel like you find on the mainland. Couple more things I didnt like but wouldnt affect my decision to stay again. $9.00 parking per day. The Papeka resort next door (also owned by the same owners, ASTON) did not charge their folks parking. Hmmm. The resort will charge you to use the in-room safe. We brought our own crib (pack and play) because we were warned that the resort charges $12.00 per day for cribs. The resort charges to use their treadmills, bicycles, and fitness equipment. This was all unclassy and they should just keep their $100 voucher they give everyone and stop nickel and diming folks. The last thing people want on a vacation they paid decent money for are petty costs and any type of little burdens like this. Now the good stuff. I think you will enjoy your vacation here if you decide to stay. We enjoyed our stay. The pools were small but very nice. Jacuzzis are great. Restaurant and bar make it nice for meals or drink. The lobby is the best part of the hotel and the grounds were well taken care of. The walkways are nice to stroll up and down and connect to Embassy Suites and Papeka resort. We strolled each night and watched the beautiful sunsets and views of Lanai and Molakia. Beach is lacking real estate and coral hinders swimming but we knew this going and drove to the plentiful public beaches on the island each day and didnt mind. Lobby has wireless (wi-fi) internet connection and a real plus and suprisingly at no cost. The shopping center across the street is another definite plus with supermarket, pizza shop, coffee house, and more.

When we got there, it was another story. They acted like we never called and said that we would have to pay for another nights stay if we wanted to stay for a week. The front desk staff were rolilng their eyes at us and got fussy when we were the ones who just 3endured a 26 hr trip getting there. After about 2 hrs of arguing with the front desk, they went ahead and said we wouldn't have to pay extra. I think they just got tired of us. 2 nights later, we observed what seemed to cockroaches in our room. We went to complain to the front desk and he told us that the whole island has cockroches and acted like it was no big deal. We asked to see other rooms and they smelled like mildew and one of them had a dead roach right in the doorway. I was horrified. I didn't want to bring back cockroaches in our luggage. The hotel was cold and insensitive to our basic need of not having cockroaches in a hotel room. Reading the other positive reviews, I don't think people payed attention to their room. The two roaches that I saw were very fast and had i not been in the room at that particular time and looking that direction, I probably would not have seen them. 2 days later, Our whole entire floor was given a note that they woudl be exterminating the entire floor as it appeared that when they treat one room, the roaches flee to the next room.

Arrived to check in at 2 p.m. and were told the \"studio\" room we reserved was not ready. No problem, we came back in an hour, but there were still no \"studio\" rooms available. After disappearing for about 5 minutes the desk clerk returned with the happy news that we were given a complimentary \"upgrade\" to a one bedroom condo. (Be skeptical of their upgrades!) The room we were taken to had clearly not been renovated in the 25 or 30 years since it was built. For starters the room just smelled bad, as mentioned above. (Had to buy a \"plug in\" room deoderizer to survive.) The unit's air conditioner was louder than some jet engines. After complaining to the front desk about the noise and asking for another room, what we got instead was a repair person who changed the a/c filter (looked like it had also been there for 30 years) and spent some time trying to quiet the unit down to not much avail. We decided to just turn it off so we could sleep. Unfortunately, the bedroom is arranged so that the head of the bed shares a wall with the cement walkway outside. So your head is literally within inches of people stomping along the walkway. Not only do you hear each footstep, but every spoken word. I won't waste much space with the fact there was a parking lot below the bedroom so we were also serenaded by cars at all hours of the night and day. (Did I mention I requested a \"quiet\" room when I made the reservation?) Night 2 we opted to try and sleep on the living room sofa bed. It was at least quieter in that room, but the sofa bed was very uncomfortable, as they usually are. The bottom sheet had a small red stain of unknown origin. We learned that the sheets don't get changed at this place, the same stained sheet was on the bed our entire stay. The unit was shabby - there were chunks missing out of the walls that had been sloppily repaired with spackle -- but not smoothed out or, heaven forbid, repainted. There was obvious water damage to the unit, the tile floors were uneven and felt hollow in some places; the cabinets in the bathroom showed signs of water damage inside. In summary, we paid $163 per night (before taxes) to stay in the equivalent of a Motel 6. And that is not to disparage Motel 6, they do serve their purpose, but no one pays that much money to stay in one. I had read some positive reviews about this place on Trip Advisor before I made the reservation and one wonders if we can all be talking about the same place! All I can say is beware of complimentary \"upgrades\". If you feel you must stay here, at least ask for a room that has been renovated in the last 10 years and avoid room 428 at all costs! As for partial ocean view, as another reviewer put it, you have to be outside the room on the balcony before you can see any blue ocean. We only had 4 nights in Maui and didn't want to waste any time trying to find other accommodations. When we return next year with our entire family (this was sort of a scouting mission) be assured we won't stay here! When we left the snooty clerk who checked us out didn't even ask if we enjoyed our stay!

I was nervous about the room we would stay in due to the reviews and limited pictures on their website. But rest assured when we walked into our room, we found a very up to date and spacious suite. We stayed in room 148 which is a garden suite so I chose the ground floor; I love waking up in the morning and opening the veranda doors to the lush scenery while having breakfast or lounging around. This room is also tucked away on the grounds so people aren't constantly walking right outside. The birds sang & chattered to greet you each morning, but you can barely hear them with the glass doors shut. You enter the suite from the parking lot side, at the opposite end is a wall of sliding glass so you have a beautiful view of the grounds and meandering creek. Most of these units are owned by other people who rent them out or something like that, so the decor is up to the owner (I think). Either way, I asked for an updated room and we got one. The kitchen came complete with dishes, dish washer, microwave, coffee pot, an island and a washer & dryer. The bedroom had a very comfortable King size bed and the living room had a comfortable pull out. Only one bathroom though. The lobby and the grounds immediately made you feel like you were in Hawaii! I had Afternoon Tea at the Ritz while there and have to say, their lobby and grounds are not nearly as sunny and beautiful (although much larger) and there is no beach either. Upon check-in we also received a $100 credit to the restaurant which has very good breakfast items. We ate breakfast once and lunch once. The pools and hot tubs (two of each) are both completly renovated and the glass wall separating the pool from the ocean helped keep the breezes down which was nice as you emerged from the nicely heated pool (not very warm, but comfortable). The staff at Aston was very friendly and not once did I see any bugs. There were plenty of lawn chairs at the pools, on the expansive lawn and the beach. You do have to rent the shaded ones though. I recommend bringing beach shoes since much of the coastline can be rocky whether it be Maui or Oahu. There is a shopping center within walking distance of the hotel complete with Subway, grocery and an internet cafe. The hotel does offer interent at $10/24 hr. We did not use it. Parking was $9 a day. Aston is 5 - 10 min drive from Lahaina which is very convenient for many restaurants and lots of souvenir shopping. There is a large free lot at the end of the strip, about half a block east of the big banyan tree. Time limit 3hrs, but we always found a space. I bought groceries once at the market in Lahaina and it was so expensive, especially fresh fruit! $13 for 3 lb of grapes! Lunch meat, cheese and bread were decent so we had a few economical lunches and snacks for our long road trips to Hana and the Botanical Gardens. We ate at the following: ROY'S - very noisy, good food, ran out of stuff; KIMO'S -decent food, lovely view; BUBBA GUMP - like any other chain, right on the Beach, MAUI TACOS - must have, tucked away, TEA AT THE RITZ - must do if you enjoy Tea, it was superb, generous and delicous. Held in the Library overlooking the tiered pools and ocean. If you want to eat at Cheese Burger in Paradise, get there early early early. The Old Lahaina Luau is a must, reserve your seating as soon as you know you are coming so you get close to the stage although not seat is really bad the way they have it set up. Food is better than most Luau's but the show and location are the BEST! There are also some nice hospitality surprises when you arrive. And don't wait in line at the bar, your server can get you all of your drinks. My family and I strolled the grounds many times and even spotted the whales swimming around and breaching on several occasions. I still recommend a whale watch tour so you get up close and personal, they can be pretty cheap at $20 (winter months only). Everyone was friendly, onsite outdoor massage & salon, free hula lessons and luau shops on the premises, and across the street were convenient, pools clean, grounds immaculate... I can't think of one thing I can complain about it. Loved it and would gladly return, especially to room 148! Enjoy your trip...

They gave us a beach bag, two sun visors, and two water bottles for staying. The room we stayed in was a Studio w/ a Kitchen. It had a queen size bed, couch w/ a fold out bed, full kitchen, tv, patio w/ a partial ocean view. Seperate sink for toilet and shower area. They provided a Hawaii Newspaper everyday, except Sunday. On the premises are two pools, a garden pool and a beach front pool, and a hottub. THE BEACH FRONT POOL IS BEING RENOVATED SO IT WAS CLOSED....THEY SAID IT SHOULD OPEN AROUND NOVEMBER 15, 2004-MID DECEMBER. This part we did not know when booking. The garden pool is more for kids, as it was only about 3-4 ft. deep, but still very refreshing. There is a restaurant on the premises that serves lunch, dinner, breakfast, and a full bar. We only had a quick sandwich from there when we sat by the pool, as it was closed for lunch for pool renovation. The beach front is nice, the swimming out front starts out sandy, then gets rocky. On the beach, you have a view of Lanai and Molokai. There are three tennis courts, that we used twice. They are in really nice condition for a resort. Behind the resort is a strip mall, within walking distance. It had several restaurants, tourists stores(shirts, snorkel, activites center), and a grocery store. The location of the hotel is just north of Kaanappli hotel area, Lahania, and south of Kapalua on the Northwest coast. It took about 40-45 minutes to drive from the Kahuli airport to the hotel. Lahania(mentioned above) is about 10-15 minute drive to the south. There are several shops and eating establishments there. Overall the experience was more than we expected, just wish we were still there.", "Date": "October 5, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, CA", "Title": "\u201cVery pleased\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2618927", "Content": "I thought the Kaanapali Shores was very nice.

So we decided to splurge a little and upgrade to a larger suite on the 5th floor. The view from the lanai, the kitchen, furniture, and, most importantly, the air conditioning was fantastic. We ate a few meals at the hotel and I am not exaggerating when I say these meals were among our favorite. It should also be noted that the service was very good throughout the hotel, whether it was the restaurant, front desk, or housekeeping staff (our rooms were cleaned well). I think the Kaanapali Shores offers a good value without compromising on quality or amenities. Many condo style properties on the island have a pool but no adjacent beach and certainly no restaurant.

It had two seperate bedrooms. One bedroom had a king size bed with the bathroom right outside the door. The other bedroom had a double bed with the other bathroom attached. This extra room was nice because we have a teenage daughter(she took the bedroom with the double bed and bath) and our teenage son took the living room with the pull out sofa sleeper. There were 3 TV's. Our room had a kitchen(refrig, dishwasher, dishes, microwave, etc) We also had a washer and dryer. I would suggest getting a bigger box of detergent when you get there(grocery store is right across the street from the hotel) The washer is small and it took more loads than we planned on to get our laundry done. Only had one roach visit during the week - fortunately my husband saw it and took care of it before I did! I only heard bugs were a problem if you left food out. Our room was always nicely cleaned - it usually wasn't done til the afternoon but, this is a big place! We were gone for most of the day anyways(who wants to sit in their hotel room when they are in Maui?) and it was always done by the time we got back. The garden is gorgeous - as so many people say! The beach was bigger than I thought it would be from the comments. The kids couldn't go really far out before the coral/rocks bothered them but they did a fair amount of snorkeling along the shore and some boogie boarding. Wouldn't recommend jet skiing on Maui, but would recommend snorkeling, Road to Hana, parasailing, bike ride down the mountain, luau, Ulalena Show, shopping on Front St and golfing! (activity desk was extremely helpful!) If you get to Oahu - where we stayed at the Aston Waikiki Circle - and it's a Wed. or Sat. - check out the swap meet at the arena. The prices there can't be beat!!! The Aston Waikiki wasn't as nice as the Aston Kaanapali, the room was smaller(just a regular hotel room with a small bathroom) but we were only there one night and they upgraded us(without us asking) to an ocean view room.

The air conditioning unit made a low humming noise, but we got used to it and it was not a problem. It worked fine.

The hotel restaurant was good although we only ate there once, so I have limited knowledge. It sure was in a great location looking over the pool and the beach. The other pool was surrounded by a grassy shaded area where many people lounged. The grounds were lovely. Much better than I had imagined. The beach was small and very crowded. I would recommend getting up early or finding a public beach to go to. The best beach was over on Lanai'i but you would have to get a ferry over there for the day or join a snorkel/lunch sail over there like we did (Trilogy is the greatest tour group). I had read in a couple of reviews before we went that there were bugs in the rooms. We found no bugs during our stay. The place was great. The staff was helpful and friendly.

I am a big beach person when it comes to vacation and I never spent more than 20 minutes at their beach. The smell of seaweed was so strong. The length from the sand to the water was only about 10 feet. Then there were the big signs stating \"WARNING - MAN-OF-WAR, JELLYFISH, RIPTIDES.\" That was enough for me. So every day we would drive to a different beach, I recommend driving down to the beach by the Sheraton which was by far the best beach. There were 2 pools at the hotel, but they were nothing special and very small. We would go next door to the Embassy who had an awesome pool with waterfalls & a slide.

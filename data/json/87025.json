All staff are friendly and helpful. Interior of rooms are dated and like in 80s including decor, appliances and bathrooms, and you may get a deck, living and dining area very small. For a one bedroom resort, it is very tight, if you use the second fold out bed from the wall, you can't even go to the washr0om since everything is tight. The rooms looks old. Hotel main lobby gives a better look than the rooms that you end up with. Rooms for 1 room suite is very small. 1 double bed only, second double bed is fold out bed located in the living room. when you unfold the bed in the living room there is no room to walk to the washroom. There is a microwave, stove and fridge and sink. No dishwasher (in these days, this is a surprise, where do you not get a dishwasher in a condo style unit). The fridge in our room was leaking water. The ice cube tray is frozen inside the freezer, you can't put anything in it. The TV is HD but the number of channels are maybe 10 or 15. You have to pay for parking at $20 a day (crazy) and it is valet parking so if you leave something in the car then it is a challenge to get it. You have to pay for internet $25 for a week. How much is it to provide this for free, it hardly costs anything? The upside is that you are close to the beach, you can be there in less than 10 minutes. There is an ABC store in the lobby for anything you need but it is very pricy..some items are reasonable and some are ridiculous like the sandwiches are $10 plus. Fruits are insane prices, 3 bananas $2.50. Bottle water is reasonable. You will have to take the location over the amneties with this hotel as you just a boring room.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLocation over Facilities\u201d", "Author": "droods", "ReviewID": "UR136856279", "Content": "Perfect location in Waikiki, walking distance from Kalakaua Ave and the beach. The hotel is not a resort, and the amenities are average. A big bonus is the ABC store located on the ground floor - highly convenient. Parking cost us $25, and I believe they washed the car (bonus) but you can find parking along the canal if you want to park for free. The decor is quite old, but the beds were comfortable. The room we had was self contained (kitchenette) which would suit families and those that don't want to have to eat out all the time. Average water views, and we were on the 23rd floor. The most painful part of my experience were the lifts. Being a high rise building (27 or so floors) the three lifts service ALL floors (instead of being split up). What this means is you will wait forever for a lift, which I experienced often especially when getting ice from the machines only located on level 2 or 27 (inconvenient). Overall it was one of the cheaper places which is why we stayed, but Waikiki will always be expensive. You could probably get better value for money elsewhere as there is nothing special about this location other than location and having an ABC store only a lift ride away.", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "O'Fallon, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cDon't be confused\u201d", "Author": "twrood", "ReviewID": "UR136346305", "Content": "\"We just finished our two week, too long, stay at the \"resort\" (THIS IS NOT, I REPEAT, NOT A RESORT IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM), and as advertised, it is in Waikiki. It's also woefully outdated; bathrooms look and feel like late 60's Holiday Inns'. They remind me of childhood vacations with the parents in South Dakota. Unfortunately, that's not what I look for in a multi-hundred $$/day \"resort\". Rooftop pool is tiny at best. I wondered about the property when I went to their website before we came, it too looks like it's from the 70's (yes, I know the internet didn't exist in 70's). Turns out the website is on par with the rest of the property. On site restaurant is a Denny's, which seems highly appropriate. Concierge Michael quickly volunteered he could not give any advice on activities not booked through him, guess he didn't want to lose the commission. Such a helpful young man. I doubt other area accommodations charge $50/week for internet access, nor $6/day mandatory fee for the \"free\" local phone calls. Will say the valet parkers are efficient. Good thing as you're required to use them for a bargain $125/wk (plus tips of course). The \"kitchen\" (kitchen is a stove top that looks like it belongs in a 60's era Winnebago, microwave, and minifridge that almost freezes ice cubes) sink in our unit started loudly belching water out, eventually discovered an issue in unit above us. Of course, we had to call twice, guess the first maintenance person I asked forgot or something. When we got back after maintenance was in our unit, we were greeted by a sign in hall warning of wet floor, and true to advertising, our floor had a pool of water. Wondered why they left it for me to clean up rather than mop it themselves, perhaps that was another extra charge. If you come here, be fully advised this is nowhere near comparable to nearby properties, and has a host of \"gotcha\" extra fees. Yes, management was apologetic, and comped internet service and parking for our continued issues, but that didn't improve the nonfunctioning shower in one bathroom, the constant nighttime noise of slamming doors, or the complete lack of any amenities (other than limited selection of DVD's available for the low, low price of $3/night). If you miss those 60's Holiday Inn vacations with your family, however, and cost is no object, this just might be the place for you!\"", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorba Linda, California", "Title": "\u201coutdated room...stubbed toes too often\u201d", "Author": "esqjohn", "ReviewID": "UR135445547", "Content": "Excellent location in midst of waikiki.

The exterior looks okay, but the interior and especially the rooms leave a LOT to be desired. Rooms are in serious need of an update. We will never, ever stay at the Imperial again. There are many other condo-style accommodations in Waikiki. It will be well worth it to pay a bit extra per night than this place. We didn't take advantage of the kitchenette as we only used the room to sleep and get ready since it was so disgusting and uninspiring. This place was a big wrinkle in an otherwise awesome vacation. PROS: - The front desk and valet staff were very nice, attentive, professional, and knowledgeable. - ABC Store downstairs. - 27th floor pool deck was decent. - Location: It's close to A beach. (Not the best section of Waikiki Beach though.) CONS: - When we walked in, we thought it was Golden Girls, but had not been updated since 1987! The green carpeting was old, gross, and faded near the windows. Oh yeah, it was coming up from the walls where the staff has pulled up the carpet to stuff electric cords down there. Isn't that illegal or against some code? The wicker furniture was equally gross, uncomfortable, and in need of an update. - The bathroom was TINY! It made me think I was in an RV. You could use the toilet and wash your hands at the same time. Oh yeah, the \"dusty rose\" color of the toilet was equally 1987, but hey, it worked. The wallpaper was so outdated. How much would it cost to replace that?! - The bedroom had a hard double bed. You will probably have to walk sideways to get around it and in to the main area of the bedroom. There is about a foot of clearance between the bed and the wall. It just doesn't seem right. - Being on the 10th floor affords no views. Our unit was also on the Lewers side, so we got street noise (with sliding doors closed) from trash trucks and their back up beeps early in the morning. Noise from drunk patrons at Yard House at the mall (Beach Walk) across the street was also annoying. - Location. You will be in the middle of the outdoor mall on Lewers Street, full of mainland chains and nothing of interest. I can go to Cheesecake Factory, PF Changs, and Yard House back home... The beach closest to Imperial is in front of the Outrigger Reef. It's not the best part of Waikiki - kind of the outskirts in my opinion. - Hot tubs. We visited the hot tubs and felt like it was a temporary location. There are two backyard style hot tubs on some random patio with ugly/ghetto green awnings. Oh yeah, the hotel workers take their breaks and smoke just below the 3rd floor hot tub area, so you get some great secondhand smoke with your tradewinds.

Prior to my friend\u2019s arrival I stayed in a studio for 3 days (horrible). See my other review for the studio. This is the 5th time I have stayed at The Imperial. Room: \u201cBanyan\u201d Unit 905: Light, bright, clean. Peek-a-views of ocean from the deck, but really just views of other hotels (I know from experience, higher floors can have great views). Small true one bedroom with queen bed, and a pull out sofa and Murphy bed in the living room. It could sleep six(!), but it is more ideal for two single friends, or a couple with kids. Linens and beds were clean and comfortable. Kitchenette was modestly stocked with utensils. Convection microwave, toaster, fridge and coffee maker are good for snacks, but I really wish it had a cook-top. In a pinch, you can go to the owners lounge and use their stovetop if you can find pots/pans. Service/Staff: Accommodating. Polite, but not particularly outgoing, warm or friendly. Occasionally a single person at the front desk could not efficiently handle the line of guests. Amenities: Good weight room, sauna and nice rooftop pool. An owner\u2019s lounge on the top floor is a nice place to relax and take in panoramic views. Overnight parking is reasonable for Waikiki at $25/nt. No free Wi-Fi, Lan connection for pay. Location: Premium. The Imperial is an excellent location in the middle of Waikiki. 1 block to the beach, steps to all shopping, restaurants and amenities. All in all, the micro-location and floor level can make or break a vacation, but otherwise a fair value for a clean and quiet home in the middle of Waikiki. As always; I travel to Waikiki several times a year, I can advise that Waikiki is a nice tropical urban adventure. The city comes with the negatives of a big city, along with the overwhelming benefits of a beautiful beachfront resort. Generally, everything in Waikiki is \u201ca little tired\u201d although there have been continuous improvements in the last few years. If you are traveling solo, take Roberts Hawaii from the airport for $12 (no rsvr rqd). Two or more people, take a taxi from the airport to the hotel (should be under $40).

There are also some clothing/jewelry/souvenir stores adjoining the lobby, as well as a Denny's which we wouldn't normally eat at but the rain was so heavy while we were there that we actually DID eat at the Denny's one night and the food was pretty good. I can't say enough about the bell staff. The regular desk staff was good but the bell guys who you work with to move your car back-and-forth OR to call a cab ---- OUTSTANDING. Friendly, polite, efficient, helpful. They don't get any better. I loved those guys. We rented a car for two days (parts of 3 days --- 48-hours) and because we got the unit on an RCI exchange (thus I guess we qualified for a timeshare parking rate), we paid $20 for two days of parking. Obviously, we gave the guys well-deserved tips. It was cheaper than I expected and so easy to leave the keys with the guys. The hotel has a pool up on top and a couple of hottubs on the 3rd floor, along with a sauna and fitness room there. We didn't use any of those as the weather was so awful --- constant rain. But, they are there and we did check them out. We paid for the DSL internet. The Imperial didn't have wireless available. Internet was $15 a week which we were happy to have since we needed to change all our plans, due to the weather. Very handy to have access for a lot of quick Googling. As far as the unit, we got what we reserved (an RCI trade) and it had many amentities (Palm unit --- 2 baths, 2 flatscreen TV's, DVD players, full kitchen, 2 extra beds as fold-outs, etc.) but, frankly, it was a dump. Except for the new Mr. Coffee coffeepot and the flatscreen TV's, everything else in the kitchen was very old and dated. The stove and dishwasher and microwave looked so old, I didn't use them. Fixtures are dated. Cabinets are very dated and cheapo particle board. Furniture and tile and bath counters were very old and looked dirty or very tired. There was a huge chip (chunk out of) in a bath counter. It's possible that the unit we had was one which had never been upgraded as we did see pictures of other units in the building which were more modern and less tacky. Also, there are a lot of mirrors in the unit which make it look bigger than it was, in the advertising. Our unit (2004, on the 20th floor) is about 520 square feet (we measured it) and did have two tiny balconies, but the unit backed out to the Waikiki Parc and the Sheraton (with a small ocean view between the Sheraton and the Halekulani) and seemed to be in an elevator shaft-type space. In other words, down below were the generators (and garbage-collection centers) of all the high-rise hotels and we could not open the balcony doors without being overtaken with a huge roar of noise. All in all --- we appreciated the location and the staff (and the comfortable bed in the tiny bedroom) but our unit was a *blast from the past* (old and tired) and not relaxing. We're not so picky on the view but it would have been nice to have a little more quiet out on the balcony, so that we could open the patio doors without being blasted with high-volume urban generator noise. Maybe they'll upgrade unit 2004 soon?

When my friend arrived I moved to a 1-bedroom for a week. See my other review for the 1-bedroom. Service/Staff: Accommodating. Polite, but not particularly outgoing, warm or friendly. Occasionally a single person at the front desk could not efficiently handle the line of guests. Amenities: Good weight room, sauna and nice rooftop pool. An owner\u2019s lounge on the top floor is a nice place to relax and take in panoramic views. Overnight parking is reasonable for Waikiki at $25/nt. No free Wi-Fi, Lan connection for pay. Location: Premium. The Imperial is an excellent location in the middle of Waikiki. 1 block to the beach, steps to all shopping, restaurants and amenities. Studio room, Unit 301 : Clean but Horrible. Dark, dank, depressing and noisy. Located 1-foot from housekeeping\u2019s door, 3 feet from the staffs changing room, and next to the sauna, spa, and gym, doors were always banging/sqeeking, opening and closing 24 hours a day. The patio of 301 was covered with a tarp. No light, no view. Situated on a alley, workers on smoking breaks could be heard at all hours. This room should not be available to guests. It should be storage. In fact, all rooms on the 3rd floor should be avoided. At over $100/nt, there is no value in these rooms. If I had to stay more than 3 days in this room, it would ruin a vacation. Please see my other review of Unit 905. As always; I travel to Waikiki several times a year, I can advise that Waikiki is a nice tropical urban adventure. The city comes with the negatives of a big city, along with the overwhelming benefits of a beautiful beachfront resort. Generally, everything in Waikiki is \u201ca little tired\u201d although there have been continuous improvements in the last few years. If you are traveling solo, take Roberts Hawaii from the airport for $10 (no rsvr rqd). Two or more people, take a taxi from the airport to the hotel (should be under $30). In Waikiki, nearly everything is walking distance or a short shuttle/bus away.

To the Imperial's credit, when i pointed this out, they changed my room the next day As previous guests have stated, the rooms higher up definitely have the better views I did not use the pool/sauna so cannot comment (and as the beach was so close by, i didn't feel the need) All up this is a place I would definitely stay at again.

It was cheap, clean-enough and in a central location. Because of the size of the unit & mini-kitchen, I wouldn't suggest having more than 4 adults in a 2 bedroom unit or stay for a long period of time. A little more about our stay; A total of 6 adults decided to catch a last minute flight to Oahu to see Pearl Harbor after spending 6 days on the Big Island. We booked one night (Sept 2011) in a HALA SUITE 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit directly with the Imperial Waikiki, at $210 per night. We didn't have high expectations of the Imperial after reading other reviews, but we chose this hotel because it was in a good location, cheap, knowing we would only sleep & shower here. Driving to the Imperial was a bit of an adventure, the hotel is situated in the city near shopping so lots of people walking, tour buses & one-way streets to navigate around. After finding the hotel, we handed the keys to the busy valet attendant (parking in the garage is $25 per day charged to the room). Hotel check-in was friendly & quick, our luggage was delivered to our room within minutes by a friendly employee. Our room was very basic, small, outdated (80s) and \"fairly-clean\"....it definitely needed a good scrubbing. The kitchen area is NOT really a full-size kitchen as they indicate on the website however it had the basics: a mini-fridge, a really old full size stove/micro combo, coffee maker & almost no counter space....you wouldn't be able to easily cook a meal. Also, we were on the 9th floor and could hear the noise of the street (honking ect). The noise wasn't bothersome to us, but could be if you are sensitive to sound or are a light sleeper. After passing our bedbug/rodent inspection we all quickly showered (The bathrooms were tight, but not as tight as in europe and water was nice & hot) and were out exploring Waikiki within 30 minutes of our arrival. In the downstairs lobby there is a cheap ABC Store, a couple of cheap souvenir/clothing stores. Directly across the street from the Imperial there is the Embassy Suites & Outrigger hotels and down the street there were lots of high-end chain stores, Fendi, Cartier and chain restaurants including PF Chang, Starbucks, etc For dinner, we ended up at the Shore Bird restaurant at the Outrigger overlooking the beach & Diamond Head. Drinks were nice and strong & the staff was friendly. We watched the sunset while eating a large salad buffet and steaks we were able to grill ourselves! After dinner we stepped onto the beach to watch the fireworks before returning to our room. The linens were crisp and beds comfortable-enough. The next morning we were up early & headed downstairs to Denny's. Sometimes Denny's is questionably, but the food here was good, coffee fresh and staff was attentive & friendly.

I parked the car in front of the ABC and our friend went inside to get a bag of ice and I got out and went to the trunk and get the chest ready for the ice. As soon as I opened the trunk, the young Imperial Valet came to me and told me to move the car. I said \"okay, just give me a second here.\" He yelled, \"Move the car now!\" I had drink bottles out and started trying to get them together. I said, \"okay,\" but he continue yelling \"move the car now!\" Of all my trips to Hawaii, I have never been treated so rudely. On every island, I have also been treated as a special guest by everyone. This is the first time anyone has ever been so rude. I made a mistake by parking in the wrong place. I did not do it intentionally. I did not leave the car. I will never stay at the Imperial because of this.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lima, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat place\u201d", "Author": "tigersfan68", "ReviewID": "UR114970883", "Content": "I've never had a problem with this place.

If not, and you have other alternatives, I would take a pass on this place. I stayed in the studio which may have led to my not-so-great experience. The 1,2,or 3 bedroom options are probably a little better. The studio did not have a bed. It only had a roll away (which was probably from the 70's and completely uncomfortable) and this \"thing\" that came down from the wall that they call a bed. It's probably a full size bed type structure which was also extremely uncomfortable. That being said, I did not sleep very well during my stay. In fact, 1 night during my stay, I went on priceline and paid for a hotel room just so I could get a normal night of sleep. Some of the pro's of the property: the staff is good and the location is good (pretty central to everything in Waikiki) Con's: it's an aging property and it shows, towels (bathroom and beach) were disgusting, uncomfortable beds, cleaning service only once per week, and dirty furniture. When it comes to travel, everyone has varying opinions and I realize that. What I would suggest to anyone who reads this is: ask yourself \"have I ever stayed at a luxury hotel like four seasons, ritz, JW, etc?\" If you have, don't stay at the Imperial. You will be completely let down. If luxury brands aren't your thing, and your used to staying at days inn and motel 6, then this place won't be so bad.

I went to the Paradise Cove luau with other guests at The Imperial and we thought it was a joke; do not assume the activity director is steering you to the best vendor and not just one that earns more commission. She never even asked me for any details when I complained about the luau, which leads me to believe she already knows about all the complaints. If you book the circle island tour make sure you know where the stops are and for how long. Normally the advantage of taking a smaller tour (van with about 12 people) is that you visit less of the touristy sites.

I found the matress to be very soft and the pillows were too voluminous for my taste. On Friday night a group of immature young men checked into the room directly upstairs from us. They partied like they were 14 years old and their parents had left them alone for the first time.

What we liked: Very convenient location for shopping, beach, food choices for a family. We went to Denny\u2019s for breakfast and ABC store downstairs for snacks and supplies. We walked to the beach by Fort DeRussy or Waikiki area (in front of Sheraton very easily. Lots of high-end shops, souvenirs within 1-2 blocks. Royal Hawaiian Centre is also within 2 blocks. We went to the foodfair a few times to have noodles, Chinese, Korean and Hawaiian food. Because this is our second week in Waikiki, we decided to rent a car for a week. Parking at Imperial can only be done by valet. We paid $100 for the week. In general, staff were very friendly and always greeted/smiled at us. With the car, we bought groceries at Ala Moana and wet to other beaches (Ko Olina lagoons, Kailua, Waimea). If you are a timeshare owner, you have access to owner\u2019s lounge on 26th floor. This is really spacious and had nice decor with a full kitchen, dining tables, lounge areas, and lanais. There is a full ocean view and good place to watch fireworks. This really came in handy on our last day after checking out to relax, eat take-out dinner and use the shower before our flight. We should have used this area more often since our unit was so small. If our unit was updated like the owner\u2019s lounge, we would have enjoyed it more. What we didn\u2019t liked: We were in unit 902 (1 bedroom) which faces east (view of Imperial Parc\u2019s deck). This is a lousy view and we felt that we had no privacy. At any time, someone could walk onto the deck. We had to keep curtains in the bedroom closed most of the time. Sine this was over July 4, they were full and were not able to change our room. Mid week, they said a unit was available in a higher floor, but on the same side of the building. We would have to pay $50 cleaning fee if we wanted to move. We decided to stay. If you are booking at Imperial, you should request view of Fort deRussy side (west side). If you are high enough, you can see Hilton\u2019s fireworks. If you end up on the Waikiki Parc side, request a room higher than 9th floor so you\u2019re not so close to the building and right at their deck level. The unit itself is small. Living room contained a sofa and a separate Murphy bed. When the Murphy bed is out, the eating table and sofa/coffee table area is really cramped. The bedroom only had 1 night table and it was hard walking to the side of the bed facing the window. The bathroom was tiny as well. There is very little space to dry off and stand in front of the sink. Fixtures were all older. We thought we had a full kitchen but this unit did not have a stove/hot plate, only microwave, sink, fridge (with a freezer that did not work), coffee maker. This is fine for having breakfast, snacks and take-out food in our room. We have relatives who have timeshare in higher level units which have been updated and they have raved about this building. Our unit has obviously not been updated (but very clean) and really needed new curtains, bedding, carpet, bathroom fixtures. However, there is only so much you can do with the layout, which will always be small. Internet is not free. I think we paid $25 per week to use the wire connection in our room. Self-parking is not available, a bit inconvenient since you have to load and unload your car in the front drive way, in full view of everyone. Our son fell asleep in the car on the way back one day and we had to wake him up in the driveway (versus letting him sleep in the parking lot with one of us in the car). The small pool is on 27th floor rooftop is not inviting at all. After being at Hilton Hawaiian Village with their waterslides and large freeform pool, we didn\u2019t want to even go into this pool. It was surrounded by walls with windows, so there isn\u2019t much of a view.

Understandably, there are thousands who visit this time timeshare, and only a few hundred, who when dissatisfied over the slightest thing, are willing to write a review. Thankfully, we decided to be our own judge and are glad we took the steps to do so. The Imperial Resort is centrally located and situated in the perfect spot for all activities and shopping. We stayed in room 2508. Arguably, one of THEE most beautiful scenic rooms offered. The rooms are clean and not as small as the other reviews claim they are. Is the furniture outdated...not really. If you compared it to a 5star resort (SUCH AS TRUMP) possibly. It didn't have cascading water falls in the lobby and the rooms didn't offer large jacuzzi style bathtubs, but the feel I got when I entered the room, was simply...Hawaii. I didn't get the impression of being in a cheap hotel by far. It's valued high for the money you spend and comparable to being in any other resort in the area. Personally, I rate it to be a 4 1/4. Why the 1/4?? ...because my experience of timeshare resorts are slightly different in the fact that I'm used to having an \"in room\" laundry facility and at least \"starter\" coffee/tea packets offered in the room. Other than that, they accomodate everything I've seen stylish resorts to offer. They have in-room maid service conveniently offered on certain days and you have full access to xtra lines/towels during extended business hours. You have access to an in-house massage therapist and the spa area in very relaxing. I especially like the security they have with reaching your rooms, which means you need to meet your guest to take them to your floor. It takes a key card everytime you access the elevator...completely eliminating the possibility of children pushing buttons to see them light up. (Nice to know in a hotel that has 27 floors.) My husband is an Officer with the State of California and raved on that piece of security. His overall experience was so profound, he will be recommending this location to his friends and co-workers.

It is on Lewers street and is a very nicely renovated street with lots of new stores and foot traffic. It is clean, the lobby is simple similar to a holiday inn. It was priced comparable to hotels two blocks away from the beach, this one is very close to the beach so we got it and were not disappointed. If you pay to much, then you might be disappointed.

My husband and daughter (5 yrs) and I enjoyed it very much. The location is A+, right by the Halekulani and Outrigger Reef, across the street from Waikiki Beach. Yes, it is true, the property is aging, but we did not find it horrible at all. Everyone (staff and guests) were friendly and in a good mood. We stayed in a studio - Murphy bed (nice and firm mattress) with a futon - my daughter slept there. Our view was of Lewers Street - great for having a beer on the lanai and people watching (3rd floor). The room had a good size mini fridge, coffeemaker, toaster and microwave. All utensils included. Room was very clean. So was the bathroom. Just had a shower stall, but no big deal to us. Good closet space and nice flat screen TV with DVD player, so we brought some movies from home to watch. We are originally from NY, so yes it was noisy, only really bothered us in the very early AM when trucks were making their deliveries, but you want to be up early anyway and enjoy all that Hawaii has to offer. The convenience of the ABC shop downstairs is the best. We did find the Walmart on Oahu and bought our milk, bread, beer, chocolates, from there b/c ABC is pricey, but in a jiffy, it was convenient. And don't forget to try those coconut M&Ms...you will love them. Ok, the pool is cheesy and the hot tubs were not the coolest, but you are right on Waikiki Beach - just go there! GREAT views of Diamond Head - your pictures will totally rock. The Imperial is also right on Beachwalk, this new pedestrian friendly area with shops and places to eat - very nice with all of the lit tiki torches at night. You can also walk to the Royal Hawaiian Center - more shopping and people watching. Great location the Imperial - you are in the mix of Waikiki Beach. I recommend that you eat at Duke's at Outrigger on the Beach and try Eggs n Things on Saratoga Ave - THE BEST MACADAMIA NUT PANCAKES AND OMELET I have ever had in my entire life.

One block from the beach and right on the new beachwalk. We didn't open our balcony because of the street noise. As long as it was shut, the noise wasn't a problem other than the trash trucks waking us every morning. We weren't interested in sleeping in, so it was fine with us to use them as our alarm clock. We had a great week and the room didn't detract from the wonderful time we had. The on-site trip planner was helpful. We booked a couple of tours (island tour and snorkeling) with them.

We exchanged our timeshare through Interval International for this resort. The Imperial is mostly a timeshare resort. However, some rooms are marketed through the Imperial website for individual nights. This distinction is important because it will directly effect the room that you receive. Timeshare guests get the best rooms. Our room was on the 24th floor. As previous reviewers have stated, you need to be on the 20th floor or higher to get a view of the beach. You will usually pay more for ocean views at resorts / hotels in Waikiki. So, we were exceedingly pleased with the view from our room. People who pay for their room by the night (non-timeshare guests) will not have a nice view from their rooms and should not expect one. Furthermore, as a timeshare property, there are certain housekeeping practices that take place, which are common to timeshare resorts. Rooms are cleaned once per week (even if you pay by the night) and if you stay less than 3 or 4 nights then your room may not be cleaned at all during your stay. Trash is emptied each day and dirty towels were replaced during our stay each day. From our room, I was able to pick up a free wireless signal for my laptop. Others may not be so lucky. This resort is not a 5-Star resort and does not market itself as such. It was built in the 1970s and has not undergone major renovations since then. However, small improvements have clearly taken place. Our unit had two LCD flat-screen TVs (one in the living room and one in the bed room), for example. The microwave was also new. Most of the other items in the unit (the carpeting, couch, chairs, stove, etc) were definitely more than 20 years old. Everything worked and was clean at check-in. The staff was very friendly. The valet parking is $20.00 per day ($25.00 per day if you not a timeshare guest). We thought this was a very good value. Our car was always brought to us within 2 minutes! If you just want to stay on the beach, then I would just take a shuttle from the airport. We did lots of sightseeing since this was our first time in Hawaii. As many people have stated in other reviews, the location is excellent. I would be happy to stay here again if I was exchanging my timeshare.

Guests get access to the owners lounge which has internet access and there is a pool on the roof. The pool scene was definitely NOT happening and it was largely deserted.

It is all valet, which means you get charged a daily valet fee.

As soon as I did, the dust came flying out of the wall, when you peek in the space between where the bed was and the wall, it seemed like no one cleaned it for ages. The dust was very thick. Since we were so tired, we made our best to tough it out and get a good night rest. For the next couple of days, we pretty much just stayed out of the room, only to go back and sleep. On our third day, my husband went down to the front desk to see if they can change our room but the receptionist was again unrelenting, he said he cannot do anything. My husband asked if there's anyone he can talk to, it just so happened that the manager was walking by, he then explained the situation and he immediately resolved the problem. We got a KOA room on the 15th floor. I found it to be cleaner, brighter and much more roomier. It didn't matter to us that both showers didnt have enough hot water pressure (almost like a trickle) so we took semi cold showers until the hot water started running like normal again towards the end of our trip. Just as I was about to say, this place is not too bad, another incident happened. We came back to our room after spending time on the beach and found that the door was left wide open. It looked like someone fixed the beds but forgot to clean the rest of the place. The garbage was not picked up nor were our towels and toiletries re- stocked. They just made the beds and left. (Remember, if you're checking in using timeshare, you only get the room cleaned once a week). After checking the whole place, we found that nothing was missing (thankfully) but we called immediately and security was sent to our room and had our door re keyed. The hotel has apologized but it really just wasnt acceptable for us. The only perks I can agree to is that the location is very good. You're within walking distance of good restaurants and shops. Valet service was great and friendly, giving us good directions all the time. They have a good selection of DVD's in the lobby that you can rent for $3.00. ABC store is conveniently accessible downstairs. Other than this, I can't think of anything else that's nice about it. The hotel pool was small and looked like an oversized bath tub (about half the size of a normal pool and I'm not exaggerating). You're better off swimming in the warm, beautiful beaches. Hopefully, other travelers will have a much better experience (and better room) than what we had. Unfortunately, our experience is such that we probably won't come back here again unless they do some much needed work on their hotel.", "Date": "June 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rancho Cucamonga, California", "Title": "\u201cMahalo Imperial Waikiki\u201d", "Author": "Carla027", "ReviewID": "UR15891969", "Content": "May 10 2008 We just returned home from a wonderful vacation in Hawaii (Oahu). We (4) of us, my husband ,our daughter ,her girlfriend and myself,staying at the Imperial Waikiki. Timeshare trade for the Hale unit, 2 bedroom 2 bath. I honestly will tell you what a great choice we made. The unit was on the 22nd floor with a wonderful view of the ocean from each room. If you don't happen to get a room with a view don't worry. They have an owners lounge (26th floor) which has everything. Offering a full kitchen for use, pool table, computers,a big screen television to enjoy . Lots of sofas and chairs for all. ....but also that fabulous view. We watched the fireworks go off Friday eve. over the Hilton Hawaiian Lagoon from the lounge. Also on the 27th floor is the pool and hot tub with great views also. We met timeshare owners of the Imperial owning for 30 years now. They return every year they said. 4 lovely elderly folks.This was the first year they recall the pool being kept heated and warm at 84 degrees. We never used the pool tho. with the beach a block away. We all enjoyed ourselves, the location is perfect! The girls (early 20's) partied every night til 4 am. at the clubs very close by. The Beachwalk is very upscale, fine dining a walk across the street, or other choices up the block. You'll have to stay there to appreciate the location without paying 5 star rates! The famous Pink Royal Hawaiian is 1 block up.We all enjoyed their Luau. Trumps new Tower (Condos) going up presently is a half block away. If that doesn't speak for itself on location. Oh save the car rental cost. Take a taxi from the airport. Just rent daily if needed, it's close by.. The cost to park over night at the Imperial is $25 a day. We only needed a car 2 days and rented daily, returning it back. Do drive up to Ko-Olina and the Lagoons available for public use. It's at the Marriotts Resort. Also enjoy driving the Island to North Shore.approx.( 3 hours.or less) Or call for a shuttle, as we did to get to the Arizona and Missouri. $12 ea.roundtrip. Hey a high 5 for all of us. We walked from the Imperial along Waikiki to Diamond Head. Then hiked up Diamond Head for it's incrediable view point!!! Of course we took the Bus back which you may take right outside the park. $2. each. Pick up a bus schedule at the hotel. Or walk. as we did. :o) Great exercise. in ending........ The staff (all of them) excellent and so helpful. Thank you Tony (reservations manager) for such a great room, which just added to our enjoyed time there. My husband and I enjoyed many cocktails on our lania watching the Beackwalk and activity below. I rate this hotel at the top. We would definetly plan another stay there if on Oahu again.

That being said, if you don't expect class A accomodations, you will be happy. The rooms are small but clean. You must like the people you are travelling with. You will not be able to make a gourmet dinner in most of the rooms, as the kitchens are mostly a dorm fridge, microwave, coffeepot. Some have small stoves or oven. Fresh towels and linens are available but requires you to get them as room service is only provided on a limited basis as this is mostly a timeshare type hotel. But you can get almost anything you want with a trip to housekeeping. Some room views are excellent, and others are very disappointing. Waikiki in general is like this. There does not appear to have been any urban planning when the high rise hotels went up. Each hotel got progressively bigger the closer to the ocean causing most hotels to lose unobstructed views. Parking in Waikiki is going to cost you your first born child anywhere. The Imperial raised their daily fee to $25.00, plus it is valet parking and you will need to include the tips on top of this. All of this being said, there are some of the nicest people employed by the Imperial Of Waikiki. Kona in the travel department can get you tickets and transportation to everything, RJ and the bellhops go out of their way to remember you.

We stayed 7 nights and just rented a car for 4 days more than enough time to see the other parts of the Island. The room was comfortable and equiped with a micro wave, sink and small refrigerator. While a cooktop would have been more convinient. The setup met our needs. The rooms do need some decorative updating thought they are clean and well kept. There is one TV with dvd player in the living room and murphy bed. A TV in the rather small bedroom would have been nice. the living room and bedroom each have balconies.

The Imperial is conveniently located on Lewers Street in the heart of Waikiki and is a stone's throw from the beach. Lower units have no view, but upper units have ocean and territorial views. The interior of the building is quiet and secure, and there is a pleasant rooftop view pool. Most of the units that I have stayed in are dated but in modest/serviceable condition with small kitchenettes. The rooftop community lounge/tv/free computer/pool table/kitchen has a spectacular view. As of this writing (11/15/06) I would *not* recommend staying at the Imperial (or any other Lewers Street hotel) until late 2007 or 2008. There is *significant* construction and new hotel development in the area and it is noisy and dirty. After the neighboring Trump Hotel is complete, the neighborhood (and my rating) will improve significantly. In the past I have paid between $85-125/nt. You may find more information at the building's website. As always; I travel to Waikiki several times a year, I can advise that Waikiki is a nice tropical urban adventure.

The rooms are dated & eventually need renovating in the near future. I was on the 15th floor facing Lewers St.. For the most part, the $460 million street renovation is done so the outside noise level is pretty much nil. The street is fabulous looking now. As far as I'm concerned, the room was clean, comfortable & much too my liking. Local calls are free. While I did not use the fully equipped kitchen except for the fridg, I thought it was very functional. The bed was firm & comfortable. There is TV with DVD player with a DVD rental plan in the lobby for only $3/day for 4 DVD's/day rental. Being a timeshare owners room, I was given full access to the owners lounge on the 26th floor. It had 4 desktop computers with full web access & unlimited wireless if you have your laptop with you, for free. It also has a pool table, big screen tv with several very comfortable black leather couches, full kitchen, & tables. But probably the best thing about it is the large balcony with an incredible ocean view. The front desk & valet staff were extemely friendly & helpful. The convenience of the ABC store & 24hr Denny's right outside the lobby is definitely a plus.

It is recommended not go out alone or even in groups of two after dark in the neighborhood, though we never heard of anything happening while we were there. I would recommend smaller families to stay at the Imperial (Unless a larger family got the biggest room).

We had a view of the ocean between two hotels and that was all we needed to check the weather and beach conditions.

We went to the northshore as well and loved the big waves and lack of crowds was a nice change. The hotel itself was clean, centrallly located and the right price for a family of 6! Our kids enjoyed the hot tub, the pool; looked fine we swam in the ocean though. We had no trouble with maid service or getting fresh towels whenever we needed them. The staff were always friendly and eager to help, we were always polite and friendly to them too!!! Christmas morning Santa even visited our room with a gift!

It basically put a big damper on my trip. It all started with loose change and dollar bills going missing within our room. We could handle that, but what really upset me the most was how we were treated like complete dummies when asking for help within the lobby area (especially the front desk). The day-shift staff at the front desk wouldn't give us the time of day when we would ask for directions to our destinations or bus times. They would simply give us an \"I dunno, ask someone else\". They were not hospitable at all, they made me feel extremely uncomfortable. The same day-shift clerk even accused me of losing a DVD rental that we didn't even rent. Later that day they found the DVD which was rented to another room, and not once did I get an apology. We were given dirty looks by the two day-shift front desk employees everytime we stepped off of the elevator for the rest of our trip. Also, I put up the 'do not disturb' sign one day while we went out to the beach, and I came back to find the towels in my bathroom replaced. This instantly made me mad, as we had money previously taken. We spent the next two hours going through our stuff making sure nothing was missing. Then, to top everything off, our checkout time was at 11 a.m., but unfortunately our flight didn't leave until 9:00 p.m. so reluctantly we had to leave our luggage with the hotel. When we arrived to pick up our luggage, we briefly looked through it all to make sure all of our belongings were still there. We did this within 10 minutes, as our shuttle bus had arrived early to pick us up. Everything looked fine, until I realized at the airport that I didn't remember seeing the macadamian cookies on top of my clothing when I searched before we left. When I arrived, I unpacked my luggage and sure enough, I discovered I was missing them. It wasn't too important but it really made me mad. My mom had asked me to bring home a couple of boxes of macadamian nut cookies (which are not available where I am from). They had opened up my suitcase and taken the cookies out when we left our luggage there. I packed them on top of my clothing. They had the nerve to steal from my bag! For all those planning a trip here, be very aware of your possessions. If you unfortunately have booked here, you'll understand what I mean when I say they really lack hospitality.

First and formost...this is the worst and dumpiest hotel I have ever stayed in! Usually we stay in moderate priced hotels such as: Comfort Inns, Days Inns and Holiday Inns, so we are not the type of people who normally stay in the so called 'best' hotels so our standards for a hotel requirements are mainly for good value, clean rooms & bathrooms and good service for the right price. However, at the The Imperial Hawaii Resort...these standards were not meet at all. The Imperial Hawaii Resort is a timeshare...I want to caution people NOT to buy into this resort...if you want to even call it a resort. You can book suites here if you are not a member of the time share program---which I would not recommend. We stayed in the 3rd level of the suites in the 'PALM SUITE' with a price range of: $258-$271. This so called suite had one bedroom, which hardly had room enough to get around the bed from one side to the other. There was no dresser in the bedroom...the TV had to be mounted on the wall. The bathroom adjoining the bedroom was so small that only one person could be in there at a time. I could've washed my hands, used the toilet and washed my feet in the shower (no tub) at the same time if I wanted too--that is how small it was. The sink--had no counter area at all to it, therefore I had to place toiletries items on top of the toilet tank! There was only room for a glass near the sink which we placed our toothbrushes in. In the living room there was a pull-down double bed, and small. Also in the living room was a small dinning table that was virtually useless because when the bed was pulled down we had to shove the table up to the window just to make room for the bed. The coffee table had to be slide up to the couch to make room to walk around the bed when it was pulled down. The dinning chairs (no arm chairs at all!) had to be moved each night to the kitchen area to make room for the bed. Again, the TV had to be mounted on the wall due to limited space in the living room area. As for the so called 'full kitchen' this again was a joke for a suite at this price range. There was a very small microwave, dishwasher and only a mini refrigerator that bearly had room for a few items. There was a stove with an oven on top of it that looked like it dated back to the early 70's and didn't work well at all! A coffee maker was in the kitchen....but no coffee, sugar or creamer was provided. We had never stayed at a hotel, let alone a resort, with a coffee maker in our room and coffee was not provided. Even in a Comfort Inn...coffee, sugar, creamer are in the rooms that provide coffee makers...but not at this 'resort'!!! So bring your or plan on buying a small jar of instant coffee for $3.95 in the store and plan on drinking it black or you will have to buy sugar and creamer too. The second bathroom was not much better...the only difference with the size of it compared to the one connected to the bedroom was it did have a bathtub with shower. However, the sink-counter area was still no larger. As for cleaniless....we had to call housekeeping the minute we got into our suite because both bathrooms had mildrew on the tiles! Housekeeping did show up later that evening while we were at dinner and 'tried' to clean it...but there still remained mildew on many of the tiles throughout our stay. Mainly due to the fact that these bathrooms had not been cleaned properly in years and not renovated at all since the 70's when it was first built, therefore the mildew was so embedded in the grout of the tiles...it would not come out! The maid service here was only once in 7 days....therefore we only received clean towels once or we could personally go down to housekeeping and get more on our own! Remember...this is a 'resort' suite and with a price range of almost $300 a night and we had to get our own towels. Even when we called housekeeping and asked for more..they refused to bring them to us. The floors were only vacuumed once in 7 days. The linens on the beds were never changed in 7 days and the bed in the bedroom was only made up once. The pull-down bed was never made up or linens changed at all in 7 days! The bathrooms were only cleaned once in 7 days...other than the extra cleaning we got because of our complaint of the mildew on the tiles our first day, which the bathrooms should've been cleaned properly to begin with before we checked into the suite! As for location...it is a very good location for right downtown Waikiki shops and dinning. Only one block to many nice places, but there was construction all around the hotel, therefore making it loud with noise first thing in the morning till 5 PM at night. This, I understand, will not continue forever...but during our visit it was very disturbing. The walk to the beach was short...but the beach was the worst I have ever been to with major hotels right on it and located on Waikiki. The sand (if you call it that) going into the ocean was full of large rocks--not pebbles--but ROCKS! So large in fact that if I wasn't careful walking into the ocean...I could've turned my ankle. So needless to say, we did not swim at this beach...but ended up walking down quite a ways to a better beach. So much for a close beach area to our hotel---NOT! If you wanted to sit on the beach...that was limited too. The beach area was very small and was surrounded by a stone wall that went up to a walkway because of the massive erosion of the beach in this area. So sandy beach area was extremely limited. The pool area was not much better. There was no view of the ocean but out one window. There is a huge, tall brick wall all around the pool area due to the fact it is located on the roof of the building. I understand that this wall is necessary for safety sake, however with the safety glass or plastic that is available (and used) in many hotels with this same type of pool arrangement nowadays, I would think this hotel could've upgraded the pool-wall with this type of material instead of a brick wall with very small windows. I felt very closed in...even though I was totally outside and on top of a building! The only redeeming thing I can say about this hotel is on the top floor there is an 'owners lounge'--which only time share holders can use. Regular hotel guest are NOT allowed in this lounge. Our friends who we went with are time sharers. So we were able to use the lounge. The view of the ocean was wonderful from the lounge. Nice arm chairs...tables and couches were in it...also a pool table. We stayed here quite a bit because we felt like we had more room to move around in than in our suite...which is very sad in my opinion seeing the cost of the suite in which we stayed in! Even enjoying this lounge had it's downfalls...no personal privacy. Other time share members used it also (as they should) so we felt like we had to talk quietly as we would in any other public place. As I stated before, our friends are time share holders and traded their points to be able to go to Hawaii. They had no choice about where they could stay...therefore they had to stay at this hotel. Needless to say, they were shocked, disappointed and very embarrassed about this hotel, because they had invited us to come with them on vacation. They stated that this hotel was the worst they have ever stayed in in their 7+ years as time share holders. That is why I felt it necessary to warn others about this hotel. Even if you have no intentions in buying into the time share...please reconsider even staying here at all. It is a DUMP!!! I am not being hard with saying this...only truthful. I would've much rather been a few blocks further from the beach and had a much nicer suite or even a single room with 2 queen beds in it than have stayed here.

I even tried to change it at last minute, but was unable to. I am used to staying at 5 star hotels, but boy, was I pleasantly surprised. It was not at all what I expected. The front desk was very courteous; they even allowed us to check in early. The parking attendants were always very friendly. We had a one bedroom suite on the 12th floor. The room was clean...no mold in the showers; and even the murphy bed was comfortable. We did not have a full front ocean view but we were able to get a glimpse of it from the lanai. We were in a city high rise and most of the views were of the surrounding hotels. However, the sunset view from the 26th floor of the owner's lounge all but made up for it. The noise and construction was to be expected; and driving through it was no different than driving in Los Angeles, San Francisco or New York City. As for the noise, again, Waikiki is a city. If you've ever stayed in any other hotel in a busy city, noise is a given...even without the construction. We enjoyed our shopping sprees. The resort is conveniently located a few steps from the \"Rodeo Drive\" of Waikiki. However, no one goes to Hawaii to stay in the hotel. A short drive away from Waikiki on H1 will take you to the most beautiful beaches in the world. We found our own secluded beach spot and spent a day swimming and snorkeling...even saw a few sea turtles for free! Our last night was spent on Waikiki beach (which was 100 steps from the resort) watching the sunset and listening to the Hawaiian music being played at the Outrigger. It was such a wonderful vacation, we decided to purchase a timeshare week at the Imperial for 1/4th the price of other resorts in the area. It is an older hotel and not a 5-star world class resort; but once the dust from construction settles in 2007, the Imperial Resort will be in the middle of one of the hottest spots in Hawaii...a place that is definitely worth returning to every year.", "Date": "September 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cGood location, but lacked class\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3814793", "Content": "Exchanged a week and did not expect the Ritz.

Construction also going on around the hotel so some of the sidewalks closed. Biggest grumble was maid service only had one clean mid week and that was poor to say the least. Had to get fresh towels and as maid only came once also had to take old ones down. Lifts were slow and only three for 26 floors, pool was tiny.

Staff were ok but did not go that extra mile, did not seem happy in their jobs when compared to nearby hotels, even the few fish in the tank behind them looked fed up!

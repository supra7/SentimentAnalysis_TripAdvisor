The restaurant is very good and the staff there are very friendly; The Bagel bros does great Coffee and being near mission beach etc made getting around very easy. A swimming pool is heated and very nice. Now for the downside - the rooms. I have stayed in a wide variety of Hyatt / Omnis and Hiltons around the world so I am used to some ' intresting' situations when it comes to hotel but this has to go down as the worst experience with rooms I have had for a very long time. Received upgrade due to status - opened the curtains, looked out of the balcony to gaze upon the wonderful view of the garbage bins and AC system off the balcony. So requested the rooms which I had originally booked in the suites, walked through the doors and stepped back into the 80s. Opened the curtains to be face to face with a couple staring over the hedge into our room ( not the water / ocean view I was expecting). Sofa was broken and 1 of the queen beds was broken, generally dirty with a strange smell and humming noise ( I was now next to the garbage bins and the A/C unit). Moved again into the tower, higher floor but still lookiing over the garbage and the incesent noise of the a/c system rumbling most of the day and night. bath switch broke so trying to shower a 2 year old for 3 days was challenging. Reported the issue to reception who kept promising maintenance would repair but to no avail. Then no hot water unless we ran the shower for a full 10mins every morning. I could go on but I think you get the picture - to summarise: lovely hotel, great location, restaurant staff and consiege very helpful but rooms and noise need sorting. Main advice, beware of the suits unless you fancy a trip back to the 80s and bring cleaning items with you.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Biloxi, Mississippi", "Title": "\u201cStaff was great but property is not a four star\u201d", "Author": "busielady1", "ReviewID": "UR126758754", "Content": "We got a great rate of $95 through priceline and the location was very central to all the attractions we wanted to see. We were thrilled since this property frequently rents for over $200. However, we learned that there is an additional parking charge of $20 per night. I have paid additional parking fees in large cities downtown but I can't see how this property gets away with it since they are not downtown, and they have a huge parking lot for guests. This always seems a bit dishonest to me because people reserving rooms on the major internet sites think they are getting one price when in fact, the price is $20 higher per night. The right thing to do is just raise your room rates $20 and don't charge for parking. We were placed in a two story building with a small room that was very musty smelling. I could not take it. So I went to the front desk and spoke to Jeff who did change my room to the tower. The difference in the rooms from the two story to the tower is significant. We went from a small smelly room to a much larger room with a air purifier in the room and a balcony with a great view of the harbor. They did not have a room with two beds available so Jeff sent up a complimentary rollaway bed. Jeff is a great asset to this property and if it were not for him, I would have rated the hotel very low. He salvaged our stay. Both rooms had off white walls, white comforters, and were very bland and should be updated. However, two good things were the comfort of the bed and the great shower head that really delivered a powerful stream of hot water! I probably would not stay here again though.

We booked through Price Line so we got a fairly good price. Positives: the hotel is in a good location, not downtown, but not that far to drive to the sights around San Diego. A car is a must if you are staying here. We enjoyed Mission Beach which was close by and also enjoyed a couple of restaurants. The Mission was excellent for breakfast - ample portions of good food and prompt and friendly service. We also enjoyed Bella La Italia for dinner. Good food and very friendly service. There was also a Starbucks and a grocery store close by. Anyway, back to the review of the hotel.... Room was nice, but nothing outstanding. We were in the tower and had a nice view of the marina - which supposedly was an \"upgrade\". The room was large, bed only somewhat comfortable as the mattress pad/cover was lumpy and shifted easily. Weird bathroom. No bath tub, only a stand up shower! Additional costs were $20 a day for parking and $15 a day for high speed internet. We knew about these costs ahead of time, and since we had a good deal with Price Line it didn't really bother us. We did NOT use the hotel internet, we went to Starbuck's instead where it is free. It seems to me that the parking and internet fees should now adays be included in the nightly rate! The room and hallways were clean. The hotel concierge has discounted tickets for local attractions including the zoo. The room initially didn't have any facecloths and only minimal hangers. These were added upon request. The weather was very cool while we were in San Diego, so we didn't use the pool and only used the hot tub once. The pool has slides which the children seem to be enjoying.

If not for Samantha at the concierge desk I would have gone ballistic as she managed my extreme inconvenience well. Still, an important fax document sent by the front desk at 11pm so it could be received the next morning never got to its destination despite the front desk's assurances.

Ocean view, clean and quiet ... and supposedly a preferred room even though we booked the rooms exactly the same way and at the same rate.

Room check out is 11 a.m. so when arriving at 4 p.m. to check in, and then told that you have to wait an hour because the rooms were not available is very frustrating (turns out only one housekeeper on the floor which is why 6 hours later not all the rooms were ready). 2. NO communication as to why the rooms were not ready and I had to keep checking back with the desk, despite giving them my cell phone number to eventually get checked in. 3. Was promised when booking that two adjacent rooms on the ocean side in the Regency Club level would be secured. Upon arriving they had \"no record\" of this request, wanted to give me two rooms that were not adjacent (which I refused since I have kids) and I had to eventually take the two rooms they did have available on the non-view side. 4. Rental car was damaged by their so called Valet car parkers, which is ACE by the way, who of course refuse to accept any liability for their damage and now I will need to fight with Hertz and Allstate. The manager from Ace investigating the claim was nice enough, but it was clear from the outset that they had no intention of doing the right thing and accepting responsibility for their negligence.

Four sleepless nights... We stayed in 'The Suites' building that runs along the length of the marina and there were sea lions barking all night long every night that we were there. We tried to get a fan from the front desk to help drown out the noise but apparently fans are a hot commodity and there were none available. The bed was lumpy and very soft. The hotel doesn't use fitted sheets, so if you move around too much, the sheets start to shift and cause rolls of lumps that are not very comfortable to sleep on. The pillows leave something to be desired as well.... They smoosh down as soon as you lay on them and provide zero support. Another thing was this stench near the bed. It smelled of urine. I couldn't quite pin down where the smell was coming from, but it seemed to be coming from the carpet and/or the bastketweave fabric-like headboard. We actually went to Target to purchase Febreeze to help cover the stench. As far as the room itself, it is decent. It's a good size but with mildly ugly decor and a nice patio overlooking the marina. The fridge is a pile of crap. There is a warning sign on the fridge that says \"Refridgerator can not safely store medical or dairy products\", so if you're a milk drinker or need to store your insulin, you're out of luck. The fridge is very small, not even large enough to store a couple beers and a leftovers container. I did not try any of the restaurants on site so I can not comment on that. The pool area is nice and the bar by the pool serves a decent cocktail. I'll finish with something positive.... The hotel staff are friendly and courteous and the cleaning crew does a good job of remaking the bed and filling the towels and such. The hotel is in a good area with very easy access to highways and to downtown. The view of the marina truly is beautiful and is very nice to look out upon in the morning.

The recent renovation has been an improvement as the grounds are just beautiful. This property takes such great care to maintain the beauty of the landscaping.

They have 1 jacuzzi and 3 pools all clean and well kept.....the poolside drinks are really good too! try a mojito made by Jeff...he is the best! We love the tower rooms as the view is incomparable to any other, however I was a little surprised of the condition of a few minor things. Our bathroom sink had a huge crack in it and seemed to leak thru a bit, how does one crack a sink that new and heavy. We stayed on the 17th floor and the room was large and clean. Nice light ocean colors along with a great sitting area makes it a very pleasant atmosphere. Our room was facing the ocean and what a spectacular view! We also had access to the regency Club, which had been renovated since we had last visited. It looked clean, comfortable and well thought out except I was unimpressed with the selection of evening bites and choices as there used to be many more options now it's just vege's, cheese, crackers and 1 dessert selection. They still have an honor bar which is nice and offer nice beverage selections. In my opinion, for the extra money to have access to this level, they could offer some hot items or even maybe a light protein or pasta? The morning fare was nice and offered cold items along with pastries, cereal, bagels, fruit, juices and yogurt. I was really disappointed with room service. This is one area I think this location suffers badly. There are 2 options of on-site restaurants and no in-between except for an Einstein bagel shop. It could be hit and miss , but with a Hyatt brand I think the food at this site could use a big improvement and must be looked at seriously by the hotel especially for the price. There is a really good casual fish market right down the boardwalk that rocks! and the fish is all locally caught...a must! I didn't try the buffet breakfast at Red Marlin, although I heard people saying it was very over-priced and not worth it. I would also suggest going to the Hyatt Manchester at Seaport village where they have a seafood restaurant called Sally's, it is right on the marina and the sushi is incredible!

FLASH FLASH FLASH I'll also add the fact that the hotel is adjacent to a bridge leading to the beach so traffic noise was common if you like your balcony door open as we do. Flight noise is relentless daily but that may be common to San Diego. We paid for a view of the bay, which was excellent. I travel for business from time to time and the room itself was below average for the price. The grounds and lobby were pretty though. Parking? $20 a day adds up.

The jacuzzi was large enough for about 15 people, and was positioned with views of the pool and tower. Very Nice. The best was the customer service given by Manager Michael, the night manager. Unfortunately, we had a someone in the room next to us with a crying baby. We are not ones to complain about much, but finally we call down to the front desk. Understanding Michael or the Hyatt could not do anything about the crying baby, Michael let my wife vent and offered a few freebees. We asked for Michael to add comments to our account should we want to take advantage of the offers. Later in the morning we did take advantage of the offers and had to speak with the day manager, Robert. He was equally as nice and could see what Michael had written on the account. I can say that Michael and Robert went far beyond the original offer for compensation, and we were well cared for. Front staff Ruth finished the checking out process, and was continued the great service. Even if the mishap hadn't occurred, my wife and I would still recommend this hotel. Its just good to know the staff and customer service etiquette would be there should you need it. Thank Hyatt and the staff for a great stay.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonds, Washington", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing vacation, excellent property and service\u201d", "Author": "tillie28", "ReviewID": "UR122362873", "Content": "This is our second time staying at this hotel the week after Christmas, each time has exceeded our expectations.

It is very big though, with a large lounge, large bedroom looking over the marina and separate bathroom. All was very comfortable. The rooms come off an outdoors walkway which some may have a problem with, I did not mind at all. There was also a small individual balcony. All facilities where good. Breakfast was ala carte due to off season but was first rate. Pools etc look good but I did not try them. Marina is a very nice environment. I had a car and found the location very good as it was easy to get in and out of and a chance to warm up prior to hitting the mad freeways. 10 minutes to the zoo, same to the airport. Best was the service. After some bad experiences with a lack of flexibility and customer focus at other hotel chains, I was very pleasantly surprised when I had to change some arrangaments here. I was given assistance that saved me a lot of money, at a loss in revenue to the hotel. A big change to quoting policy we are used to from most. I am now committed to returning the favour and will be loyal to Hyatt as much as possible as a result. Price was very good, may have been off season special though. Overall, keep in mind this is a regular Hyatt experience, with pristine rooms and ulta chic furnishings.

It has an \"open-air\" feel about it, especially in the reception area; and it certainly feels like a resort. The hotel is a series of smaller buildings surrounding a main \"tower\". The interconnecting grounds are absolutely beautiful. However, during the place in time I was a guest, it was unusually cold in San Diego, and I did not like having to go outside to go the restuarant, or lobby, etc. The hotel is in a marina setting, with beautiful views of Mission Bay. The rooms seem to be fairly recently upgraded (I believe this is an extremely old hotel, although faily well maintained). My room was nice enough--very attractive with a small balcony. Bathroom was very tight, but, serviceable. Regardless of what temperature I set the thermostat, the room never rose above 72. This may be fine and enjoyable for some, but, I was always cold, and in the 4 days I was there, I grew to resent this, and thus cannot say I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Since I travel quite a bit, I have come to appreciate buffets in the restaurant--so that I can fix my plate the way I want it. But, there was no buffet at this hotel, although the breakfast they served was totally acceptable. This hotel is in a fairly secluded area of San Diego. I think some people would really appreciate this. I do not. If I want to be secluded, I stay home in my bedroom. I first learned that I do not seclusion when I stayed at the Hyatt Miramar Resort in Puerto Rico. It didn't take long before I started feeling trapped and imprisoned!!! I am a vacation / traveller who likes city lights, and activity around me. The Mission Bay is not really my cup of tea, although it may be for others. There beautiful pools and cabannas; and palm trees--just not what I need in a home away from home. I would recommend this hotel for folks who enjoy getting away and being secluded. It seems to be a good option for this type of traveller, and especially if you still want to be within striking range of a major city and all it has to offer.

Fortunately, we found the hotel with minimal difficulty with help of our Garmin. Check in was effortless, which was a pleasant surprise given that I had two reservations - one for a seminar I was attending and a second for an extra day after the seminar concluded. No problem, and no need to change rooms (which has happened at some hotels in the past). Despite the hour a bellman was standing by and took us immediately to our room. I expected a \"room\", given that I was attending a seminar at a group rate. Instead we had a king corner suite. Clean and nicely appointed with a large work area. The bellman took time to explain the lay out of the property and to show me on the hotel map the room in which my seminar was located. We had rented a car for the first portion of our trip and intended to return it the morning after we arrived. After studying the maps to find some of the places we wanted to go to in the evenings after the seminar, we realized that to get there we would have to take cabs. So after a call to the car rental company, we decided that it was less expensive and more convenient to keep the car because of the relative isolated location of the Hyatt at Mission Bay. The stay was uneventful. I was impressed that staff members often inquired if they could do anything to assist us. Housekeeping did a nice job and responded to several special requests, including one for a hair dryer, which apparently should have been in the room but was not. Because I don't do well with the lack of protein at the continental breakfasts offered at seminars, I ordered room service on several mornings. Delivery was right on time, and the food well prepared. The Concierge Desk was very helpful with suggestions and directions and printed out our airline boarding passes. Our biggest disappointment was the weather, which of course was beyond the Hyatt's control. I enjoy swimming and, after checking out the hotel's web site, was looking forward to swimming in its three beautiful pools. The temperature never got above 70 degrees, so I never went in the water. A fee was charged for internet service. Since I was on business and had to remote to my office during the day and in the evening, this was a minor annoyance. Since this is a resort and not a business hotel perhaps the fee is understandable. But free internet is always appreciated. Our visit was after the summer season at Sea World, so I assume that the hotel was quieter and less busy than in the summer months.

On arrival at the room, we found it to be dirty with wet cleaning cloth's on the floor and table, the bedding had holes in it, some of the towels had obviously been used and then put back on the towel holder. The enamel surface on the bath was missing in large areas so leaving a chipped surface so making it unsuitable for having a bath and the blinds on one of the windows was held on with White tape.

This place was perfect for a family getaway with our twin 2.5 year olds. We booked a room in the main tower (they are not clear on the website - I believe they are the rooms that are listed as Deluxe Queen Ocean View) and my kids loved it! You can see the ocean, the marina with boats, AND the fireworks from Sea World every night at 9:50pm. Request a high floor. The grounds are perfect if you are with little kids. There are little nooks where you can hang out and read and the kids can run around safely. The pool is also perfect for kids; especially the water slide. The big fire pit was fantastic at nights and my boys loved making their first Smores! Red Marlin is great - amazing food, decor, service, and they know how to treat families with young children. The $5 per adult boat ride to Sea World is a MUST (The hotel has its own boat that takes you there). First of all, that alone is an experience for the kids. Secondly, you get a VIP back door entrance and avoid the crowds. Note that you have to have pre-purchased Sea World tickets though to get in through that entrance. Last, the \"captains\" were fantastic and would stop or slow down so the kids could sea the seals, pelicans, etc. Oh, and with a AAA discount we saved over $30 a night! Another note: We drove 10 minutes to Downtown San Diego and spent one evening there, eating and walking and we also caught the Sea World fireworks from there. Came back to the hotel, made Smores, and hit the sack. Look, this is not a 5 star hotel, but it gets 5 stars in my review because it was everything that we wanted and needed for a family vacation.

We went for a suite, not in the tower. We had a great view of the Marina, it was quiet, and each room had a door with the bathroom in the middle. Meaning, you can go to the bathroom with out disturbing the kids in the other room. It had a small fridge and a television in each room. The pool was bit on the cool side, despite being heated, but the kids did not mind. there is a small waterslide for the little guys, and two big ones for those over 42\". Poolside service made this a great vacation. Gotta love a place that will serve you a pina coloda while your child is entertaining himself on the water slide. One downside, didn't really seem to be enough life guards, so don't get too sloshed. The breakfast buffet was included in the price of our room, and included a wide variety of hot foods, cold cereals, good fruit (not just honeydew). It would normally cost $20 per adult, which I would have considered a rip off. If the buffet is not included in your room the Einstein coffee/bagel shop was the place to be.

Pool- water slides were great- there is a tiny one for all ages but the two larger ones were 42 inches and they are strict on it. My 3 year old was disappointed he couldn't get on there. Older kids seemed to be having a blast and there was one organized race/activity for them during the day. However, the pool was freezing in the middle of August. It really needs a heater. Unless your child is a bit older and will stay in no matter how cold it is - we spent more time in a very crowded hot tub. The staff said it was like this all of the time- and this was pretty calm.

Annoyingly, some people would leave an item on a chair but be gone for 3/4 of the day to reserve for later.

We get to our room, which was located in the older part of the hotel near the swimming pools and sure enough, the smell... it was pretty strong. Our room faced the pool and had single paned windows so it was super noisy, it was very dark, kind of old looking and the ceilings were really low.

She was awesome.... she checked us in to a new room in the main tower (which I highly recommend) and the difference in rooms was huge.

It seems that only the main tower of the hotel has gone under renovations, but the two Bay buildings have not...

Next is the pool... it's a very nice area with 2 big water slides in one pool, and 1 small one in a smaller pool... then there was a big pool with no slides. The pool area had lot's of kids so we didn't feel as if we were out of place with our own. There are waitresses that come around to serve drinks and food, which is great--just charge it to the room or pay right there. Restaurants on the property were the Red Marlin and Einstein Bros. Bagels... both were pretty good, but the price of it makes it hard to enjoy. Our first meal there was breakfast... my husband ordered the buffet and shared with our daughter, my son had poached eggs and bacon, I ordered an omelet...it was $47... Einstein Bros was good but equally pricey. We caught the water taxi from right there to head to Sea World... $5 per person. Our last night there we had dinner at the Red Marlin...it was very good. They brought out the kids' food first so they weren't waiting around. We enjoyed some drinks, I spilled mine half way through and broke the glass-they brought me another at no charge. After dinner we bought a little smores kit ($15) which is so great that they offer that, and went out to the grassy little courtyard where there was a fire burning, and toasted our smores. The kids loved it.... All in all, I would say this is a great hotel to visit with your children... they are welcome all over the hotel..... It's not the fanciest but the kids were happy and they are the whole reason that we planned this vacation. Although I'm only giving 4 stars because of the above mentioned concerns, I give the customer service and staff 5!", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northridge, CA", "Title": "\u201cUnless you have small children run for the hills!\u201d", "Author": "Denise E", "ReviewID": "UR116783752", "Content": "My husband I arrived with our 13 year old daughter on a Friday.

And we were not alone; there was a never ending line of people getting new keys. Next - the pool. The pool are is not very big. There is a huge garden area with seating areas that nobody uses but there are a LOT of people jammed into the pool. If you have small children under 4 this is probably acceptable, but there were way too many people. Running, yelling, jumping in the water. Twice there was an \"accident\" in the kids' pool area, so it needed to be closed and cleaned. Last, the beds. We were really surprised at the lack of quality. Backache is an understatement.

After a terrible night at the Harborview Inn and Suites no thanks to hotels.com for a last minute booking. We finally arrived at the Hyatt Regency Mission Bay. As I walked into the lobby to check in I was greeted with a, \"Welcome to the Hyatt Mrs. Rosales\". What a breath of fresh air! We were checked in quickly, answered every question, and given every detail about our stay. The gentleman working the front desk apologize for our horrible experience with hotels.com and the Harborview Inn and Suites. He agreed that it sounded awful and assured us that the Hyatt would make sure that our stay was comfortable and relaxing. We got the room key and hurried up to the waterfront suite. We walked into the room and my jaw just dropped. BEAUTIFUL, comfortable, contemporary, large, and with a gorgeous view of Mission Bay's marina. I LOVED it! I immediately collapsed onto the bed, it was soft and smelled so clean! The kids were so happy! They loved the sound of the seals barking and the seagulls in the distance. After relaxing in our room for a bit, we all got dressed and headed to the pool with WATER SLIDES! My 6 year old was in pure heaven! So was my 3 year old because they had one the perfect size for her. They both went down those water slides a ton of times while my husband and I drank a margarita and gave a toast to beginning of our wonderful vacation! It was fabulous! One thing I can say is that this hotel is for families. It would be hard to avoid the scene of extremely happily playing children. If you have no children and want a relaxing adult vacation by the poolside, I would not recommend this hotel.

The location of the Hyatt was great in regards to Sea World - and the hotel provided a water taxi to the park for a minimal fee of $7 each. Also, the view from the room was amazing. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable but overall we would not stay here again. There simply wasn't much to do in the area (aside from Sea World and Mission Beach a few blocks away) and we felt isolated from the rest of the city. If you're going for isolation, then this is the place for you. The pools looked like they were nice and the slides looked fun - but it was frankly so windy in the area we never went in. Also, the hotel, while overall beautiful and nice, it was extremely \"cold\" and uninviting. We paid for the upgrade to a free breakfast (sounds funny, no?) and literally walked out of the breakfast area due to the snobbiness of it all. My husband and I are \"upper class\" so it wasn't as if we were out of place - it was just frankly too exclusive and cold and not something we wanted to be a part of. Instead we went to the Einstein Bagel shop and had an enjoyable and relaxed breakfast on a pier and had a great time. Another con was the parking situation. We realize most if not all hotels have a required valet in the area, but the valet was $25 and the self-park was $20. Seemed ridiculous when we should have been able to park in the HUGE lot for free. This hotel really seems to nickel and dime you. Again, overall it was a decent hotel - but we wouldn't return to it and really really wished we didn't leave the Embassy Suites downtown hotel which was better in every way. PS - One comment about Mission Beach was the incredible amount of seaweed washing up. Coming from NJ, we've never seen anything like this and it was amazing and fairly gross. Perhaps more can be done to keep the beach clean?

What I didn't love about our stay... our room was the stinkiest (mold/must/mildew) room I have probably ever stayed in. It was so damp in there you could not walk barefoot on the carpet because your feet get wet. No working fan in the bathroom. If you hung your swimsuit in the shower, it was still dripping wet 24 hours later. There was no free internet and no complimentary breakfast. I have been to cheaper hotels that were no anywhere near as nice as this one appears that have offered you these complimentary things. There was one channel my kids could watch on TV. The location of the hotel is not the best if you don't have a car. You are then forced to eat in the area with limited (expensive) choices. My daughter's allergies were worse staying here, I would assume due to the mildew. The balcony was dirty (furniture/ground). I had zero desire to be in my room other than to sleep due to the smell in there. It was also SO loud. We were in a balcony suite and our view was of the backside of the gym. They offered to move us the next day if we wanted, but I felt it was hassle with 3 kids. The first night I could hear every person walk by on the sidewalk behind our room and I had to hang a blanket on the window because the sidewalk light shined right at my eyes in the bed. This hotel is pretty and does have a nice placement on the bay. And, like I said above, the pool area is awesome. I don't know how the tower rooms are, but would not recommend a balcony suite on the bay unless damp must is your style.

The property itself was fine and located close to Sea World and Mission Beach area. Our adjoining rooms were located in the lobby building, not the tower. The kids enjoyed the heated pool and water slides. Our check-in experience was terrible. We arrived at 2:30pm and were informed that our rooms were not ready which was understandable since check-in is actually 4:00pm. We were issued a temporary pool key so that we could \"enjoy the property\" while waiting - even though our luggage had been taken away so we had no access to bathing suits or a place to change into them, leaving the bar or restaurant as our only real options for kililng time onsite. Long story short, we were only able to access one of the rooms by 5:30pm - after a 3 hour wait during which staff could not provide any estimate of when the rooms may be ready. After complaining to the manager we were finally offered a $75 credit to spend at the property and 3 entree vouchers for the SWIM pool bar (when I pointed out that $75 would not go far with our party of 6 after seeing the menu prices). We did use the entree vouchers later in the week and the 3 beers, 3 Shirley Temples, a kids meal and dozen hot wings that we were billed for used $47 of that credit. We used the concierge service to arrange tickets for the Old Town Trolley Tour which also provides shuttle service to the hotel, for a van taxi to Sea World, and to arrange a rental car on our last day and they were helpful. Otherwise, we made our own arrangements as much as possible. Side note: our van taxi driver Fran (US Cab) was fantastic. We called him direct for transportation the remainder of the week and it felt like we had our own personal driver. He happily stopped by a store so that we could pick up a few items on the way back from Sea World and also took us by the hotel and waited for our son to change out of wet clothes when going from Sea World to dinner another day.

The cost is what I would expect for a nice hotel. We stayed in the Marina facing suites which were comfy and well proportioned.

When we requested a move to the Towers, where my partner had stayed before, the staff took more than an hour to get back to us about our request. When they finally worked out a transfer (after haggling over maintaining our original rate), the tower room was lovely - much better appointed and with a superior view - definitely request a room in the tower, should you choose to stay here. Unfortunately, our adjoining room was inhabited by smokers. Though there are balconies in these rooms, our neighbors smoked in the room - the staff did what they could to address the problem, but ultimately it wasn't in their power to make their guests stop smoking. As far as we were concerned, however, it made for an unfortunate stay. The smoke was bad because our rooms shared a door, and so was the noise. The fitness facilities were great - replete with a lovely view of the marina. The pool was nice, too. Not much in the way of eating or nightlife here - if you don't have a rental car, you'll need taxis. We ended up moving downtown on our last night in San Diego, and I'm so glad we did.

The pools were heated, not too full of people, and open until 11pm. There were 3 water slides running nearer the weekend.

The hotel staff proved friendly and very informative about their city and sights to see. The front desk staff, the consierge, and Regency Club 'cafe' staff were all so helpful, easy to approach, and were willing to assist regardless of the time of day. It's worth it to pay a little extra each day (I think maybe $10) and get the Regency Club service.

We used the concierge shuttle once and were extremely pleased with the vehicle - clean, easy to seat 4+, driver was super nice. The concierge was also helpful for their recommendation of a place for dinner. This hotel is older but ownership has attempted to refresh the property. The lobby definately looks great but the rooms didn't quite get the same attention. The rooms are good but not great. The bathrooms are unnecessarily small as there was room to expand them during renovations. The shower head was installed for a very short person as the head is placed about 5 ft high. The pillows are not king sized - not a huge deal but are comfortable. Tv is smaller than other Hyatt's I stay at. there is a fridge in the room which is nice touch. The pools are decent and have water slides the kids like a lot. This hyatt gives the impression that they are kid friendly but sends mixed signals - ie. the kids are forbidden ( and the staff will remind you - way too strict and for no good reason in my opinion. Maybe after 8pm but not 5pm) from the regency club starting at 5 pm and they advertise s'mores being available via TV and signs but when we inquired we were told it was $8 per 'kit' that you use on your own. Really?!? At other properties such as: lost pines & hill country this experience is included as a part of the overall experience and is managed on by the staff. It is a great experience and is cheap to host. The regency club is just 'ok'. There is not an automatic coffee machine as there is in every other RC Club I visit and we ran out of coffee this morning. The food selection is average to below average compared to other hyatts. Another patron shared my views about regency club in a conversation we had this morning while waiting for the coffee to be replenished. The spa is nothing special and not on par with other hyatt spa's. We did not use it this trip but I did on a previous stay and thought it was worth mentioning here. Overall, I think this hyatt is just 'ok' and I really don't see coming back with my family or on business again because there are some other great Hyatt's nearby.

I was down in San Diego for a girls weekend with my mom, it was her Christmas present. I was impressed with the lobby and couldn't wait to get to our room. I was somewhat disappointed by our room. It smelled a little musty and the bathroom wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clean and some of the lights weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working in the bathroom.

I went down to the lobby and mentioned it and they said they would send us a repair man shortly. We went out for the rest of the day and came back late that evening. When you stay at this hotel you have to choose between valet ($25) or self-serve parking ($20). We decided to do self-serve as we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind walking, however what they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you is that there are not enough self-serve spaces for everyone staying at the hotel. After looking for 20 minutes one evening, we finally had to park in the street super far from the hotel. Since it was very late and we were two women, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel that safe. We were still charged $20 for parking that night even though I told the lobby attendant there was no parking in the lot and we did not end up parking there. That is ridiculous! When we got back to the room we noticed the A/C unit was still not fixed. I again went to the lobby (annoyed) and told this person that our A/C unit was down and it was supposedly already fixed. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer to change our room or anything. He ordered another maintenance person to fix the unit at almost 1am. We were so annoyed. The repair man fixed the unit fairly quickly and we went to bed. However, after the parking issue, bathroom dirtiness, and A/C unit issue I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to leave. The bathroom when we arrived had several little hairs still in the tub and the sink was that well cleaned. Also, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t inform you that the pillows and duvets are down. My mom is severely allergic to down and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop sneezing. Nowhere in the documentation in the room does it say what the duvets or pillows are filled with. We finally had to pull them out to figure out they were filled with down. They should have a card stating what it is. Another issue we had was with the noise in the hallway. We could hear everything that was going on, including a running child up and down the hallway at 7am as well as the cleaning carts at 8am.

The timing and taste was perfect; from the champagne toast, passed h'ordourves, and the best large-group meal I've had since our wedding in MN! There were countless compliments that night and in the days to come regarding how delicious the food was. Your staff and chefs pulled off a delicious event for 25 folks brilliantly! Having been to quite a few large goup meals in the past, this one by far exceeded expectations. The salmon I had was moist and full of flavor, the steak my husband had melted in his mouth. Well done- even with the distance traveled from the kitchen to the penthouse, everything was still warm and fresh from the grill. I can't say enough good things about that night. Thank you again for all your help and energy in pulling off a very successful surprise party! Happy New Year! P.S. watching the Christmas boat parade from the penthouse was a wonderful treat, didn't even miss the fireworks. The room was very relaxing, the views unbelievable, well worth the splurge for one night!!

This makes it great for 'getting away from it all' but not the most ideal for tourists without a car. However, if you are like me and don't mind being adventurous, the #8 bus stops right outside the hotel and goes north to Pacific Beach, and south to Old Town.

And when we gave her the confirmation number she said we were only booked for 1 night. I had explained to her that we were booked for 2 nights originally through SW and added an extra night. She made calls and could not find anything but had said we were ok for 3 nights. She did not let us know anything about the Hotel or what the Hotel had to offer and did not even offer us what had come with the 3rd night stay ( a movie and 25% off meal in their restaurant and free parking). She has no buisness in the hospitality buisness because she lacked hospitable skills. Then we get to our room. Where do I start?

We didn't rent a car and just used taxis which are plentiful outside the front desk. I believe the hotel charges $25 a night to park. It was $6 to Seaworld and $25 to the zoo.

We liked the convenience of the proximity to Sea World (water taxi is awesome) and SD Zoo. However, our enjoyment of this hotel stops there for the most part. I must admit the staff was super friendly and the food was really really good, but the hotel is in major need of an upgrade. It's very drab and very dated. We stayed in a one bedroom suite that had furniture & decor from 20+ years ago. Not dirty but not clean. In fact throughout most of our stay the housekeeper did not clear away dirty glasses, cups, etc. The bathroom never was quite cleaned properly either. Towels are rough. Showers are horrible. Overall just poor quality in a room. If I didn't get the room at a decent discount I would have felt very ripped off. HUGE line at check in, which took way too long. The hotel is loud b/c it's very family oriented so be prepared for banging doors and screaming children running around. But the Red Marlin restaurant gets kodos for being super kid friendly and very accommodating. The spa was just so-so. Had a hot stone massage which was nothing more than a poorly trained massage therapist that put warm stones on my body and lightly rubbed them in circles. I could have done that myself.

Also, the website stated that a $65-million dollar renovation had been completed. Above all else, i value new, clean hotel rooms, which is what I expected to find at this Hyatt Regency. Check-in was a lengthy process, even though they were not that busy. The desk clerk was friendly, just slow. The bell hops and valet guys were very nice. They gave us great info on things like where to eat, and what time the fireworks display was every night. (You can see Sea World's fireworks show from the property.) Our room was in one of the two \"Bays\", which are two-story buildings with several rooms in them. Our second floor room was small and cramped. There was little room to move around with the two queen beds, dresser, nightstand, desk and bench. The bathroom was a bit better. It was standard, except the long countertop, which was nice. Although the rooms were \"newly designed\" and furnished, they were not as clean as I expected. The carpet felt sticky, there were dust bunnies in the corners, and the bath tub was stained and dirty looking. Not quite the standard I expect from Hyatt Regency. Unfortunately, one of our kids got sick and we needed clean sheets for one of the beds. I called and requested a full set with blankets and pillowcases, and was told they would be sent to us. It took about 40 minutes for the stuff to be delivered, and when it arrived, it was 3 sheets, no blanket, no pillowcases. So I had to wait again for the pillowcases and blanket. Finally, the pillowcases arrived, but we never did get a blanket. The other disappointment was the lack of a balcony off of our room. The grounds of this resort are beautiful. Generous landscaping lends it a lush, tropical feel. The pools were nice, and had small slides that my kids enjoyed. One of the pools also had a zero-entry which is great for my one-year old to splash and play in. We also enjoyed the cabanas with sofas that were available. It was nice to sit in them at night, relax and enjoy the fire. There is a restaurant on site. My husband ate lunch there and said it was just okay. Overall, this resort hotel was okay. The grounds were very nice, but the rooms were lacking. I expect cleaner, larger rooms for the amount of money we spent. In addition, I think it is ridiculous for a hotel to charge $9.95 for 24 hours of hi-speed internet service. Thankfully, we travel with mi-fi and don't need it. Also, we needed to print something while we were there. So, we went to the business center, and incurred a $5 charge to use the PC and print a one page form. Another ridiculous charge!

The hotels location is great, if you use the pool or go to mission beach. We are accustomed to eating out and were in downtown everynight. If you are renting a car get a small one because they striped their lots so there is only about six inches between cars. The hotel seems to nickel and dime you to death, charges for internet, self park. When we were at the pool some 3 year old did business in the pool and they had to close the slide for a few hours, only to have the same kid do it again in another pool, so 2 of the three pools were closed. When we were at the pool trying to relax they started playing bingo, they were selling $5.00 cards where you had a chance to win a $75.00 hotel gift certificate. The least they could do after closing the pools was give out the cards. Not only was this cheesy, it was so load and disruptive I wanted to scream. The nickel and dime stuff needs to stop, face paintings for the kids, smore's kits for the fire pit, I felt like I was at the grocery store with my kids.

I read every review on here, deciding to ignore the negatives, and just book, and I am so glad I did! Such a relaxing stay! It was perfect for our family vacation for our 3 and 6 year old boys, and I would also stay here if we were traveling without the kids. The grounds are beautiful, the staff is amazing, the rooms clean and relaxing, the food delicious, and the location perfect. We agonized over whether to stay in La Jolla, Coronado Island, or the Mission Bay area, and feel we made a great choice. The water ferry back and forth from Sea World was fun and convenient. We could go to the park for an hour, or the whole day, through an easy back gate into the park. (makes you feel like part of the staff ) We loved watching the boats in the bay, and the sea lions frolicking in the water, and on the docks, from our 15th floor balcony. We've been home for days and still miss the sound of their barking. We also had the perfect view of the nightly Sea World fireworks. The weather was pretty cool (mid 60's) that week, but coming from 100 degree Dallas, TX heat, we didn't mind so much, and it didn't stop our boys from having a BLAST on the water slides. We only wish the slides opened earlier, since my husband and the boys would have loved to do that while mom primped and got ready for the day, before breakfast. Speaking of breakfast, one of our favorite parts of every day was the delicious, relaxing breakfast buffet. Located in the Red Marlin restaurant, sitting over the water in the marina, with beautiful views from every table, it was the perfect start to every day of theme parks, and sight seeing. The staff were infectiously friendly and attentive, and the food was really delicious. Lots of healthy choices, along with yummy pastries and treats, since it is vacation after all. We highly recommend making this part of your stay package...very worth it. We filled up so well, that it allowed us keep our lunches light. The restaurant at the pool, Swim, was also delicious. Definitely take advantage of that. The boys loved sitting by the beautiful aquarium, and the fish tacos are delish. So are the veggie sandwich, and quesadillas. Also, the smores kit you can purchase through the concierge to use at the firepits at night is a must. So fun. I have to end with this example of how wonderful the staff at this hotel is. On our last full day at the hotel, our three year old woke up with a stomach virus. He was extremely ill. We called the front desk mid morning, to request some new linens. A security guard and maid came to our room, to dispose of and change all the linens. They were so sweet to our little boy, and I was impressed with the thoroughness in which they cleaned the room. Very reassuring. We left for a walk that evening when he was feeling better, and returned to our room to find a basket FULL of goodies, and several bottled waters and sodas, and a sweet hand-written card from Keith, the security guard, addressing our son by name, telling him he hoped he felt better, with a gift certificate to purchase a movie through the hotel. It was so thoughtful, and special. I realize I sound like Suzy Sunshine, but I truly can't think of any negatives about this hotel, aside from the price of parking and the hours the slides are open.

I heard from others we met there that the rooms that have an \"odor\" as listed in previous postings are in the Bay I and Bay II buildings. The Tower building was fine. We ate dinner one night at the Red Marlin restaurant.The meal was pricey but the food and service were excellent. The Sea World water taxi was great. It cost $5.00 per person R/T and was great to avoid waiting in line at the gates and the parking lot. The pools were nice however I was disappointed that all of the waterslides close at 6:00pm. It was way to early in my opinion. The weather was unseasonably chilly while we were there ( low 60's) so the pool temp. could have been turned up a bit. We spent more time in the hot tub than the pool. My only negatives for the hotel are signing out pool towels with a 25.00 per towel deposit. For a hotel of this caliber, we shouldn't need to sign out towels. If ther has been a problem with missing towels, then provide more staff to monitor. Don't make it into a YMCA towel system. This was an issue because my kids went down to the pool first while I got changed and couldn't receive a towel until I came down with the pool cards for our room. Also, Einstein Bagels stops serving at 12:00 noon which really limited your food choices to the expensive pool bar or the expensive Red Marlin restaurant. Also, it is advertised that the beach is within walking distance. It is not! You need to drive to MIssion Beach. I'm a walker , but it is too far to go when you are carrying things with your family.

It was 65 and cloudy but that's not to blame on the hotel, I will still rate them accurately. We found the hotel to be very good for what we needed. Here are some things I wish I knew LOCATION: if you're looking to see the San Diego area it is a great location to do so. You will have to drive everywhere but that is expected. Most sites (Coronado, Gas Lamp, La Jolla) were within a 15-20 minute drive. The hotel is situated on a Marina and you can walk around and view the boats/etc. PARKING: expensive for what seemed to be plenty of parking availability. It was $20/day to self-park, $25 to valet. I would recommend the self-parking as none of the parking lots were too far away to walk yourself. BEACHES: It is situated on a Marina so you cannot swin in the ocean there but Pacific Beach is the closet beach (10 minute drive). I would recommend a longer drive to Coronado Beach- much nicer. POOL: Due to the aforementioned weather we did not get to take advantage of the pool. It looked great for kids, not so great for a young couple looking to enjoy a romantic swim. There are 3 waterslides but as this hotel is situated next to Sea World it is infested with kids TOWELS: upon check-in you can ask for towel cards (as many as you like) that you will be responsible for returning when checking out. Basically if you lose the card or the towel you pay $25. The towels are better than the typical pool towel but not worth 25 bucks. ROOMS: There are two different rooms types to pay attention to when booking. The Bay rooms are small one story rooms that basically have a bed and bathroom, not much room for anything else. They have decks but no view of the ocean. With the hotel being situated on Mission Bay I would recommend upgrading to an ocean view in the tower (2nd room type). These rooms are spacious and have a breathtaking view of the Marina or Ocean. We chose the ocean and were on the 10th floor which enabled us to see for miles. It's worth it. We also stayed in a corner Junior Suite which was incredibly nice but probably bigger than what we needed. FOOD: We only ate at the \"Swim Lounge\" which is fine for chips and dip or a sandwhich but not much else. It is also a lot smaller than the pictures lead you to believe.

I am a Hyatt Goldpass Member - I travel a lot for business and stay at Hyatt's First and Marriots second. I prefer Hyatt -- the quality and cost have always matched and surprised me -- NOT THIS TIME... I would call this an ala carte Hyatt. 1) Parking $20 self parking - $25 - Valet 2) Internet - 9.95 a day 3) Need to print something -- Business Center $6.95 for 15 min. 4) Pool Towel - $20 dollar per pool card returned at the end of the trip when you turn in your pool card The rooms are outdated -- the need a new renovations project team. The first room we were \"upgraded to\" what on the 3rd floor facing the pool and right next to the noisiest ice machine ever made. The airconditioning didn't work and neither did the lights in the \"living/office\" area. The morning we awoke to the seagulls morning feeding ritual because the were nesting on the roof of the Pool Lounge. We complained and I also told them as a gold passport member I always get the uppper floors and pay for it so using my \"points\" gets me a lower quality room. I got to the 15th floor... but wait my profile also states not to be near the elevator -- who wants to hear that all night -- so they moved us again - to room 1101 -- a Jr Suite -- that looks nothing like the other suite. There are stains on the floor and the furniture is filthy -- my feet are black just from walking on the carpet. Honestly I am not that picky for $250 a night (or $350 if I didn't ask) I expect better -- I stay at Hyatt Places for $120 a night and they are immaculate...and all these \"ala carte\" items are included. Now the view from the room is nice but even on the 11th floor you hear the traffic but that is prefferable to the loud music played at the pool until 11pm on Friday night and the obnoxius guests that don't have the decency to respect other guests. There is no coffee bar in the lobby - so fill up in your room - with the paper cups.. yes paper cups..again for the room rate? Really? The staff is definetly what saves this place and I think they are well aware of the issues with the hotel -- so the sqeaky wheel gets some action - don't be afraid to complain. Would I stay here again -- NOPE!! In fact will be shopping around while here to find another hotel for the next trip. Location -- great if your a tourist and want to go to Sea World - we have a view of the fireworks everynight which is thrilling for my 6 year old. Other than that there is nothing around this hotel - better off staying in Hotel Circle if you are being a tourist. We lived hear for 12 yrs so thought is would be fun to stay at the beach -- which is not near the hotel -- you need your car or be prepared to walk about 20 minutes. Not one of Hyatt's better property's -- very disappointed.

My previous experience was okay with just middling service from the staff and nicely redecorated rooms that were comfortable but not spectacular. Both times I received a \"partial\" ocean view or \"Marina\" view I think is what they call it. As others have said the pool area is nice but definitely meant for families and kids. There is a nice bar area near the pool and a highly rated restaurant (Red Marlin) on the grounds but I never took advantage of them due to the price. If you feel up to walking, Mission Beach is about a 20-30 minute walk west of the hotel (or 5 minute drive) where you'll find plenty of restaurants and nightlife (parking is difficult there so I usually walk---besides, you've already paid $20). There is also a seafood restaurant next door that has more reasonable prices but is also more \"divey\" looking. Rooms are comfortable with the Hyatt Grand Bed but beware if you're a light sleeper with a marina-facing room as on both occasions I was able to hear the seals barking even at night. My biggest surprise here though was the massive improvement in customer service. I'm not sure if they got a new GM or just better training but I was very impressed with the friendliness, smiles and genuine willingness to help provided by the staff. At check-in, I chatted with a nice young lady who genuinely seemed to be happy to be working there. If you've ever stayed at the Hyatt in Irvine or Orange County, you'll see a marked difference in the staff (especially among the sour/dour Irvine staff). Even when passing by maint. or housekeeping staff, they acknowledge you and smile and sometimes joke with you making you feel at home and relaxed.

Here are the details and some advice Advice: consider booking from the hotel's website. We did, and found the cheapest rate of all the sites we checked. The other benefit of doing so (rather than booking on Expedia or whatever) was that we were able to SELECT, rather than request a room type (like you do on Expedia). In this way, we selected a high floor tower room with an ocean view. When we arrived at the hotel, they didn't have a room that fit what we selected so it's my understanding that because of this we were upgraded to the Hyatt Gold Passport floor (or whatever it's called) which is the highest floor other than the penthouse floor. My other tip only applies to Costco members. If you are a Costco member you can get Hyatt gift certificates. You can buy cards in increments of $100.00, but you'll only pay $80.00. We used these certificates to pay most of our bill (for the hotel and food, etc.) saving us about 20%. If you get to the Hyatt and realize you've forgotten to do this, there's a Costco about 4 miles away. FYI: Please call to double check that they'll take the credit in case they've changed their policy! I don't want any mad Trip Advisor readers coming after me. On to the review Check In: Check in went smoothly (we were excited to be upgraded) Room: Our room was in good condition and had a fabulous view. The toilet gurgled occasionally throughout the night. Other than that, no issues. Staff: Wow! The customer service at this hotel was very nice. Everyone was very friendly and polite. I even got a book recommendation from the waitress at the pool who saw the novel I was reading and had some ideas for me. I also thought they handled the issue of not having the room we reserved ready really well. Good job Hyatt! Noise: Our room was really quiet; we couldn't hear anyone else in adjoining rooms. Resort Grounds/Pool: The grounds and pool were generally in good condition and very aesthetically pleasing. Even though the hotel was pretty full, we didn't have problems getting chairs by the pool. The hot tub was kind of dirty looking and bubbled ominously. We did not go in. Food: Wow. My husband and I both travel a fair amount (him moreso than me for business) and both of us though the SWIM bar (that's the pool food) was pretty good. We had dinner at the Red Marlin restaurant and it was absolutely fabulous, but pricey. As hotel restaurants go, this is one worth checking out. That being said, teir wine list was really polarizing: some good stuff but really pricey and some stuff which was inexpensive but pretty yuck. Other amenities, etc. The firepits outside were nice. I thought it was sweet that they brought around free popsicles at the pool (although I would have loved ice water dispensers or the distribution of iced water like they have at some Ritz Carlton properties. Sigh.) Some people have commented that this place nickles and dimes you on parking, pool towel charges (which are refundable, btw, so I don't get the problem) and other things. I priced around before booking and the Hyatt is just about even (and in some cases cheaper) than places like the Mariott and the Hilton (the Hilton is $25.00 to self park) which is just down the way. I think the prices seem reasonable _for a resort_. All in all, we had a good visit.

I was attending a conference being held at the hotel so it seemed like a good choice. It wasn't. First of all, this hotel boasts about a multi million dollar renovation. If this hotel had a multi million dollar renovation, they grossly overpaid. This is an old hotel and overall it looks like an old hotel that got a paint job. A lot about this hotel reminded me of a 1960's roadside motel. I believe that this hotel remodeled the guest rooms with a paint job, new bedding and new carpet but they need a lot more than that. The room looks okay at first glance and I liked the white bed linens with the green accents. All the other furniture looked old. The kicker was the rooms stink. Literally, they stink. My room smelled so musty and mildewy that I was worried everything I had would absorb the odor. I opened the windows, but since there are no screens, I then had to contend with bugs. I went to another conference attendee's room in another building and that room stunk as well. I heard the same comment from several people. Honestly, I have stayed in a lot of hotels and have never experienced a hotel room stinky like this. The bathroom was fine with a very long granite vanity and overall the room was clean. I stayed in Bay I (same building as the lobby) on the second floor. Rooms on the second floor of Bay I and Bay II do not have outdoor space. That is unless you call the open atrium area outside your door useful outdoor space. It's not. There is a real lack of attention to detail which when all those details are added up, it gives the feel of shabbiness. An example was that there was a wire was coming directly into the room through a hole in the wall for the heater/air conditioner and it was very visible since it was a few feet up the wall. The doors to the room had been painted inside and out, but it looked like they slapped paint over them and they looked shoddy. The walls of hotel are paper thin. Every sound traveled through the walls. I could hear everything in the room next door including the TV, the hairdryer and even talking and they weren't being loud. The hotel landscaping is quite lush and pretty. However, there is so much that as you try and navigate the pathways, it's hard to know where you are going sometimes. Note that the location of this hotel is not ideal unless you have a car as there is very little nearby and the choices at the hotel are limited.

The directions to the hotel did get us little confused (even with our navi) and ended up driving into the parking lot of Sea World, then they informed us how to get to the hotel. Once we got it, it was very nice. We checked in, and I thought we'd be staying at the tower, but we got \"upgraded\" to suites. There were 5 of us, 2 rooms, so we thought \"wow\". Once we got to our \"ocean view\" rooms, we got blocked by some building infront of us that gave us NO OCEAN VIEW what so ever. Then we asked to be switched. Well, they only switched 1 room (HELLO, there are 2 rooms, we checked in not even 3 minutes ago). Then we were told that the new room we switched to doesn't have the next rooms available so the other room will have to be down the hall. OK. That was one. So, the water bottle in the fridge (there were 2) and we had brought our own (12 pack), and from all of my other stays for business, most of these were complimentary (unless it has the minifridge stocked with food and drinks, which was not the case) and each bottles were 5 buck each. UM... it's not like they're fiji water, it's effin AQUAFINA!... ok, and according to dhec (department of health and something else I can't remember), a hotel MUST provide complimentary items such as toothbrush, toothpaste, hair comb, etc (i should know, my family owns bunch of hotels!), but noooo they had those 50cent travel size toothpaste in the room... So, we used it, and they charged me 9 dollars... what a way to make money. SO, 29 bucks total for 6 dollars worth of products we could've bought at the am/pm down the road. BAH! The suites were nice, don't get me wrong, but they sort of felt like the \"shorter yellow bus\" version of hotels (exterior entrance) in comparison to the NICE tower rooms (had we known this, we would've stayed at the tower and not get \"upgraded\") Really, I think we were rather \"downgraded\" to accomodate the wedding party. I don't mind being downgraded, but don't bs with me. The hotel \"ocean view\" is to the pier. That was a nice walk....

The staff is very friendly and accomodating. The room was clean and nicely decorated and we were always able to find a parking spot close to our room. I didn't like that we had to pay an extra parking fee of $20 ($25 if you want to valet, plus tips). The suite itself was pricey, but having to pay more for parking was ridiculous. You also have to pay for internet access. Any cheap motel will throw in free internet access, so I don't see why the Hyatt would charge for this basic service. There was also no Disney channel. As any Mom will tell you, some sort of kids channel is a must. It comes up on the channel guide, but when you go to it it takes you to the Speed channel. Our TV didn't work properly and when the person came to fix it they said they had switched to Speed from Disney a few months back. Even he couldn't understand the logic behind this change. We'd gotten the suite hoping that we could sleep our daughter in the front living room in a crib, however we were right next to an outside corridor that had noisy pedestrain traffic until late into the night. The bedrrom itself was not noisy. It is on the flightpath for the airport, but it wasn't too disruptive. Overall, the hotel is very nice and the staff is great.

Unfortunately, it was quite cool so they only were able to enjoy it one afternoon - just too cold and breezy! Our room was more like a 3-star hotel's in the tower; however, we had a great view of the fireworks every night from Sea World.

Our rate included free, wired Internet and breakfast at the Red Marlin (buffet). I was annoyed however at having to pay $20 to self park (valet was $25). In some locations I like valet - but most of the time I prefer the ability to just get my rental and go - and not have to plan to call for the car. Paying this much for parking really annoyed me, especially when it was this much for self-parking! Although the hotel's been remodeled - it is more like a 3 1/2 star hotel in my opinion. However, the room and bathroom were comfortable and clean but I didn't like the toiletries at all. Service was fine and congenial.

With all this in mind I kind of feel bad for adding anything negative however I have noticed from some of the reviews that people have mention: Noise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c After a 6 hour drive from Las Vegas we arrived at around 11pm and were very tired and looking forward to a nights sleep. After we walked into our room we started to unwind and then realised that our room backed onto the elevator shaft and so every time someone got in the lift the noise from the mechanics would be coming through the wall. I went down and told them about it and we were promptly moved so no really complaints but I can empathise with people that have experienced this. Charges \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I noticed some people complained about the charges that the hotel adds I had no need to wireless internet etc. So again I feel a little bad for mentioning it but on our first day we went to explore the hotel and found that they have some very nice gazebos that you can sit on in front of a fire by the pool area, after mentioning to the receptionist how nice they were she told us that they were available to hire by the hour, which seemed absurd. We off course just laughed it off and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t both but I wondered if they were going to charge for the sun loungers while we were there? Pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c And finally some people have mentioned pool noise, again I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really have any need to complain because we were on a high floor but the pool area gets very busy and noisy and so I can imagine if you are on a lower floor this could become disturbing. Overall this hotel was nice and the staff were very friendly and extremely accommodating however it appears that it depends on the luck of the draw. We were fortunate enough to have a high room away from the noise, however I can see how you could have a completely different experience to the one we had.

The rooms are fine and the pool area is very nice, although we did not use it. The daily parking fee of $20 self or $25 valet is extremely excessive in the writer's opinion. Twice over five days there were no spaces to park in the self parking lot for the $20 fee. Technically this was breach of contract. Breakfast in the restaurant is $20 for the buffet, $12 or so for a couple of eggs. Also unreasonable, which explains why almost no one is in the restaurant. Dinner is proportionately expensive. The restaurant is only open during certain hours, so you have to go off-site to eat if you arrive at a non-standard time and need to eat. When the air system is on the in the room, whether on a heating or a cooling setting, the air becomes extremely dry. We are used to California air, but the room air must get down to maybe 5% humidity. It dries your mouth and throat and hands out to the point that it becomes very uncomfortable. It is sort of like living on air airplane. We all ended up turning off the air systems in all our rooms. The only explanation the writer can guess at is that the HVAC system must be one of the old, inefficient designs that takes all the room air regardless of the temperature, cools it all down, dehumidifies it, and then heats it back up to your temperature set point. If you are there for just one night you might be OK. There for several days, keep the air system off. Hotel doors need to close reliably for security reasons. Well, this Hyatt has nailed that problem. These doors slam like you will not believe. Not a gentle slam; but a wake-the-dead-holy-moly slam. The paint all around the door frame on one of our doors was completely shattered from the slamming. If you try to go to sleep before the last person slams their door, or sleep in after the first person gets up, you might have a big problem. Over fifty years in hotels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is the worst the writer has ever seen (heard). The closet door in the rooms folds outward in the middle, pivoting on a small metal post at one end. Without warning it fell out on my wife, smashing the top of her foot. We had our two-year old granddaughter constantly in the room; luckily she was not there at the time or she might have been killed. My wife's foot was badly bruised and discolored. The weather was great except for some rain and wind on one day. Once the wind rose above maybe 20 miles per hour, something in the building facade began vibrating loudly and fairly continuously. It sounded similar to a truckload of iron rebar driving down a rough road, with a frequency of about 5 Hz. The balcony railings are constructed of clear plexiglass framed in metal, and it could be the plexiglass/railing assembly that was clanking (it was not just the plexiglass), but it could have been the whole balcony or something else. It was so loud that the writer was unable to sleep, and was actually loudest in the bathroom, which was adjacent to the hotel hallway. This noise was prominent in room 912. In 914 it was audible but not terrible. It was not noticeable with the air conditioning on in 916. This problem was undoubtedly designed into the hotel and has been present since it was constructed. Every time the wind rises to some threshold level, this vibration starts up. When this complaint was brought to the hotel about it, they claimed/pretended that they were unaware of it. Since the wind must rise to this level 10-20 times a year (the hotel faces the ocean), this is not credible. Now the writer may be the world's worst structural engineer, but obviously the design of the hotel structure failed to anticipate and damp these vibrations, so that is one oversight. Because the hotel is on the ocean, salt is everywhere, and the unplanned vibrations can be creating stress corrosion, accelerated by the presence of the salt. In addition, if any of the structural support members that are vibrating are under tension, which is likely, then you can develop fretting corrosion and/or fretting fatigue, which will eventually cause the affected parts to fail (fall apart). So if it is the balconies, they will fall off the building and kill and/or injure the people in the pool area below. When the writer mentioned this and the closet door that smashed my wife's foot to the hotel, they just blew me off with a polite smile. In other words, they will be very nice to you, but they really don't care about your safety, and on top of this they will charge you outrageously in the parking lot and restaurant. So you should stay here with your eyes wide open, your construction helmet and boots on, your vaporizer, earplugs, lots of insurance, and a thick wallet.", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cLoudest hotel I've ever stayed... it was torture!\u201d", "Author": "sunta", "ReviewID": "UR50717134", "Content": "As I am writing this review I am sitting in my TENTH FLOOR room, listening to the blaring announcer and pounding loud music from the GROUND FLOOR at 10:30pm at night, totally unable to sleep because of the noise.

Good for conferences, receptions, marina boat owners, visitors to Sea World, Old Town and the beaches, and for just lazing around the pool with nothing much else to do. Boats, water scooters, kayaks and bicycles can be hired. But it is a fair way to the centre of San Diego, so not the place to be if you want to spend much time exploring the city. To downtown by car is 20 mins. (Cab $25). Bus (Nos 8/9) then trolley is $5 per person. (About 40 mins.) The room The room styles vary considerably from marina-side suites, high rise with balconies and bay views to ground floor with no views but easy access to garden and pool areas. Our room was on the first floor of one of the older accommodation blocks. It has no balcony and the former bay views are now mostly blocked by a large, seemingly permanent conference tent. The Good The room itself is quite large, but dominated by two QS beds. Clean and maintained but no recent upgrade. Beds are firm but comfortable. Small walk-in robe, bench space and office chair for laptop and one lounge chair. Nice big LCD TV with 30 channels and zillions of pay-to-view video offerings. Also a fridge, small coffee machine, a safe, iron and board, and a clock radio with iPod dock. Shelves for three cases. Internet via cable or WiFi is available. Very quiet at night. (One exception - see below.) The bathroom is also large with two wash basins in a long granite bench top. Bath and shower. The Bad No elevator in this wing. Just \"exercise\" stairs. No self-catering (except for the coffee maker) and there is no table and chairs for room service meals! Lighting is a bit basic. No bed-side control. No reading or ceiling lights. The A/C is an older style and rather noisy, as was the exhaust fan in the bathroom. While the TV has a good range of channels it's all in NTSC analog, not digital, so is a bit fuzzy. Internet is not free. No prices listed anywhere. The bathroom could do with an extra, wider towel rail. As usual in American hotels, there is no floor drain in the bathroom. (I guess that is the hotel's problem.) Just about everything costs extra, including the water! Unexpected problems: We reported a couple of minor maintenance issues which were never sorted out; and one night at 4am some bikies got in and roared around the grounds a few times just to wake everybody up. There apparently is no effective security for such \"noise terrorists\". The Ugly That big white tent that blocked our bay view. (Well it's not that ugly, just in the wrong place for our room.) General faciities. All you might expect at a resort/hotel in this area.

We payed quite a lot for the room and it was not worth the money at all. We have stayed at many Hyatts in the past and this was the first time we were confronted with blinds with slats missing (so the room was well lit all night), the smell of cleaning fluid (and/or possibly bug spray), and very visible stains on the furniture. There were no screens on any of the windows or doors, and some flying insects did join us as a result. There was a sign near the fridge stating that there were 2 bottles of water in the fridge (such was not the case) and that if we used them there would be a charge of $4.99 each. Pretty pricey indeed. The first two rooms we were given had the definite feel of a budget motel and smelled terrible, and after complaining to the manager, we were given a different room. The third, while the best of the three, still would not be considered anywhere close to luxurious. The hotel is located near a busy street, so if you leave your windows open, it is noisy. Internet is not included in the room rate - which, given the room rate - is completely unacceptable. The room was a good size. As mentioned, we tried 3 rooms and, while the third had the mildest version, all had the same smell and ALL had stained furniture. Views were nice. We were not on the executive floor, so perhaps that is better. I note that some of the good reviews for this hotel were by people who stayed on the Regency floor. We chose to not eat at the hotel, and did not really use many of the amenities, so we cannot comment on that aspect. Again, for the price, it was terrible.

The hotel was packed for the holiday weekend and the pool area was insane on Saturday and Sunday, but the hotel had extra security and the kids didn't mind the crowds at all. Our rooms were clean and very comfortable and the hotel staff was very accomodating. I should mention our issues: we had no paper or pen to jot down a note, no bathrobes as in other rooms, and no \"do not disturb\" sign for our door. Parking is a big issue. A large parking lot on the far side of the hotel has been taken over by a tent.

We fit two cribs in nicely into the room and never felt squeezed in. The halls were clean, the elevators although a little slow always worked well and we never heard them from our room. We never had the room cleaned, we were there for three days and just asked for new towels and shampoo which they gladly gave to us. Parking is a Rip and the spaces in the east lot are tiny. Go to the west lot (other side of the hotel) and the spaces are much larger. We normally ate at a restaurant on Sports Arena Blvd... There were many there... In & Out; Papa Johns, Chile's, Olive Garden, and all the fast food joints. On the other side of the bay just across the bridge is a great park with a bay beach. Good sand for sandcastles with minimal waves. If you like the waves, a few hundred feet down the same road (w. mission bay rd) and you hit the Pacific Ocean. Kids stuff... Our four year old loved all the water slides (you have to be at least 42\"). Our three year old loved the kiddie slide and out non walking toddler loved the slanted beach like pool where he could crawl down. For some reason the kiddie slide pool was colder than all the other pools, couldn't figure this one out. Each night you can roast marshmallows and make smores by the fire. They also had movies or other activities for kids through the day. Like I said, very kid friendly. The Water taxi is awesome. The tickets at the concierge are $3.00 per person but you can go and come back from SeaWorld as often as you like. Next time we go our plan is to go in the morning, come back for lunch and pool time, then go back in the evening for the night shows and fireworks. The breakfast if you have it included is ok. Definitely not one of those Vegas ones but enough to where you will have a decent breakfast if you can get it included. All in all, if our kids had a bad time, I would be negative about the amount of money we paid for the hotel but the smiles on their faces makes the money we paid seem less important.", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Larchmont, New York", "Title": "\u201cKids Rule!\u201d", "Author": "Helene W", "ReviewID": "UR38544435", "Content": "Rooms in the Tower building are spacious and beautiful.

We are locals, had stayed here a couple years back prior to the renovations and wanted to see how the new improvements looked. For those of you considering this hotel, I would recommend you look elsewhere Upon arrival we were given a room in the Bayfront II building, close to the pool. Upon entering the room, we were struck with a very strong odor coming from the bathroom. My husband said it smelled like a men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room. A very dirty men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room. I tried a couple of different room sprays, and even bought some scented oils and candles. When nothing worked, I went to speak with someone at the front desk who promised to send housekeeping out right away. After waiting for some time, attempting to air out the room, we finally got tired of waiting and went to dinner, hoping that it would be cleaned when we returned. If anything, the smell was stronger when we got back. There is no way that someone responsible for cleaning that room wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have noticed the stench. Finally the next day I complained again to the front desk and asked to be moved. When we were eventually moved, we did get a nice room in the tower. A few days after our return I sent a message to management and have yet to receive a response. Aside from the ridiculous $20 daily self-parking fee, the hotel really gouges you. There is a charge for poolside activities that other resorts offer for free. The hotel towels are tiny and limited \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we had two of each, when there were three of us that checked in. The bath mat was miniscule and not thick enough to sop up the water that seeped out of the shower, and the couch in the room smelled of body odor. On the surface, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very attractive resort. The grounds are pretty, the restaurant has a beautiful view, and there are some fun cabanas outside of the pool area next to some fire pits. However, the seats in the cabanas are all stained and smelly, the restaurant food was marginal (the kids buffet was almost inedible), service was non-existent and for some reason the outdoor speakers continued to play music very late into the night making it hard to sleep. Dining choices? Forget about it. The poolside menu is not at all geared to kids, even thought the pool, with the 3 water slides, is meant to be a family environment. And if you are looking for a late lunch, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to leave the grounds. The bagel shop stops serving lunch very early (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also quite a distance from the hotel lobby area) and the restaurant does not offer lunch items past the usual lunch hour. On top of everything else, this location is constantly windy. It was so cold that we ended up leaving the pool after about an hour. Next time, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll stay at the Mission Bay Hilton nearby instead. Better location, friendly service, clean rooms, a relaxing ambience and the food choices were far better too.

Some wedding guests in the tower had to go to other floors to showers. Skip ahead two years...I take my children out to visit with family. I had booked a room through the website, which I subsequently determined was NONREFUNDABLE, mistake on my part. I had reserved a 2 Queen room. When we checked in, we were assigned a room in the Bay II building. I have stayed at this hotel probably five times and didn't even know it was there. When we checked in, there was no balcony or patio. Again, I didn't even think they had rooms like that! When I went to the front desk to inquire, I was told that was a STANDARD Queen/Queen room. The rooms below me, with patios, were all King rooms (sure, makes perfect sense, give more space to the parties with fewer guests!). A dirty swim diaper was still in the trash can--my kids are 7 & 9, so it did NOT belong to me! I had forgotten the ridiculous charges for parking. \"Self-parking\" of $20/day was more than my subsequent stay at the Hyatt Orange County's VALET parking. The pool at the Hyatt Mission Bay was extremely crowded, and in the spa, I met some people who were locals and just mooching off the hotel for the afternoon. Then I was awakened at 4:45 by a drunk guest downstairs arguing with someone on her cell phone. After half an hour, I finally went out of the room, down the stairs and around to her patio to ask her to quiet down. (If I had had a balcony, I wouldn't have had to leave my room!) Almost immediately upon returning to my room the birds started making noise--this is a Polynesian style building with an open roof, and bird feathers litter the hallway, as they sit there in the morning and caw!

However, I had a bad taste in my mouth from check-in on, so I chose not to eat at the hotel & give them as few of my vacation dollars as possible.

I just wasn't prepared for the full-on day-care kids camp that I encountered. If I did have children, I might choose this place, but have no idea how I'd afford it with kids. My partner and I arrived to find a diaper-smelling crib in our room. I called room service to have it removed, but gave up after 5+ minutes on hold. To be fair this was 4th of July weekend and the place was inundated. The bulk of the hotel services/programs seem to be directed at families. There are so many kid-directed activities I think this place should be called the \"Hyatt Mission to Cater to Kids Bay\". I have nothing against children, just would've liked a few more things that catered to adults - especially when paying these kind of room rates. But I guess technically a \"kids camp\" is something that caters to certain adults . . . parents. One other thing that I'll mention is that this hotel is not really near a \"beach\". Despite the \"beach icon\" that hotwire and some other vendors display. It is definitely on the ocean, but there is no swimming beach, It is smack in the middle of a marina. I thought we might be able to get away from the hotel pool and check out a real ocean beach, but that is not possible given the boat traffic and the fact that there is no sandy entry into the ocean. That said, there is a very good bargain to be had in the $5 round trip per person water taxi to sea world. This puts you right into the middle of the park and runs every hour and twice hourly on weekends. Red Marlin was a nice restaurant in a beautiful location - but you'll likely not have the wallet for eating there nightly. Room service was very expensive - $19 for French Toast. The bagel/coffee shop is a great option but note that it closes at 2pm. Just continue to walk another block or so away from the hotel and you'll encounter a couple of small hamburger/hot dog joints and a fresh seafood restaurant that are extremely reasonable and cater to folks in the Marina. Other than Sea World and the marina businesses (boat/jet-ski rentals and fishing charters) there is not very much nearby and the $20 day parking is steep. Overall this is a very beautiful property just consider the location carefully (getting to downtown or gaslight district is a haul) and make sure you can handle the heavy kid factor. I have nothing against kids - I just was expecting a bit more of a romantic setting, not sharing the hot tub at 10:30pm at night with a bunch of teenagers drinking beer and throwing foam in each others faces. I guess I also assumed the $239 nightly rate I paid (Hotwire) would keep most of the families priced out - but I assume they must've found some cheaper rate or just are not feeling this recession like the rest of us.

I cant understand how parents can let the kids be like this but when we saw the amount of unsupervised kids in the Club Room / hot tubs etc we could understand all the noise. And also the hot tub was a lovely shade of green with snotty nosed kids in it. YUK! Suggestion to Hyatt. Have adults only on floor 17 and Adults and kids on floor 16, as when you pay extra for Regency you expect peace, not being kept up by loud banging above! We did complain but it still continued on until midnight and resumed at 5am. Not very relaxing for us, and we have stayed religiuously with Hyatts and enjoy the upgrade option. We prefer Hyatt La Jolla for their food and pool and Regency Club has better Breakfast but it has no views at all. One other thing.

After leaving the Bahia \"resort\" next door (which was horrific...read my review of it!) we got a great last-minute deal for full week! The Staff: Fabulous!! Valet parking was only $5 a day, and so worth it, bc we were in and out alot throughout the day. The valets were so helpful with directions, reccomendations, and very courteous with us and our crazy kids. (plus they were FAST!) The bellman we had upon arrival was so nice and understanding about us leaving another hotel and coming there, so he was extra helpful quickly getting our things to our room. The ppol staff, bar, restaurants (Red Marlin) and everyone were just so nice and wonderful! The room: Was gorgeous. We had room number 1115 in the main tower, which was just a standard double (both queen beds) but had a gorgeous view of the harbor, mountains and Sea World (we watched the fireworks from our balcony every night at 8:45...the kids love dit!) Comfy white down linens and pillows (lots of pillows!), flat screen tv, desk with chair, and another chair in the corner. Nice bathroom with storage for toiletry bags. GREAT water pressure in the shower (important!). Balcony, as mentioned, with cushioned chairs and a little table. Balcony is always nice to have a place to go after the kids go to sleep! There was a little \"cooler\", not a fridge in the room as well. Dresser, closet, n/s. Alarm clock with place for your ipod. Very clean, bright and pretty! The POOL: Also FABULOUS! The pool is nice and BIG, three large sections, 3 water slides, zero-entrance section for small kids. Heated, which was so nice, b/c 65 degree weather isnt exactly swimming weather if you ask me, but the kids didnt care one bit. Cusioned chairs all around the pool, towels provided. Good music by the pool too. Lots of sun, but also ample shade. Large hot tub as well. There were family cabanas by the pool too, first come first serve. The only negative i would have to say is that it seemed they were understaffed in the pool/bar/restaurant area during the day. They were supposed to have waiters to take drink orders, but one single mom sitting next to me with 4 kids (whew!) said she waited 45 minutes for her beer. (And boy did she deserve that drink). But the bar was just a few steps away, so my husband went to get our overpriced adult drinks himself, which was fine. (we ended up going to Long's drugstore across the bridge and buying a cheap styrofoam cooler and a case of beer which we kept on ice in the room...saved us a TON of money! Long's also had a full liquor section as well.) Right outside the pool was a circular area lined with curtained cabanas with cushioned outdoor furniuture sets, with litte cocktail tables. These were so nice! One afternoon we brought down some blankets and snacks, drinks and toys and just hung out while they were cleaning our room. At night they have fire pits in this area too, we saw some people roasting marshmallows on night. We ate at the Red Marlin for breakfast two mornings, it was very good. (the bacon was great!) They had a menu but also had a buffet available. Kids 4 and under ate free at the buffet. They also had very good burgers that we ate by the pool a couple of days. The LOCATION: Right next to Sea World, so that was nice! Sea World has some kinda deal this year that if you buy a ticket (called a Fun Pass i think) you basically get a season pass for a full year, and can come back unlimited times. We used that alot. And Sea world never seemed overcrowded, we didnt wait in line long for anything. The shows were great (see the Pet Show!!) and the animal exhibits were very cool. i was very impressed for our first time at Sea World. We were 30 minutes from Legoland (go early! dont get there after 10:30 or you will wait in line forever! Get there at 9:45 and head straight to the major rides.) And i truly dont know what all the fuss is about with this park. The rides are very carnival-like and the lines!! OMG! 90 min wait for a 90 second ride is just insane. The rides were not worth the wait. This is not somewhere we would bother going ever again. We spent 3 hours here and were over it.

We booked it through hotwire (which gave me an impression it was a beach resort - which it was not - its on the water with a marina, but there is no beach to be had). I can live with that though - you never are 100% sure with hotwire. I am not a picky person when it comes to hotels, all I want is a little respect and attention when issues arise. I know stuff happens, all I ask it that it gets taken care of. Because we had issues and they weren't addressed very well, I will say this was one of our worst hotel experiences ever, especially when the price is factored in. First let me mention the positives - good location - close to pacific beach, sea world, etc. Easy access to and from hotel. The pool is also pretty nice, especially for younger kids (under 9?). Some nice slides, etc. Now keeping up a stock of pool towels would be nice (this would be one of those things I can overlook). Now for the bad. We arrived just before check-in time on our day of arrival, and our room wasn't ready. No big deal - to be expected.... went ahead and did a pre-check in (got pool passes) and gave them my cell number to call me once our room was ready. We drove around a bit to pacific beach and came back and let the kids play in the pool, all the time expecting a call that our room was ready. Finally, 45 minutes after the official check in time we finally went to the front desk - our room was ready, but they didn't bother to call like we had pre-arranged. Get to room. Nice furnishings, comfortable beds...but a little warm. Crank up the A/C, unpack and head out for the evening for dinner and to play around the amusement park area. return after 9 and ready for bed - room still seemed warm, but I figured it needed time to cool & beind so tired (it was 11:00+ our time) we just hit the sack. About 1:30 am I awoke realizing it was very warm in our room. Opened windows which faced the pool area to let in some of the cool San Diego breeze only to discover the taped music they play in the pool area was blaring out of a speaker right by our window. Being thirsty, I got one of the bottled waters we had put in the fridge hours before only to find that our refridgerator cools about as well as the AC does. Next morning my wife goes to front desk to complain about the lack of A/C and the blaring music... and to ask about getting me some coffee (no coffee pot in room). Front desk man says he would send maintenance. tells my wife she can get a pot of coffee to go at the coffee shop for $10. Now.... you would think the first thing the front desk person would say to her is \"you had a cruddy night, let me send you up some coffee on the house\". Strike One. Before our kids have even awoken, housekeeping knocks on the door wanting to clean the room. We tell them to come back in a hour or two, that we were still sleeping. We leave for the day and return about 5pm to discover (1) housekeeping has not been there yet and (2) the room is still very warm. Strike 2. Call front desk, who does get housekeeping to come up and reports that maintenance says the AC wasn't cooling too well yet because we left the blinds open all morning (morning sun) with the windows open and it will take a while to catch up. they supposedly 'adjusted it'. Night 2. AC Still not working, we open the windows (at least no blaring music) and manage a decent night with a cool breeze. Next morning - report to front desk who will again send up maintenance to work on AC. Long story short - when we return late that night its still not working and complain again - this time the front desk guy at least showed a little concern for unhappiness (finally). there were no rooms to move us to, but he was able to get us a large fan. Neat, now I am spending almost $300 a night to stay in a hotel room with a large noisy fan. Spoke to manager on the way out and she did comp our parking.... I truly think she would have done more if we hadn't prepaid on hotwire. I have her card should we ever want to return they would give us a discounted stay. I don't think we will take a chance...its just not worth it. So to sum up - all the negatives: * Poor service (this trumps everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!) * Maintenance Issues unaddressed * Lots of noise from pool area (blaring music, loud party) * No in room coffee, expensive to purchase at coffee shop * Pool often had no towels * Not on a beach (should you think it is based on hotwire) * No free wifi... cost per day in the room was outrageous. None available in lobby. Positives: * Good location * Our room was clean - no issues there * Nice beds * Nice Pool For the price and star rating, I expect more than what we got at this hotel.", "Date": "March 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "us", "Title": "\u201cS'mores By the Bay\u201d", "Author": "Bblgirl", "ReviewID": "UR27004663", "Content": "We arrived at the Hyatt and checked in.

The room was spotlessly clean and complete with mini fridge, coffee maker, wine glasses, wine opener, fluffy robes, nice towels and the usual great Portico bath products - always a treat. Hyatt did it right when they chose these products. I spent every early evening sitting out in the balcony on the very high quality comfy and expensive looking outdoor furniture overlooking the water with glass of wine in hand. The pool area is great and they really did a great job with the renovation. It's like a little mini Hawaii right there complete the tiki torches, fire pits and very cool outdoor sitting canopies. One pool even has a sandy area that is sloped like your are walking from the beach into the water. The water slides are FUN even for adults. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants so I cannot comment about then. I now live in San Diego and I'm trying to figure out a way to convince them to sell me a summer pass to the pool area :)", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing Work Trip\u201d", "Author": "cadet1821", "ReviewID": "UR25537134", "Content": "Work required me to spend two days in San Diego and I stayed with the Hyatt Regency Mission Bay.

We booked through Priceline and bought the upgrade to the oceanview room. Just opening the door and glimpsing the stunning ocean view for the first time was memorable. One whole wall is floor to ceiling glass facing the sea. In our cases, facing the San Diego River, Mission Park and then the sea. We were 16 stories up with a large glassed in balconey with comfortable seating for two. We get a great price on Priceline; mind you watch out for all the add-ons such as paid parking, paying for internet and exorbitent restaurant prices. It is a somewhat isolated location so you really don't have much choice but to pay the piper for food. The 3 pools are lovely and they don't scrimp on the luxuriusly upholstered deck chairs or private cabanas. Lots of thick towels too. The water slides are a blast! Unfortunately the jacuzzi was only luke warm with no jets running. No one responded to our requests to fix the jacuzzi either. One nice touch is that there are airport web check in machines in the lobby. If those are on the fritz, the concierge will download your boarding pass for free. This was a huge help at the airport. We just skated on it to a special web check in line, while many other passegers were stuck in a huge long queques for check in and baggage. Lunch at the Red Marlin was wonderful, but very pricey ($90 for 2 people!!). Oh, and about those wonderful balconeys way up 16 stories in the air. I would not allow children on them unsupervised as they could climb right up on the furniture to get a better look which might lead to tragic consequences.Speaking of kids, those three pools and 2 water slides are jammed with shrieking kids, so if you are trying to have a quiet pool experience, look elsewhere. Having said that, because the walls are floor to ceiling glass you can lie in bed and watch the sunset/sunrise or lie in bed and watch the catamarans cruise by on the San Diego river.

But two warnings first: 1) The walls in the main tower are super-thin and it seems like the doors to the rooms are made out of lead. They slam closed (unless you are courteous enough to gently close them). You will hear every door slam on your floor, the floor above you, and the floor below you. Also, pray you are not next to the ice machine. 2) If you want a real \"ocean view\" make sure you are AT LEAST on the 10th floor in the main tower (there are 17 floors or so total). Ocean view rooms are even numbered. Odd numbered rooms look out over the parking lot side. I don't think there is much of a view there. Room numbers between 10-20 are better than 2-8. You'll have a better view. Views from our room were amazing. Sunsets were beautlful. The lower rooms are right over the pool and are blocked partially by rooms across the way. Also, the noise from the pool bounces off your balcony and you can swear people are swimming right in your room. The higher the room, the better. We stayed for a week and never ate at the hotel restaurant (Red Marlin). It just looked too expensive. There is an Einstein Bagels in the marina, but even that will cost you $20 for breakfast for 2. Positives: The main tower was very clean and even smelled \"new\". When we commented to the front desk that the pool noise was too much for our 9 month old son, we were upgraded to an end suite on a higher floor at no extra cost. I was very satisfied. Overall, the hotel staff was extremely friendly and professional. They gave some great restaurant recommendations as well. Hotel location seemed pretty central to everything, but we had a rental car so that wasn't an issue. The hotel is located pretty much right across from Sea World.

We choose the ocean side rather than the marina side to get a better view. The room was not ready and since it took much longer than expected to get it ready we were given a complimentary upgrade to the 16th floor--a concierge club floor that included a continental breakfast (pretty good) and evening snacks (no great shakes, soft drinks and a some passable snacks- booze was not free as at other Hyatt hotel Regency club floors). It was really a nice gesture to give us this additional upgrade and indicative of the overall friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. The room was small but the view was terrific. Pick the Ocean/Mission Bay side if you are on an upper floor, the sunsets were great. There is a small porch sitting area you can enjoy the view from. The bedding was the usual high Hyatt quality. The pool area was great with two tame but decent water slides. One tip, parking is $22 . My daughter lives in the Crown Point area of San Diego, only a 15-20 minute walk from the hotel. There is very safe and free on-street parking in the Crown Point area so I did not pay the parking fee.The street parking in the immediate vicinity of the hotel prohibits on-street parking from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. effectively eliminating that as an option. As a practical matter there really does not seem to be any policing of the hotel parking lot area so even if you did not pay the fee and get the paper tag for your dashboard, you probably can still park in the hotel lot anyway (because of a late return to the hotel on the last night we used the hotel parking lot and suffered no ill effects).

When I booked this hotel I thought that I couldn't go wrong with this Hyatt property. The pictures on their website and the fact that it was recently remodeled looked convincing as well but after reading some of the reviews on here my expectations were rather low. good thing: I was not disappointed. When we arrived I asked for a tower room as those were getting better reviews than the motel-style ones. The room we were given was on the 2nd floor, though and they had no other rooms. The front desk offered us an upgrade for $40 a day to a room somewhere on the 10th or 12th floor. This was not the Regency Club Level either but basically the same room category we had reserved. What a ripoff, especially considering that we already payed well over $300 a night. We declined the offer and accepted the 2nd floor room. The room itself was very nice and had a friendly atmosphere with tastefully chosen colours and contemporary style. The furniture was all new and the carpet wasn't stained. The Bathroom was unusually roomy and opposed to earlier reviews our shower had a small tray placement area. The Beds - simply awesome! Smaller details leave a lot to be desired, though, particularly at this price. The balcony was covered in dirt and so was the furniture outside - maybe something they forgot about after the remodel? The hallway seems to be mostly untouched during the renovations as the doors have lots of scratch marks on them and although you get a HD-Flatscreen TV the video quality is average at best. I know these are nit-picks but this ain't no Motel6. The downside to a room on the second floor was that we missed out on the awesome view over Mission Bay but not the annoying noise from the children and the music at the pool well past 11pm. The pool area seems pretty cool with nicely kept garden surroundings but very crowded. Nearly all of the chairs were already taken by 9-10am and they ran out of towels by about midday. We didn't care because we barely used the pool anyway. The red marlin restaurant offers a delicious breakfast buffet that you shouldn't miss out on. We ate there every morning. Dinner is equally good but pricey (main dish well over $30). Overall we enjoyed our stay except for those little shortcomings. The hotel is a convenient starting point to explore the San Diego area. Sadly we couldn't enjoy the amenities of the hotel as much as we would have liked while still seeing so much of the city... The Beach is only a few minute-drive away and so is Downtown and Coronado. In spite of that I'm not sure if I'd choose the HR Mission Bay again. It's more expensive than the HR La Jolla which is getting better reviews and one could sometimes feel a lack of attention to detail.", "Date": "September 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tustin, California", "Title": "\u201cDon't Let the Name 'Hyatt' Fool You\u201d", "Author": "TustinTraveler2008", "ReviewID": "UR19619243", "Content": "I am a frequent Hyatt customer and, as such, have come to expect a certain level of quality at Hyatt hotels. This is my experience at the Hyatt Mission Bay - First, although I had specifically requested a room with a balcony or patio, I was given a room with NO balcony or patio. When I was then moved to a new room, our balcony was part of a large balcony that spanned the length of the building, with no dividers between rooms. The people next door to us were outside late at night and used \"our\" balcony, as well as their own for a small party they were having. When I asked to be moved to a room with a private balcony there were none available. In addition to the patio problem, our room (which was barely more than a standard motel room) had stains on the carpet and upholstered furniture, nicks in the wood furniture, and none of the standard amenities I would expect from a Hyatt (coffeemaker, toiletries, etc). There was almost no place to put our clothes (two tiny drawers and a very small closet with an ironing board that took up most of the space). My daughter and I decided to go to the pool, which was noisy and crowded. There were no pool towels available which wasn't a big problem as there was also no seating available. Once we finally got seats and towels (roughly half an hour wait), we ordered a drink. Half an hour later we hadn't received it and decided to leave the pool. We did not use the pool again because every time we went by we found it crowded, noisy, messy, and with an insufficient amount of furniture. There were a number of other minor problems and inconveniences, but my point is this - if I had gone to a Holiday Inn or Best Western I would have expected these problems - and paid FAR less than the $287 a night that I was paying. When I go to a Hyatt and agree to pay the prices that they charge, I expect more than the standard motel experience. Being a holiday weekend, I was not able to move to another hotel which, I assure you, I would have done if I could have found one. My husband and I travel frequently and generally stay at Westins, Hyatts, or Intercontinentals. This particular weekend was intended to be a fun \"Mother-Daughter\" getaway, with time to relax and rejuvenate. Our experience at the Hyatt Mission Bay fell far short of our expectations.

We live in Santa Barbara. My husband, my son and I stayed at the Hyatt just last weekend and I can only summarize it in this way: Here are the Pros: Hotel is conveniently located to area attractions The bed is extremely comfortable as those Hyatt beds are known to be. Room is spacious and is nicely appointed throughout INCLUDiNG the Deck. It seems all of the rooms in the tower have lovely viewsl. Ours looked out over the pool and the bay. The staff is acommodating and friendly. The grounds are lovely Ok and now for the cons: The hotel lobby is cold an austere with obnoxiously loud music that greeted us when we arrived at 11 PM, kind of strange for a Hyatt, I thought. The parking price is outrageous given, the non-urban environment, however, there are spaces on one side of the street, that are not marked that were avail to us so we DID NOT USE valet, which saved I think $24 /night, not sure of exact cost. The pool scene is an absolute zoo.... think Disneyland on a holiday weekend. We were there on a summer weekend. The pool and waterslide was filled and I mean FILLED with kids and their parents. As if your fear of public water needs to be heightened, I went down to the pool are at 8:30 AM one morning ( I will explain why I was down there so early shortly)and what was the first sight I saw?? Was it that of blue water, glimmering in the early morning San Dieg Sun? Well perhaps but I was also greeted by a three year old little girl who had stripped off her entire bathing suit and was squatting in the shallow end of the shallowest pool peeing, while her mother attended to her older brother. And now back to why I was there at 8:30 AM, we soon learned that the some of the guests send their children, as I observed from my deck , down to the pool as early as 8 to \"reserve\" chaise which only has a domino effect of mandating that eveyone do so if they wish to not be seated on the cement by the pool during the course of their stay. I complained to the concierge regarding the hotels policy of allowing this. She was sympathetic, and stated that \" items left for 1 hour at the pool will be removed\" .We did not see evidence of this. As for the food, we ate by the pool and it was as expected for that type of dining. I did not attend the spa, but honestly given the way the place is over run with kids, I cant say that I would have relaxed any by going there. As a side note, my 12 year old son had a GREAT time.

If you are going to Sea World stay at the Hyatt for this extra service. The worst part of the hotel is the pool area. Not the new pool itself which is great but the lack of space to move around and have chairs. They built to large a pool for the space and now have no room to put alot of chairs.

I called the day before our arrival to confirm that we were in fact booked for the Marina Suite and to give them notice that we would not be arriving until about 11:00 pm. I also confirmed that we were to have a rollaway bed. The person I spoke with told me that we were all set. We arrive at the hotel at 10:30 pm Friday night. Check it seems to go well, customer service is nice and the service is prompt. This is where things start downhill. We pre-pay $18.00/night for parking. We drive to the lot for our room and there is absolutely no parking left. So, we spend $18.00 to park in the street. I decided not to complain about this as the street parking was close to our room. Then, we try to find our room. Although I am accustomed to hotels putting even numbered rooms on one side of the hall, and odd on the other, this hotel puts even numbers on one side of the building and odd on the complete other side (through two gates that require your key). Also, there is no sign to tell you this until you walk around to the other side of the building. So, dragging suitcases and a cranky two year old, we eventually find our room. The patio area that greets us is filthy and has the prior tenant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room service tray and beer bottles on the table. Yuck. Then, upon entrance to the room, we realize that we are not in the Marina Suites (if I had been more awake, I would have realized this when there was no marina anywhere near the building). Instead, we are in a studio room with one king bed, and without a roll away for our (now really cranky) son. So, I called the front desk. They acted confused and then eventually told me that there had been a mistake and they did not have any Marina Suites left. After I complained some more, they told me they were willing to give me a $50.00 discount off the price of this room for the inconvenience. They also said that the next night we could move into the Marina Suite and if we left our luggage in our room, they would move it for us. Then, I addressed the issue of no rollaway bed for my son. I expressed the fact that he is two, it is late and he needs to go to bed very soon. They told me they would see about getting a bed. I also told them about the trash on the patio and they said they would pick it up. It took about an hour and four phone calls before we eventually got a bed. Also, they did not pick up the trash. The next morning we left to go have fun and came back mid-afternoon. I went to the lobby to collect the keys for our new room. The lobby was full of people checking in and there were about four attendants checking people in. I waited in a long line for about 20 minutes (it was obvious that the couple in front of me were having some issues that were taking a long time to solve). Finally, the attendant finished with the couple in front of me, and then she turned around and walked away without saying anything to me. I waited for about two minutes, as the other lines had grown even larger, and she did not return. The people behind me left for other lines. I went to the concierge and asked if there was anything she could do as I was a current guest, and she said no and that I had to wait in the long lines (again). At this point I was too mad to wait, went out to get my husband, and had him go back in and take care of it. We get to our new room (that looks absolutely nothing like the pictures online) and discovered that one of our suitcases had not made it to our new room. It took two phone calls before someone eventually located our bag and brought it to us. The living room of this suite was very small and very dark. Nothing like the picture online. Also, the bedroom did not have all of the windows that the pictures show. It had one sliding glass door and one very small window. Also, the balcony area was tiny; it was difficult to have even two adults on it. They did end up giving us the room for only $199.00 to make up for the issues. The room service was great, wonderful food, very prompt, very nice staff. Also, when they forgot to bring a rollaway bed to our second room, Courtney the manager brought it to us herself. Very nice. Not worth the price. We ended up spending way too much of our vacation dealing with hotel issues rather than relaxing. This put quite a damper on the vacation and put all of us in a rather bad mood.

Our two 18 year olds loved being within walking distance of Mission Beach and being able to enjoy the pool and workout room. The workout room is perched over the marina with a great view. The hotel is in a nice location but with the exception of Mission Beach, you will need to drive everywhere. The only problems we ran into was that the only adjoining rooms we could get had a king instead of the two queens we had reserved;' they were willing to move us to a lower level with two queen rooms but we decided to stay put and have the higher level rooms with the great view and get a rollaway. The carpets were stained which was surprising considering the hotel was recently renovated; otherwise, though the room was impeccably clean.

My husband and I, along with our 3 children, had a 4 day trip planned for quite some time and we were all really looking forward to it. We've stayed at Hyatts before, always with good experiences. When we go to Kauai we always stay at the Hyatt there and it's beautiful. And after hearing that this property in San Diego had undergone a major renovation, we were really excited. We were expecting a beautiful, clean room and everything we've always experienced in other Hyatts. We stayed in Room 2221 which is a suite facing the marina. The carpet was so filthy we literally would not walk on it in barefeet. And not just in one spot, I'm talking throughout the entire room. Large dark spots from the door through the entire room, a bright orange spot next to the bed. It was really awful. The sliding glass door on the balcony did not lock, no matter how hard we tried. Fortunately our children are old enough that this wasn't a hazard however it would definitely be for anyone with small kids. The shower drained so slowly that we called down to have it cleaned out. After our first night we called down to the desk to ask them to clean our carpets while we were gone and to address the shower drain and the non-locking sliding door. We returned to a room with carpet just as filthy as it was in the first place though they left a card telling us our request for service had been tended to. What? The pool area was nice to look at - clearly has been recently done and has an upscale feel to it. However, i agree with what other people say in that there is definitely not enough seating poolside to accommodate the guests at the hotel. We managed only to snag one chair to pile up our things on, but never could get a lounge chair. My husband and kids went in the jacuzzi and said it was not hot the way a jacuzzi is expected to be. It was just kind of warm. There was a sign in the room advertising the bottled water available for purchase but there was no bottle to be found. Our stay was supposed to be for 3 nights but after 2 I told my husband I wanted to leave. I'd rather have been at home than spend another night in this place. The only good thing is that it's located close to Sea World. What bothered me the most is that when my husband went to check out he told the manager in training all of what I have mentioned above. Of course the actual manager was \"on the phone\" and not available. A good business gesture would have been for her to offer to take some amount off of our bill or something else to show that the customer's opinion matters. I was not looking for her to comp our stay or anything. But she offered nothing and allowed him to check out having spent almost a thousand bucks on this dump. I went back in and took this up with this same girl since the manager was still \"on the phone\". I told her my concerns, how we have been patrons of other Hyatts many times, etc. She again had no intention of offering anything to us until I suggested that maybe they should take off the \"room tax\" they charged us for both nights and maybe take off the fee they charged us for using their Wifi service. She finally conceded and took off - woo hoo- a hundred bucks. How in good consicence were they charging 400 bucks a night for all this?

We have stayed in the marina suites twice (other trip Aug. 07) and have thoroughly enjoyed it. We came in 07 despite rough reviews over the remodeling construction problems and were so glad we did. The nice modern design is perfect for a southern california vacation. It's a clean look with white bed linens, white bolster - comfortable w/ a front room sectional sofa & flat screen tv and then the back bedroom with a desk, flat screen tv, arm chair, and balcony with view of marina - boats literally right out your door. We could hear sea lions but it didn't disturb our sleep. This visit we were supposed to stay in the main hotel in a great room on a higher floor. However our preference is for a lower floor and were given the option to switch to the marina suites ( I think they only go up to 3 floors.) The front desk assured me the original room was better with a great view of the ocean but happy to meet our preferences. Another service plus, during our Aug. 07 trip, we lost the baby's boppy pillow that was a must have for the flight back. A bellman had found it and stored it for us. As well I had a problem with my rental car/parking etc. and realized it while sitting in the restaurant. The staff was incredible & called hotel security for me and helped me while I waited for my lunch. They went out of their way to help me! I ordered a simple burger& fries and it was so good. Great ice tea (I am a native Texan!), great service, and great view - you can see mission bay in the round restaurant with all windows. Like the hotel, the restaurant has a simple modern elegance that is very nice but comfortable as well. Very impressed! While my husband checked in, I steped out the back door to see the renovations completed that we're underway during our last visit. There is a courtyard of cabana like lounging areas etc - it's especially impressive at night with great landscape lighting. The pool looked smaller but nice and I didn't go into the area myself , just looked through the iron fence. The hotel is the perfect blend of elegance and comfort esp. since we've traveled with an infant each time. It is down the street from the Mission Bay board walk and amusement park and the bellman told me there is a trail/path/sidewalk I could stroll the baby from the hotel to mission bay. The afternoon I went to Mission Bay boardwalk, the beach was beautiful blue - a perfect day at the beach.

The whole hotel was recently re-done and looks pretty good. Yes, there are carpet stains. Pool lounge had good food. Einstein's service was awful - the Hyatt should disassociate themselves from them.

Unfortunately when i got to my room i didn't even get the room type i had requested and was told by the girl at the front desk i should have called and confirmed with the hotel that i was on my way. If i knew that I swear i would have never booked with a hotel that so absent-mindedly sold all their ocean view rooms and were banking on the fact that i would not mind the change in room types or view. Not only was my room view type overlooked but also was my bed request. I specifically requested a ocean view corner king for my 1st year anniversary. So after being told that even though i paid for that specific room type I was unfortunately not going to spend my anniversary in the room type i booked, but also i was not going to get a view at all. Actually what i got was a standard room with a view of a parking lot--absolutely what i wanted and paid for. Try explaining paying over $1000 for a weekend that was ruined from the start, to your husband! That was only the beginning. When we got to the room that we had not requested nor booked the room was suppose to have rose petals spread out over the room and also was suppose to have champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. And as you guessed it they weren't in the room at all. I paid an extra $45 dollars for this small added luxury that wasn't in my room nor would they bring it to my room after the whole ordeal. The room obviously was the beginning of the crappy weekend. Along with that the hotel has no amenities especially for the high prices you pay for rooms. You have to pay for internet services and parking services. The food was absolutely horrible. If you order room service the food won't be hot or warm by the time it gets to you. If you sit in the Lounge the waitresses are absolutely rude and brash. Or if you want to go eat a fine dining course in the Red Marlin forget about it. The food wasn't fine dining, nor was it up to scale. I found hair in my food and the waiter messed up our order 3 times. The front desk agents are rude and not willing to help fix any situations. When they tried to get a manager or when i called for a manager i was never able to get them. I had tons of issues with the hotel room such as the shower wouldn't drain and the toilet overflowed to the point it was leaking on the carpet it took 45 minuets for someone to get to the room to fix the problem. Also the Hotel operator lacked any care or speediness in getting the issue s taken care of. I was actually told by the operator that my situation wasn't dire so i could wait until someone was free. They also couldn't move my room due to the fact that they didn't have any more rooms to put us in. Sad to say this was all in the same day i checked in. Finally my husband and I were fed up with the lack of assistance and lack of a real hotel we decided to leave. That was until the desk agent told me that they refused to comp my nights stay because it was 6 o'clock and i would be charged a night's stay anyways. Between the two of us we decided to stay for just the night but we would check out in the morning and into another hotel that obviously is better with their guest and that doesn't have a hotel falling apart even though it claims to be all brand new. Trust me this is not a hotel to stay in if you want to be near activities or shopping. You need a car for all the places the guest services will recommend to you. the beach is about the only thing within walking distance.

Our skepticism grew as we opened the door to our room to find filthy carpeting and bad mildew stains in the bathroom. I went back to the front desk to express my disappointment and asked for a room change. They said they were 100% booked and could not switch my room until the next day (it was after midnight when we arrived). Then the next day they apologized that there was no other rooms available either. Hard to believe...could it be because I was a Hotwire guest who paid $124/night? The room was bare bones -- not even an alarm clock!! Had to pay for internet. Upon complaining they gave me a free breakfast coupon for their restaurant and when we went there the next day found it was only for two. Had to pay for the children which made our total with tax & tip come to $40!! That was for a very mediocre-buffet. The grounds are nice but the beach is not easily accessible. Hotwire calls this \"oceanfront\" which it most definitely is not. The pool are was extremely crowded and the waterslides have limited hours. I have stayed in a lot of Best Westerns that are much nicer. Hyatt should remove their name from this property. By the way, it is the same hotel as the Hyatt Islandia.

We had stayed at the Marriott Marina Hotel Downtown, (an excellent choice), and knew a big convention was coming in to town so decided to move north to The Hyatt Regency Mission Bay. We were very disappointed in our choice of this Hyatt. We had read they had just finished a multi-million dollar remodel of the hotel and were looking forward to our stay. When we first drove up we could not figure out where the front of the hotel was. There is a tower which we thought would be where the lobby was located but instead, it was in a separate section which looked like an old motel. There were a couple of these motel-like buildings surrounding the tower. Knowing that we had gotten a cheaper rate which meant we would be in the motel rooms with no view, we elected to upgrade to a tower room. Upon arriving to the room which was on the 7th Floor I could hear screaming kids. I looked out of the sliding glass doors to see what was going on and found the view of the ocean which is what I had paid extra for was also the view of the pool which had at least 75 screaming kids in it having a good time sliding down water slides and swimming. The average kids age was about 6 and they were squealing with excitement running everywhere. We normally like to sit on our balcony, have a drink and enjoy the scenery, but that would not be happening in that room. Even with the doors closed you could still hear the noise coming from the pool. I called down to the desk and requested a change of rooms away from the \"view\" that we upgraded to and away from the pool. We were given a room on the 10th floor which had a view of the Marina and the freeways. We were glad to get away from the kid noise but now had the highway racetrack noise to enjoy. We couldn't believe the room had been remodeled. The only thing we could tell that had been changed was the addition of a flat screen TV, and the sink and shower in the bathroom had been changed. The walls had cheap wallpaper on them that had already been scuffed up by people's suitcases, the lounging area consisted of a cheap, modern looking L-shaped couch with no arm rests, the carpet was a thin cheap material which was already stained, the glass doors to the patio were filthy, the sheets had stains on them and we found long black hairs in the shower. The hotel advertises coffee makers but I had to call down to request one. The next day we were not given any additional coffee so had to call down and ask for more. Room Service prices were more expensive than the Marriott Downtown so we did not use it. We tried to get a spot at the pool but it was continually crowded with parents and their small children. When we did get a spot, we could not relax with all the noise. We thought if we got some drinks it would help make the noise more tolerable, but when we tried, we found out the bar/snack bar was not open. Seems they have special hours, and when they are open you have to go in an get everything yourself, no pool service. We ate our last night's dinner at the hotel's restaurant, The Red Marlin, and with their higher prices it kept most of the large families away. We had an enjoyable quiet meal with drinks, a shared appetizer, salads and a main course of tuna. The problem there was that the waitress brought out our main course before our salads. We then had to wait for the salads to be prepared and she assured us they would cook us new tuna. Don't know if they did or not. The moral of this experience is that this is a \"family hotel\" and we wished we had a way to know that before we booked. We didn't realize it was so close to Seaworld which is probably why it was full of families. Even without the kids I wouldn't stay here due to the low quality of the rooms. I guess with so many kids going through this place the \"remodel\" only lasted a week or so.

The rooms are clean and the beds are comfy. The balcony overlooking the pool area and the Bay was beautiful.... the rollercoaster at Belmont Park was in the distance.... kids thought that was cool too. The Pool area was phenomenal! The kids had an absolute blast! Hot tub was not working when we first got there but 2 of the pools were warm so it was just fine. Plenty of fluffy navy blue towels. lots of families there over Spring break but it was fairly quiet. The one negative that could keep us from returning was that the planes flying overhead were quite loud... up until around 11pm and then picked back up around 6am. If it doesn't bother you then the place is fantastic. We have a 2 year old who likes a cup of milk close to bedtime and their little shop was out of milk. The girl mentioned room service or going to the Swim Bar/Lounge and we figured it might be cheaper and faster to just go to Swim. Well when the waitress came back to me with a plastic cup of milk and a bill for $4+tax I swallowed hard and handed her a five dollar bill. I can buy a gallon of organic milk for that! YIKES! When I mentioned it to the girl in the shop she apologized and said if we needed milk for the rest of our stay she would direct us to a Longs Pharmacy to get a fair price since their shipment wasn't coming in till friday! We know for next time to bring those boxed milks for the kiddos. Our little one got sick overnight and we had to check out early. The front desk apologized and charged us for the one night and gave us no trouble for cutting our trip short. All the staff we encountered were very nice and friendly. It was fun while it lasted and for the pool area alone we may just have to come back (our 6 year old was already asking if we could this summer).... maybe a room lower down wouldn't be as noisy with the planes??? We were up on the 15th floor!

Each day I spent there, I liked the place more and more! Check-in was flawless - there were parking attendants and bellhops at the ready immediately upon our arrival. Inside the lobby, there were 3 desk attendants who were assisting with check-ins and other guest requests. Initially I was disappointed to find that our room was located in \"The Suites\" building, which is a small, 3-story, motel-like building located to the side of the main hotel. My concerns were put aside the second I stepped into the room. The door opened to a spacious living room area, that was tastefully decorated and included a large, flat-screened t.v. and a sectional couch with a pull-out bed. Separating the living area and the sleeping area was a hallway containing a mini-refrigerator, a dresser, a closet with double sliding mirrored doors and a large, very clean bathroom. I am pretty certain that some of the reviews I read indicated that the bathrooms had showers only, no bathtubs. That was not the case with the room I had. It had a bathtub/shower combination. The sleeping area had 2 queen sized beds, with plenty of pillows and crisp linens. The beds were firm and comfortable. There was a t.v. on the desk, along with internet hook-up (which was a paid service - $10/24 hr., I think). The nightstand had an I-Home that doubled as a radio-alarm clock. There was also a chair and ottoman in the bedroom. There were sliding glass doors which led to a small deck overlooking the marina. The glass doors allowed for plenty of light to enter the room, but were easily darkened with curtains when necessary. Overall, the room was clean, secure and quiet. The loudest and most common noise was the sound of luggage wheels on the walkways. That noise was apparent from the living room, but I don't recall having heard it from the bedroom at all. There were occasional noises from the marina, but nothing to complain about. The pool area was fantastic! The outdoor temps were in the low 60s during my stay, but the pools were heated to a nice temperature and when I got chilly, I sat in the hot tub to warm up. The water slides are an excellent addition to the pool! The slides are attended by a hotel employee / lifeguard at all times - the slides were closed occasionally for breaks and closed for the night at dusk. The 2 big water slides open into a medium-sized pool that had a walk-out ramp at the end opposite the slides - this was the coldest of the 3 pools, but the water slides were such a distraction that I barely noticed how much cooler the water was in this pool compared to the other 2. There was a smaller water slide which opened into the smallest of the 3 pools - this pool was warmer than the other slide pool. The largest pool did not have water slides and it was a bit deeper and a bit warmer than the other 2 pools. The hot tub was roomy and a nice break from the cool outside air. I found the pool towels to be plentiful (and warm!) and restocked every day. There also appeared to be waitress service on the pool deck. I didn't use this service, but it appeared as if orders placed at Swim Lounge were delivered poolside if requested. I did not eat at Swim Lounge, so I can not comment on the service there. I did, however, eat at Red Marlin - 3 times! The service and food at Red Marlin were excellent! It was pricey, as expected at a nice hotel restaurant, but the presentation and flavor of the food made it worth the cost. I would place Red Marlin in a fine dining category. Having said that, it was very accommodating toward my young daughter. There was a children's menu and my daughter was treated like a princess by everyone at the restaurant. All of the food I had there was excellent and, overall, it was a very nice place to dine. The hotel staff appeared to try very hard to make for a pleasant stay. Every time I was in the lobby, the desk was staffed by 3 or 4 attendants, including a concierge. The concierge was very helpful in making local recommendations, making reservations, and providing driving directions. I utilized this service numerous times during my stay. The cleaning staff was also very pleasant and meticulous. Because self-parking was so convenient to where my room was located, I did not use the valet service. The only \"issue\" I had during my entire stay was trying to find the exercise facility. It was listed in the hotel directory as being on the 2nd floor of the tower. It was actually located right off of the marina, behind \"The Suites.\" It was not fun running from building to building in the driving rain - at 5:30 in the morning - trying to locate this facility. The facility itself is typical of a hotel exercise room - a few treadmills, a stationary bike, some weight machines - but with a beautiful view of the marina and harbor. In closing, this hotel is conveniently and beautifully located. It was very easy to drive anywhere I needed to go. I would definitely stay at the Hyatt Regency Mission Bay in the future!", "Date": "February 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Springs, California", "Title": "\u201cNot a Fav\u201d", "Author": "leclaire68", "ReviewID": "UR13798469", "Content": "This was my first stay at this property and I probably won't choose to return. Overall it was adequate, but there were some issues that I consider to be important when finding lodging. First, let me say that I was in one of the Bay wings (two story wings beside the tower). I'm not sure what the tower rooms are like and this review only reflects my experience with a room in the wings. The room has been somewhat recently renovated. It's too bad, though, that the carpet was a bit stained in my room (1916). It is also unfortunate that when they updated these rooms (and I think they did a pretty bang-up job on the overall renovation) that they didn't remove the popcorn texture from the ceilings. It makes it look dated. Overall positives: Great furnishings as part of the renovation, including LCD TV; comfy bed; lots of light from slider; interesting room design. Issues: Noise was a big issue for me here and I'm generally not a light sleeper. I heard TVs on both sides of my room very clearly. I also had a \"heavy walker\" above me and I was pretty amazed at how clearly I could hear that walking back and forth. Mission Bay is close to the flight path for SAN, too, so there was some aircraft noise. An additional noise source was the heating system. This, clearly, was not updated in the renovations. It looked ancient and made a big ker-bang every time it shut off. It jolted me awake a couple times. The location is great only if you have transportation of your own. I did ... and found the location to be fine. The noise issues, alone, would probably steer me away from this property.

The hotel has just completed a $65M renovation. The room was beautiful with a small balcony. Plenty of privacy to sit and enjoy the view. Large room, nice comfortable bed with great linens and pillows. Wonderful flat screen TV. The pools area is lush and tropical.

But if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening, how can you avoid it? The Regency branding is supposed to indicate a luxury resort and setting, but staying at this Hyatt in November 2007, with their renovation running five months late, only the setting part was even mildly luxurious. This hotel comprises both a main high-rise tower and some low-rise marina-side accommodation. At the time we stayed there the main lobby wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t built, and the only place for breakfast, apart from expensive room service, was the Swim Cafe, a pool-side snack bar intended to serve pool-users. The choice was absolutely minimal and self-service. The pools themselves were not in use, as their renovation hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite completed either. Our marina view king room was fine in itself - spacious, light and airy, if a little minimalist on the decor. The view was good with a sunny balcony. Our bathroom lacked a tub, and the shower ran water that was tepid at its warmest. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public facilities were just non-existent. There were no lounges or other public spaces available. The hotel was largely occupied by business convention groups, who dominated the place. One group were selling a gothic teen clothing brand, and their delegates ate from a mobile kitchen around the back of the hotel, and were a frequent site coming and going, wearing hoodies, drinking beer in the elevators, and generally acting like extras in a bad teen movie. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure this hotel will be better when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s renovated, but from the layout and situation I doubt it will ever be great. The location on the marina is nice, and if proximity to Flipper is your overriding factor, then you will be close to Sea World. But the limitations of the architecture will never make for a wonderful hotel, renovated or not. How Hyatt have the nerve to sell rooms in a hotel with so few of the facilities working is beyond me, and sell those rooms at full price too. I felt it was worth only half what we paid given the state of the place, and were thankful we had only a two-night stay pre-paid.

We chose ocean view and were given a room on the 8th floor in the tower. The room was renovated recently and it looks pretty much like the pictures on their website. Note though that there is only a shower, no tub, and the ocean view was nice but there are planes taking off nearby. The beds were crisp and comfy. Our only complaint was that there were some stains on the carpet, and the $18 fee for self-parking was steep. Overall the property looks really good now that renovations are for the most part complete (there seems to be some work going on still, but we didn't hear any noise). Don't mistake this Hyatt for a full- scale resort though; it definitely is a smaller property that doesn't impress on a grand scale. The lobby is located in a small hut-like structure, and they obviously cut some corners during renovations (the hallways and room doors seemed to have just received a new coat of paint and not much else). Overall though it is an excellent choice if you can get a good price-- it's clean, has a good location, has impressive ocean/marina views, and undoubtedly has recouped its 4-star quality, but the rack rates of $200+ are a bit high for what you get.", "Date": "February 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "alberta!", "Title": "\u201cvery mediocre\u201d", "Author": "mickeeAlberta", "ReviewID": "UR13040697", "Content": "We stayed to attend a conference and found that there was no restaurant which was mentioned in the confrimation sent by the hotel.

The renovations are nearly complete and did not impact on our stay. The issue to be considered when choosing this hotel is geography. The hotel is used for conferences and trade gatherings, and if you are planning to attend such an event the hotel is prefect. If, however, you are visiting San Diego as a tourist then you need to consider the following. The hotel is within walking distance of Sea World (15 minutes) and Belmont Park Amusements and Pacific Beach (25 minutes). It is, however, a fair way out of San Diego city. If you are intending to hire a car, then its location is not too much of an issue. If you are not, however, you will need to catch a bus (No.9) and then the trolloy bus (blue line) to get to San Diego city, which can take 40 minutes. Around the hotel there is also a paucity of restaurants and hardly any shops. Popping out to the local drugstore is a non-starter as there is not one anywhere near. To sum up if at a conference, or looking to spend some time at Sea World or Pacific Beach then this hotel is fine.

Some would know this place as the former Hyatt Islandia. Right now it's a torn-up mess. If you are interested in a normal hotel stay, this is not the place to come for a while. It's torn up, spread out, inconvenient, and many amenities are either lacking or a pain to use. Think of it more as an apartment near some restaurants and you get the idea. A few examples: If you want to swim, you can be taken 3/4 of a mile by van to a private athletic club. It's neither convenient nor capable of being anything other than an excursion--although they will take and pick you up on demand. No easy independence for anyone in your group. You have to plan to take everything you will need with you. Forget something and ..... The hotel has decided to allocate about 95% of the surface parking for their extra-price valet parking. There are VERY few spots left for anyone who doesn't want to pay that fee, yet 80% of the valet spots are VACANT. There is additional \"self-park\" across a road. Guest-friendly? You decide. If you stay in the tower you are going to walk a fairly short distance with wooden siding hiding the construction areas on one side because you have to walk around the back to get to the elevators to your room. There has been no noticeable construction noise but we are on the other side of the hotel. It's hard to convey the feeling one gets during the walk, but in summary it's not a good feeling. There isn't a trash can in sight. Period. Not inside, not outside. Not in the hotel hallways, not anywere. If you want to dispose of any litter, well....good luck. They installed new built-in furniture in the room and there is a built-in set of electric plugs on the vertical wall that is part of the desk unit. Unfortunately when they spec'd the placement of the electric/computer plugs, they set the box too low on the wall and many cell phone chargers and other chargers cannot be plugged in because the charger power unit can only be plugged in one direction and there's no room for the charger plug to fit in and be electrified. There is nothing in the room tower but rooms. No lobby, no real service (there is a small gift shop, however). If you want to go to the lobby or desk, you go out the back of the tower, walk around the multi-story tower, walk across the parking lot and in another building. It's more like staying in a really tall motel that's spread out without any cohesiveness. To get to the hotel none (not ONE) of the guiding signs off I-5 /I-8 say anything but \"Hyatt Islandia\"and that is not where you think you are staying. The current name isn't anywhere, even when you are right next to the hotel. It's confusing and ridiculous. We stopped at the hotel for directions from what we thought was a sister property, only to find out that the signage was all wrong and we were at the hotel. That's inexcusable and an example of inattention to guest needs, poor planning and poor management. There are some good/neutral points: The employees have obviously been trained, trained, trained to be \"cheerful\" during the renovations. The rooms have some size to them (at least in the tower) and the bathrooms are reasonably sized. The televisions are decent or better. Summary: \"usually\" we enjoy Hyatts and we've stayed at a lot of them. The overall quality is generally higher than many other mid-market chains.

Hyatt also provides an excellent water taxi service to Sea World! It's a 15 minute boat ride, to the back entrance, NO LINES to wait in, you can't get any better than that! It's only $1 per person for round trip, sure beats the heck out of $10.00 parking.

I was there for a conference, and the Islandia was one of the hotels used to house convention registrants. This was one of the most disappointing and inconvenient hotel stays I've had in a long, long time. Let me say at the outset that the staff of the Islandia were unfailingly courteous and friendly. No doubt the conditions at the Islandia have been extremely difficult for them. No, this is a prime example of very, very poor management, reflective of a genuine contempt for their guests. The Islandia is basically a construction site with rooms, not a functioning hotel. Let me detail some of the inconveniences: 1. The construction noise -- and it is quite loud -- starts very early in the morning. My room was so noisy that I couldn't even hold a phone conversation. I had to ask to use a courtesy room during the afternoon to do some work. (There are no common areas or rooms because of the construction. No open areas, no nothin'!) 2. I did not bring a laptop, figuring I could access e-mail through the hotel business center or TV Internet. Wrong!!! Of course, whatever business center previously existed is now part of the construction site. The TV Internet did not work in my room or in the courtesy room I used one afternoon. 3. The one small available restaurant on site was so packed in the morning that I had to order room service and spend extra money to do so. Of course, I could've made a L-O-N-G walk to the hotel across the highway, given that I didn't rent a car, but I decided to splurge on room service instead. 4. Guests received a note under their doors informing us that on Tuesday, May 22, there would be NO WATER for most of the day because of \"emergency\" repairs. 5. The next day we received another letter under our doors, instructing us that locks were being changed and we MUST report to the front desk to get new key cards. 6. The hotel site is dirty and cramped. After checking into a makeshift check-in desk, you walk outside with your bags, following a dirty \"red carpet\" (Hah--how ironic!) that takes you through part of the construction site, scaffolding and all, to an elevator bank that takes you right to your room. 7. There appears to be absolutely no acknowledgement on the part the hotel management that this is such an inconvenient and unpleasant place to stay. The letters they give to guests, explaining once inconvenience or another, are written in a sort of insulting, insincere \"happy speak,\" as if they were informing us that some minor amenity, such as mints left on your pillow, could not be provided.

The bedspread was not only covered in stains, it had large areas of encrusted chunky material embedded in it! I took all sorts of photos with my cell phone camera, stormed down to the manager, and demanded my money back. They were nice, although a bit hesitant--until I showed them the photos. Then they were willing to give me anything I wanted. What I wanted was to never stay in a hotel again.

The wife and I decided to have a \"weekend-getaway\" to San Diego and chose the Hyatt mostly due to it's location to Sea World and a place called MIssion Beach where we were to meet up with a few friends. We had a most delightful time and the Hyatt played a major part. So here are the pluses for us followed by some notes that others might feel could have an impact on their staying here: 1) We checked in at 3PM not realizing the check-in time is 4PM but were still given a room right away by a very polite desk clerk. 2) Our room was just what we asked for(Ocean view with a balcony) and it fit our needs. The size was perfect for us and the bed was sooooo comfortable. We slept very well not only due to the bed but we were perhaps lucky that we had quiet neighbors as we only heard the sounds coming from the Bay area. All in all, we appreciated what we were given. 3) The pool and jacuzzi were very nice. Towels were readily available as was cocktail service. Though we were there on a weekend, we had no trouble finding a lounge chair or room in the jacuzzi. 4) We had breakfast included in our plan. I can't say it was the best ever but having stayed at other Hyatts, it was just what we expected. For the uninitiated, the buffet and service is acceptable, no less, no more. My wife though was pleasantly surprised that the smoked salmon she had the morning she opted out of the buffet was better than expected. 5)The hotel sells Sea World tickets for about $6 less than when you buy at the park itself. But verify with the concierge about specials at Sea World. She pointed out to us that they were having a AAA special and the tickets were even cheaper so I am glad this was pointed out. 6) Overall, this place was just fine and the weekend price we paid of about $235 per night(incl. breakfast) seemed to be in line with what that gets you anywhere on a summer weekend in San Diego. Now some notes that I guess might make this place less-than-perfect for some of you a. No shuttle to Sea World. We were surprised we had to drive considering the location is the reason so many choose to stay here. b. Our room had a shower stall only. For two adults, it was fine but with small children it might be good to verify beforehand. c. Parking lot fills up, especially if there is a special event in one of the halls. Be ready to do some searching for spots unless you like valet. The charge is $14 per night, a little more for valet Also note the spaces are spaced more for compact cars. Be careful entering and backing out of spots, not much room between rows. d. One couple remarked their balcony on the marina side was closed due to some remodeling going on. It did not impact us. e. I see some reviews talking about the hotel being dated. A person we know from there thinks the place may have been around since the late 60's or very early 70's so it seeming dated would not be surprising. Fortunately, everything in our room was clean and in working order so the age of the building had no impact on us.

We chose this hotel for it's close location to Sea World and we couldn't have been happier. It was literally 3 minutes from the park. The staff was wonderful and very accomodating. The rooms were okay - not brand new but nice. We stayed in the main hotel - not the high rise rooms. Everything was fine except mid-june the humidity was brutal. It was way to cold for swimming - anything below 80 degrees is too cold for us (we live in Arizona). It was nice to be so close to the park, it made leaving mid afternoon to head back to the hotel for naps not a big ordeal. We chose to have room service for breakfast in order to avoid getting out early and fighting any crowds for breakfast. Food was excellant. Portions were HUGE. The second morning my hubby and I split one breakfast between us. The girls had pancakes which were out of this world. Room service is a little pricey but if you balance not having to leave and drive around the area to find somewhere it's pretty nice. Sea World was GREAT! We arrived as the park opened at 9am - I suggest getting there the earlier the better. All the animals are awake and being fed. You will not have to fight the crowds to see the exhibits. We ate at the ShipWreck Cafe for lunch and dinner. Great food - huge portions. For those with little ones - bring juice boxes - beverages are at least $2.65 and little ones tend not to drink a full size drink. My husband and I both had Cheeseburgers and they were great. Hand made patties - not frozen - with all the fixins. Huge portion of fries. Carrot cake was delicious. Best theme park food I have ever had. They also had salmon, a variety of salads, jumbayla, and chicken. We left the park around noon - came back at around 4pm to see some shows and wait for the fireworks. The Shamu show was great. But as in past reviews do not attempt to sit ANYWHERE in the soak zone. You will get SOAKED. Cold salt water. Not fun. We avoided that area. It's more appropriate for older kids that won't mind getting dumped on. The dolpin show was great. All shows run about 20 minutes so they aren't too long and can keep little one's attention. Lots of hands on exhibits for the kids. Stingrays, dolphins, and starfish. Finally the fireworks... they were a nice end to the day. The only hard part is sticking around to see them. Most of the animals are sleeping or mellowing out after a long day - so it was a little boring for the kids.

I booked 3 nights but cancelled the last night because we didn't see any purpose in staying. The hotel has a 17 story tower and a 3 story marina building (all suites). We stayed in a Jr. suite in the tower(14th floor). The view was great and the room was large with a balcony overlooking the marina and windows on the side looking south, down the coast. The room itself was nice enough but a little stark. If you elect to stay in one of the marina suites, be careful....there are two marina building right in front of them, partially or completely blocking the view of some of them. Make sure you get a room on the third floor, either in the middle of the building or at the very ends. We actually had a great time but not really because of the Hotel. It was OK, but I expected better. It's a little run down and in need of a face lift. Actually, they are in the middle of renovating the place, which brings me to my biggest gripe.... When I booked the room, I asked allot of questions about the rooms, their location, which ones had the best view etc. At no time did the guy tell me they were jack hammering and grinding away on both sides of the hotel tower, where our room was. This was a little annoying but we were not in the room much so it wasn't that big of a deal. The pool was nice, although it was a little hard to relax with all the noise. We ate dinner at the Islandia Coastal Grill, which was good, but not fantastic. We got a full breakfast with our room and that was probably the best part about our stay. The service at the Blue Ray restaurant was a little slow on the first day but the food was outstanding. My wife said the pancakes were the best she had ever had. My omelets were real good too. So, like I said, it was just an OK place but we still had a great time. I would suggest waiting 'till the construction is over before staying there though.

Our frustration was that we hadn't known that there was a $14.00 a night self parking charge, or a $16.00 a night valet parking charge. The room was clean, it had a small table with 2 sturdy wicker type chairs, a small couch and coffee table, a dresser that the tv sat on, the king sized bed and 2 night stands. The room had a small patio area with a table and 2 chairs that you could access thru your door, or you could use a sliding glass door that was pretty much right next to your door. The nice thing about the sliding glass door was that we could open it, and kind of air out the room. It smelled a little old, not bad, just old. The room had vertical blinds in the room and someone had pulled off some of the decorative paper on a few of them. Disapointing visualy, but still an ok room.

When I first set the thermostat at 75 and left the room for a couple hours, I returned and the temperature was a toasty, er frigid 65 degrees.

Room was big and bed was comfortable, though I'd have liked a real blanket, not a thin flannel rag between two top sheets (weird -- yes there was also a bottom sheet), covered with an old bedspread that felt greasy -- maybe that's the purpose of the extra top sheet, to buffer your face from the germy bedspread.

Good water pressure in the shower, comfortable beds and a balcony with an awesome view of the marina and the bay...you could even see the downtown skyline. We were on the 7th floor of the tower. From what I could see, the tower was the place to be. The marina rooms looked like a Motel 6. The pool was supposedly heated but I didn't get in because it was chilly everyday we were there. Although I saw a few brave souls swimming everyday. The complex was nice. Almost like a resort. There were bunny rabbits all over the place! Service was good. Everyone was very helpful. The fitness room was adequate for what I needed...again nothing special. You have to pay $11 a day for parking so don't be surprised about that. I travel a lot and it's not really all that uncommon. The best thing was the location. It was right on the water...not on the beach, but it was too cold to spend too much time on the beach anyway. For some awesome views drive up Mission Bay Blvd till it turns into La Jolla Blvd and get out anywhere. Breathtaking views of the ocean and the multi-million dollar homes there. Also worth seeing is of course the zoo, although not as impressive as I expected, and the Torrey Pines Reserve was great for hiking. Talk about awesome views.

When we checked in, we were informed that we had been given an 'upgrade' from the junior suite that we had booked to a marina suite. Initially, we were pleased at this turn of events until we realised that we were walking in the opposite direction from the tower (which apparently, is more modern and well maintained) when being shown to our suite. Our hearts sank. The first thing I noticed about the suite was how dark it was. Anytime we were in it, we had to have all of the lights on all of the time, even though there were numerous windows around the suite. In the bathroom, we could barely see anything at all! It was clear that the suite and indeed the hotel in general, badly needs updating. The decor is dated, the bathroom in particular needs ripping out and replacing and the door to enter the suite was so old, that if you leant against it from the outside, you could nearly force your way in which didn't make it feel very safe. We were also very disappointed to find that the suite had no safe. I would have thought in almost any room of this supposed grading (absolutely not 4*) let alone a suite, a safe would have been a basic amenity. We found it very inconvenient to have to continually make trips to the front desk to use a safety deposit box. The high point of the suite though, was the beautiful view of the marina. We were a bit concerned it might be noisy being so close to it, but it didn't bother us once. The grounds of the hotel were pleasant and well maintained, particularly the area containing the koi pond, which many people have pointed out. In terms of food, we had a very mixed experience at the hotel. We were given vouchers to use for breakfast which could be used either at Blue Bay Bistro or for room service, so we did both. We had one good room service breakfast (corned beef hash) which was nice but ordered pancakes on another day which were literally the most vile thing we have ever tasted. They were burnt and tasted like they'd been made with salt instead of sugar because they had the most awful sour and bitter taste. No matter how much we drowned them in syrup, they were clearly inedible and I couldn't physically swallow a scrap of them. Similarly, we had one good breakfast in Blue Bay Bistro when we ordered from the menu and another that was awful when we chose the buffet. The food had all clearly been sat there for a while. It was soggy and luke warm and for some reason, one of the servers forced a bowl of biscuits and gravy onto me (we don't have that in the UK so I didn't really fancy it for breakfast) which I found bizarre and bewildering. I don't know whether the buffet is always of that quality or whether they took their eye off the ball because it was a Sunday when they have a champagne brunch at Islandia restaurant, but it did no-one any favours. The Islandia restaurant itself (which I understand is only open certain days which I found a bit strange) we enjoyed very much. We were seated at a lovely window table overlooking the marina and found our server to be very polite, kind and helpful. The food was plentiful and of good quality. We found the location of the hotel to be OK, obviously paricularly for SeaWorld but we ended up spending a lot to get taxis to various other places and in hindsight, it may have been better for our particular needs to have stayed in the downtown area instead. Also, the hotel is next to a busy road and I did find that the noise bothered me from time to time. We made use of the concierge's services by booking some attraction tickets and a day excursion with her and we found her to be helpful and pleasant. We were collected at the right times, had no problems with the tickets and found everything ran smoothly. The staff in general, we found to be a mixed bag themselves. Some were very helpful and polite particularly the servers, concierge and bellhops but others, especially on the front desk, seemed to have an attitude. Upon checking out, we were given a bill for 4 nights spent in the suite. We pointed out that it was already paid for and had handed over a voucher saying as much, when we checked in. This turned into an argument for a few minutes as the girl was adament that we hadn't. It actually became quite embarrassing and we started to worry that we were going to have to pay again. She then flounced off, saying she would get a manager and returned a few minutes later, agreeing that we had paid but blamed our travel company (who we have used numerous time and are always impeccable). We didn't receive an apology.

A downside that I would see is that fact that the resort hosts many conferences, so all the people in suits and big name tags, walking around all day, kind of ruins the resortish feel of the place.", "Date": "October 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Royal Oak, MI", "Title": "\u201cWonderful, beautiful, accomodating, comfortable Hotel!

We left the horrible Tower 23 Hotel after one night and had decided, basically 4 hours after arriving there, that we weren't staying. We drove the coast toward Sea World where we were visiting the next day and saw the Hyatt. We expected them not to have a room available, but explained our predicament of being out-of-town on our Honeymoon and finding our current hotel to be much less fabulous that we were led to believe. The front desk attendant, Cory, said they had a beautiful suite available and even upgraded us to an ocean view! The grounds are absolutely beautiful! There is a koi pond with a bridge next to the very large pool and big jacuzzi. All of these look out over the marina into the bay. We had the sunset from our balcony every night! The concierge was so helpful and pleasant (thanks, Rhonda!). Make sure you stay in the tower, the views are the best and we received a really great rate (thier standard, but less than I would have expected for such a nice hotel). Room service was quick and very accomodating, the Blue Bay restaurant and staff were wonderful and friendly. The food was great too! The main restaurant on the property is only open Wed-Sat(?), but it was ok (we liked the Blue Bay better!) This hotel is also very close to the expressway, but not OBVIOUSLY on top of it. I had no idea how close we were to the entrance to go to downtown and all the attractions we wanted to go to until we started driving. We felt like we were in a secluded, tropical paradise everyday and night we came 'home' after our adventures to Sea World, Gaslamp Quarter for dinner, Coronodo Island, the Midway, the HMS Surprise (both by the Maritime Meuseum in Sandiego), the Sandiego Zoo, etc.... We were basically 15 minutes from anything we wanted to do. The hotel was extremely clean and there weren't a lot of noisy children running around (which appeals to us since we don't have any) My husband and I stayed on the 7th floor in a corner junior suite and we loved it. The room was very well appointed and extremely spacious! Obviously, I can't say enough good things about this hotel. Don't miss the chance to stay here if you're in town. Thank you to all the staff who made our honeymoon perfect without overdoing the whole 'honeymoon thing' (we are kind of discrete people). We will see you next year on our one year anniversary!

We got a couple of connecting rooms in the Hyatt Islandia using one of the online services. I was a little nervous after reading the uneven reviews of this facility. The stay was okay. There was nothing out of the ordinary--rooms were more like a Sheraton and less like a Hyatt in my opinion. Our rooms were in the Garden Terrace units, a two story structure that faces the highway and is hidden in the photo on the Hyatt Islandia website. So our view was facing the highway and noisy only if the windows were open. To get to our rooms, you go upstairs from the lobby and go through a door which opens to an outdoor hallway. It reminded me of the casual lanai setting of hotels in Hawaii. The rooms were pretty average but at least the bathrooms were updated and relatively clean and nice with granite tiles. We had breakfast and dinner (not a wide selection) at one of the restaurants (Blue something). It was pretty standard fare for hotels and we received the best service at the hotel at breakfast time. We tried to go to the other restaurant for dinner but it was only opened from Weds to Sun. The pool is nice and full of kids. There is also a hot tub and bar within the pool surround. This hotel is next to a harbor and there is a harbor walkway that extends along the water. The hotel parking was across the street at $11/day. Printing of boarding passes were $3/pass even for Hyatt Club members since computer access is provided by a third party vendor.

This Hyatt is in a great location near Sea World and close to Mission Bay/Beach, however, it is not typical of a Hyatt resort in its quality and is better classified as a 3-start resort. As others have said the two low-rise motel-style structures are not even up to 3-start quality. We stayed in one our first night and while they boast upgraded bath rooms (marble, tile, etc.), carpet, bet, etc. - they are constructed of wood and are quite old. You hear everything including your neighbors upstairs, next door, outside, etc. We asked to be moved to the Tower for the rest of our stay and they are better and much quieter, although they are also quite dated with acoustic (popcorn) ceilings, slightly moldy shower grouting, etc. I got the room during Summer-peak for $180/night through Priceline which is a crime. I would not pay more than $100/night for this facility if I had a choice, but the Summer rates go up quite a bit. They were advertising the room for $300/night on Hyatt.com which is absolutely absurd. The hotel staff is just okay - certainly not as accommodating as the typical Hyatt standard. The onsite restaurant (Blue something or other) was quite good and the service was great; I recommend it. Pool facilities are pretty good and they have a bar there. Lots of kids so if you don't like them it might not be your scene. For a great breakfast place with casual street side dining and excellent food checkout the Boardwalk Bistro/Cafe in Mission Beach.

We booked through Priceline and paid $100 a night (darned per diems!), which was fair, but I would say that the hotel is not worth any more than that. It was very quiet, and not bad, but not the 4-star property they claim to be either. Rooms B The room itself was okay, a pretty standard 3 star room, with a very tiny bathroom. The bathroom did have marble countertops, but that does not a 4-star make. I do have to say that they did a great job with the lighting\u00e2\u20ac\u201dso often hotel rooms do not have enough lamps and/or overheads, but our room here was very well lit. There was a very small balcony with a couple of metal chairs and a tiny plastic table. We did enjoy the fact that we could see the fireworks (put on by neighboring Seaworld, I believe) from the balcony. We did not enjoy the fact that our room (we were either on the 3rd or 4th floor) was directly over the area where they have the dumpsters, making being on the deck hard on the olfactory glands! ). I normally would have asked to switch rooms, but we were exhausted by the time we got there, and it just did not seem worth the effort for one night. If you are planning to stay here, I would recommend asking for a room on a high floor, with a view of the marina (we had a bit of one, but it was heavily obstructed by HVAC systems or similar equipment Service A The valets were very friendly, check in was quick and courteous, and the bellhops were also nice as can be. We had dinner at the Blue Bay California Bistro at the base of the main tower, and our waiter was quite friendly and brought our food out very quickly. There were only about 2 other parties in the restaurant at the time, so not sure if it would always be that quick, but hopefully so! Restaurants B+ I was disappointed to see that the Islandia bar and restaurant was closed during our stay. We asked and were told that it is only open for dinner Wed-Sat, and for Sunday brunch (we were there on a Sunday night). It is the more upscale of the two restaurants at the hotel, and looks out directly onto the marina. The dinner we had at the California Bistro was actually delicious, though, so we were pleased with that \u00ef\ufffd\u0160 They have a pretty basic menu of sandwiches, burgers, salads, etc, but very fresh ingredients are used, making the sandwiches we had quite tasty. Bars C If the Islandia Bar had been open during our stay, this category would probably have gotten a much higher score. It looked spacious and pleasant, with (I believe) a seating area out on the deck where you can relax and enjoy the sunset or the lights of the marina. But, again, this was closed, so the only other bar option was a very small, dark, depressing one at the base of the tower. We walked in and pretty much walked right back out\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit just had sort of a grim atmosphere. Pool/Grounds B- The grounds are kept clean, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small koi pond, which was nice, and the landscaping is well maintained. But nothing particularly spectacular here. The pool itself was not at all impressive\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsmall and very basic, surrounded by a fence which tends to take away from the overall look of the grounds. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure they have to have the fence up for liability purposes, though, since many families stay here. There is also a tiny (maybe 20 feet by 15 feet) manmade \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd right off the marina. Be forewarned: this is not an actual beach, but more of a dirty sandbox. If you want to lay in some sand, I would recommend the Hotel Del Coronado or even the La Valencia in La Jolla (just up the hill from a bit of beach) instead. Location Depends If you are planning on spending a lot of time at Seaworld, the location probably cannot be beat! The location is also pretty much equidistant to La Jolla and Coronado, among other areas, so if you want someplace where you are 30-40minutes from nearly everything, this may be a good choice for you. If you are just planning on spending most of your time in downtown/Old Town/Coronado (for example), though, this hotel is probably not the best option. There are also no restaurants within walking distance, which can be a problem when they only have one restaurant open. If you want something different, your options are to order room service (pretty much the same menu as the Cali Bistro) or to get in the car and drive a little ways away (not always appealing when you are exhausted from traveling!) Overall, this is a decent hotel, just not quite up to the standards of a 4-star property, in my opinion. If you can get it for around $100 a night, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want anything fancy (or want to be very close to SeaWorld but not anywhere else), it is worth considering.", "Date": "July 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3697874", "Content": "We just returned from the Hyatt Regency Islandia and I would have to agree with several other reviews that this hotel needs some major upgrades.

We stayed at Hyatt Islandia in MIssion Bay. A nice location right on the bay, a marina on one side, close to Belmont Park & the beach & \"boardwalk\" area. The hotel room wasn't ready when we arrived at 3:15 so we went for a ride & some lunch/supper (it was 6:15 \"our time\" so we were hungry). Returned to the hotel a littel before 5 and were told the room still wasn't ready so they offered us an upgrade to a Marina Suite. While we were debating the relative merits of taking a suite, the original room became available, but the offer was still out there, so we took it! Had a bedroom w/2 queen beds, TV, a patio w/2 chairs overlooking the marina, a little wet bar area, and a living room w/TV, table, chairs & sofa/pull out bed. Decor a bit shabby, the sofa was uncomfortable to sit on to watch TV, but we were hardly in the room so it wasn't a big deal. What a kick to sit on the patio and see pelicans and a seal or two poking around the boats in the marina! They nickel & dime you to death there, however. $10 a night to self park (altho' we did have under the bldg. parking, which was great when it was raining) and $20 night for internet connection! Business travelers have come to expect WiFi at the better hotels (think Omni), not that price for a dialup connection! The bathroom lighting should have been better - kind of hard to put on even the little bit of makeup I use with the lighting provided! Even the connecting area where the wet bar and another counter with 3 mirrors were poorly lit. They have a \"thing\" they do there to save water - they say they'll only change your towels and linens every three days to conserve water (save our planet) unless you call and tell them no thanks. I certainly did call and say we wanted fresh towels daily, thank you very much. We've been on a couple of cruises where they do something similar (there's a REAL need to save water in their case), but they do it in a better way...they say if you want the towels refreshed, leave the used ones on the floor, otherwise hang them back on the rack to dry if you plan to reuse. I think that's more user-friendly than making a customer call to say they want clean towels. All in all, I would recommend this hotel. It's a nice location, close to the beaches and the highway both, and the facilities seemed very nice. We did not use the pool, but they have a small sandy area with chaise lounges they call a \"beach\" for those that want some sun with no water. it's not really a beach, but you get the same effect for sunbathing. Breakfast at the Blue Bay in the hotel was good - we had the breakfast buffet which was standard hotel buffet stuff - scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, fruit, bacon, sausage, french toast, biscuits, gravy, syrup (I think I'm leaving something out, but can't remember what). We did not have any other meals than breakfast there (I ordered an omelet off the menu one morning, it was very good). We tried to go to the Islandia Grille on the Thursday night around 9:30pm...hours on the door said open 'til 10:30 but all the doors were locked. We just wanted maybe an appetizer and a drink at the bar. A bartender came out and said they were closed. Hmmm...was that a management decision or just the bartender's choice???

Everyone who works here greets you warmly, even the maids! they are all trained very well - even calling room service was nice! And food was great and fast. I used the gym on the second floor, and it was the best gym i've ever seen in a hotel. New workout equipment - aerobic stuff, and free weights, and other equipment! towel, water, tvs, mats... the whole nine yards. Great! The grounds are amazing - so tropical and lush, with the aforementioned koi pond, big swimming pool and big hot tub - great to get into at night. The hyatt is right by the marina - all the boats are steps away! it's just gorgeous. Plus there is nothing right beside it - it's all by itself, away from downtown but only 10 minutes to get into the city. A little bunny rabbit hangs around the grounds by the koi pond, just eating grass and being happy. It was perfect weather, a nice breeze and sunny, and just so nice to hang out in the tropical little paradise here. yes, the hotel is a bit old - not exactly up to date - but it is still nicely decorated and lovely. and i bet if you don't stay in the main tower, you won't like it as much - but if you do stay in the main tower, and especially if you get upgraded to a suite, you will enjoy your stay.", "Date": "April 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fillmore, CA", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay here!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3375019", "Content": "My family and I stayed here one night after a day at Sea World.

The bathroom fixtures seemed to be quite recently installed, and included a granite vanity, white tile and a shower. I personally like having such a large shower, but if you are a bath person, or have kids who like to take baths, it might be an issue. I suspect that being a beach-oriented hotel, they probably found the shower to be more practical. The furniture looked to be new, and was quite contemporary looking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c generally the same I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in other Hyatts. The balcony was showing its age with some dirt and water stains, but was certainly fine to sit and enjoy the view. Room: Cleanliness I found the room to be acceptably clean. There were some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153marks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the toilet. They might have actually been from a crayon, since they were blue. There was quite a bit of dust and some pieces of trash underneath the bed. Other than that, the room was clean.

Our tower room also had a balcony with great view of the hotel pool and grounds, mission bay, mission beach and Pacific Ocean. We had wonderful views of the sunsets. Hotel: Amenities (Restaurant, room service, workout facilities, pool, transportation) I ate at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Blue Bay California Bistro\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for dinner during my stay. Then menu featured a wide variety of American and Mexican-influenced food. The waiter was quiet, but attentive. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was pleasing and relaxing.

The waitress was quite conversational and friendly. The bartender wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overly generous on pour of my Bushmill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was a little on the short side, but I still enjoyed the few minutes I spent there. I made use of the hot tub on one night. The water was warm, but a little cooler than I would prefer. Its large enough that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel crowded, and I had some nice conversation with some of the other guests. Hotel: D\u00c3\u00a9cor Generally, the d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the indoor public spaces was pleasant, but a little dated. Hallways seemed to need a little refreshment. The lobby furniture seemed a bit worn. Much of the interior and exterior of the complex looked a little 70\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to the extensive use of pre-fabricated concrete forms. Coupled with the islands-themed landscaping, it reminded me of the Polynesian and Contemporary Resorts at Walt Disney World in Orlando. Since that brings back pleasant memories of my childhood, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really complain! The grounds and landscaping were quite well kept up. Hotel: Location The Islandia is in an excellent, central location for a trip to San Diego. Many people have pointed out its proximity to Sea World, which is certainly true. Its proximity to I-8 and I-5 make it a breeze to get anywhere else in San Diego, especially Old Town, Mission Valley and Downtown. Mission Beach is only minutes a way going west. Hotel: Staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c courtesy, attitude and promptness Check in was handled swiftly. Every employee made an effort to smile and say hello during my stay. We had been billed for a water we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drink, and the checkout clerk credited us for the charge and actually complimented me for checking the bill carefully. Value/overall impressions: I have to say that after reading many of the reviews I was really skeptical about the hotel. After staying there, I really find myself wondering if either some people were unduly critical, or if the hotel has made some recent changes or upgrades. I felt that the $75.00 Priceline rate was a fantastic value, and I would be even prepared to pay up to $150.00 given the location and amenities of the hotel.", "Date": "February 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cConfirms My Decision to Stay Away from Hyatts\u201d", "Author": "MrBillMi", "ReviewID": "UR3183450", "Content": "I recently received an email from Hyatt Regency. As a Gold Passport Mermber I had not stayed at a Hyatt property for some time because of past disappointments. The email was urging me to try Hyatt hotels again. I decided to give them a try.

I was told that they did not have any king beds left. So I accepted a room with 2 queen beds. The 12th floor hallways were in desperate need of rework as the wallpaper was coming loose or was torn in many places. When I got into my room I discovered that the \"upgraded marina view\" I had paid for was a view of the parking lot and parking structure. If I craned my head a certain way I could see the marina. Several of the outlets in the room were cracked and I was afraid to try plugging anything into them. The wallpaper and furniture were overdue for updating. The desk was rickety with age. I had to pull it away from the wall to discover the outlets that were attached to the desk itself. It rained all weekend so cabs were in short supply and the hotel did not offer a shuttle to the immediate area, So I ate in the restaurant 3 times. The servers would drop the food and never check back to see if I was satisfied.

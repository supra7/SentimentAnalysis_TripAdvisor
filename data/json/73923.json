Our family enjoyed the large and inviting outdoor pool, and the complimentary dinner and breakfast were very good (outstanding oatmeal!). Depending on your party size and food consumption, you can easily save at least $20-$40 in dining-out costs by staying at Drury. Several rough edges: 1) We were originally given a room directly across from the elevator bank, despite requesting in writing in our online reservation a quiet room away from the elevator...and reminding the front desk clerk of this request at check-in. (Older Drury Inns, such as this one, have an open atrium from the ground floor to the 6th floor, creating an \"echo chamber\" effect for guest rooms adjacent to the atrium/elevator area.) Upon revisiting the front desk, we rcvd a satisfactory room--15 mins. after we originally thought we were \"checked in.\" 2) The wall-mounted A/C/heater in guest room blows directly on the face of the person sleeping closest to the unit. 3) Unlike newer Drury Inns, whose lobbies are bright and inviting, the lobby of this one is dark and a bit unwelcoming. 4) Hotel elevators were dirty...they weren't vacuumed or cleaned during our entire stay. 5) Hotel was hosting dozens of motorcyclists staying for Bike Week, which was fine, except for fact that hotel allowed them to park their bikes immediately outside the hotel's covered front entrance, despite ample parking in the parking lot. For hotel guests, this meant navigating through a gauntlet of cycles--some on and rumbling; some not--whenever entering/exiting the hotel. Guests inside the hotel were \"treated\" to the sound of throttling cycles throughout the evening and into the wee hours (see Drury \"echo chamber\" comment, above). The \"Drury Inn\" brand became more like the \"Harley Inn.\" Until this hotel's management and execution matches the quality of its newly installed amenities, there are many, many other hotels closer to Sky Harbor Airport that likely offer a superior stay experience.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Idaho", "Title": "\u201cBeing renovated - very nice\u201d", "Author": "lovetotravelalot", "ReviewID": "UR127440724", "Content": "Really liked this place - only there for one night for business but very enjoyable.

Probably closer hotels to the zoo but we chose a one bedroom suite so the toddler would be able to have a quiet nap while we were in the next room. Efficient check in and we were advised of ongoing hotel renovation which proved not to be an issue on the 5th floor. Toddler loved the elevator with a glass side over looking the lobby area. The suite had a \"kitchen area\" with tile floor and a small microwave and small fridge. A bar style sink with no stopper. There are no amenities (paper towels, dishwashing soap, kitchen towels) so it really is more like a regular hotel room that happens to have a fridge and microwave. It was obvious the room was newly renovated/updated. Nice furnishings, large tiled bathroom with deep soaking tub, granite counters, flat screens, etc. King bed in nice sized bedroom but no chair although there is room for one and still plenty of room for suitcases. There was also a large walk in closet to the left of the door as we entered the suite and a smaller closet inside the bedroom. The social hour food - hot dogs, mac & cheese - made the toddler very happy. Free drinks make it more palatable for adults :-) Also, baked potatoes and chili, broccoli soup one night. Menu varies a little bit and 2nd night did not include mac and cheese. The hostess both nights was very cordial and accomodating. Breakfast the 2nd morning took a big hit with a baseball team hitting right before we got there. Eventually everything was refilled and the ladies were hustling to replenish hot items - french toast, scrambled eggs, sausage. There are also 2 make your own wafflemakers. The area for eating is nicely done and usually spacious enough for everyone. We enjoyed our stay in this nicely updated hotel.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "peterborough", "Title": "\u201cA Gem!\u201d", "Author": "14bosley", "ReviewID": "UR125552060", "Content": "First expereince with this hotel chain and so pleased that we returned on same trip and would highly recommend it for value and location.

The free breakfasts, suppers, drinks, popcorn, long distance phone calls, shuttle service that Drury hotel chains provide is a really nice touch. Service was exceptional, friendly and everyone has a smile!!! We were constanly being thanked by all levels of staff for staying at their hotel- from the front desk, to the cleaning staff, shuttle driver, hostess and even the manager who made appearances in the evenings at the supper time event.

The air conditioner in the room was so loud I didn't get more than an hour or so of sleep the entire night. When the AC was on it was like a jackhammer at your window.

The whole staff was very polite and did what ever they could for us. The manager or assistant manager was usually around at kick back talking to the quests- A very nice touch. You wouldn't know there was construction going on if you didn't see some of the workers using the elevators. It was quite and you never heard them. The free breakfast every morning was good.

Rather than search for a hotel in Philadelphia at night we chose to do so in Phoenix in the early afternoon. US Airways provided a telephone number to their supplier for \"distressed guests\" and we were offered a number of choices ie Fiesta Inn Resort, Comfort Inn, Sheraton Airport etc as well as Drury Inn....I was aware of the Drury chain of hotels (based out of St Louis) but did not know the chain had a Phoenix property(ies). I quickly searched the hotel using Tripadvisor and chose it not knowing exactly what my family could expect but hoping for the best under the circumstances. I wanted a hotel near the ariport for the following day's flight as well as being safe and having useful amenities ie breakfast, free airport shuttle, business center and free wifi. You also are entitled to a complimentary evening \"KICK BACK\" that includes apetizers, snacks and drinks that could easily be your dinner as well as all the popcorn you can eat together with 24 access to comp beverages. We booked the hotel with the supplier at the airport and proceeded to the transportation area where we called the hotel and requested a pickup. The shuttle arrived within 10-15 minutes and we were greeted by the very friendly driver and assisted with our luggage. The driver very kindly offered cooled bottle water to my children (temperature was approximately 100 F that day) and returned us to the hotel. The shuttle was efficient and clean and the driver friendly and knowledgable. The hotel is architecturally interesting from the exterior and interior and is currently undergoing renovations by its new owners that include what appears to be a complete makeover including updated elevators and lobby and breakfast/bar area. Check in by the assistant manager was efficient and very friendly. We were advised of all available amenities and headed to our room with the assistance of a hotel employee as our children were quite tired at that point given their lenghty trip. The room was very pleasand and clean offering 2 queen sized beds, a desk area with chair, a second chair, a crt tv, 2 phones, fridge and microwave together with 2 alcove areas, one beside the beds and one beside the separate washroom area where there was complimentary coffee and glasses. The staff were VERY helpful and courteous and I cannot say enough good things about them. For example, we forgot our daughter's blanket in the room and realized that while in the air to Philadelphia. A phone call to my brother who contacted the hotel and arrangements were made to send it to him to pass on to us eventually. As I am involved myself in the hotel business I understand how difficult it it to operate a property while doing renovations. I suspect that this airport hotel location will do very well once the renovations are completed and word gets out that you receive great value for your travelling dollar with all included amenities that others have referred also. Well done Drury Inn staff. Your hospitality (that is why it is called the hospitality industry) was appreciated and made our travel difficulties somewhat easier to deal with.

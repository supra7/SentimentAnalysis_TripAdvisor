A lone female traveler, I checked in with only the clerk and another another person behind the desk and on one else in the lobby. Not more than 5 minutes after I got into my room, I began receiving phone calls asking to let me in the room.  I just saw you in the lobby. Let me in. I know you're alone and want some company The clerk or his friend used my personal information to terrorize me in my room. I received more phone calls and did not answer. Besides being too afraid to leave to walk across the dark parking lot to my car, there was a tornado warning in effect. I was Trapped! until the next morning.

Once more staff came out the line moved quickly, but it wasn't a fun way to start our first night in Vegas. We did however get an upgrade on our room. We stayed in room 421 in the Monaco Tower which is one that has gone under renovations. Our room was very clean and had new carpet. Our only other issue was that the AC definitely hadn't been updated in awhile. It worked really well, but sounded like a boat motor was in the room with us! Thankfully we were exhausted at the end of each night so the sound never kept us up. The staff was all great and very helpful. The cocktail waitresses in the casino were definitely nicer than ones we encountered elsewhere. They always greeted you with a smile and weren't as surly as some other places. My favorite part of staying at this end of the strip was that it wasn't as crowded as the south end.

They only had two people checking in people and they were not to friendly. We were next in line so we started to walk up to the window this is what one of the lady's behind the counter said to us. \" Did I call you? You stay right where you are until you are told to approach the counter\" thank god we were checked in by a gentleman who we think just started his shift and he was great because if I had to deal with the other woman I think I would have snapped. 2. The internet for lack of another word sucks!!! 3. Parking was terrible I have never stayed at a hotel were you could not even park your car at the hotel you are staying at. we literately had to give a person a ride to her car so we could take the spot she parked in. 4. Trash there is pop cans, paper, beer bottles and other trash whipping around in the wind not only in the parking ramp but the front entrance ways as well and I wish I took a pic to show you. It was terrible. 5. fire alarm going off all hours of the night. 6. over charging for things. If you want good internet you have to pay a dollar a min. 7. If you want more than a few channels on TV you will have to pay $6.00 a half hour. The movie rates are average so that's not an issue. 8. The elevators are scary. In the parking ramp the elevators are not only very dirty but are in rough operating order. very bumpy ride and the doors don't like to close properly. The elevators going to the monico tower have doors that barely close. 8. The hotel employees are not too friendly. 9. we love oriental food however in their food court there is a place called 1st wok. I tell ya what don't even wast your time their food was terrible and not to mention over priced. The food was so bad we didn't even eat it we threw it away. Now the good points: House keeping was awesome!!!!! The dinner buffet was very good and the room was nice with a comfortable bed. Over all this hotel is not worth the price.

We are a lucky group because we have what I feel is our \"own\" personal service with Dave Pate, the person in charge of \"Louisiana Player Development\". Over the years, Dave has done everything imaginable to make our trip as carefree as possible from the time we arrive at the airport until we're on the plane on our way home. The \"Riv' is a huge hotel ... I find something new every time I go ... whenever I need information about the city or the strip, all I have to do is get with Dave and all my questions are answered and options become clear for me to chose to my liking. Last several years we've gone for the excellent \"Super Bowl\" party held at the \"Riv\". Huge room with big screens everywhere with excellent view from any seat, food, drink, even temporary gambling set up in the room for your convenience. Don't know of anything else like it. Dave is always available to show us or tell us what, where, and how we get to fulfill our vacation travels, sights, and \"adventures\". This year I did something I always wanted to do. Rent a car and take a ride to Mr. Charleston. Dave showed us the car rental facility in the Riviera and \"POOF\" ... there was my car. My trip was everything I wanted it to be. Year before he told us about trips to the Grand Canyon, the options available, the west rim or the south rim ... on and on. That, too, turned out to be a sight of a lifetime. The Riviera has all types of gaming limits available, which I need, and the dealers were courteous and helpful to those who needed help. We ate in the restaurants and the food was excellent ... poolside cafe has the greatest breakfast anywhere ... The \"Riv\" is on the strip, not far from the more recently built casinos and closer to downtown than most of the newer hotels. Rooms were clean, housekeeping was excellent and staff was thorough and friendly. If I would have \"won\" ... I would have tipped them more ... hehehe If you would like a Las Vegas hotel that is still going after all these years and getting a little more \"personal\" than those other guys, the \"Riv\" is the place you need to go. Prices are very reasonable ... more of your vacation dollars to spend on having more \"fun\". And, when we go, it's usually NOT just us ... it's usually a gang of anywhere from 40 to 80+ people ... don't know how Dave can make all this happen, but somehow, without fail, he does. He is actually concerned that everything goes well for everyone. I don't even \"thing about\" going anywhere else, and have been doing so for years. Thank you Riviera, and thank YOU ... DAVE, for all you have done for us in the past and for the upcoming trips we'll take.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada, United States", "Title": "\u201cRiviera Bingo Room!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Danielle L", "ReviewID": "UR126506104", "Content": "Ive lived in Las Vegas all my life but the neatest place I have seen here is the Riviera its very friendly and calm.

Food court also has Mexican, Chinese, Quizno's and a PIzza parlour. - Breakfast buffet was a great value with plenty of gournet items available. - Very good soundproofing in between rooms .. couldn't hear a thing from the neighbours Cons: - Besides the rooms, the rest of the hotel is dated - The 2 nights we ventured into the casino and played some of the games, not once were we approached by a cocktail waitress for drinks - Parking is a bit hidden and have to go through a maze to get there. - It's in the north part of the strip not too close to any of the other casinos and the area is a bit rough.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tacoma, WA", "Title": "\u201cOn my short list of good inexpensive Vegas properties\u201d", "Author": "RulesLawyer", "ReviewID": "UR125600754", "Content": "I'd read reviews here and elsewhere, and was more than a little worried about what I'd end up with. If it was just me, I'm happy to stay almost anywhere, since I spend very little time in the room, but my wife was with me this trip, and she likes taking things a little more leisurely. She stayed with me at the Flamingo last time we were in town, and I'd hoped that this would be almost as nice. For the price (three comped nights, Friday-Monday!), I decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did. We got a non-smoking room near the top of the Monaco tower; the room felt like it was renovated about a year ago. The cabinetry was a bit scuffed, the view was of a parking lot with the Wynn golf course further out, and the AC unit had a damaged grate. Other than those three issues, I've got nothing but praise. It felt similar to a well maintained Red Lion. Check-in at 4:30 on Friday was immediate, although when we left the hotel a couple hours later, I saw that the line was much longer. Water pressure's good, bed was comfy, carpeting seemed clean, refrigerator worked, internet was fast. The valet service was top notch; by Sunday night, even though we'd switched cars, the valet recognized us. We never needed to wait more than 5 minutes for our car. Single-zero roulette in the casino was a blast, even though I ended up behind; slot play was slightly profitable. I'd been warned to avoid the buffet and to make sure to eat at the steakhouse, but did neither. Having a rental car feels like a must here.

We travelled with friends. Checkout was over an hour wait and the personnel seemed untrained or unable/disallowed to make any decisions of their own as with each guest, the clerk would disappear into some back room and reappear often. The friends we travelled with had their handicapped brother with them and as such needed adjoining rooms so they could supervise/assist him. The hotel did not have any adjoining rooms when we got there (2AM) and they graciously upgraded their accommodations to a Penthouse Suite at no extra cost. This was a big plus for the hotel and staff. Hours after we checked in, one of our travelling companions had a major coronary event and needed an ambulance. The front desk phone went 35 minutes unanswered! Finally a call to security resulted in an almost immediate paramedic crew from a local ambulance crew. No onsite personnel for medical emergencies are at this hotel. This information is provided as neither a pro nor a con, but is provided for informational purposes. Incidentally during the whole 4 day stay, 4 attempts were made to contact the front desk and the phone was never answered once although it was manned. With our friends at the hospital and my wife and I left to look after their brother, it was left to me to get the front desk straightened out as to what was going on. I failed to mention that when we went to check in that the hotel had, for inexplicable reasons, split my reservation into a single night and three nights. At 2AM when we were checking in, I attempted to get it put together, but they were unable to do so and I was told to come back in the morning, or later in the morning in this case! I did explain to the desk that my friends were unable to get their rooms swapped and that their stuff and a handicapped man was still in the room due to the emergency. After much sweet talking and pleading, the clerk disappeared behind the seemingly magic door and reappeared with news that they could remain in the penthouse (which is very nice) one more night. This was a big plus, but it is pretty much the last one. My wife and I stayed in room 3605. At first look, the room is noticeably outdated with a flatscreen television that somehow seems surreal in the antique room. There are no coffee pots in these rooms and ours was missing a hairdryer although the bracket was there. When we asked for one, we were answered with a huffy, \u201cThere is supposed to be one in there!\u201d My wife felt like they were accusing her of stealing it, but they did bring one after a considerable wait. Most of the staff we encountered were either rude, clueless or moved at the speed of a glacier. Please know that our expectations are not high and we are friendly, outgoing people and have never written a bad review ever. Back to the room\u2026 The bathroom was Spartan to say the best. One of the sink faucets had no stop in it and turning it off was like breaking into a safe until you could find just the right combination. The room was dirty and I am pretty sure the bedspreads only get washed after someone dies on one of them. The windows were incredibly filthy. I am one to recognize that when I rent a room for very little like we did that carpet will be threadbare and things will have chips and scratches, breaks etc, but even those things can be cleaned. The telephone is useless because nobody at the other end even answers it, although I did find it interesting that they still have a rotary switch! Last disgusting note on the room: when we were packing up to leave, I checked under the beds as always to look for the misplaced sock or whatever and when I lifted the bed-skirt on the unused bed on the outside wall, there was, God as my witness, a used condom lying there. It gave me the heebie-jeebies and I couldn\u2019t get the wife to take a picture of it for the review, but you cannot make that sort of thing up. The breakfast buffet was fairly unremarkable although there are lots of choices. The food was average, but the service was abysmal. We had the misfortune of having a server named Cornell (I told you I would remember your name), and this guy either hates his job or is independently wealthy and doesn\u2019t need it. We were seated at a recently used table by the hostess and we noted that there was a large amount of eggs, food and God knows what else lining the edge of the table. We nicely asked if it could be cleaned and he, in a flash got a really snotty attitude and stated we should sit somewhere else if we wanted it cleaned. Slightly aghast after not getting any sleep whatsoever the night before, we noted he was pointing at the floor and we explained we were talking about the edge of the table. He slapped a rag across it and some of it was removed while some of it found its way to the seating surface which I just cleaned myself after seeing how volatile he was. When he asked for our drink order, I asked my handicapped friend what he wanted and he replied, \u201cWhite milk.\u201d I asked Cornell for 2 coffees and white milk and he snottily replied, \u201cWe only have one kind!\u201d Off he went in a huff. Shaking our heads, we went and loaded some plates with mediocre, but filling food. When we returned we noted there were only two sets of flatware, so with just a little apprehension, we asked for another set. He glared, and went off to the magic silverware place and returned with 2 sets, but now here is the good part\u2026. As he walked past our table toward some other unfortunate guest, he literally pitched the silverware on our table and it slid to the back edge. I have never seen anything like it and I have teenagers! That was our last meal at the Riviera Buffet, and management, if you are reading this, you can thank Cornell for us eating there once. The food was bearable. He was not. (Readers: The Circus Circus accross the street has nicer people and better food at their buffet. Make the short walk.) The Casino is okay. Drink service is slow and unpredictable. The bell staff move like tortoises but at least they mean well and are very polite. I have more to tell, but think you get the picture. Stay somewhere else until they get their act together. The place actually has potential, but they need to clean things, train staff and basically make people feel like they enjoy serving them. Oh yeah, one last feature\u2026 No hot water the last day before we checked out.

The 2 teenagers sat on the floor and the guard made them stand up. They then decided to go get ice cream at a vendor they could see from the elevators and the guard again told them to stand up against the wall and not move, even though there were no gaming tables between them and the few yards they needed to walk to get a treat. The final straw was when I called downstairs to say the hallway was flooding (someone had turned on the bath water and then fallen asleep). It took forever for someone to come up to check on it, and then wanted to use our room to call the adjoining rooms to see who was in.

Unfortunately, the 2nd AM the omlette was a bit runny and I stupidly ate it anyway cuz I was in a hurry and almost immediately regretted it.

Upon check in of our room the bathroom was disgusting, it had not been wiped down at all, the toilet had blood on the toilet lid, hairs all over the bathroom and the ceiling was full of mold. We contacted the front desk, they convieniently sent a doorman up to move our room.

He did \"graciously\" place us in a petite suite. Okay conditon was so so. Not impressed at all.

Previous reviews hadn't painted a great picture of the hotel, or its hospitality, but since the Sahara, my previous Vegas home from home (see my two reviews of it), had closed its doors in Spring 2011, the Riv was the nearest inexpensive full-service hotel to the Las Vegas Convention Center, a walking distance that wasn't onerous. There was quite a long line for the checkin desk, but I wasn't in a hurry, and the checkin clerk was courteous and helpful. I left the desk with a \"fun book\", and a map to guide me to my room - a nice touch. I couldn't help thinking that it took much longer to check in than at other Strip hotels - definitely a procedural thing rather than a staff problem, as all three clerks on duty were taking about the same time per customer. The Riv could do with buying in a consultant's time to find out what's slowing things, and work out how to streamline checkin without appearing brusque. I had a \"signature room\" (non smoking) in the Monaco tower. It was a very nice accommodation, with perhaps a little more space than the Sahara offered. The bedside alarm clock/radio took a bit of working out, but was fine. The room also featured a decent-sized safe - more than big enough for a 13\" laptop and all the valuables I wanted to store. Wi-fi was included in the price - but more on that later. The bed was big and _very_ comfortable - I can understand how the Riviera has a sideline selling satisfied guests the same brand of mattresses they use in the rooms. A steam iron and board were provided, and - big win - a decent-sized empty fridge. The room, one of those recently refurbished, looked and smelt clean, and was very nicely furnished and finished. The one disappointment was the aircon unit, which was shockingly noisy, even on the lowest settings, and unusable at night. The bathroom was Vegas average: a slightly short bath (necessary for water conservation, as the Colorado river simply isn't delivering as much volume to the Hoover dam as Vegas needs), and a reasonable-sized faux-marble counter with a backlit mirror. The sink had a crack, but didn't leak. Nothing special there, but fine. The extractor fan was noisy, but stopped as soon as the bathroom light was turned off - in some hotels, the fan runs for ages after the light's off, which is frustrating when you just want to turn in and get some sleep. I said I'd come back to the subject of the wi-fi. Basically, it didn't work. Sometimes the nearest access point was \"visible\", but ran at the speed of a slow dial-up; sometimes it just didn't appear on the list. And that wasn't because my wi-fi devices were broken - I had no problem \"seeing\" several access points at Circus Circus across the road. I did my best to find other guests who did have working wi-fi. I couldn't find any. Now, with apologies to other readers, I'm going to shout at the Riviera management: PARTICULARLY FOR OVERSEAS VISITORS, THE INTERNET IS *NOT* AN OPTIONAL EXTRA. When you're looking at roaming data costs of $10/MB (yes, that's per megabyte, it's not a typo), you DEPEND upon a working internet service at the hotel - and the Riviera's was terminally stuffed. This hotel gets its volume custom from Convention Center visitors - staying on business, in other words - and they ABSOLUTELY MUST have access to their email, web browsing, and so forth. I note that the hotel manager has been responding to reviews critical of the wi-fi, stating that the Riv is working to improve coverage. It's certainly true that there are not enough access points, as the current installations clearly do not have the capacity to cope with a full hotel's worth of connection attempts, but it's also pretty clear that the backhaul - the Riv's external internet \"pipe\" - is not nearly adequate to the task. I see that on the desktop lamp base, there's provision for an Ethernet socket. Wiring Ethernet to each room, and bringing that out through the lamp base's socket, would at least overcome the wi-fi side of the problem. Beyond the room itself, let's talk about the rest of the hotel. The layout is...bizarre. It does take a bit of getting used to, but the map given to me at checkin helped. I didn't eat at any of the hotel's restaurants, so can't rate them. Parking was plentiful: there were more than enough spaces even during the peak CES week. The casino floor was never all that busy. Part of the problem might be related to the annoying little stickers on every machine: \"Minimum 25c bet to qualify for free cocktail.\" I can't imagine which [--]-clenched penny-pinching little bureaucrat thought _that_ would encourage people to stay and play (many of the penny machines only went up to 15 or 20 paylines) - but suffice to say that I've never seen anything like that in any other Vegas casino, and suffice also to note that I've never seen so few people playing the slots. There was a stage behind one bar overlooking the main casino floor, and there was some good music coming from it. Unfortunately, unless you were seated at that bar, the piped music over the general PA fought tooth and claw with the live music, resulting in a miserable mish-mash at close range, and inaudibility beyond. What's the point in paying decent performers, if you drown them out? Far better to hook them into the PA, and broadcast the live performance across the casino floor - it might even inject some life into the place. I did spend some time (well, about 4-5 hours if the truth be told) at the Pai Gow Poker table on my last evening, a Friday. Over that period, we had several dealers, most of whom were friendly and fun - although one did look as if someone had taken his teddy bear away. The cocktail waitress was noticeable by her absence most of the time, but it wasn't her fault - there was only one for more-or-less all the gaming tables. (C'mon managers, if people go dry, they wander off; do you really want that?) Whoever's in charge of the casino floor is asleep on the switch, or hasn't ever risked asking visitors what they think of it. It's by far the worst and least hospitable casino I've ever experienced in Vegas, and I think I've played in most of them at some time or other. Even the off-strip small-scale hotels are universally better than this. The only redeeming feature is the staff on the casino floor, who seem a decent bunch, if over-stretched. I ended up doing most of my evening playing at Circus Circus over the road, or the Tropicana at the other end of the strip, whose gaming floor is brightly lit and cheerful, the cocktail waitresses are friendly and so regular that I never had an empty glass, and played a great music selection, mostly classic rock, over the PA. So what's to be said for the Riv? On the plus side, the signature rooms are pretty decent, apart from the ridiculously loud aircon units. And it's cheap, convenient for the LVCC, and car-friendly. On the minus side: the appalling internet (non)connection, long waits for checkin that could be fixed by staffing the remaining windows and sorting out the checkin procedures, and a casino that offers potential players more hostility than hospitality. For next year's CES, I'd have to see evidence from staff and reviewers that the Riv has its internet problems fixed before I'd consider it again. I'd _like_ to use it again, but I really can't justify the cost savings if I can't keep running a business because there's no connectivity. I'm seriously considering the Trop for next year. If the \"minus side\" problems were fixed, the Riv would rate at least three \"blobs\", maybe even four, but I can't award more than a two-blob rating as it stands, even though the room was better than I could have hoped.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonds, Washington", "Title": "\u201cOne of the old greats!\u201d", "Author": "delong", "ReviewID": "UR123837919", "Content": "We stayed at the Riviera as part of a tour package.

It had Comfy beds nice shower and for those who like them a flat screen tv, which I could care less about your are on Vacation you are not there to watch TV.

There is a McDonalds across the street and a Dennys about a block down. The pool was very nice and clean. The Casino is also very nice because it is not crowded.

Hotel gave taxi, and in our case, limo drivers instructions to drop off at the South Lobby. \u00a0The problem is that drop off point is the furthest from the hotel\u2019s registration desk. \u00a0No bellman or other staff at this drop off point, so guests are expected to find their own way to the registration desk. \u00a0In the past, check-in was possible at the South Lobby, but it was entirely shut down. Room included 40\u201d LCD TV mounted to the wall which restricted viewing angles. \u00a0At most, there were 15 channels; the \u201cbest\u201d channels were TBS and TNT. \u00a0Of course, the hotel does not want you to sit in your room watching TV. \u00a0 WiFi cost $9.99/day, but during my entire stay, the longest I was able to stay online at one time was 1 hour\u2014after midnight when other guests logged off. \u00a0Most often, the WiFi signal would drop every 10 to 15 minutes, if you could get a signal at all. \u00a0The fastest speed I was able to measure via SpeedTest was about 650Kbps-- not Mbps, Kbps. \u00a0Do not expect to use Skype, Netflix, or any other service that requires a real Internet connection. \u00a0Lack of a stable connection made it difficult to keep up with work e-mails. \u00a0 Bed, pillows, and bed linens were nice and comfortable. \u00a0Bathroom towels had torn edges and should have been taken out of service. \u00a0Water pressure was good on the 8th floor, but hot water was hit or miss. \u00a0It just depended on the time of day. My clock radio was set 1 hour ahead, and I could not figure out how to reset it. \u00a0Left a note for housekeeping to reset it, but it was not done after the first day. \u00a0It was done after leaving another note. \u00a0Co-worker had similar issue, but his clock was off by 4 hours. \u00a0Seems minor, but we were already 17 hours from our home time zone, so an incorrect clock can make a big difference. CES brought an extra 140,000+ people to Las Vegas, but that fact was not obvious from the Riveria. \u00a0Only once did I see a line at the taxi stand. \u00a0No crowds in the casino, in the shops, at the food court, etc. \u00a0As a side note, AdultCon 2012 (a porn convention) started in the hotel\u2019s convention center the night before we checked out. \u00a0Even that event did not seem to increase the number of people in the hotel. \u00a0 If you do not care about TV channels, WiFi connection, hot water, or an empty hotel, this is the place to stay as long as the price is right. \u00a0Save your money to eat, drink, gamble, and have fun. \u00a0At the same time, I would not recommend to family, friends, or co-workers.

I have been going to Las Vegas for business for the last three or four years, and I have also visited before, so I know my way around the place a bit. For the last few years, I've been staying at another hotel, right across the street from the Riviera and was pretty satisfied with it, if it wasn't for the long lines to check in and out (about 10-15 people waiting). This year though, I decided to switch to Riviera, due to its better price. Big mistake. Problems started as soon as I arrived, on a Friday evening about 7pm. The line for checking in was simply incredible! Nothing I've seen before compared to this. I waited for more than an hour before I was in front of a reception employee, who appeared to be overworked and less than eager to help. Let's just say that it took some frustrating moments to find my reservation, since she couldn't understand that in Greek a person's name can be totally different than in English, even though my passport shows both the latin equivalent of my Greek name and my American name. After taking some moment to solve the name issue, and after the employee apologized, I was given a room, which however was not for smokers (as I had requested). I was promised a switch to a smokers room the other day. This is not the \"welcome\" I expect after being in planes and airports for more than 24 hours. The room given to me the first night, was in the Monaco tower and was OK, comparable to other rooms I've stayed in Vegas. However, the free WiFi connection promised in the reservation web site, was a joke. It never worked OK with Skype, I guess that the hotel is somehow blocking Skype in their system, because it never worked properly while I was there. Then, it kept throwing me out of the network, if I was not overly active. If I had my computer check for my emails on a 5-minutes schedule, I never got any emails. I had to switch to a once-a-minute checking, to maintain an active connection. Then, it won't allowed me to have both my computer and my phone connected on the network. I eventually managed to overcome that issue, but in general if you want a good WiFi connection, look elsewhere, the one Riviera is using is a joke. And of course, there was no in-house support, which is provided via an outside company, whose technicians don't even answer the 800- number I was given for them. An automatic system takes your call, and if you are lucky, someone will call you within the hour. Huh? Being a member of the press, I need 24/7 reliable Internet, I can't wait for an hour before problems are solved, if they are resolved at all. As I said, if you need reliable Internet connection, look elsewhere. So next morning, I was expecting to hear from someone, to arrange my switching to a smokers room. Well, that didn't happen, I had to personally go to the front desk and ask (or rather demand) the switch. A very reluctant employee had me come and go at least three times, since they had to move people out (those leaving) and have maintenance clean the rooms before they could move me to a new one. In the mean time, newly-arrived guests were moved into their rooms just fine. Overall, the hotel personnel lacks the attitude that you would expect to find in such a hotel. The hotel I used the previous years is much better in that respect and it has a reliable, unrestricted Internet access. More details: 1. Rooms: the rooms are adequate. \"Tired\" but they provide what you would expect from such an old hotel, in that price range. They are usually spacious, even if you were to add a third bed it won't be a problem. 2. Restaurants: I tried the Food Court and the R-Buffet. They are (again) nothing to write home about, at the same level as similar restaurants in other hotels in Vegas. Keep in mind, that you'd better get there early, if you are used to late dinning like us Europeans, you may find that some of the buffet entries are getting \"old\", I was served a very dry beef slice by the \"Chef\" in R-Buffet, when I visited that restaurant at about 8 pm. 3. Bars: I haven't tried them, so I can't tell, but from what I saw the Queen's Victoria bar looked attractive. 4. Personnel: Usually unfriendly and non-professional. I have to mention though, that I was surprised by one high-rank executive I've met in the elevator. I knew she was a hotel employee, but I didn't knew her position at that time. We briefly chatted in the elevator and she insisted to walk with me to the hotel Business Center, to pick up a package which was waiting for me there, because it was almost 5 pm (closing time for the Business Center) and she wanted to make sure that I would get my package, even if they had just closed. This lady was an example of how the hotel staff should be. Thank you! The only other employees which were friendly and helpful were the Vallets at the rear entry of the hotel. Great friendly guys. 5. Other considerations: The hotel location is a bit far from the center of the Strip, so be prepared to do some walking if that's what interests you. It's not a huge hotel, like some of the others on the Strip, so you do not need to walk much to reach its various areas, but that also means that your choices inside the hotel, are limited. For those interested in the casino details, there seemed to be a variety of tables you could play all the usual games, as well as a lot of \"slot machines\", so if that's what interests you, you probably won't be disappointed. I am not into gambling so take this with a bit of salt. Room service is kind of strange. In one of the rooms I stayed, there was a sticker which advised you that the sheets wouldn't be changed unless you ask for it! If you do not, they just make the bed with the existing sheets and call it a day. Come again?!? Also, floor managers have the tendency to enter the rooms without waiting for permission. One of them caught me undressed, as she opened the door immediately after knocking! Would I stay in Riviera again? No. I need a few basic things from my hotel, during my business trips. A prompt service during check-in (lacking in Riviera, the waiting line for check-in is usually 30-50 people long), a decent, clean room (OK in that respect) and a reliable, unlimited, unrestricted Internet connection. The Riviera scores low in two of my three requirements.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cOld & Outdated, not a good place to experience Vegas\u201d", "Author": "Japan_Expat_07", "ReviewID": "UR123079698", "Content": "If you are coming to Vegas for a convention and you are on a tight budget and only need a bed art night, then this place is ok.

The check in staff said that in Vegas there is a law saying three adults can not share a room (honestly have you heard that before!) They refused to sort this and said the only way we could stay there was to book an extra room, which we did in the end due to the time it was taking. Luckily when we got to the room there was a hotel brochure saying that extra beds are available so the next day we complained to a manager who rectified the situation and refunded the money paid and that was handled extremly well. Whilst in Vegas the weather was cold, cloudy and rainy which was a shame and unlike what you would expect, but we still had a good time, the only thing it affected was our Grand Canyon trip and the staff member that dealt with tours at the hotel (he was located in the entrance near the bus and taxi drop off to the side of hotel) was amazing and was trying everything he could to make sure we could go to the canyon.

Upon arrival to the hotel, I was greeted by the receptionist with comments about how can it be that I arrived so early (11am) and that I should go somewhere and return at 4pm. At first I thought she was joking but she wasn't. After paying $20 extra I was given a room. This is the first time I hear that even though rooms are available, I cannot get one after a 28 hours flight. 2. In the past 3 days, I have not had usable Intenet access in my room (which as Press, I must have). Apperantly, this is a known hotel issue but every time I complained about it, it was treated as if it was a surprise to the staff and perhaps only my problem.

When I asked about the Internet issue, I was given a 1-800 number to call for tech support although the Hotel knew this was known issue and that tech support cannot help me personally.

A guy called James checked us in and he was a lovely fella, very freindly polite and professional and as an unexpected bonus we were upgraded to the Monaco Tower!! We paid the $7 per day resort fee and this included wifi and the safe, I know some people have commented on this so I guess the Hotel have listened and now include these in the price. We also got free local calls as well. We battled through the crowds to our room and the room was fine, it was clean smelled fresh, had a big telly and a bed you could sleep forever in! The only criticism was the maid service was very poor. We never had our sheets changed in 7 nights and the room got very very dusty and not cleaned all week, that was a shame but still I,thought the rooms were great value. The Hotel is quite small in comparison to the top end of the strip but I preferred this, it was easy to find your way around and you didnt have to walk miles to get to your room so we were happy with that. I dont think us Brits are used to hotels the size of Caesars or MGM etc, they were beautiful hotels but you would walk miles everyday in there!! I'm not really used to casino's but the Riviera's was fairly small but loads of slots from pennies upwards and plenty of game tables too. It was smokey in there but its a casino right? I quite like being able to have a drink and smoke inside as we're not allowed in the UK anymore so it was fine for me. The waitresses were regular with the free drinks and if you tip a $10 straight up then they're back very regularly, as we mainly played the penny slots this made the drinking very very cheap!! We had a few beers in The Queen Victoria Pub in the hotel and the service and beer were great, maybe a bit more expensive than some bars but you always pay more in a hotel bar so not really unsurprising or overly expensive to be fair. They always had Football (soccer to our colonial friends!!) or sports news and plenty of live music at nights too. There was a great atmosphere in there. We always found the staff to be polite and helpful and most of them smiled and greeted you as you passed, I know some guests have made comments about this but I reckon the Hotel have taken this on board and done some extra training. We didnt eat at the restaurants other than breakfast buffet on our last day. I wish we'd had the breakfast earlier!! For $10 it was great value, loads of choice and the service was excellent. The waiters were regularly topping up coffees and soft drinks or juice, we really enjoyed it. If we had gone there on our first day then I'm sure we would have gone back everyday. We got a cab from the airport and the strip was closed (due to New Years Eve) so the taxi driver went on a scenic route and robbed us, $40 to the hotel. We learned that the Hotel was in the opposite direction and you dont have to go near the strip to get there. The fair should have been $15 maybe $20 max. Please be careful of this, a better way is maybe get a shuttle bus. There are plenty of them right outside and its $7 dollars each, Bell trans gave us a great service ( we flew to San Francisco for a day during the week!) and only a 10 minute ride so I would recommend them. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at The Riviera. It was comfortable, friendly, clean, reasonably priced and not too far to walk for shopping and the ''main'' hotels up the strip. If walking is a problem then get a Deuce bus, $7 for 24hrs and stops right outside. They run every few minutes and well worth riding.

This past December we had 2 seperated stays. The first three nights in the Monte Carlo tower and then 5 nights in the Monaco Tower. Both rooms had been recently renovated and were nicely done. The bathroom was still a a bit dated but the shower had great water pressure and was clean. Both rooms Recently renovated and upgraded with modern amenities, 32\u201d flat screen television, AM/FM alarm clock radio, refrigerator, complimentary in-room safe, \u201cEuro\u201d pillow top mattresses, iron and ironing board, hair dryer. The Casino portion of the Hotel is very \"Old Vegas\" which I happen to like. More quiet and less crowed then the new mega resorts. Of course if you do need more action the Encore and the Wynn are just within walking distance. Also within walking distance the Fashion Show Mall with food court, Walgreens, Ross (discount store/ great buys and prices) and Resturants such as Denny's and Fireside Inn. Check out the Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside lounge just next to the Riv. The portions are huge (we usually share) and delicious. The Fireside lounge is a bit funky with the firepit but if you are lucky you may run into a celeb or 2 early/late at night. The restaurant and lounge is a bit of an icon in LV. The Riv also has a food court, buffet, English pub, asian food and The R steakhouse. As far as buffets go it is just \"ok\". If you go to a buffet and are under the assumption that you will like everything then I guess it is better to skip buffet food. The breakfast is great and most items on the dinner menu were good. The R steakhouse was exceptional and not that pricey commpared to some Steakhouses. Deffinately worth checking out. Besides like the Rivera for the above mentioned I also like it for the easy in and out if you rent or come by car. The self parking or Valet parking (which I usually do) is easy and fast. You can leave your car or get it delivered quickly compared to long hours in a line at other properties. The check in is also just inside the door from the parking / drop off area. You don't have to walk thru the entire casino to check in. Another Riv plus!!! You also have easy access to Paradise road that will get you away from the busy strip.

Asked if the photo of the one bedroom suite was the actual room availabl and the answer was YES!!! Booked the suite and headed for Vegas. Lines were long at check-in, but it was not the hotel's fault, just an abundance of people there for New Year's. Got checked into a nightmare, and the suite on their site was not they provided us, and was not even close to the same. Of course, NO one was able to help the situation; NO other suites; NO refund of the room; NO comp for the deception; just shut up and enjoy your stay. During the first 24 hours, we gambled approximately $5,000 on table games, and one of the pit supervisor's indicated we should talk to Casino VIP services about getting the bad room comped, or maybe even moved. Took the time to go to VIP services and the informed us that for a Comped Suite, we would need to bet $50 per hand for minimum of 4 hours each day; if we wanted any comped food, in addition to the comped room, we would need to bet $80 per hand for a minimum of 4 hours each day. If you play slots, comps racked up at a whopping $1 for 300 hundred points ($300 in wagering); with a minimum accumulation of $20 in your account before anything could be done. NO offer to rectify our situation!!! Male Pit Supervisors could not care about anything unless you were wagering over $100 per hand. There were a few players, at the blackjack tables, wagering well over $100 per hand, and the Male Pit Supervisors were bringing VIP Hosts to the pits to provide anything they wanted!!! Bottom Line: False Advertising on their web site; deception when dealing with reservations personel; and total disregard for resolving any problems unless you are willing to gamble $100 per hand, then the world is your oyster. Old hotel in need of updating; food is some of the worst on the strip, don't waste your money. If you like Old Style Vegas, are not a mini-high roller and don't mind getting deceived then this is the place for you!!! Even basic rooms at Ceasar's International; MGM Resorts International; Boyd Gaming are MUCH BETTER, and those companies take care of ALL the visitors (gamblers or not). Have read comments on Trip Advisor where manager of the Riviera indicated they would have loved to had the opportunity to address the issue when it occurred; however, they had the opportunity and did not care of us, because we only were betting $10 and $25 per hand, and sat at the tables for over 7 hours providing them the opportunity to take $5,000 of our money. STAY AWAY!!! Beware!! If you want a better stay, with better food, better rooms, better overall experience contact Ceasar's Internation, MGM Resort's International or Boyd Gaming. Travel out there for relaxtion at least 7 times per year; biggest mistake was Riviera. See photos uploaded of the One Bedroom Suite on their web-site that Reservations indicated was the only ones available, and the photos of the wonderful one bedroom suite they gave us.

Have been going to Vegas since 1989 and am well aware of the area that the Riv is in. We stayed in the original tower (Med. North) which is located directly over the casino. The room was clean and comfortable, Kingsize bed, standard room on the 8th floor. Flat screen TV, desk, dresser and table and fridge in room. Small area outside of bath for wife to do make up. Aside from the TV, all furniture may well have been 10 years or older, but it all was clean and was more than capable of doing what it was intended to do. The lights worked, the shower had good pressure, no issues with any fixture. Check in was quick and easy, but I did notice lines later in the week - but not nearly as long as lines we saw at other hotels reg. desks during the same part of the week. They had moved the reg. desk to the convention area and the self kiosks were not being used. We ate at the buffet 3x and found it more than we expected. Don't let someone elses tastes rule where you go. While the omelet bar may only have 6/7 options, it was well made, tasteful and quick. We went to Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet and were very dissapointed (except for the crepes). If you want a quick meal with some variety that is within reason price wise, the Riv's is fine. The casino has a wide variety of games and table minimums. Dealers were very friendly. A great asset to the Riviera, which I never see metioned, is the ease of driving to and from the hotel. With access to Paridise Rd. for driving to places south, and able to get to downtown with 10 mins, and west (Red Rock Canyon) by using Sahara, the Riviera is ideal for those who rent a car. The only neg. I can think of is that the parking garage is a little small and during busy times it is hard to find a space. Yes, the Riviera is cheaper than the newer strip hotels and you know that at those prices no one is going to tuck you in at night.

I paid for the upgrade this time, and ended up requesting they just put me back in the north tower - the extra money paid for a refrigerator, nothing more. For me, not worth it, plus I like to do yoga in my room, so the bigger older rooms were better for me. The Monaco tower rooms were smaller and much darker than the other room. They told me the bathroom had been redone, but they've put in a new counter - the tub was old, small and dirty. I requested a room with new linens - white and comfortable - but the rest of the room is the same. Old, tired. There is an 8 dollar a night resort fee here - which I have to say I'm appalled by - it doesn't pay for anything - you get free access to the gym - but most of the cardio equipment at the gym is broken, and the equipment is all 30 years old. Wireless costs an extra 10 bucks PER DEVICE PER NIGHT. I honestly would not have a problem with the Riviera if the rest of the hotel wasn't charging such outlandish strip prices for everything. I buy NOTHING at the Riviera while I'm here, not a meal, barely a coffee - because the place is old and grungy and awful - if they were charging accordingly I'd be more inclined to hit the buffet or the cafe. If you're going to be a budget hotel, be a budget hotel. I was with a HUGE group - over 1000 of us here - and everyone left the hotel to eat and get coffee and do everything - a crappy coffee and a muffin you could buy at a gas station cost 9 dollars here. It's Vegas, it's expensive, I know - but come on, Riviera! So I guess the Riviera is a budget hotel that will nickel and dime you to death if you let it, and it's about a 20 minute walk to the \"real\" Las Vegas Strip. You're better off to pay a little more at a better resort and be in the middle of the action. Again, if I didn't have a conference here, I wouldn't stay here at all. No coffee makers in the rooms, so if you drink tea or coffee bring a portable or a kettle - they won't give you a cup of hot water anywhere. the room description says they have ipod docks, but they don't. The walls are paper thin, so if you're stuck next to a party room, you're in for a long night. They don't answer the phone when you dial zero, there's usually only one or two people at the desk, and they're checking in guests, not picking up the phone.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cRiviera Casino, Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "Ian g", "ReviewID": "UR121007953", "Content": "Flew out from manchester with Delta airlines transfer time at Atlanta to do passport control about 1 and a half hours was very tight 5 mins to spare.

There's a food court near the entrance with a decent selection of food, and a great breakfast special. I won some money playing roulette and video poker, so no complaints about the casino either. Drinks are free while you're gambling, of course. Don't forget to tip the girl. What I liked most at the Riviera was the relaxed atmospere.

I read many reviews complaining about slow check in and lines...this is common in all Vegas hotels.However, my experience was different, we arrived at 11:00 am and were offered room immediately and check in took us last than 5 minutes !! and the staff checking us in and out were all very friendly. I heard that a new management has taken over this hotel and things are really changing. I will definitely stay there again and recommend you give it a try and not to judge based on other reviews. This place is really good and their casino is well maintained with large variety of slot and table games. We used to walk every night to the strip centre and the walk was really nice - we like walking. Also try to shop at the north end premium outlet mall ..its worth it and only a 12$ taxi ride. Overall, our stay was very very pleasant.

As with others, I had read some of the not so favorable reviews posted and was a bit leery with all I had read, as to what we would encounter at the Riviera. We knew it was way down the strip, but we are walkers, so that didn't bother us a bit! Just a little more exercise to wear off all of the good food and beverages to be had on the strip! Check in was quick on a Sunday afternoon...about 20 mins (and we were checked in ahead of scheduled check in time of 4pm) . We were upgraded to the Monoco Towers at no charge when I asked. The room was very nice...nice, new and comfortable king size bed. Room was very updated, clean and tidy. Bathroom was nice too....good working shower, drain, toilet, fan, lighting and a mirror with a heating element, so the mirror didn't fog up! Nice towels too. All in all a pleasant room! And we've stayed at many other hotels for more $$ that didn't even have the basic working features in their bathrooms! Vegas is alot of fun...but you have to be prepared to walk or the bus will cost you $7 per day per person! The folks at the Hertz rental car desk at the Riviera were very friendly and helpful with our renting a car to travel to the Valley of Fire State Park and the Hoover dam...and the concierge was very helpful as well. The only negative I have to say about the Riviera is that if you stay on the pool side in the towers....they start up their LOUD pool music at 8:30 am and it goes all day til they close (which is relatively early). If you want to sleep in or take a nap during the day....you'd have alot of noise. Didn't particularly bother us as we were up by 8:30 every day. The other negative was the rudeness/inconsideration of other people staying at the hotel...yelling, laughing, talking in the halls and in and out of rooms all hours of the nite. This didn't happen every nite....but about 3 out of the 7. Not the Riviera's fault, as you will encounter rudeness in other guests no matter where you stay...seems that some people forget there are other people trying to sleep behind all of the closed doors. Vegas is a 24/7 party town...so be prepared for some of that if you visit. All in all a fun time and a good price in a fun town!

I figured that it would be comparable to the Fremont or 4 Queens downtown. It was a lot nicer than those places, though. Check in was a little longer than I'm used to but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Very friendly service and I was even upgraded to a \"luxury\" room for no charge after being booked into a basic \"deluxe\" room in the Monaco tower. Once I got up to the room, I was really surprised at how clean and comfortable the room was! Nice TV, nice bed, nice chair, nice desk. Unfortunately, no coffee maker, though. Probably the only disappointment. It woulda been really nice to not have to get dressed to go downstairs for a cup of coffee before getting my day started. The casino was nice, too. Machines were clean, bartenders were great, and the tables were nice. I'm a card player (but in no way a high roller) and I like to play at the $5 tables. Sure, I'll up my bet to $10, $15, or $20 but I like to be the one to decide that. Really disappointed that the Riviera's minimum bet was $10 at the BJ tables. I played for about an hour or so at a table but after that, the money was gone and I never went back to the tables at the Riviera. I'm big on playing where I stay but they have $5 tables at Circus Circus right across the street and it's a really quick walk. As for food, plenty of choices. A food court, a steak house, and a very good Asian restaurant is right in the casino, McDonald's is across the street, and the Peppermill is a 5 minute walk down the strip. Unfortunately, there's not a lot going on nearby, casino wise. Circus Circus is across the street but that's about it. There are a couple stalled out projects next door and across the street where the Stardust was located so if you're looking for other places to visit, you'll have to do some walking/driving. But you'll be doing that wherever you stay, really, if you plan on seeing some of the major resorts. You can be staying in the heart of the strip but there's always going to be another resort that you wanna see that's going to be a couple miles away.

I do want to say a couple of things before I begin to review this property in order to be fair. I have worked in the hotel industry as a laundry worker, breakfast bar attendant, bell attendant/shuttle driver, and front desk clerk. Because of this experience, I can relate to some of the mistakes that were made during my stay. Now for the review: I reserved my room online through southwest.com's website as a combo package. I looked at the room selection and decided to pay for an upgrade to a \"Signature\" room so that my wife and I could be comfortable. So we arrived at the Riviera. Now I knew ahead of time that the hotel was located on the north end of the strip so we rented a car to get around (parking is free so we didn't really care). In order to find the self parking lot we had to take a few turns around the block and it's not really in the most \"bright\" area, but that was something we were willing to deal with. Upon leaving the garage and stepping into the hotel you could tell that it had a darker feel. It's an older property so it wasn't too surprising. And we had a bit of a hike to hotel registration. Now based upon the reviews at this site and others we were prepared for a nightmarishly long check in line. I was surprised that check in was relatively quick, but I was shocked when I was advised that they had run out of rooms with one King bed. I guess I was willing to deal with that and checked in to my two Double bed room. This is when the mistakes began to happen. When we opened the door to the room we were surprised to find a hanger and crumpled tissue on an unmade bed, ironing board out, garbage not taken out, and a mans razor still on the bathroom sink. Of course I was disappointed and immediately began taking pictures of the room to take downstairs. Now I didn't cause scene TA, but I did then take the opportunity to express my disappointment with the mistake and requested that they make it right and also honor my upgraded room (since the \"Oasis\" room felt suspiciously \"interstate side Motel-ish\"). The front desk clerk then (I assume mistakenly) offered me an upgrade at an additional cost. This was definitely not going to fly (especially since I had already advised her that I had paid for an upgrade). She then corrected the error by finding us a \"remodeled\" room with one King bed non-smoking as I had originally reserved. Upon arriving in our new room (which was definitely better than the first) we found a couple of things odd, but liveable. The lack of lighting when you first come into the room is awkward. The vanity outside of the bathroom had two blown light bulbs (which is understandable in a city where money is spent keeping the lights on the outside of the buildings bright). There were other minor things, but one main thing that stuck out was a missing chain or security hatch for the door to the room. On the plus side, this location does save you money. We only ate one meal here which was breakfast and it was okay for the cost. By renting a car, it did give us easier access to the center of the strip without having to always get a cab. And getting a rental car allowed us to get to the other \"off-strip\" properties like the Palms and Rio. The hotel is old, and feels old. That being said, I did enjoy this trip and appreciated the value of a comfortable room at a decent price.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA good deal\u201d", "Author": "vammer", "ReviewID": "UR119359186", "Content": "For a friendly, reasonable, subdued hotel stay, we always go back to the Riviera.

I've been reading with interest the negative reviews on this site and I'm wondering if these people stayed at the same hotel we stayed at?? Our experience was nothing but positive! I have been to Vegas many times and stayed at many hotels up and down the strip, but never at the Riviera. Its the last of the \"old Vegas\" hotels on the strip and thank God a group of new investors stepped up this year and decided that it was worth keeping! The first 5 nights of our trip were spent at the Flamingo, where our Jr. Suite wasn't half as nice as our standard room at the Riviera!! A lot of the negative reviews about the Riv. involve the long waits to check in. I'm thinking that if people would just pay more attention and ask a few more questions they would have noticed that there are two very clearly marked self check-in kiosks right at the front desk. A very friendly & helpful front desk clerk named Alex was standing right there and was available to help us. It was all very easy and we were checked in and had our rooms keys within about 15 min. while approx. 20 people continued to stand in line waiting to speak to a clerk. Alex even said in a loud voice a couple of times to the people standing in line that they could use the kiosk. The only thing about the kiosk is that you might not get the room you originally requested, but for us it wasn't any biggy. I'm sure that if we would have wanted something different that Alex would have help us change if we had asked. Also if you use the kiosk versus the normal check in you need to give a $50.00 per day hold on your credit card. I never did ask why, but it didn't matter. As soon as you check out the hold is taken off of your card. Our room was a low floor recently refurbished room in the San Remo tower. I've done a lot of travelling and by far the beds at the Riv. were the most comfortable I've ever slept in!! We had good and efficient maid service everyday. The hallways and common areas were clean with no 3 day old room service trays and dishes laying around unlike the \"other\" hotel we stayed at................. Everyone we dealt with at the hotel was friendly and helpful. As a previous poster on this site has stated you need to keep in mind that this hotel is presently in the process of doing a lot of re-modeling, so make sure you ask for an already upgraded room. I suspect that some people that had problems with bad rooms ended up in one of the old, not yet re-modeled rooms. The pool area was also very nice & clean. Yes, the Riv. is an older hotel a little further away from the strip action, but we enjoyed that part. You can always easily travel down the strip by bus and enjoy all the action and then return to the more quiet Riviera for a good nights sleep on a great bed!

We first had to wait in line for over 50 minutes just to check in. At first there were 4 people helping people check in...but as time went on they slowly dwindled down to only 2 people with the line moving at the pace of grass growing. What was bad was watching people in the back as they drank their coffee laughed and discussed how they were going to spend their night after they got off!!! And here we are with all of these people waiting to check in and no one showing any urgency that there was all these people waiting in line. I had just flown two hours and now I had to stand in line for another 50 minutes. Good grief I was having a flashback to standing in line at Disney land waiting for the rides. Nothing was being done until one of the customers in line blew his top and asked to speak to the manager. After he did that all the sudden we had people galore smiling at the counter, waiting to help us (figures someone has to scream and shout to get help). What blew alot of us away was when a hispanic couple came up and asked for help and the hotel clerk looked at them and said \"sorry we don't speak spanish here and can't help you\". Those poor people! It pretty much then went down hell after that. Room service...none...they even missed our rooms to clean. We had to call and get help for clean towels (and of all things at 11:00pm !!!!) toliet paper. So here is the tip. You want cheap...go to the Riviera...you want bored clerks with no urgency and whose fake smiles saying that they could care less if you were checking in with them....Go to the Riviera...your broke and could care less...go to the Riviera. Otherwise you want to pay an extra $25-$50 a night and get treated the way you should (remember the economy sucks and if you are planning on spending the big bucks you might want to go somewhere were the people know and appreciate your buisness) Go anywhere else BUT the Riviera. Also we were informed that someone else has now taken over the Management of the Riviera...I also work in management and the way the hotel staff treated their customers I would have FIRED the lot of them.

I'm an avid hotel go-er/review writer and I've got to admit, overall the staff at The Riv are some of the friendliest I've encountered. Thank you so much! What to expect --- Don't expect to walk into a 5 diamond star hotel...that is not what The Riv is about. The Riv is a classic Vegas hotel. It's probably the oldest hotel on the strip but it's good. Our room in The Monaco Tower looked nice, comparable to any 3 or even 4 star hotel room. Sure the furniture has some dings but all that is expected in any hotel. The linens felt good, the carpet was clean, the curtains were nice, bathroom was clean, nice TV...not sure what else is needed beyond that. Fyi, there is a fridge in the room but no microwave or coffee maker (as with most hotels in LV though). From the food court to the other restaurants in the lobby, the hotel offers several fairly priced food options (even for late night). My friends and I were glad we chose The Riv...after touring the strip we were happy to come back to somewhere that didn't charge $16 a drink or $15 a hamburger. Sure the casino of The Riv is not like the casino of Caesar's Palace...but gambling wasn't our thing anyway. And if we had really felt like some serious gambling we could have just walked to the nearby Encore or Wynn...still the casino at The Riv had some good games and lively tables. Obviously you're in Vegas to see everything...not just the lobby of your hotel! The pool area was decent/very clean even...nothing to really complain about. They even have a live DJ and towel service...I even saw cabanas to rent (if that's what you want). One thing I do want to note, some things are under construction but it's not a huge bother...plus you've got to appreciate the effort being put in to improving The Riv. Getting around the strip --- we used the unlimited bus pass for $7 per person (all day). You could also opt for the hop-on hop-off tour bus (the kind with the tour guide) for $35 per person (til' 6pm)...the stop for both of these are directly across The Riv at Circus Circus. Oh, and listen to all the people passing out flyers, coupons, and free passes...we did a couple of these and got free VIP access, free drinks, no-line waiting at a couple really nice, otherwise pricey places...Tryst Nightclub in The Wynn and Chateau (the rooftop beer garden) at Paris Hotel...to name a couple.

He asked them how they could offer such a low price and they said that The Riviera had gone through a remodel and they were wanting to show off the new accommodations. I had checked Trip Advisor and noted the comments from other travelers. I thought that they were probably kind of snobby and \"how bad could it be?\". Let me tell you how bad it could be. Our taxi dropped us off and upon entering the registration area, there were at least 30 people waiting in line. There were only four people available to assist the guests. We waited in line for 45 minutes. Note that there is NO where to sit and it would probably be impolite to sit on the ground with your suit case. After getting to our room, I noted the two beds. Jokingly I stated that we each get our own bed. Then I noticed the size of the bed. They were full size beds! The only question the attendant had asked was smoking or non-smoking. We are not large people but at my age, I really prefer at least a queen size bed. Other than a few \"special\" times, we slept in separate beds. Very romantic!! Then we get to the room itself. When we were told that the property had gone through a remodel, I would think that they would put us in one of the newer rooms. No, our room was circa 1975. There was a sticker on the mirror in the bathroom that asked that we keep the staff safe and if we had any hypodermic needles to dispose of to ask housekeeping for assistance. Seriously?! There was a Dole banana sticker on the bathroom counter that was there when we arrived and was there when we left, even though housekeeping came in each morning. The cupboards under the sink wouldn't close. The room was not clean. The window, that overlooked the pool, had mold/fungus in the windowsill. I wouldn't have noticed this except the drapes were falling off the hooks and I was trying to put them back up. On one of our ventures out, I noticed a room service tray outside one of our neighboring rooms. The tray was there for more than 24 hours! I know that we didn't pay much for this hotel stay. As I told the manfolk, if I make it out alive and without bed bugs, I'll consider it a blessing. If you must stay here (why would you?!) ask for an updated room.

We booked with Expedia and paid extra for the encore room (Monte Carlo tower) where we always stay, had read some bad reviews since it was taken over this year but thought some people just like to moan and have always enjoyed the hotel every time we stayed there. On arrival we had to wait 45 minutes in line to book in a lot of people were complaining about their rooms. When it was our turn we gave the receptionist our booking and she said fine and then said that will be $111 for resort fees we said we always pay that when we leave to which she replied it is now paid when you book in, so we paid it, she then said you can\u2019t have the encore room and we said we paid for an encore room and that\u2019s what we want, she said no one is staying in that tower as work is being done to upgrade that tower, we were not happy and she said that we were to be upgraded to a better room we said no thanks we just want what we paid for, she said at least look at the room, so we went to see it .it was in the Monaco tower and the room was a lot smaller with the old type of noisy air conditioning unit it also had a connecting door, but more to the point these rooms cost less than the encore, so we went back down and said we don\u2019t want the room, she said that\u2019s all we have take it or leave it. I just looked at her and said get me the reception manager and was told that she was on her break for the next hour, by this time I had had enough so I said are you sure that no one is staying in the Monte Carlo tower and she said yes, so I replied well the workmen must be staying in the rooms then as we saw lights on and people in the rooms when we passed, so I will just go up and check to see who comes out of the rooms and ask them if they are guests shall I, she then said that what she meant was that no more rooms were being let out in that tower so that work could start in that tower, I said we booked with you 6 months ago so why were we not told this, she replied not our problem and anyway it\u2019s a first come first served basis and as you didn\u2019t book with us direct it\u2019s not our problem, speak to your tour operator it\u2019s their problem, I just said what\u2019s the name of your manager she said Annette, I said tell Annette we will be back to see her. We went back and had to stand in line again while 4 people in front of us were complaining to Annette, when we got to speak to her she was very offhand with us and I said we are not stopping in that room and I do not like being lied to and told her what had gone on previously she just looked at us and I said well, my wife said so we are at a stalemate and I said we have been travelling for 18 hours so get me the c.e.o. of the casino, she said that he was only in charge of the casino and I said well he is in overall charge of the whole casino of which this is a part, she then said that we would have to wait until the next morning to speak to him, and I said well we do now have a problem as we will not stop in that room and we have stopped in this hotel on numerous occasions and if you check your records it will prove that we always stay in an encore room, she went away and was some time when she came back it was with a totally different attitude, she then gave us a key to a room in the south tower room 763 the room was bigger but had a connecting door and the air conditioning was making a lot of noise, so we went back and said no, she then gave us the key to room 761 same room but next door it looked better than the last room, by this time we could hardly keep our eyes open, so we took that room, on checking the bed found it had only 2 sheets on it, no cover, blanket or duvet, so we rang housekeeping and had one sent up. I wish that we could say that was the end of it but no. Next morning after a sleep we checked out the room and it was terrible very badly run down and furniture covers all ripped, air condition unit filters had not been cleaned for years so the unit not working right. There was water on the floor at the bath (later found out that the toilet was leaking) when we complained about it you would think that all you had to say was that it was leaking please fix it, no I had to explain in detail where it was leaking from, I felt like saying just send me up the tools and I will fix it myself .the fridge was coated in filth and set to highest output controls ripped out so totally iced up. We stuck it out for 2 days but had had enough, so we booked into other hotels downtown (main street station, Freemont, Fitzgerald\u2019s and the Las Vegas club, all of these hotels were far superior in every way polite and helpful staff, nice rooms and far cheaper than the Riviera. Also there were no resort fees and the safe was included. In total we spent 5 days out of 15 in the Riviera and out of them we ended up with a Mexican couple with a child in the next room to us from the 23/9/2011-26/9/2011,we had to suffer screaming and shouting up to 4am for 3 days and to add insult to injury in the morning they had a do not disturb notice on the door. The maid service was just about none existent a quick flick around, we had the same sheets on the bed for 10 days I know this because the top sheet had a rip in it and 3 holes on my side. The hoover was run over the room 3 times during our stay we checked the room most days. I could go on and on but to finish I will say we were booked to go back again in November for 16 days at the Riviera but we phoned up and got the travel agent to change our bookings to another hotel thank god, as for complaining to the management why keep complaining my advice to anyone considering staying at the Riviera don\u2019t go elsewhere where you are treated with respect and politeness, even when we booked out all that was said was that\u2019s you all paid up .no hope you enjoyed your stay and look forward to seeing you again.

Usually we would avoid the Riviera because it is one of the \"older and decrepit\" strip hotels. Before our trip, I read the reviews on TA and learned about the remodeling and the Monaco tower. We checked in for a long weekend and had a fabulous time! Here is what you need to know if you want to have a great experience and save loads of money. 1) The breakfast buffet has everything you expect, INCLUDING an omelet chef and is only $10. 2) The room we had was unbelievable for the price. We stayed in the Monaco tower and had a pretty nice looking room with a flat screen TV, a pillow top mattress, and a refrigerator. 3) The pool was awesome..and best of all NO KIDS! In fact, we did not see any children running around the Riviera. Maybe they were all across the street at Circus Circus. (We have kids of our own, but we do not take them to Vegas.) It was nice and quiet by the pool without any screaming or splashing. 4) The Bingo Room is awesome! I am not usually a bingo player, but my husband was napping and I was bored. In the bingo room, I got a free drink, 24 cards to play with simultaneously for 13 different games (the computer keeps track for you if you want it to) and an hour of entertainment. All for 26 bucks. It was so much fun! 5) We are big football fans and could not turn away from Sunday Night's game, so we had pizza brought up to the room. It was very good and had loads of cheese on it. I think we got a 16 inch pizza with 2 drinks and an order of cheesy garlic bread with marinara for about 20 dollars including delivery. Yum! The casino is not special, it is pretty typical and has all the games you expect. It is a little smoky but not unbearable. This hotel is ideal if you want a very nice room on the strip for a very reasonable price! The only reason I did not give it a 5/5 rating was because check in took forever, and because we are members of Las Vegas Advisor and they would not take our 2 for 1 coupon.

Once I got in to the room I was overwhelmed by the musty smell which seemed minor after I flipped on the bathroom light and saw all the roaches (I counted 6) scatter about. I picked up all my stuff and went back down stairs to get a new room. The front desk staff was nice enough to move me to another room which was o.k. at best. The bathroom was tiny with a pedestal sink which made it tough to spread out your toiletries. The beds were suprising comfortable. Overall....

It was neither wonderful nor terrible. If you want a budget place to stay on the strip (although fairly away from the main part of the strip) this is about as good as it gets. It's either the Riviera or Circus Circus with all those kids. You decide. I was able to check in early and my registration went smoothly. I opted for a $20 per night upgrade which put me into a room on the 18th floor of the Monaco tower, which is supposed to be the best. My room was fine with a south view of the back of the strip and mountains. I was surprised that the Monaco tower rooms are considered the best in the hotel because my room seemed fairly average and the bathroom was a bit shabby. But for about $70 a night with all the fees and taxes, it wasn't a bad deal. Circus Circus and Slots of Fun are across the street. And there is a Walgreens and Ross for Less with walking distance. But if you decide to stay at the Riviera, be prepared to take the Deuce bus or drive to the more active part of the strip. You can also walk through the Riviera's convention center to the monorail at the Hilton. There's an elevator to the parking garage that I walked through to avoid the sun. For $12 you can ride as much as you want for 24 hours and it's much more pleasant than trying to squeeze on the Deuce bus during busy times. I ate at the Riv Buffet on my first night. I was starving so the food tasted just fine to me. There's a good selection of comfort foods and deserts.

She upgraded me to a room that i later found out charges $500 per night usually and i had only paid $22 a night! She also gave me the fun book with vouchers in which came in very handy! Aftr an efficient check in i made my way to the room. It was out the back, past the pool into the monaco tower. The lifts were clean and the when i finally worked out the floor numbers i headed up and found it to be lovely. It was clean, crisp and bright. There is a drink vending machine and ice machine on each level by the lifts. I opened the bedroom door and was shocked. It was wonderful. I had a huge king bed and flat screen tv. A fridge and mirrored wardrobe. The bethroom was slightly small, but as i was alone, it was absolutely fine. There was a bit of mould on the ceiling above the bath, but to be fair, i would expect that in an older hotel. Seeing as i was room 6418, i knew they had quite a few to keep updated! The view was of the pool was ok. Be aware that they turn the pool music on at 830am and it goes on til late so you will hear it. They also clean the pool early and that can be quite noisy. The fridge was spotless. Tv had 23 channels which was good, travelling on my own i wasnt out late so watched a few films on fox. The staff were all friendly, the shops great, the ABC shop had everything i needed in it. I didnt really gamble, was on a budget that didnt really allow it. But i did do lots of shopping as well as go to the wedding. Taxi's were easy to get outside (the underground part) and i had to gt an early one to take me to the airport. Check out took seconds and the taxi was wating for me at the door. Downstairs is smokey, but all the casinos in vegas are as you can smoke in them. Took a bit of getting used to as in england you cant smoke in public places like that. My room was always clean, no smells. I apologised to the cleaners for doing their job for them, i made my bed, re used my towels and kept it all tidy, they just had to empty the bins. The walk from this hotel into the centre of the strip took a while. I had stayed at circus circus opposite before and i didnt remeber how long that walk was. Took an hour from riviera to mgm and that was walking fast! The duece bus is brilliant, $7 for the day and their are stops right outside the front of the hotel which is handy. Can ride for 24 hours on $7 and as many times as you like. utilsed this lots. (if you have lots of shopping, there isnt much space, and people tut at you, but i coped!)

I saw the prices here at the Riviera and was happy to see the low prices. I then checked out the reviews here on trip advisor and saw many scarey reviews that had me regretting my booking with the hotel. For the next couple days i was worried that i had booked a dump and sweated it out. My 1st fear was people talking about the long wait to check in. We arrived at 3pm that friday and waited a total of 15 minutes in line to check in. The line flowed nicely, and what really was a wonderful surprise was the fact that our luggage would be taken up by a bell hop. We were offered to upgrade to a mini suite in the Monte Carlo tower and we gladly upgraded. Later on i saw how long the lines were and i could see how people could wait longer to check in. My advise to try to get there earlier to aviod longer lines and longer waits. Next fear was the room. We walked into a very very awesome room. Bed was comfy ( i wish i took pictures ) and having the fridge was awesome! Flat screen TV and bathroom was nice. Everything was clean and nice.We stayed at the luxor and didnt have a flat screen there and paid double. Channel choices were mediocre, but i didnt care since we werent going to realy be in the room. Negitive was the fact our remote didnt work. The view out the window sucked but who cares im not there in vegas to look out windows ill go to the strip to see things. I wish we'd join the riviera club while we were there also. Oh well, next time. An older man who was our bartender there at the hotel was nice but aparently didnt like the choices of drinks i ordered because he asked me why did i hate him. When i tried to order a mojito he told me they don't make those kind of drinks there?? Okay this is vegas and mixed drinks arent made there? I won't be going to that bar again. Walking to the main part of the strip was not a big deal. Its right down the road. Get some excersise and walk. Even with 110 degree heat its not that bad. Getting a cab was confusing, after walking around for awhile trying to find out where to get one we had to go down the escalator. Thats a pain in the butt. Oh and i got a tattoo and 3 Lions and loved it. Tyson the tattoo artist was awesome! And I used the coupon too ha ha.

The Riviera exceeded my expectations as far as being a dump. It is very low class & located directly across from Circus Circus. We stayed in room #1068, but you couldn't tell since the #8 had fallen off the door. The Riviera is located at the end of the strip and not very convenient to anything. As you walk throughout the hotel you can tell that its become so abandoned. Spaces that once occupied a store or an attraction are now closed. Our room overlooked a portion of the roof, and it looks as though one time there was a rooftop pool, and its now empty and dirty. All amenities are outdated, and our room was below average, not even a flatscreen tv in the room. The Casino area is dark, old-fashioned and stinky. While I understand that smoking is permitted other hotels have done a great job of keeping the stink down to a minimum. Not to mention that nothing in the hotel looks like it has been cleaned since the 1980's. I contacted the spa a week before our trip to make an appointment for a massage. I was told that reservations were not needed & to just call before coming. I called upon arrival and was told there was no availability for the entire weekend. The pool area was fair, however it should not be considered in any sense as nice. There were so many children splashing and driving it was impossible to relax. The hotel also had a Midget Wrestling Show that weekend...the Midgets had a Cabana and one, who said his name was Rod, was very harassing. Made crude sexual remarks and was very persistent, we ended up leaving. The food at the buffet was greasy & disgusting. Memorable Staff... Kelly with the blonde hair standing at the Guest Services Counter in the registration area...thank you for your awful demeanor and snotty attitude. Your dirty looks and unhelpful service was not at all appreciated. The moral of the story is nothing in Vegas is budget friendly. I recommend spending an extra $70 or $80 a night & staying at the Stratosphere down the street, whatever you do don't waste your money on this deplorable dump ! According to our taxi driver, the Riviera has been in the negative earnings the last few quarters & will most likely be closing soon...lets hope that is true...good riddance to you Riviera Casino !", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cfabulous hotel but at the wrong end of the strip\u201d", "Author": "hmchiswell56", "ReviewID": "UR117687588", "Content": "Great hotel but unfortunately this end of the strip seems to be disappearing as they are pulling down old hotels and not rebuilding therefore it is very quiet and a bit depressing.

They were in the process of remodeling some areas of the building to add a bingo room and fix or change some other stuff. It was 6pm on a Sunday night and there was a line about 100+ people waiting to check in. I was tired from a 9-hour drive and trying very hard to find the humor in it, but just about all the people waiting looked very unhappy.

The reviews seemed a real mixed bag, and I was unsure about whether it was a great idea to stay at the Riviera, as we have stayed at the MGM Grand and New York New York, quite swanky, very clean, super efficient, if a little soulless. But we went ahead with our booking, as the price was great, and we hadn't visited the top of the Strip properly on previous visits. One of the things we had read was that check in time was long. We didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes. When we got to the desk, the guy behind there was lovely, and upgraded us to the Monaco tower for no extra charge. Lovely. The room was smart and comfortable. We had to call housekeeping to clean and tidy because someone had just left. Housekeeping visited while we played the machines downstairs, and when we returned, the room looked great. The bed was super comfy and there was plenty of room. We signed up for the players card, and because of this we were entitled to a free buffet! The buffet at the Riviera is good, it's not the swankiest of places, but the choice was good and we enjoyed the food. I would recommend joining the players club for the buffet. The casino is one of the smaller casinos on the Strip, but it was a lovely casino with character. Some of the other casinos (e.g. Planet Hollywood) are a bit soulless, others (e.g. Circus Circus) are a bit grim and full of kids! Riviera casino was a lovely friendly place, and I think you need to have a good look around. On the last couple of days, we realised the casino was bigger than we first thought! I think I would have liked to have been offered more cocktails, but hey, I could see the waitresses walking around the place, they really do work their socks off. We had breakfast most days at Kady's Cafe. The staff there are lovely! Quite characterful, polite and amusing. We liked Patty, she was friendly and super helpful. The food was reasonably priced and the coffee was spot on! Being quite far north on the Strip, you do have to walk or get the monorail from the Hilton to get to places. Something I've noticed people moan about is that you have to do this! Use google maps, lazy people, to work out where the hotel is, doh! Honestly! We didn't mind that it took a bit of effort to get to other places, and we discovered that the Hilton has a nice casino and buffet, and the Wynn, has a fabulous casino, buffet and players reward card. We would not have visited these places if we had stayed elsewhere.

We were staying for a roller derby convention. As a savy consumer I kept watching reviews and was quite frankly getting a little nervous as so many people were pointing out all these negative things.... Well, much to out surprise it was an ok place to be.... So lets breat the trip down by the numbers. Flight in .. On time Luggage .. all in one piece with nothing missing Shuttle .. We used Executive. You get it on the airport property and they pick up and drop off at your hotel. Much Cheaper than a cab. $11.00 round trip for each of us. Arrival at the Riviera .. Earlier than check in. Bellhop met us at the door. Took our luggage and gave us a stub. No fuss, no worries. Advised us that they start early check in around 1230. Walking thru the casino .. A slight smell of smoke in the air.... However It is one of the oldest casinos in the city with a rich history.. I am fairly sensitive to cigarette smoke and it was NOT strong enough to be a bother. We arrived on a monday morning and it wasn't very busy. Yes some of the staff looked a little bored but hey they're human too.... Not much going on... chill We came out to the front of the casino across from Slots O Fun and Circus Circus. Opting to walk across and check out the casino's across the street just for fun. Circus Circus is very....... crowded. Signing up for players cards is of course quick and easy. Lunch at Rock N Ritas. not a bad place but to me the food was a little bland... (full disclosure I like some zing to my food). The pina colada my wife had was apparently a-ok! A quick walk back across the street and a line had formed for check in. Yes if you've read the reviews there is a wait to check in... However there is a wait at most LV hotels. That's the nature of the beast. Get over it, strike up a conversation with the people around you and chill. We checked in and was reassigned (by choice) to the Monaco tower. If you've read prior reviews this is the most up to date tower. It's nice. I recommend it (more in a bit). Bellhop service friendly and efficient (don't forget to tip). ROOM .. Our room was a normal hotel room sized king room. Bathroom small but efficient. Closet decent sized. Carpet, some wear but servicable. Bed comfy Serta. Tv, flat screen (32 inch maybe) countertops were marble and there is a refridgerator. The view was facing the pool and towards Las Vegas Blvd. They do offer room service. Things to know and to be warned of. They charge a \"resort fee\" (7 something a day per room). There is a safe in the room but they charge you a daily fee if you use it.. ($3.88). Yes they are nickel and dime fees but not too bad. Housecleaning staff .. quiet and efficient. (there is a tip envelope when you first come in, toss em $5.00 as a thanks for their often unappreciated hard work!) Food on site .. Various choices. A buffett (I didnt try it as there were so many bad comments, though you get a free buffet when you sign up for the players card. (A friend gave a specific and non repeatable comment about the poor taste of breakfast buffet.) Kadys .. Pretty good. I had a cheesesteak, my party had a french dip and the other a member had the meatloaf which looked, smelled and tasted awesome! There was a small deli area that I didn't try Off the the south of the casino (still inside, up a few steps and around the corner) is a food court. Jackpot inexpensive food right on site. The shops included, Indian, Burgers, Cheesesteak, Chinese, Wings, Pizza and mexican. The Cheesesteaks Etc offer a $5.99 breakfast special of a 3 egg omelett, toast, hash browns and side meat (bacon or ham) and a drink. Good solid way to start the day. (cheesesteaks were good too). Things to do.... You are in Vegas... there are unimaginable things to do. OK Get your Duece Pass (it's a double decker bus that runs up and down the strip and to other places in Vegas. Go to Freemont Street (old Vegas) . Go to Binions and get your free picture with $1,000,000.00 No fee. Walk up they take and print out the shot! Ride the zipline almost 2 blocks above Freemont. Hungry? Go to the 4 Queens. Sign up for their players club and take the coupon (2 for 1)to Magnolia Verandas. A $9.95 10 ounce prime rib with soup or salad (excellent gumbo) baked potato and carrots. Throw in a couple of sodas and you've spent less than 20 bucks and are WELL fed. Hop back on the Duece, Get off at Hoover St and walk a block to go to the world famous Gold and Silver Pawn shop (where they film Pawn Stars). Vegas is an interesting city. Lots to do from free to pay as you visit. Mix it up. I liked the Atomic Testing Museum. My wife enjoyed the Coke and M+M Stores. Our companion enjoyed the aquariums. Oh, fair warning if your easily offended there are card flippers along the strip. They hand out cards with less than fully clothed females that can come to your room. And there are newspaper racks of \"services magazines\". So shield their eyes and keep walking if the little ones are with you.... Oh and if you've read down to this part one last tip...

I was reluctant, but had a free weekend without my daughter and thought it was worth a shot. I used to like the Stardust and the old school vibe it had. Since it's gone there is really nothing left. So I thought. Arrived about 7pm on a Friday night and check-in was long. I located the host and he took me to his office. After only a couple minutes we were off to a room in the Monaco tower, I was told it was updated. He shows me the sparse casino with many blank areas, and very few tables. We see a rundown cafe and a bnunch of empty shops. We go through a couple towers, the original North tower, Monte Carlo and I am not impressed. These have 70's decor and rooms do have flat screens but it is in the honey oak setting with old drapes and colors and carpets. I was nervous. We pass the buffet and head up to 59. We arrive at a clean, sparse newish carpet, marble and clean contemporary hallway. Once in the room i am surprised!! King bed, pillow top, 32\" flat screen on dark wood with granite dresser thing, which housed a fridge. There was a comfy chair and ottoman,a desk and safe. The safe does cost $3.77 a day to use, and not covered in the $7.88 resort fee. The bathroom is tiny but updated nicely. Smelled and looked good. For the right price I will be back. Just keep in mind it is only close to Circus Circus and Slots a fun. THATS IT. Its $9 to Pallazzo via taxi. So if you need to be at Caesars, it will run like $12.

I was hotel hopping during my stay in Vegas. Looking for a more reasonable rate, I decided to Priceline a hotel. I knew that I would never want to stay at the Riviera, but unfortunately that is what Priceline awarded me. You have no idea how disappointed I was. Firs, the line for check-in was TERRIBLE. I stood in line for about 1.5 hours. I was there so long that my cell phone battery died while I played games to amuse myself. I started to check my bags at the bell stand and wait until later, but the bell hop advised me that the line would get even longer as the day progressed. I had no choice but to wait. I will admit that I am no gambler, but the presentation of the casino area was a huge turn off. It smelled of smoke. Everything looked beyond its prime and outdated. Even the dealers looked like they'd been rode hard and put away wet. By the time I finally got up to my room, I was worn out. I was on the 6th floor of the South Tower, I believe. I can't remember now. I think I've blocked it out. The elevator smelled. The hallway was disgusting, littered with garbage people had thoughtlessly left behind. Housekeeping was still on the floor attending to rooms, but I'm sure that poor woman was swamped. When I entered my room, the only happiness I felt was that it was large and spacious. The outdated decor was depressing, but I don't usually get hung up on stuff like that. The bathroom was very small. The tub was absolutely filthy. It looked like the tarmac at JFK. I went out into the hallway to get the housekeeper and she informed me, \"The black stuff won't come off. I'll be glad to scrub at it for you so you can see, but it's not going anywhere.\" Totally gross. The bed was moderately comfortable. I did sleep so I can't complain about that. But I will admit that I did not enjoy staying here. The place is just not really my scene. I believe it is for the older crowd that smokes 2 packs a day. An added annoyance is that the resort fee does not appear to actually include anything. Many hotels charge the annoying resort fee but there is usually something you get for it. At Riviera, the resort fee does not include internet or gym usage. I found myself wondering what the up charge was for. Overall, I would not recommend. This place is not romantic so it is not for couples. It's not swinging and hip, so it's not for singles. You could bring your family here but do you really want to expose your children to this sort of filth? I mean, whatever floats your boat but it is not recommended in my opinion.", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ardmore, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cNot the best choice\u201d", "Author": "oksooner1", "ReviewID": "UR114722219", "Content": "This property has several things going against it. First is its location. It is far removed from the majority of other well known strip properties. Sure you can catch a cheap bus (and we did), sure you can walk (and we did) but bottom line you are not centrally located in a town where being central means being close to the action. Second, the hotel and the casino are dated. Think 1970 - 1980. Both were good decades and it might even be possible for the Riviera to capitalize on the retro look but instead it just feels old and worn. Third, the rooms are OK, but just OK. We stayed in a \"Signature Room\" in the Monaco Tower - supposedly remodeled - and really not bad. However, the safe didn't work in one of my rooms - they moved me. The air conditioner didn't work well in that room - they fixed it (which was great) - then the tub wouldn't drain- just one thing after another. I've got to believe that for a few more dollars you could stay in a nicer place and reduce these kinds of issues. Fourth, they charge a \"resort fee\" - a $7 charge to the room rate, per day. Perhaps it is semantics but I would have felt better just paying an extra $7 because the Riviera is not a resort by any stretch of the imagination. The pool is OK, but again just OK. I am unaware of any other amenities offered - no free wifi, a charge to use the in room safe, etc. Finally, they have a policy that if you have food delivered to your room from an \"outside\" source, say a late night pizza, they will charge you $500. This is small print \"gotcha\" kind of gouging at its worst. Perhaps other Vegas properties have this policy, perhaps not, but only by fortunate accident did I even discover this. Incredibly, in both rooms I had during my stay this week there were \"outside\" pizza fliers that had been slipped under my doors. If the hotel is so hardline against other food being delivered to the rooms then they should take proactive steps against these kinds of advertisements. One the plus side I found the staff there to be hardworking and friendly. Whenever I needed something I felt like they tried to take care of me. There just weren't enough of them. Check in was very slow - each person working behind the desk was working quickly but management has not scheduled enough workers. Calling the front desk was very time consuming. Most of the time I gave up before the phone was answered. Again, not enough workers. Going back to Vegas I'll choose another place to stay.

The problems are too numerous to profile in one review and started the minute I arrived for check-in. I attended a convention in Las Vegas this weekend and the Riviera had great rates and was close by the venue. First of all, I booked and PAID for my room several weeks in advance requesting TWO beds in a NON smoking room. When I arrived to check-in at 10pm on a Saturday night, there were TWO check-in attendants and over EIGHTY (80) people in line! The attendants were in no hurry to attend to these guests - so I used my cell phone (while in line) to call the night time manager and ask why they were so under staffed a the check-in counter that evening. Believe it or not, the manager said, \"Oh, I guess most of the employees didn't show up, I didn't realize there was a problem! I'll send a few more people out in a minute to help.\" Ten minutes later, one elderly man (who must've been on his break)_shuffled into the terminal to help the two overburdened check-in clerks but that was it. The average wait period to check-in was an hour and a half. A nearby self serve check-in kiosk offered up guests nothing but confusing and incorrect information. If you entered your information into this system, it supposedly located your room and would issue a ticket to you for a $30 per day extra fee! (Either you agree to this or stand in line all night, was the premise). However, at the check-in desk, I learned that even this information was misleading and that the eventual fee to be charged would be $50 per day extra! In every way - this hotel is abhorrently awful and I would NEVER recommend this place. I could tell that the staff members were used to complaints and chastisements from customers; they all seemed totally immune to and anesthetized to every valid and outrageous call that I had to make. I'm certain the management is aware of all this - don't stay here!!! When it was finally my turn to check in (an hour later) I was told there were no more NON smoking rooms available NOR rooms w/two beds! When I complained that I'd paid (in full) in advance, I was told, \"Well, that payment only guarantees a room with us - not necessarily one to your specifications.\" (huh???) Try telling that to an airline if you prepay for a flight (\"We only guaranteed you a seat - not necessarily to your requested destination.\") When we were finally sent to our SMOKING suite with only ONE bed - the room was FILTHY!!! Room service hadn't attended to this room since the last guest(s) left! By now it was almost 1AM and I called the front desk SCREAMING to speak to the manager again. We were eventually shuffled off to a clean, NON smoking room w/one large bed. Fair enough - that would have to do for the night. However, we requested a fold out bed to compensate for not getting our PAID FOR IN ADVANCE - two bed suite; and despite making SIX phone calls to the manager and then house keeping about this - the bed never arrived! Also, the cleaning crew never cleaned our room ONCE despite repeatedly phone calls to Housekeeping. Finally, I went in SEARCH of a domestic pushing a cleaning cart and demanded new towels and that our room be cleaned. I felt like I was in the twilight zone with these people... Each and every person whom I complained loudly and often to said the same thing to me, \"Ma'am, we'll get on this right away!\" Yet failed to show up to clean, to bring the folding bed AND clean towels....", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGood Value, Subpar Service\u201d", "Author": "kgnvu", "ReviewID": "UR114587368", "Content": "We were on a bachelor/bachelorette party weekend, so no one was looking for luxury, but we did upgrade to the Signature suites of the hotel (hoping that would be a bit better).

The hotel is located at the bottom end of the Strip but still within reasonable walking distance of all the other hotels in the strip. Although being 6 months pregnant I couldn't manage it as often as I would have liked so we relied on the Deuce buses every day. I read that if you flash a $20.00 note in front of the receptionist when checking in you could get an upgraded room. Well I did this at the Riviera also commenting that I was six months pregnant and I managed to bag us an upgrade to a room with a view over the strip that would have cost us another $200 dollars extra per week, but we got it for free. So its definitely worth trying to bag yourself an upgrade with a bit of charm and courtesy. The room was very comfortable, although the air con a tad noisy. The kingsized bed was huge, high and probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. There was a flat screen TV, ipod docking station and the room attendent added a little touch by shaping the tissues in the box into a rose bud every day. The only down sides to our stay was we were not informed by our travel agent that a week into our stay 4000 Celtic fans checked in for a week for their annual conference and basically took over the hotel. They crowded the pool area every day taking up all the sun loungers with none left for other guests, and were singing and partying every night by the pool. The pool is not the best in the strip, pretty plain and boring compared to all the other pools we saw. If you want a pool party every night, stay at Treasure Island. We also had a connecting door from our room into next door and one evening our neighbours came back drunk and had an argument that was rather loud. The other thing was the room we were allocated, although comfortable, was located on the top floor of the Monaco Tower a level below the ball room. When staff were preparing the ball room for a party / entertainment they would do it at 7.00am when we were still asleep, and they were dragging furniture across the floor, banging and generally noisy, disturbing our sleep. When the ball room was in use in the evening the music and noise could be clearly heard till at least midnight. So tip is ask not to be put in a room below the ball room. Overall our trip was fun and enjoyable and the staff lovely, especially in the casino, poker area. Remember if you play poker or sat at the bar playing the gambling machines, your alcoholic drinks are free. I could not take advantage of this being pregnant!!

We were a bit concerned given the cheap cost of the hotel however we were pleasantly surprised by the standard we found at the hotel.

Our room was cleaned every day and was always done to a high standard. The hotel itself is clearly one of the older on the strip, however this was quite endearing. There were lots of facilities on site for food and drink, as well as its own wedding chapel and tattoo parlour!! But close by there was a McDonalds, Dennys and 7/11 for all your other needs. The Peppermill was great for a hearty breakfast and i'd definitely recommend this! The location of the hotel was around a 15 minute walk from the start of the main strip, which in the heat of the day could get quite unbearable, thankfully the Deuce which ran up and down the strip all day was a welcome relief - although sometimes taking around the same time in the traffic it was air conditioned and very useful for those late night returns to the hotel! The pool area was reasonable, although more of a sports centre pool than a holiday pool it was relatively quiet midweek, with the weekends seeming to become a hub for younger people and families packing out the sunloungers (weekend visitors). Overall i'd say the Riviera hotel is a great place for a cheap n cheerful stay. Its clean and tidy and on par with some British 3* hotels for its level of comfort and standard.

There is a Deuce bus service which we used when we didn't fancy the stroll down to the main attractions in the searing heat, this came every few minutes and cost $7 for a 24 hour pass. We paid next to nothing for the hotel part of our trip and after reading some mixed reviews on here we were unsure of what to expect. We said 'as long as its clean we'll be happy' as you don't spend all that long in your hotel. We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the Riviera, the rooms were better than described and were very modern with flatscreen tvs and ipod docks. They also contained a good sized fridge and a safety deposit box (be warned though that the deposit box charges $3.50 a day when locked and that is not always publicised). In terms of cleanliness the rooms were spotless and could not be faulted. The only issue we had was that our shower water pressure was rubbish and we had to move rooms, but their service was still very good. They located all 8 of us in rooms very close to each other even though we had all booked seperately, which was very accomodating. The pool at the hotel wasn't the biggest I had ever seen but it was clean and well observed by lifeguards. There were plenty of sun loungers and always clean towels on hand. They played music by the pool which was fine and there was a waitress service for drinks. Prior to arriving in Vegas we purchased Groupon vouchers for the Queen Victoria Pub as we thought we would use them to drink (as we get enough English grub at home!). The staff there were very friendly and accomodating and we had no trouble spending our vouchers. We both drank and ate there and we had no complaints at all.

The casino was much like any other in Vegas, full of slots etc. However as it was not a massive expensive hotel the minimum bets were not too massive and Slots a Fun was across the road and this was also excellent value for money.

My adult son and I were traveling together and arrived in Las Vegas late evening. We had to stand in line to check in. When I stepped up to check in they indicated that I would receive a King size bed. I told them that I had requested two double beds in my room when I booked. They told me that what you book is not guaranteed and you get what is available when you check in. I told them I had to have double beds. They told me the only had non-smoking double bed rooms. I asked them about my package could they upgrade me to a suite. They had no clue or record of the package....I came to find out that is some gimmick.....you don't really get anything special with the online package. They told me they had a suite with double beds but I would have to pay extra and it was not clean....we would have to wait two hours. It was already 10 p.m. local time and we had flown in from the Eastern time zone so were tired. I complained about having to pay for the upgrade since they did not have the room I requested. They told me that I could check the next day about moving to another room. I finally gave up because I was ready to get in a room. We went to the bell stand to store our luggage for the two hours we had to wait but were told that they would take our suitcases but not my rolling case that contained my laptop because they had had problems with theft in their bell stand and would not take responsibility for holding laptops. So for two hours I had to drag around my rolling case in the casino. We checked on getting the buy one show ticket get one free at the place they directed us but because we were not officially checked in we could not get any ticket deals. When we did go back to check in, I was fed up and complained more about the room situation with a different clerk. This clerk agreed to give us the suite at no extra charge for the first night and we could switch the next day....I told her that I would prefer not to change rooms and if I was going to have to do that I would go to another hotel. She finally agreed not to charge extra for the suite upgrade. We got our room keys and went to the room. As we approached our room, we noticed a housekeeping cart sitting beside our room door and the door propped open. When we entered the room we found two housekeeping employees sitting in the room chatting with the phone off the hook. I asked them if they were through with the room and they were rude. Would not let us in the room unless I gave them my key so they could verify that it was actually my room. I called down to the front desk to complain about this after they finally left our room. The room was just average. Nothing special....very low budget. The beds were very comfortable but that was the only positive. Next time I visit Las Vegas I will not try to find a deal in an older hotel but pay more and get the better service. I was completely appalled at their lack of customer service.

I really wanted to like the Riviera. This was my 3rd trip to Vegas, and I\u2019ve stayed at hotels center-Strip and the Riviera end. Even though it\u2019s very far from most of the Strip action, I\u2019ve always liked the idea of \u201cOld Vegas.\u201d Never again. There were so many issues, I will bullet them out. \u2022 Was told at check in no room upgrades were available (hard to believe, they don\u2019t want our money?) \u2022 The minuscule bathroom was falling apart. Literally. I turned on the faucet and the ceramic came off both knobs. Really? Crazy Glue can fix that. The tub was scratched and pockmarked, and drained at a snail\u2019s pace. The door did not open all the way and hit the sink. \u2022 All but 2 electrical outlets were disabled and covered over with plastic. Forget about trying to charge electronic devices or hairstyling items simultaneously. A cheap way to save electricity. \u2022 The air conditioning controls were hidden, and could only be opened with a nail file (thank God I had one). \u2022 When I called the front desk to ask where the AC controls were before I found them, I gave up after 25 minutes on hold. \u2022 Woke up to use the bathroom at night to find cockroaches in the tub. Awesome. \u2022 Breakfast buffet was mediocre, and had run out of omelets/any made to order items by 8 am. \u2022 We were given an adjoining room to another guest, and even with the door closed and towels shoved under the door, we could hear every word they said until they stopped partying at 5 am. I get it, it\u2019s Vegas and people come to party. But if we weren\u2019t invited, we shouldn\u2019t have had to go. Most decent hotels have double or reinforced doors to adjoining rooms for that very reason; not this Hotel. \u2022 Most of the clientele appeared to be over 50/Seniors, or families from other countries. Which is fine, but not what I was looking for, because I am not in either category. If you are looking to meet, drink and mingle, this property isn\u2019t for you. The gaming floor was just kinda\u2026depressing for that reason. \u2022 The pool has no Jacuzzi/hot tub. Neither does the health club (no sauna either), which makes the resort fee silly and just an unnecessary revenue generator. \u2022 Inquired about late check- out, and was brusquely told by the front desk \u201cthere isn\u2019t any.\u201d When I pointed out the sign that said \u201cAsk about our Late Check Out!\u201d, the clerk said we could check out at noon, or stay until 6 PM an pay another $30; basically another weekday rate night\u2019s stay. No thanks. \u2022 Because we were offered no late check-out, my companion and I had to wait 2 hours for our shuttle to the airport in the lobby, lugging our luggage with us. We ordered soft drinks from the coffee bar and tried to sit at one of the patio tables in the English Pub (there were a dozen empty tables and 3 couples eating on the inside, one on the patio). The hostess immediately ran over and rudely chased us out, saying that if we weren\u2019t eating, we had to leave. Luckily, after some wandering around we found a food court on the sidewalk adjacent to the hotel with open seating, where that lovely woman could have directed us. But that would have been the nice thing to do. No reason to accommodate us after we paid our money. \u2022 The positives I will say was that the beds were new and comfortable and bedding was clean, and the employees at the on-site convenience store were very nice and helpful. To close, I guess you get what you pay for, but I expected better than what we got. We still paid a premium rate for Sunday night, and that makes the above unacceptable. Unless the Riviera plans some major renovations soon, do yourself a favor and pay the extra $20 a night and stay at one of the newer or renovated hotels.

I have to admit i wasn't expecting much as it was the cheapest room rate out of all the casinos for a Friday night. On entering the casino i was surprised at how nice it smelled, normally the older casinos have that lived in cigarette smoke stench, but everything was clean and well looked after. We walked to the check in desk but the queue was impossibly long so thanks to a review on here, i knew about the check in machines in the hallways. I can highly recommend them, the process was quick and easy; and saved us about an hour waiting in line (we had tickets to a concert and were running late!) Our room was in the Monaco tower on the 43rd floor, again the corridor smelt clean and the decor looked quite new. The room itself was very well furnished with two double beds, a decent sized TV and fridge...although there was no mini bar! The room was spotless, and the sheets on the beds were clean and crisp! The bathroom was a standard hotel setup, with a few toiletries. Nothing exciting but again clean and well maintained. I seriously would recommend this hotel, it's cheap and old but has been well refurbished. Also the Queen Victoria Pub does a stonking good breakfast and if you are a Las Vegas local they give you 10% off the bill! The only down side is that it is a LONG walk to the center of the Strip, and not one i would recommend while wearing 3 inch heels!", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Annapolis, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "lombaowski", "ReviewID": "UR104280888", "Content": "I had heard mixed reviews about this place but decided to give it a try.

Casino has a mix of table games and the atmosphere is busy but not over the top like the IP or one of the swank joints that cost north of $500 a night. Dealers, staff, management and shop keepers were all polite and friendly. Sports book was actually really nice but the bar in there was never open, you couldn't get a drink and they didn't even offer simple bets like puckline bets (they would have taken my money on the bet I wanted to make).

My fiance and I have been to Vegas several times but neither had ever stayed at the Riviera. This trip was to celebrate my son's 21st birthday and his first trip to Vegas. I booked online about a month prior to our arrival date and the confirmation page indicated the booking was through a place called Tourico. We received a great deal on the room. After booking the room, the confirmation page stated that despite the fact that I indicated there would be 3 guests in the room, that we may be assigned to a room with only one bed! The confirmation also stated that 72 hour advanced notice was necessary to cancel reservations without penalty. I immediately called the hotel to ask if I should cancel the online reservation and book through the hotel direct. I was told that the reservation would not show up on their system until 3 days prior to the reservation date. So much for no penalty! I sent an email to the hotel hoping to receive a response from an Eloise Orndoff (Management) of the Riviera. I noticed that she had responded to negative reviews on Trip Advisor and thought I would give it a try. I received no response to my email. I ended up calling the hotel 72 hours in advance and indicated that I would need a room with 2 beds, which request was thankfully granted. The front desk person was extremely friendly and check-in was quick and easy despite the fact that there were only 2 individuals behind the front desk at the time (we arrived at 11:00 p.m. on a Friday night). When I opened the door to our room, the smell of cigarette smoke was overwhelming. The room looked clean, the bathroom was clean but there was no refrigerator, which would have been nice (or nice to know that we would not have one in our room). The room was nothing fancy but we could live with it as we weren't planning on spending much time in the room anyway. So I decided to let the smell of the room and the \"no fridge\" slide as to not ruin my son's birthday. We had a great time in Vegas despite some of the downfalls of the room. We decided to drive to Valley of Fire just outside of Vegas. A very friendly valet provided us with directions and insight regarding the Valley of Fire and Lake Mead, which was absolutely breathtaking. Our last night was wanted to go to the Riviera Comedy Club. I asked a person behind a small desk across from the front desk about where I could purchase tickets to the show for that evening. She stated she does not sell tickets, but gives them away. She then asked when we were leaving and I stated the next morning. She replied \"I don't have any tickets to give to you.\" She was trying to get us to sit in on one of those time-share scams for the free tickets. The thing is, I just wanted to purchase tickets, not receive free tickets after sitting for hours in a boring, high-pressured sales presentation. Needless to say, I wasn't going to purchase the tickets after the treatment I received from this individual. The night prior to check-out, I asked the front desk if we could just leave the keys in the room as our room was prepaid. The person at the front desk indicated I could check-out via the television which seemed convenient. The next morning I tried to check-out via the television and noticed that there were charges on my bill for each day of our stay for Safe Rental. We did not use the safe in our room so I immediately called the front desk. They indicated that I would have to come down to the front desk to have these charges removed. So much for convenience! I went downstairs to the front desk and indicated that the safe rental charges should be removed as we did not use the safe. Granted, these fees were minimal but I am not going to pay for something I did not use. The front desk person said no problem and removed the fees. He provided me with a receipt as to the charges that were incurred, which I agreed to. Upon returning home, I looked at my bank account online and noticed that I was not charged the amount indicated on my receipt...but was charged more!!!! In addition to the charge, they also had a \"pending transaction\" of $60 on my account for who knows what! I immediately called the hotel (after waiting 27 minutes on hold) only to receive voice mail. The voice mail indicated that if this call is placed prior to 2:00 p.m. Vegas time (which it was) that I would receive a response that same day. It is now day 2 after my trip and no response. I called again only to receive voice mail again. The charge to my credit card in excess of the charge indicated on my receipt has been processed through my bank and the $60 charge is still on hold in my pending transactions. I suggest if you plan on staying at the Riviera do NOT use a credit card and pay in CASH!!!", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cThe room was fine for the price we paid.\u201d", "Author": "nicolediane", "ReviewID": "UR103802686", "Content": "We had a nice room overlooking the pool.

I understand that most of the employees are older, but most of them are also plan rude. To begin with, neither my wife or I made these reservations, since we usually stay at another hotel in town. Upon our arrival we were met by the vallet, Ron, who so was very nice with a warm smile and a pleasure to talk with. Once inside and as we made our way to the reservations desk the couple we were with noticed the hotel smelled like smoke, but I didn't notice it. The wait at the desk was not a long one, as others have spoke of, but the lady working the desk must have slept in one of the hotels beds because she was not in a good mood at all. When the reservations were made we requested a king sized bed, but of course, they didn't have any so we were given two \"queen\" beds. Once in the room I noticed the room was very old looking and the beds were not \"queens\" by any means. When we requested our luggae brought up to the room it was as if the bellmen had read my mind, because he was there very quickly. In the casino the employees are mostly friendly, but nothing that stands out. Sleeping, or should I say the lack of sleeping, is something you are faced with since the beds are small and very uncomfortable. The air conditioning was just as mean as the employees, working only when it wanted to. The drain in the shower was pluged, but we worked with that. We ate at the buffet the next morning and again the lady at the cash register must live at the hotel, because she was as grumpy as the rest of the employees there. The food at the buffet was no prize either. We paid for the champagne brunch and had to ask for the champagne three times, only to be told it wasn't ready yet. We sat down at the bar on Saturday before heading to dinner at another location and the bartender couldn't smile if his life depended on it. Also, when he was told that he got our drink order wrong, we were told that we were wrong not he. The second night we were again faced with no sleeping and my wife even tryed the other bed, which she said was better, but not great. Again, as we checked out, there were those vallets and bellman who were very friendly and great to talk to. I know this hotel is 54 years old, but some upgrading would be great.

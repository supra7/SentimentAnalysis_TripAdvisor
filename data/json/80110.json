Also on saturday the st Patricks Parade, we did not go to the real center of the parade, but saw al around us green, green and green. happy people enjoying that day for the 251st time. Even by taxi it is not far away from Soho, Central Park, meatpacking district with the High Line, of wherever in manhattan. It was 3 years ago we were in NY, as I was operated at one knee, and even now it was a bit more difficult, but in NY you find allover the city seating possibilities, or inside a shop, so I could rest for some minutes. the bed of the Roger was very comfortable and high, nice sheets and cushions, the bathroom had all ammenities needed, a good shower, enough place to put the things we need in a bathroom. For one reason or another we received 3 breakfast for two complimentary, what was very welcome, and nice breakfasts, just what we needed, served at the Mezanine, with a nice view over the crossing of 31st and madison, very nice decorated. A friendly Doorman, who used to open the door coming in or out, taking care about luggage and looking for Taxi. Checking in and out was very fast. The service at breakfast was good, we had twice simple dinner at the Mezanine too, very good, and very friendly servicer again.

She said adjacent, which I took to mean adjoining, but didn't. When I arrived at the hotel, the person who greeted us also looked at the request on my form and said, \"we've put the two rooms right together.\" Well, we went upstairs and the rooms were sequentially numbered, but one was down the hall and around the corner from the other. OK, that wasn't a big deal, but it was the difference for me between feeling comfortable having the 2 bigger kids in one room alone (versus wanting to divide the parents into 2 rooms) and the difference between putting all of the stuff in one suitcase vs. not. Also, there was a maid's closet in between, and every time the maid rummaged in closet in the middle of the night, I woke up and wondered whether something was awry in our other room! I really could have lived with it if one hotel person had said, \"oh sorry, we didn't have anything right next door\". But instead, I just felt they were lazy-- not knowing the layout of their own hotel! The hotel was fine. The beds are pushed against the wall, because the rooms are small. The carpeting, etc. is a bit shopworn, but not bad. One of our rooms had ink scribbles all over the desk-- some child had scribbled on it and the hotel had left it there. The bathrooms are SMALL (at least they were in our rooms). There was one small-ish window. I actually kind of liked they way they covered the windows with Japanese screens that you could slide aside.

We didn't have a view but we were only there to sleep and shower, not to sit and watch the world go by. The rooms were well maintained, clean and the beds were very comfy. The bathroom was probably the smallest I've seen outside of Europe but it didn't bother me. The only thing we did not like was that breakfast in the amazingly small (for a 14 floor hotel) breakfast area where we had a buffett style breakfast that was so overpriced it was laughable(ended up paying $44.00 for 2 of us) We also had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated. There are many restaraunts around (1 is across the street) that provide a more reasononably priced menu. The other thing was that the room was very stuffy(the cool fan wasn't doing it's job).

Since this was going to be the trip where I was going to propose to my future wife, travelling all the way from Greece and having booked the flights early enough, I wanted to make sure that everything was going to be exactly as I had it in mind. This is the point where the hotel staff gets into play. I have no words for Shane and Leslie who have done a wonderful job in preparing everything to perfection. We have met Leslie in person who is a lovely young lady with a smile always on her face -- she took care of everything including a room upgrade, the room decoration for the \"special\" night, as well as keeping my mail until our arrival. I cannot thank her enough! From a practical aspect, the hotel is centrally located at 31st and Madison, making it a perfect hotspot for exploring the city. It's about 15-20 minutes walk from Times Sq. or $8 cab ride. Taxis are cheap which means that even if you are exhausted after a full day of walking up and down the city, you can grab a cab and be back at the hotel, cheaply enough. The room itself was gorgeous, with a splendid corner view and a huge bed! All in all, having been in NYC a couple of times, this has been my most memorable of all, and for sure the hotel itself, as well as its staff has a played a major part in it. Needless to day that next time we are in NYC, Leslie will be the first person to ring up to secure a room!

We didn't try the facilities in the hotel as we were close enough to walk and find deli's and cafe's for breakfast. Location was perfect - a few minutes walk away from the Empire State Building (highly, highly recommend buying an express ticket online before you go - you jump the queue and save about 2 hours!). We walked from Times Square to the hotel late one night and it felt long, even though its probably only about 15 mins. Cab fare to most places we went was $10-$15. We also did a 3 day hop on hop off bus tour - well worth the extra $$ for the 3 day pass as you save on admission to lots of attractions. The bus stop is at the Empire State Building, so a very convenient way to start the day. Could go on and on about the location - really it's just perfect.

As most hotels in New York that have a central location in Manhattan, it is expensive, but you can definitely also pay more for the same level of hotel.

If you want shower gel etc., which is usually provided in small containers for free at hotels, they will charge you for it, only the soap is free.

Caf\u00c3\u00a9 28 on the corner of 28th street/5th Avenue is more of a supermarket and deli with a couple of tables to sit, and not exactly a quiet place, but it has an excellent selection of food for breakfast, so if you don\u00c2\u00b4t mind the noise, it is a good place to go as an alternative to the hotel breakfast.

The moment i entered the room one thing i noticed was that the room was smaller than expected, though it had all amenities and a TV which did not have much channels, but the room was cozy with a nice view of the city from the window, which made me forget the room size :). Then next morning i had to order breakfast as it was not included in my room tariff. The breakfast was amazing for 15$ with a fruit bowl, bread and coffee. Overall the staff were well mannered and respectful. The rooms were small but it was worth for the money i paid and was cozy too.

I feel a bit torn because on the one hand, I feel like the hotel intentionally tried to take advantage of me, but on the other hand, the staff was extremely attentive and friendly. While there were certain flaws in the room--overflowing shower and ineffective air conditioning--the room itself was extremely comfortable and modern. So here's my story: Upon checking in, the clerk couldn't find reservation. I said, \"Maybe that's because we booked through Travelocity.\" Next words out of her mouth: \"Oh, there's an $18 service fee.\" I asked what the fee was for. She said, \"Hotel taxes and fees,\" implying that they were just standard NYC hotel charges. I knew I'd already paid all NYC taxes, so I said I would be extremely upset if she charged me taxes again. She then said, \"Well it is for service fees; the fine print on Travelocity tells you there are hotel service fees.\" I again objected. She said, \"I'd hate for you not to stay here because of this fee.\" I took this to mean that if I didn't agree to it, I'd not be allowed to stay at the hotel. This put a sour taste in my mouth for the entire evening. The clerk said she'd see if the manager could take the fee off and told me she upgraded my room. I was required to sign something saying that the hotel reserves the right to charge an 18 dollar \"service fee.\" However, there was no explanation as to what the \"service\" was. I suspect the fee is only levied on Travelocity customers so that the hotel can recoup its listing fees. The upgraded room was a corner room on the 14th floor with a sliver of a view from each window of the top of the Empire State Building. The amenities were comfortable and modern. The bed and pillows slept great. There were two flaws in the room, though--the rainfall shower water ran out and into rest of bathroom, soaking the bath mat and the A/C was ineffective in 3 digit heat in the evening. By the morning it had cooled comfortably, but it took a while. At checkout the clerk tried to charge me the service fee.

I am not as enthusiastic about it has he, but it's not bad by the standards of Manhattan mid-priced hotels. I've been to a number of them recently, and all have major faults. Let's start with the bad. The room upon first exposure was too hot, and the air conditioning is noisy so that it really wasn't possible to cool it down until I left for dinner. The window is behind the bed, so it can't be readily reached to be open. The window shade isn't totally light-proof, so the room is dimly illuminated all day. The bathroom sink is extremely small, and crowded with useless items for sale, so it's hard to even put a glass on it. The TV is just horrible. Although the TV's hi-def, the hotel only supplies traditional analog channels, so the pictures are lousy. Some channels are missing, leaving hissing spaces when one moves from channel to channel. The hotel claims 24 hour room service, but strangely it is not available between 11:00PM and midnight. There is an apparently undocumented $8 service charge for room service, so the breakfast one thought was $12 ended up costing nearly $25 when that charge and taxes were added. The room was clean, but the housekeeping staff neglected to provide wash cloths and Kleenex on the second night. Now the good. The wireless internet is free and is reasonably speedy at 2.5 Mbs for both up and downloading. However, on the first night, the speed was so slow as to make the service close to unusable. The staff was friendly, with nice touches like providing in-room umbrellas for use during rainy days. The provided robe was comfortable and of ample size. The bed was comfortable and the room decently large. The closet was small, but there were provided a satisfactory number of removable hangers.

I had a wonderful view of a wall twenty feet outside my window, but that doesn't bother me. The location is not great. I felt safe but it seemed off the beaten track. I think if the room and especially the bathroom were a reasonable size compared to other NYC hotels I would have enjoyed my stay more. I had planned to do some work in my room but I felt too closed in and only spent a few hours sleeping at night in the room over the 3 day stay. The staff seemed great. Pleasant all the time. Not a place I would return on my next visit. They tack on an $18 daily fee to use the Internet and other services.

We really enjoyed the Madison Square Park close by where my son played for hours on two of our days, I am grateful for the front desk for telling me about it. We ate in two restaurants suggested by the staff and both were perfect and within short walking distance from the hotel. Right off I was pleased, as when I asked about parking, I was told that the valet was $60 per night for our SUV, but if we were good w/ walking two blocks we could park for $22 per night w/ hotel validation! that's a pretty significant savings and it was not inconvenient at all... when we picked up the car, it was only $20 per night.

I did not choose the hotel, I stayed on a group rate of $199 for a conference that was near by. When I made my reservation I asked for a high floor away from the elevators. When I checked in, they had a room with my preferences but after reading the great tip on a previous Tripadvisor review, I decided to ask for a room with a shower stall instead of the shower/tub combo which I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stand. They gave it to me and I went up to see it. The bathroom was really nice, but it had 2 full beds when I wanted only one. The front desk said all the rooms with the shower stall have 2 beds. So I was moved to room 405 which was smaller but has a nice large bed and a flat screen TV (the shower stall room did not). I was worried about being on such a low floor but I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear any street noise. It was the noise from inside the hotel that I should have been worried about. The other rooms were a bit noisy, with doors slamming early in the morning. One other thing is that the window coverings are a bit odd. There is a sliding screen in front of the small window which blocks a lot of light, but I guess provides more privacy. Also note, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide body wash (just soap) and there are no luggage racks in the room (apparently, nor in the entire hotel) so suitcase must be kept on the floor. Safe is also too small for even my tiny laptop. On a positive note, they allowed me a late checkout: 1:30 which was very nice. I agree with other reviewers who said the staff goes out of their way to make you happy.

I did peek into another room on my floor and noticed that it had a shower instead of a tub...and the bathroom by default seemed larger.

You have to use your room key for the elevator--great touch.

The front desk was exceptional. They even asked if we prefer higher or lower floors. A few minuets after we were in our room the front desk phoned to make sure we were happy.

If either my husband or myself were very large people or had a handicapped in anyway there is no way you could manage this bathroom.. It would also be very challaging to manage with children. I doubt we would book this room for more then one or two nights because of the very small bathroom as there is no place to put anything on its counter. We stayed in room 603.

It was kind of last minute. Orbitz had a special with it running at $150 a night. For being in the city that seemed great, and so I booked it right away. It's about a mile and a half away from the Convention Center but that was fine, I know the Javits doesnt really have much around it so I didnt want to stay near that area I'd rather stay further inland. Enter the Roger Williams. I checked-in and realized I actually was so rushed that I booked it for the wrong dates on Orbitz. Ooops. The person at the desk was super helpful, we thought we'd be so screwed but they had us check-in and told us they would sort it with Orbitz, no worries. I've never had hotel front desk personel be this cordial and accomidating. So definately a huge star for saving the day on that one. We checked in early to boot, so it was just above and beyond what I was expecting. Even more rare for it being in NY where people are generally impatient and pushy (sorry to any local NYers.) Anyway we checked-in, the room was pretty well laid out and comfortable. It wasnt a huge room but the furniture was modern and well chosen so the short footprint of the room size was not that noticeable due to the furniture that didnt crowd the room or become too bare and jail-cell like. The TV could use some modern touch. It seemed like an akward mix to have an older TV amongst a room with a modern flair. We didnt use the TV at all because we were out and about but that was my main gripe about it. Most hotels, even lower scale travel lodges have flat panel tv's these days. Minor gripe. The bathroom was a bit too tight for my liking. The sink was like just barely squeezed in. I suppose this leads to a bigger space for the room itself but even still. It felt a little too close to the toilet. Other than that the room was comfortable and fine. They had some Japanese sliding screens covering the windows, I thought it was a unique touch and way of covering a typical unexciting view of a building next door. The room is very well lit so you dont actually feel claustrophobic. If you did, you chould easily just slide them out and let in the sunlight, or rather the shade from the other building. The internet was free and worked flawlessly. They also have laptops near the lobby that are free to use. They have quite a few of them so you could get by not having a laptop if you just need to check your mail/google something real quick. My only reason for giving this establishment a 4 out of 5 is that the breakfast buffet is too bare for 18.00. For that much money, id expect custom omlettes or pancakes. None of those are available. You have scrambled eggs or sausage and thats about it as far as warm food goes. They had fruits, muffins, and bagels, nothing that really warranted almost 20 dollars. My suggestion would be to skip the breakfast and walk out of the hotel to one of the nearby diners. You'll save some money and probably enjoy better food. Definately a better selection of warm food. The wait staff was occassionally there for you. Sometimes you'd have to refill your coffee yourself.. sometimes they would come around and ask you. Inconsistent. I would stay again due to the great value you get at $150 a night. The room is great, the bed is great and you are within walking distance of all the things the heart of the city has to offer.

This seemed like a better deal than $250 per night for a standard room plus at least $45 per night for parking and $16 each for breakfast. We were greeted at the sidewalk, the doorman had the car valet parked. Check-in was easy and fast.

One of us was working, the other taking a few days to rediscover Manhattan. Having spent a lot of time in NYC and being pretty well traveled, I was sceptical of what this property had to offer before we showed up. The website is a classic example of something trying too hard and just not making it. Compared to \"classic\" boutique hotels such as the Soho Grand, the Mondrian in L.A., well, there is no comparison. And the location in midtown is by no means the best that the city has to offer. Then there is the staff. At one point, we commented that it felt as if someone had bought a hotel and turned it over to a group of students to operate. We live in Europe and are used to, perhaps, a higher level of service - but regardless of where one lives, a certain level of professionalism is expected and this was often missing at this property. In general, too much \"chit chat\", especially when guests were in ear shot; typical for a New York bar maybe, but not at a hotel. That being said, most of the staff were very friendly and welcoming: the doormen were gracious (but should take it as a given to help with the bags); the staff at breakfast were, on the whole, wonderful in dealing with early morning grumps; the cleaning staff were thorough and charming; the staff at reception were generally competent and added a tough of, shall we say, New York color to the experience. The hotel has a nice fitness room which is open 24 hours and which is usually empty. Breakfast is very good. The room decor is truly not to everyone's taste. Tacky, to be honest. If you like the Paul Smith logo (multi colored stripes) well, you will feel right at home here - I believe he had a hand in the design scheme. let's just say he should stay well away from hotels. The rooms themselves are typical for this level of hotel in New York, not terribly large, not enough water pressure, but the beds are comfortable (extremely, even) and the views are not bad from the upper floors. In general, we were very happy with our stay at the hotel and would return, given the same budget.

The sliding glass door and shower only made the bathroom nicer. There was a desk.

I would call it a nice blend of modernity and old-school charm. There were cosy little quilts on the beds that helped liven up the room. And a sleek looking minibar with every 'trendy' snack or drink available on offer. Shame that they don't have a kettle for hot drinks as with other hotels. The room I stayed in had a tiny little window for some sunlight but because it faced a brick wall, I kept the screen shut most times. Staff were extremely friendly. There was a cab strike going on while I was there and they went out of their way to help me out. Even going as far as to negotiate good prices with the cabbies who weren't on strike. Very accomodating. It was nice to come back to such a homey place after a hectic day at Fashion Week. The concierge is very well-informed as to the IT joints to hit during the nights so you should ask him for recommendations As it was Fashion Week, the hotel was fully booked up by celebs and fashion types all round. I spied a few familiar faces so it looks like it's fairly popular with all. Had supper at their one and only restaurant cum bar and the food's good. Empahsis is on comfort and/or healthy food with some interesting choices. If you're looking for a tummy-busting brekkie buffet, you'd be sorely disappointed. Choices include muesli, bagels, croissants and the only warm-type food on display was a tray of creamy scrambled eggs. My only complain with the Roger Williams is that the bathrooms are tiny, cramped little things. But from what I understand, that's the standard in most NY hotels... unless you're forking our for The Plaza or something. It's centrally located in Midtown and you're pretty much a stone's throw away from most major must-go places in NY.

The hotel is very conveniently located at 31st & Madison, which is close to 2 subway stations. (Only 3 blocks from the 33th& Park station for green lines to go up to the Met/Central Park East, and 4 rather long blocks to 34th/Herald Sq subway for orange lines to Natural History Museum/Central Park West - can go downtown from either stations). It's a very nice safe area to walk around in midtown, even when walking home after an 8pm show (only 3 blocks from the empire state building, and 1 block off 5th Avenue shops). There were always plenty of other tourists walking around so we always felt safe. The lobby is very grand with very prompt doormen who are handy for calling cabs. Our room on the 6th floor was very nice - The room was snug but comfortably fit a king size bed, a bench at the foot of the bed, a wardrobe, a desk, and a wall-hung flat-screen tv. The bathroom was much tighter of a space, but functional & had Aveda products, which was great. Everything was clean, and the whole hotel is smoke-free, which was a plus for us. The bed was very plush and the linens were silky soft. Of note, our room had no window, just a window shaped space at the head of the bed that was lit with lights from above, to simulate light coming through a window, i think. We didn't really miss having a view, but i guess some might. Our check-in & check-out was very efficient. They even call you about 10min after you check-in, just to make sure the room is satisfactory. The one thing that really stood out about this place was the extensive \"mini-bar\" offerings - from the standard min-fridge w/overpriced sodas & liquors to half bottles of Louis Jadot white & red wines on the counter to a full basket with snacks on the desk and a guidebook to NYC on the nightstand. Be mindful that you don't accidently take these items to be *free* and get charged $9 for a tin of breathmints! The same goes for the basket of goodies in the bathroom. Overall, we loved staying here! We booked on Hotels.com and paid about $200/nt, which we found was a good deal for a nicer hotel in this area of NYC.

The room was incredibly sweet: spacious, brightly colored, and surprisingly quiet; the 'garden terrace' was basically a small rectangle of rooftop overlooking the Empire State Building: perfect for a nightcap. I'd read on TripAdvisor about the IKEA-like furnishings, and, sure, the overall vibe skews toward Scandinavia (read: clean lines, lots of orange and blue and green). My only real complaint about the room was the way in which practically everything was for sale: the desktop is almost entirely taken over by bowls of candy and bottles of water and wine, all of them (of course) yours if you're willing to pay for them. Who wants to spend the night in a 7-11? (Or, I guess, something slightly more exotic: er, Tesco Express?) The staff was ingratiating; the breakfast was abundant and full of little surprises (fresh blueberries, real prosciutto); and, most importantly, I slept really well.

The room was minuscule - even for New York standards- and we travel there frequently. For example the night stands (attached to the walls) were less than 12 inches wide, and the bathroom sink was probably not much wider than that. We literally felt \"wedged\" into the tiny bathroom. There was no closet - just a tiny wardrobe about 2 1/2 feet wide. The worst part is that there was no window! Actually there was a cheap mockup of a \"Japanese screen\"in front of a dilapidated old window that they obviously wanted to hide. Walls were paper thin. At 4:00 in the morning we were woken by a guest blasting a CD - 4 floors below us (we were on the 8th floor). The \"concert\" lasted until 5:00 a.m. with only excuses from the hotel staff. Even walking in the hallway of the hotel felt claustrophobic - it was so narrow that there wasn't room for two people to walk side by side. And I seriously doubt that anyone over 6'2\" would fit - the ceilings were incredibly low. The very ample and lovely lobby was deceptive - this hotel is an overpriced DUMP.

I was originally checked in at the Kitano Hotel, which was a nightmare from beginning to end, and I decided quickly that I needed to find somewhere else. I vaguely remembered someone telling me about the Hotel Roger Williams, so I thought I would take a stroll down Madison Avenue to check it out and see what kind of rates they could offer. From the moment I stepped in, I was greeted with the kind of friendliness usually reserved for somewhere where people still wave to strangers. As I spoke to the woman at the front desk, I was almost alarmed at her helpfulness. It can really catch you off guard in a city like New York. Before I knew it, I was checked in for the weekend, and so was my colleague (who hadn't even wanted to change her hotel, but was so charmed by the woman at the front desk and the overall quality the hotel, that she decided to book in as well). The stay itself lived up to the hype - and actually surpassed my expectations. The rooms were a good size for Manhattan, very well decorated, with super, super comfortable beds, and the overall attention to detail was truly impressive. I was in the city partly for business and partly for pleasure, and the hotel did a great job of meeting requirements for both. Their creative use of space meant that we had a desk, with ample space for working, without feeling cramped. The free wireless was also helpful (don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you hate it when hotels charge for internet?). We found a Time Out New York, and a book on New York City's hidden treasures waiting for us in the room, Aveda products in the bathroom, and a whole host of useful toiletries which you could purchase for a very reasonable price. (For anyone who travels as much as I do, I'm sure you'll appreciate how convenient this is - if I had a penny for every time I've forgotten my toothpaste or razorblade...) The customer service was absolutely top-notch throughout our entire stay. Even the food in the restaurant was great! All in all, I had fantastic stay, at very reasonable price for mid-town Manhattan. To put my review in perspective, I travel for work about 6 months out of the year throughout North and South America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. So, I pretty much live half my life in hotel rooms. I struggle to think of a better overall experience I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had anywhere else.

The concierge (Neil) is a young guy and a New York native and has legitimately good restaurant / nightlife recommendations. 2) Great Lounge - the hotel was recently renovated by a notable NYC archtect (I forget the name) and the lounge was designed to feel like your living room at home, which it does. The drinks are great, and food is quite exceptional. They have a great cheese board, as well as a number of appetizers, sandwiches, and a small selection of entrees. The portions are a tad on the small side but fine. Prices are standard NYC hotel bar prices but way above par in terms of quality. 3) Nice Rooms - the rooms are well-decorated and modern. Internet is free throughout the hotel via WIFI. The beds are very comfortable. The hotel is slightly oddly configured (there is a church attached to some of the property) so there is a large varielty off room designs and layouts. Room size note - any 'standard price' hotel room in New York City, especially in an older building, is going to be small. Rooms range in size from tiny to generous, with the bulk being just fine. The tiny rooms are ones that are only sold on high-occupancy nights and the staff will gladly switch you to another room if one is available. 4) Excellent location - located only five blocks away from several large companies, Madison Square Park, nice walk to Union Square, three blocks from Empire State Building, a good number of restaurants in the area (and growing). Short cab ride to Central Park, Lower East Side, Village, etc. 5) Price - the company I work for has a prenegotiated rate with the hotel that makes it a no-brainer.

The windows were \"very cool\" - ours had an electric room darkening shade, and a screen that slid shut instead of drapes. The bathroom was nice - nice sink, nice shower stall, mediocre water pressure but it had a \"rain showerhead\" as well as a showerhead on hose. The hotel is on the corner of 31st and Madison. We were able to walk everywhere - location was wonderful! I spent many late nights on my laptop in the Mezzanine Lounge - the entire hotel in wireless. The lounge is small and lovely...and I met overfriendly business people!

The rooms are spacious, the bed fantastically comfortable enabling you to get a well earned rest after a hard day in Manhatten. In my opinion the bathrooms were above standard for New York City, very corporate and clean and tidy with more than enough space to not fall over your own feet. It was also good to see you had an easy to use safe within your room which to keep your money/valuables safe whilst you ventured out in Manhatten. Another good point is that the hotels location being fairly central Manhatten 2 minutes walk from the Empire state building enables you to get both uptown and downtown without any real hassle.........we preferred to stroll around Manhatten itself taking in the sights but its so cheap and easy to get a cab if you don't fancy walking so much. The only negative I would say having being a patron of the Roger Williams for a couple of years is the continental breakfast on the Mezzanine level which if being honest is a rip-off price wise so I would advise you to get your breakfast outside the hotel itself. The hotel used to do a free breakfast/hot drink service before it's renovation which I thought was an endearing feature especially as it is reasonable high priced to stay.........its sometimes the small things that make all the difference.

Having stayed there often since it first became a hotel, we were interested to see what the new owners have done. They've done a lovely job of redecorating, and the staff was even nicer than usual, BUT there was a $10 per day 'Service Charge' on our bill when we checked out. Nowhere was there warning that such a charge would be applied. When we asked what it was for, we were told it was for the new 'amenities': Wireless internet (which is advertised as 'complimentary'), the availability of a fitness room (which we did not use), and the unlimited local phone calls (which we also did not use) The amount of the charge is not relevant. This is a deceptive and dishonest practice so be forewarned and factor that into your decision on whether to stay at the Roger Williams, or any hotel owned by that group.", "Date": "February 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cYou grew up smelling of cooking oil.....\u201d", "Author": "Sparkly*Euro*Peep", "ReviewID": "UR3184988", "Content": "I would not advise to stay here - the rooms smell of cooking oil, all of them. There is definitely a ventilation problem with this hotel as we changed a number of rooms and eventually were on the 12th floor and still had problems!!! The rooms themselves are kind of weird, they've tried to make it a trendy place but it just looks like cheaper than Ikea tack - plastic lamps and bright blue carpets. The bathrooms are tiny and if you move the wrong way whilst sitting on the toilet, you will injure yourself on the sink. The ingrained cooking oil smell everywhere will by default make you want to avoid the restaurant. There are only 2 lifts (elevators) and you sometimes wait, I kid you not, up to about 8 minutes for one to come and there are no stairs that you can take (emergency stairs only). The only positive thing this hotel has going for it is it's great location - pretty much walking distance to anywhere if you have the time, and also it's friendly staff - they can't help it if the ventilation system sucks.

It looks like something out of Wallpaper magazine. The rooms do not dissapoint. They are large for New York, the beds are fabulous and they have minibars. The bathrooms are clean and comfortable. The problem is the noise. After getting a great room on the 3rd. floor I went into my room to take a quick nap but immedietly I noticed the noise. Garbage trucks, cabs honking, etc. I know New york is loud but I should be able to sleep in my room. I called front dest and asked for a quieter room. I was given a room on the 8th floor and went about my day. When I got back that night at well after midnight yet, the noise level was high enough that I could hardly sleep. At that point I stayed up watching t.v. until 3. I fell asleep but was upset that I spent $240 for a great room with so much noise outside. It doesn't make sense. The staff is attentive and professional, the rooms are state of the art, but it is ruined by the loud garbage trucks and other noise makers that permeate the streets as late as 3 in the morning.

This ofcourse is the start of the peak holiday season. I booked a penthouse room back in July. (YES, JULY!) I had confirmation of the reservation with a penthouse room written on it, and even talked to a reservation specialist at the hotel to make sure this room was available. They gave me confirmation that I had booked a penthouse room and that it would be available for my stay. We arrived and the hotel was a small, very modern hotel. The lobby has a couple of places to sit, yet right next to the door where it gets a little chilly. There is no fireplace. There is a very tiny bar upstairs. The staff were very helpful to check our bags while our room was being cleaned. Come to find out that my reservation was not what I had booked. I was given a deluxe room, not a penthouse room as I had confirmed. They gave me some ridiculous excuse that the woman who booked my room for me had only been working there 2 days. Maybe the worst excuse I have ever heard. So, we ended up taking the deluxe room, but made sure we were given the room rate from back in July. This was about the only thing they did to accomodate us. They had no explanation as to what happen to our reservation. ?????? If you like shady reservations, then this is the place to stay. If you want to take a chance on getting a different room than what you book, stay here!! Rooms are nice though. I would definitely reserve a deluxe room. There was a plasma on the wall.

My only advice would be to not drink the hotel water, as it is not free (I thought it was complimentary to the room) and cost an amazing $9.00 per litre.

The view was of other buildings. The room came with two very clean full-size beds. The room had a weird smell. The bathroom does have frosted glass, but it just felt very uncomfortable knowing that my parents could see me taking a shower(the glass is see-through). The bathroom door, which was also frosted glass, had no lock. The tiles in the bathroom were very dirty, and the edges were growing mold or something of the sort that we had to wear flip flops while showering. We needed three towels, but they always gave us two. The drawer was broken. The hotel does not give complimentary bottled water(very deceiving on their website: rogerwilliamshotel.com). The breakfast was the same everyday, but i did enjoy the croissants and cereal. I also enjoyed the free cappuccino two or three times a day. The hotel's location was very convenient. It's about two blocks from the 6 train(local green subway). There's a church right next to the hotel, around the corner to the left(when exiting) that i would not recommend.(nothing to do with the hotel, but just thought i'd sneek that in). Fitness \"studio\" had a tv, an exercise bike, two old tredmills with no water bottle holder, and a bathroom. The many halogen lights in the fitness studio made the room hot, so i had to open the window. I liked that there was free access to a computer and internet in the lobby. The people that work at the hotel are very nice. I asked to see a penthouse room and they glady brought us to see one... it was very nice!!... it came with a flat screen tv, clean bathroom with a DOOR, a big bed, nice view, and a patio/terrace. The mezzanine, where the food is, is not a big room. The lighting in the hotel is dimmed; i think they do this so that the dirty spots and scratches everywhere aren't too noticeable. For $130 a night, the hotel was a good deal. My only real problem was the bathroom, and maybe the smell of the room(that you do get used to). The hotel told us that they would be doing a complete remodeling of the hotel in september, or i think they said it would be done by september 2004...So i'm thinking that they'll raise the rates/night, but the hotel will probably be very nice.

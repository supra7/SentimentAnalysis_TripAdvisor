WAs in a nice part of town, unlike the hotels near the airport which are near strip clubs, etc. Included continental breakfast was danish, cereal, bagels and cream cheese, and bananas. There was a Denny's, Waffle House and Cracker Barrel visible from the parking lot. Was pleasantly surprised by the mini-fridge. Room was clean and mostly comfortable. I will say that the bed wasn't as comfortable as others, but we paid so little that I thought it was an ok trade off. I've read some people complain about the furnishing not being stylish, but at this price, what do you expect? We spent most of time in the room with our eyes closed, so I wasn't looking at the furnishings.", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "anan01", "Title": "\u201cVERY QUITE\u201d", "Author": "anan01", "ReviewID": "UR57089821", "Content": "When I am traveling I always stop by at this hotel whenever I have the option to do so. The prices of a single double and even a suite room is a very low price. It has free high speed internet access, free encore and all four HBO channels, free USA TODAY newspaper, a pool and Jacuzzi. The rooms are very clean and cozy with essentials needed such as hairdryer, coffee maker, microwave and a fridge. I felt safe around the area because it was very well lit and the parking lot was safe. They hafe well security everywhere, they have cameras and there is always someone at the desk. The location is great. You can never get bored because there is so much to do and see around this area. They have the Rock art museum nearby and the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport. Even the Anthem Outlet Mall is 5 miles down. Also, I took my friends to Castle and Coasters, which has rides and a golf area. There is also a HUGE water park and golf coarse nearby!!! A movie theater it close by as well. It is also surrounded by excellent restaurant. There is a lot of sit down places such as the Cracker-barrel, Thai Place and Marconi Grill and there is also fast food places which were walking distance likes taco bell, Mc Donald\u2019s, Arby\u2019s and In-n-Out. There is a variety of food places. If one would like to order food they have Pizza Huts number right on back of the key card, so that was efficient for us. The customer service is great. When I needed directions to the church, the front desk people were kind enough to help me find my destination. They are very kind and polite people who opened doors and helped with my baggage. I come here often! And you can even get a triple AAA discount!", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "salt lake", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely a pleasant place to stay\u201d", "Author": "saltlakekid22", "ReviewID": "UR45363889", "Content": "I chose this hotel because I found it very convenient.

It is in a quiet area, right between a Dennys and a Waffle House. The area is safe and I never felt threatened. In addition, the hotel is very near a shopping area that has several great chain restaurants such as Macaroni Grill, Rubios and Chilis. The same shopping plaza has a Super Target and an AMC 30 theater. We stayed in a king suite which was very roomy for the money. The room did have a musty smell upon entering but running the A/C for about an hour did away with that completely. We were on the bottom floor and never heard any noise from the room above us. You can tell the property is not brand new but the bed was clean (no worn sheets) and the towels were in great shape. The front desk and house cleaning staff were very nice, going out of their way to help with our requests (extra towels, pillows, etc). This is not the Hilton and if you are expecting the Hilton in this area for less than a hundred dollars a night you are sadly mistaken. If you must have Hilton quality, for Heaven's sake, book the Hilton but don't book this and expect that kind of quality and fuss when you don't get it. For the money however, we were very happy and will return to this location should our travels take us to Phoenix again. Recommended for someone wanting a nice room (not a great room) for under $100 per night.", "Date": "January 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cBad\u201d", "Author": "qwerttt", "ReviewID": "UR7247201", "Content": "Black mold in bath.

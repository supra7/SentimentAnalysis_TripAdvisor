The hotel is at 51st Street directly off of I-10. About a 5 minute drive to Maryvale for Spring Training...15-20 minutes for downtown, golf & other stadiums. Pretty easy to get to/from the airport from here. Keep in mind, this is not a hotel to stay at if you like to hang out at the hotel. The rooms were nicely remodeled and were fine for sleeping. Just come with the realization that there is nothing else to do at the hotel or even within walking distance. While the service at the front desk was excellent, the service at the hotel lounge/bar was abysmal. It took 30-45 minutes to get a drink, the bartenders did not even know how to make basic drinks and they were out of several common things (including Grey Goose, amaretto, etc!) If you wanted anything other than a basic bottle of beer, good luck. This was really too bad as the lounge looks quite nice with TVs, a pool table and a dartboard. Most hotel guests will want to hang out in the bar/lounge...so I hope the Holiday Inn will seek improvements here.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFit our need perfectly\u201d", "Author": "isellfords", "ReviewID": "UR126347038", "Content": "We stayed at Holiday Inn West Phoenix for 4 nights March 12-16, 2012.

I called ahead and reserved a room with 2 double beds, and they were glad to accomodate the request. Sounds like a small thing, but I've had issues with this in the past, especially if you've booked online.

They don't have a pantry where you can buy water, treats etc. They have vending machines. There is an in house bar and small restaurant. The food was bar food.

I was traveling with my recently graduated 23 year old son; helping him move from Golden, CO to his new job in Tucson, AZ. We stayed in room 321. This is my third stay at a Holiday Inn/Holiday Inn Express in seven days. The Good: The staff -- very helpful, very polite, very nice The location -- right off I-10, easy to locate The room -- fridge in room The Bad: The location -- right off I-10...could be noisy. I always ask for an upper floor and with the AC running, we had no problems even though we faced the highway One elevator -- plan to spend time waiting, and waiting, and waiting,.. Business Center -- saw one by the front desk; only one computer in a small room. One person on the computer and one standing by the door waiting. WiFi -- Never was able to connect. Spent the night at a HIE in NM the night before & had no problem. Stopped at another HIE during the day to make reservation for this night & had no trouble. I eventually signed on via the Red Rood Inn WiFi. Oddly enough, my son was finally able to connect to the WiFi after the front desk contacted corporate and corp re-set the system. (Again, very helpful at the front desk!) WiFi -- No option to purchase a secured service (as was offered at the HIE we stayed at in Bernalillo) so was limited in what I was able to accomplish via my son's computer. \"Restaurant\" -- Is in the bar which is dark and dated. Mediocre food at high prices. One person working behind the bar...who was taking care of everything, including room service. She was very nice but, due to only one person working, service was lacking. The hotel -- dated. It looks and feels like effort has been made to keep things up, and even improved, but sometimes cosmetic face-lifts only go so far. The room -- 90% clean: windows to outside balcony were dirty (looks like a dog's nose prints all over the window). Few outlets...the outlet on the desk lamp had the fridge plugged into it. Hate having to crawl under the desk to plug things in...I always travel with an extension cord and could have used another one. We had two computers, two phones, iPod, iPad, and a battery charger for my camera. We rotated items in order to charge them all. Our HIE in NM had more than enough outlets to handle our items. Mattresses, mattress covers, sheets all seem very new and were clean; no rips, stains, etc. (I always look but just can't bring myself to use a black light - would probably never sleep in a hotel again, lol). Nice blackout curtains on the windows too. Pillows looked new but were cheap foam, most already lumpy. Effort has been made to update the bathroom but it's still small compared to HI and HIE that have been built in the last few years. I'm a towel snob and these rank about 5 out of 10. They were clean (not thin and no stains) but small and rather cheap. Older TV but it worked well enough, don't expect flat screen. Newer phone. Used the iron & ironing board - clean. Seemed brand new; don't know if it was ever used before! Single cup coffee maker, good setup but didn't use. Free B'fast: None offered - but then again, I booked the wrong hotel so that is my issue. You can purchase b'fast in the bar/restaurant but after dinner there the night before, we grabbed a bite on the road. The location -- Not thrilled with what is, and isn't, in the area. Two fast food places nearby and other hotels. Not much else. Didn't seem anyone hanging around the area but it just doesn't have a good feel to it; I wouldn't go out here at night. Pool/Hot Tub -- Son used both; hot tub was about the same temp as pool. Both clean. Fitness room -- Per son: Some dumbbells, elliptical, stairmaster, and treadmill. All clean and in good repair, some pieces seemed to be rather new. The other thing I noticed immediately...upon checkin (and then waiting at the front desk area for about 50 minutes while working on WiFi issues)...not one woman checked in. Watched over 4 men check in. In the bar/restaurant for dinner, 5 men at the bar and then 6 other men came in to eat. Mind you, I had no issue with any of the men but it was odd that none had a wife/girlfriend, and no woman checking in alone. I also didn't see any families. Finally saw one woman while we were trying to exit the elevator to go to dinner...she just barged in without allow my son and I to exit. Neither of us got a positive feel from her based on her behavior, dress, and attitude. Just made you wonder... Son said he did see a mother and son check in and one teenage girl at the business center when he went down to the pool but still, very few woman and families. Not my cup of tea and not the place for families but I would recommend to the solo male business traveler who wants things rather simple.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Cruz, CA", "Title": "\u201cThey are trying to improve, but have a long way to go.\u201d", "Author": "bixatthebeach", "ReviewID": "UR105880627", "Content": "This hotel is supposed to be being renovated, but it does not appear to be moving very quickly.

Although there was an on-site security guard in the parking lot, he seemed distracted and was sleeping near the front door. Shame on him as there was a car filled with gang members cruising throught the parking lot, looking for an available victim. Upon checking in, the desk agent asked me, \"So, I have you down for a non-smoking king.\" I replied in the affirmative and after about 15 seconds of looking through her computer, the desk agent said to me, \"Is a non-smoking double okay?\" I told her that I had previously called to request a king and she told me, \"You booked on hotwire and nothing is guaranteed.\" I told her, \"I guess I have to take what you have.\" She rudely pushed me 2 room keys and my wife and I made our way up to our room.

The bedspreads were circa 1978 and appeared dirty and unkept. The towels in the bathroom were paper thin. Come on, does it take much to stock the place with new towels. This isn't the Motel 6 and I would expect a little more from a chain like the Holiday Inn, especially their flagship brand.

We had an absolutely wonderful time and would recommend this hotel to any/everyone traveling to the Phoenix area!", "Date": "August 29, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Holiday Inn Phoenix-West", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d73825-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Phoenix_West-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "Price": "$93 - $126*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1500 N. 51st Ave.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Phoenix</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">AZ</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">85043</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "73825", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/0a/ce/0acebae5f95c88b070c8469cca88893a7large.jpg"}}

I would suggest they don't advertise free wi-fi. They really don't have it. The second issue we had was a homeless man who wanted to discuss his search for a wife with my son-in-law and my husband.

Signage sucks and if you miss your turn it is painful. About the Hotel...no it is a motel only in this part of San Diego but no one tells you this. We arrived late Sunday night after 8 hrs on the road. The room had ants, was loud, and beds were too soft for my liking. My wife spoke with Mgmt and we were moved across the property and upgraded to a \"Suite\". Didn't know that there was some major baseball tournaments so quiet was not a reality. The suite was helpful for a 4 night stay given we brought a small dog. It gave us room to spread out a bit and didn't cramp with a pet. We had a few times where we left the pet in the room in her crate so housekeeping could do their thing. Housekeeping was nice and helpful during the entire trip as was the balance of the staff. The two biggest issues I had were the ultra narrow parking spots and the lack of channels on tv when we were resting between activities. Best items were the restaurants. Next to the motel we had a 24 hr restaurant that had one of the best CFC w/eggs I have ever had! Plus the muffins were monsters in size and taste. A little pricey but quality was there. The best BBQ in San Diego is across the street at Phil's. Try the Beef Rib and Chicken combo it was awesome and cost effective. The Onion rings were the size of my fist and those were the small ones. A few minutes away in OB you have Azucar which is a bakery/coffee shop that was one of the best places we visited once we learned about it. 4 days and 3 visits if that tells you anything plus stocking up the day we left. Really close to OB and Mission with both being less than 10 minutes away with lights.

I have an Ipad 2 and an Iphone 4 and have never had a problem with WiFi. The free tech support could not help and I gave up after 5 calls. I would have rather paid for WiFi than that useless (different company's) WiFi.

Marissa went out of her way to ensure we had the experience we wanted! Tip for the traveler to this Wyndham, ask for the newly renovated rooms.

Less than a mile from Sea World and Mission beach. Close to freeway access, and local roads. Like other reviewers have said, it isn't the best location, but it is close to many places. I was a little concerned about the fact that there were not many reviews, but they are remodeling the entire place and it is brand new. Now keep in mind it is a remodel, and not a new hotel. We liked that we didn't have to drive far to get to Sea World. We paid $90 a night for our 5 nights there, it is the least expensive place for the money!!! The bunkbeds are so NICE!!! It was nice to have each kid have their own bed and night fight over space in a queen or double. The king bed offers plenty of space. Soft mattresses, and nice comforters. The only draw back was no breakfast. With the money we saved from staying here we went out to breakfast. (they also have a microwave for oatmeal or other microwave breakfast) We did return to our room one night and found that they had only left 1 towel. We called the front desk and they brought more with in 20 minutes. It wasn't a problem for us at all and they were very nice! Parking is a little over crowded, but it was never a problem for us. The gym close by uses the parking during the day, but by night there are not many cars that are using from the gym. It is a little odd seeing guys walk accrost the parking lot, and then disappear around the building. It made me wonder the first night, but then I realized they were going to work out. Pool was ok, and the hot tub was working even though we were told it wouldn't be when we got there. Overall I really liked our stay! Good location, close to everything.

Internet did not work for the entire week. staff tried everyday to help. tech support also. could not fix it. this ruined my trip and i could not work there. but was not the staffs fault. dont buy the deal with the breakfast included. save your money. it only includes 3 choices-, 2 pancakes, 2 eggs or an omelet. if you had to pay for it would cost $6,00. learned important lesson. DONT book through third party sight.- expedia, hotel,com etc. you have no rights. hotel and airline tells you to complain to them. they tell you they cant do anything. your not saving anything WILL GO BACK TO THIS HOTEL ANY TIME IN SAN DIEGO. i honestly felt as if needed i could live at this hotel suite Hopefully their Internet will work.

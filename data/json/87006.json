{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good memories My family and I have stayed at Amy Lau's Edmunds Apt. Hotels for around 15 or so years. She is a great lady and very sweet owner/manager. She always made the 6 of us feel so welcome - she would bring us a big platter of mangos, and was always so friendly! The rooms are like small apartments, very homey. Not the most upscale place you can stay, but it was our home away from home, and it was probably the most inexpensive place in Waikiki, so we were able to stay for almost 3 weeks every year. Full kitchen, 2 bedrooms, lots of closet space, and very roomy! The unit we stayed at on Liliuokalani has been torn down since, but she does have another on Ala Wai Blvd.,- it is a very noisy place due to the traffic. It does have a nice view of the Manoa Valley and the Ala Wai canal. I would stay there again, if it meant I could spend more time in Hawaii! All in all, a good value.", "Date": "Jan 18, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR188000389", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60982-d87006-r1555897-Edmund_s_Hotel_Apartments-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html", "HotelID": "87006", "Price": "$80"}}

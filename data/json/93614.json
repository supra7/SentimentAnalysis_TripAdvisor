Within minutes our female butler was there to show us the facilites of the room as well bringing us a life saving pot of tea! The hotel staff especially the concierge were extremely helpful - booking us a different restaurant every night - including New Year which were all exceptional. I have never had such exceptional service from any concierge staff as here. The location of the hotel is perfect. We walked to all the museums and galleries and you are surrounded by amazing shopping - the subway was around the corner, we actually never took a cab except to and from the airport.

Can't beat the location. Service, as one would expect, was top notch. The obligatory international front desk staff (I frequently wonder whether the staff at hotels such as this are *really* foreign, or just regular 'ol American kids to whom they teach foreign accents?) handled check-in with aplomb. And very nicely walked around the front desk to walk me the very few feet to the elevator. Somehow, I was upgraded to a Tiffany Suite. Not quite sure how that happened. I was incredibly spacious -- long hallway from the front door that led to a separate living room (that could've -- and I'm sure frequently does -- served as its own bedroom. Separate bedroom with a wardrobe that filled one wall. Get this -- *two* full baths, each with double vanity. I had four bathroom sinks at my disposal during my one night stay. I made sure to use all four at some point during my stay (kidding). Two showers, two tubs, two \"water closets\", etc. An efficiency kitchen hid behind closed doors. Despite its sheer square footage, I'm not a huge fan of the baroque architectural style of the hotel and the room. Very ornate, very \"over the top\". It is what it is, though, and it's consistent, I think, with the history of the property. My very own butler (or at least one that I was sharing with a few other well-heeled travelers) showed up immediately after I checked in (foreign accent!) and gave me the walk through for the room. The TV in the bedroom was recessed in this piece of furniture at the foot of the bed, so she showed me that. She also brought a plate of fresh fruit and told me that pressing for two pieces of clothes and shoe shine was complimentary. Nice touch, though didn't take advantage of it. My only other comment is a bit of a complaint, and at the time I was experiencing it, it was frustrating. When I returned to the room that evening after dinner, I wanted to turn the bedroom TV on. It was already \"un-recessed\" from its wooden home, but the power button wouldn't turn the thing on. Kept messing with it, but couldn't get it to turn on. So, I went to the very modern phone contraption and tried to call the front desk to get someone to help me. I was touching the \"front desk\" button, but nothing was happening. Then I tried to dial the four digit extension itself. While all this was going on, a phone was ringing in a separate part of the room, far, far away. I at first didn't answer it, but then when it rang again, I ran to answer it. It was the front desk asking me if I was trying to call them. I'm sure anyone reading this thinks that I'm just an idiot that doesn't know how to operate either a TV or a touch tone phone. However, when the butler (a different one) showed up, she shook her head, had a wry smile on her face, and said \"yes, when they (do something -- can't remember exactly what it was) you need to reset the TV.\" And she proceeded to lift up a corner of the wooden frame around the TV, hit a completely hidden reset button and the TV worked. I exasperatedly said \"how would a person know that?\" And she said \"you wouldn't, I keep telling them they need to get this fixed\". I apparently wasn't the first person to express frustration about this. Then I said \"and what's the deal with the phone?'\" She said (and I'm paraphrasing) \"We have problems with these all the time, I can get you a regular phone if you want...\" I said \"It's 11 p.m. now, and I'm checking out in the morning, so it's not necessary, but it's just very frustrating for a hotel that is so service-oriented in every other respect\". She seemed a bit sheepish about the whole thing and again offered to replace the phone, but I declined. Again, the (human) service was excellent, but the TV and phone system left a little to be desired!", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Margate City, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel in Great Location with Excellent Concierge\u201d", "Author": "William S", "ReviewID": "UR126323609", "Content": "The Hotel is very good.

I'll admit that my expectations were extremely high for this property; a result of its exorbitant price coupled with the incredible reputation that precedes the property. The first thing that someone considering staying here needs to take note of is that this property is OLD. There is nothing in particular that is falling apart, dirty, or not up to modern standards, but everything just feels incredibly old fashioned and out of date. I know that this appeals to certain demographics, but for me, when I'm spending this type of money, I prefer a modern hotel with only the most cutting edge aesthetics and technology. With that in mind, I would recommend somewhere like the Trump SoHo over this property, if that's your sort of thing. If you're more into a hotel that resembles an antique and old-world glamour, then perhaps this is the place for you. Positives: -Great, over the top service (having a butler on each floor is nice). -Great location in the middle of Manhattan -Very clean with an attention to detail Cons (for me): -Old and outdated -No pool or other resort amenities typically included at this price point -Poor views from most standard rooms (first night stayed in a room that literally had almost no view, with only a tiny window allowing for a small view of the building next door making it feel particularly claustrophobic).", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cExpensive but special!\u201d", "Author": "NYTravelCriticIntl", "ReviewID": "UR124796786", "Content": "This is where you stay in New York when \"nothing but the best\" will do.

Astor realized 110 years ago that his Waldorf-Astoria was inevitably going to be forever filled with hundreds of tourists gawking slack-jawed at the lobby and built this hotel as a quieter refuge.

In fact, it's expected. The one distinguishing feature of the St. Regis, as I understand it, is the service. Much is made of the butlers in particular. However, we found the service to be very hit-and-miss: - The butler on our first night was polite and attentive, and provided a nice enough overview of the amenities, complimentary services, etc. - Then I called the butler on the morning of my second day, as I needed to know a number written on a business card I had left in the room. Instead of graciously helping out with this simple request, this butler grunted and protested her way through the request, sighing and muttering loudly as though I had asked her to benchpress the bed or clean the Aegean stables. I've experienced friendlier service at hostels. - We also informed the hotel in advance that we would be celebrating my birthday during the stay. They acknowledged this by email before our arrival, but absolutely nothing was done while we were there. I've been offered chocolates, champagne, dinner reservations and more when celebrating my birthday at other hotels of a similar calibre - at the very least, a card would have been nice.

Problem was: our first room had a flickering light in the closet, very annoying and no way we'd be able to sleep in there. It was like a strobe light. We left for an hour, it couldn't be fixed. Second room (after an hour), was.... right off the elevator, thermostat didn't get cool, a room we had before and didn't like (and requested not to be in). Then we waited in the lobby for an hour, 10pm, with our bags packed, sitting there. The front desk people have no autonomy to give out rooms, we had to wait for a \"manager\" who I guess was busy for an hour. When she showed (11pm), we got the lowest floor, inside room, no apology, etc. We didn't complain. Not a huge deal. Just for $800 a night we'd have liked better... maybe an apology, an upgrade (which I offered to pay for, didn't get it either free or paid for), anything. By the way, third straight time we had add-on minibar expenses we didn't use. To be honest I've paid it in the past because I didn't want to complain.

During my last review, back in January, I made a point of telling you that I choose this hotel for stays such as these for any number of reasons, but primarily for service. I booked this stay myself so I know what I asked for (not myself really, but through AMEX Centurion concierge) and I know what my travel advisor made clear. Problems with room availability happen and it is not the fault of the hotel if a guest (or many of them) decide to extend their stay. When that happens I am more than happy to spend many of what my friends spend in rent a month for each night in a suite here. Why? SERVICE. Unfortunately, again, the St. Regis let me down. PERHAPS I could have made clear that walking into a room that reeked of pine smell from cleanser was not something that was necessarily the St. Regis welcome anyone would be looking for (and it's not like we arrived early); MAYBE I could have expected that the room would have been ready (and by ready I mean clean with regard to vacuuming up the schmutz left on the floor by the previous occupants of our room (or do I really need to tell someone that candy wrappers not eaten by me are not decorative?); I certainly could have asked that I not have to go through my luggage for toiletries (you come to expect things like soap, shampoo, and body wash in a hotel - especially when you are checking in and going directly to a Passover Seder); AND MAYBE it was a request of a high order that when hotel employees are walking down the halls before 5a.m. that they turn their radios down so that I don't have to wake up hours before I need to. But I guess I should have. The best part was room service (something you would think that after my last experience with room service here they would have been on top of), but that too needed correction. My boyfriend was hungry so we shared a midnight omelette made from egg whites (we're gay - you didn't expect yolks did you?) and when the food arrived, quite timely, we were treated to an omelette without anything in it. Essentially what we got were egg whites that looked like an omelette, but had no filling. It was insane. I called down to get it corrected and, well, they apologized and about 15 minutes later new ones came (with TWO delivery men) to make sure they were okay. The addition of 1 ingredient makes an omelette. But NO INGREDIENTS? Why bother? All in all the first night at the St. Regis here in NYC has me wondering where the old St. Regis went? It is still there in the butlers and door men (except the one that can't seem to keep off his phone from texting, but he was doing that the last time so I hailed my own cab to synagogue), but something is missing. MAYBE it is the fact that they are pretty full (that could be it, but surely they anticipated large crowds for Passover); PERHAPS it is that things just fall through the cracks - OR, more likely, the St. Regis is going by way of so many landmark NYC hotels and becoming more like the Waldorf? I stay at a hotel for service - nothing more. Everything else can be fixed. What I don't expect is everything to require fixing so soon into a stay. I only hope the old St. Regis returns before I leave next week or this will be my last stay at any property with the name for this, the flagship, should be the best and it is slowly losing that distinction.", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "long island", "Title": "\u201cMy first choice\u201d", "Author": "elfion", "ReviewID": "UR102361426", "Content": "The St. Regis continues to be a standout among many hotels in New York City. I am a ten year Starwood Platinum member. I have stayed at all the Starwood properties in NYC and at many of the other 5 star hotels in the Big Apple, The St. Regis remains my first choice of New York hotels. Everyone that we encounter appears to genuinely want to assist . From the doormen and bellman to the hotel operator. I have stayed here many times and have always experienced excellent customer service. My last stay was March16, 2011 for two nights and this stay was no different. The wheels of the car are just about stopped when the door opens and we are warmly greeted back by the doormen, Pascal and Jim, who guides us up the steps to the lobby. We arrived early and although our room is not ready, we have been upgraded to a suite. Thank you St. Regis and Starwoods. As we had previously arranged to have afternoon tea in the Astor Court waiting for the suite was no problem at all. I would like to add, that if you enjoy high tea this is the total experience. If you do not try the Astor court for tea you are doing yourself an injustice. Before tea was over we were found by the front desk clerk and handed our keys. The suite was very nice and with a powder room, very convenient. Housekeeping somehow cleans without being seen but does a great job. We ordered room service for dinner, although good, I think going downstairs may be a better bet. The delivery person could not get out of the room fast enough, and the table set up suffered. We think he may have rushed because he was alone in the living room with my girlfriend while I was in the other room, this happened on two occasions. Dinner in Adour is a sublime experience that should not be missed. Excellent in every way. There was one experience where I was taken aback. When checking in the butler comes to your room and introduces him/herself and will bring you a coffee or tea set-up that is complimentary. Well, upon check-out I noticed a unknown charge and was informed that was for tea. I explained that I never saw my butler when I checked in and I received the tea the next day assured on the phone I would not be charged. I was told very curtly that they will make an exception this time but that it is not customary. When I reiterated that my butler never showed up the attitude became condescending and again was told just this once they will make an exception. I thought she may have apologized that the butler never showed up, never happened. Not a big deal but again unexpected at the St. Regis. I love this hotel and already have a booking for this summer.

I'm currently at the St. Regis and wanted to write before my issues became stale. The hotel is beautiful and historic. No question. It is a St. Regis and I would expect nothing less. But when you get beyond the beauty of the lobby, the initial, superficial, cleanliness of the room, and the size of the room (NYC is notorious for small bathrooms, but that is not an issue here) - you end up with the reality that like flying in America today, hotel stays lost their exclusivity. Good: location, bell staff, front desk, and butlers. They do what is expected of them and check-in was very friendly is my welcome back each time I return. Only complaint about the door man would be he became \"star struck\" by someone and as I stood in a snow storm the other night he moved this person in front of me for car service. Bad: Room: beautifully appointed and what one would expect. The \"smart\" controls in the room do not work - so bad are they that the butler had to re-set the phones and the bedroom one has an alarm clock that keeps going off at odd hours. I've taken to using my cell phone and calls from my assistant in CA (yes, 3 hours earlier). Cleanliness: when NYC closed the day of the 12 JAN I decided to take a bath. I did so and as I was getting out of the tub to go the shower I noticed that there was something dark and sticky on the tub. It was not clean and I bathed in it. I got an \"I'm sorry,\" but how horrible. Before someone checks into a room it should be checked completely - not haphazardly. Painfully, I must tell you that if I didn't need to pack up and move myself, I'd change hotels. Room Service: two orders; two mistakes. Not big deals, but if you cannot get an order 100% correct at this hotel you should not be in the hotel business. Another \"I'm sorry.\" After I was done eating I called for the butler (technology coming next) and nobody came. I moved the dirty dishes to the living room powder room to get them out of the living room. I had to get the poor butler to take them this morning since nobody showed last night after I called the operator since I could not use the phone to call for the butler and the e-butler app on iPhone got no response. Concierge: FAIL. I needed two things from them. A massage for a friend and I (I used e-butler to request it) and the next day I heard from them and by about 1:00 they were still working on it. Huh? The concierges at the St. Regis could not find two male masseurs to do the massage for my friend and I? We ultimately went to the Peninsula after I suggested that instead of waiting to \"hear back\" from their own spa. The best part was me being told, \"you could always call...\" I could call? Isn't that what you do? Technology: Both phones in the room are not working. The butler has to have the engineer to my room today. I cannot dial the butler, cannot set an alarm, and cannot control the lights or anything else. You literally have to walk around the room and turn lights on/off manually. Do you know how many lights are here? This hotel is among the best and their accolades from other members of the media and travel groups are wonderful. But the practical reality is that I am not getting the same service that I would get at the Four Seasons. I did not stay there because they did not have the room type available that I wanted. Staying here is not a disaster, but I come to hotels for service. I'm not getting it here. What I am getting is a lot of \"I'm sorry\" and I'm growing quite tired of them. I don't suggest you stay here if service is what you want. If you want to say \"I'm at the St. Regis\" fine, but if you are looking for something special and a real St. Regis experience - head to Orange County and go to the Monarch Beach.

The lobby is tiny but a true jewel-box, marble everywhere, very elegant and takes you back to a glamorous time in NYC. There are doormen just for the famous revolving doors as well as at least two out front curbside to assist w cabs, luggage, etc. I think we had a standard room on the 5th floor (fronting the street, a bit noisy but this is Manhattan, after all, you expect a few sirens and honking horns at all hours), and it was VERY large for NYC, big for any standard room anywhere. The bed was recessed into an arching alcove, and there was a large chandelier. Furniture is antique French, not my style but still very pretty and high quality. There were speakers in the ceiling for the stereo, I thought this was super (never seen that in a hotel before) and they were high quality. Also, a remote controlled the stereo so I could adjust as needed from bed. I thought this was better than the usual Bose Wave radio on the bedside table. There is a digital control unit for the room on the bedside table, to control lighting, climate, phone, etc. I didn't think this was a revelation necessarily but it was nice to adjust the temperature without getting out of bed. The bathroom was gorgeous, all marble with TWO chandeliers, exquisite fixtures, many towels including true bath sheets (that were all replaced for turndown service, nice) and the best shower in any hotel I've ever been in. The rain head released a true deluge, very luxurious. Despite being an older property I thought the bathroom was spacious and modern, I was pleasantly surprised. There was a separate tub from the glassed shower stall and separate toilet. There are some unique touches here. The china is all antique and a variety of patterns. Absolutely everything was embroidered with the St. Regis logo. There was fresh fruit on china and silver every day placed in the room. Maid service was superb. Room service is delivered by staff in black tie and tails, really! I also liked how you don't sign for room service each time which always seemed ridiculous to me since tip and service charge are already added. Here they just say \"is everything to your liking and can I do anything else?\" If not they whisk out the door. Charges are on your final bill, as it should be, I loved it!

I especially appreciated that he didn't just recommend the most expenisve option, JoJo was top notch from a celebrity chef (Jean-Georges Vongrichten) but the most expensive entree was $34. It was super. One conceirge did give us the wrong subway line for the 1st day for Yankee Stadium, it was for Citi Field instead, but I think they may have had the US Open on the brain.

The location is great, right in the middle of the best shopping in the World, very close to some landmark buildings (Lever House, Seagram's Building) and Central Park. Tons of top dining in the area.

I had always been intimidated by the St. Regis -- I used to live in New York when I was young and had very little money and would sometimes walk by the entrance on my way to work. Well, thirty years can make a difference -- the hotel is the same (as far as I remember) but from the moment the bellman opened the car door to the morning we left, the staff at the St. Regis were gracious, efficient, welcoming and discreet; they were never intrusive, rushed, overly-friendly or (my worst fear) condescending. Luggage, dinner reservations, check-in and -out, breakfast in the room and cars to the airport were all handled with a smooth efficiency that I think comes with a very well-trained staff that works well together. Now, down to business: I had booked a Grand Luxe room, and was upgraded to an Executive Suite. The room was huge, very traditionally decorated (see pictures) quiet and comfortable. Great bathroom, fabulous shower. The property is in the middle of Upper East Side shopping district, and is more than just well-maintained -- everything from the marble floor in the lobby to the gorgeous flower arrangements (they're sort of famous for those, I believe) to the fireplace in our room was either brand new or lovingly-maintained. We had a butler assigned to us, who pressed some clothes, had our shoes polished and made a reservation for dinner. I don't think we were too demanding, but she always showed up at our door within a few minutes of being called. I think of room service breakfast as a litmus test of sorts for hotels: how quickly it comes, how close to the scheduled time, and how good and fresh the food is. The St. Regis passed this test, sort of as expected: the food showed up, beautifully presented, freshly-prepared and exactly what we ordered (I was particularly grateful that the fresh-squeezed orange juice tasted like it had actually been just squeezed). On Sunday, I scheduled a massage at the spa in the morning. I asked if there was any food, since it was around breakfast-time, and the manager just asked what I wanted to eat, and arranged for room-service to deliver it there. The spa is lovely, although not large -- the same holds for the gym. In short, the St. Regis is a beautiful old hotel that lives up to the promise of elegance, refinement and luxury.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MIAMI", "Title": "\u201cBasic Expectations Not Met\u201d", "Author": "MAXZZ", "ReviewID": "UR72486563", "Content": "Recently spent 3 nights at this property.

Let's just start with this: Don't even think about another property in NYC, because this is the closest to heaven on earth in hotel form. From beginning to end, the stay was well worth every penny spent on site. Ok, ok- the room service is pricey- but you're not at a HoJo, and you get what you pay for. I spent this weekend at the St Regis celebrating a momentous occasion and happened to mention it as I reserved my room. Not only did I receive a welcome note and chocolate strawberries from the GM, but it seemed as if all of the hotel staff knew of the celebration too. This examples the overall feeling of my stay: Every detail wasn't too small to be overlooked. The concierge, Peter, was more than helpful securing dinner reservations, exhibit tickets, spontaneous nail appointments and the like and we were grateful for his help. Going to NYC is in itself a stressful task due to the overwhelming amount to see/do and the desk guided us perfectly. We sent some items to be pressed and was pleased that they came back only a few short hours after sending them down. The rooms are beautiful and ample though it was a little difficult to find an available plug in that wasn't in the entry way, bathroom or behind the bed. I resolved that this is due to the age of the hotel itself, which also explains the smaller than expected bathroom size. This is the only negative I could possibly point out, and attributes the 4/5 on the room evaluation. Make sure to go to the King Cole Bar, if only to marvel at the King Cole painting, but I would recommend trying the Bloody Mary. Tea service was pricey but also worth a try and the spa was satisfactory.

The lobby is posh, albeit quite small and will not tolerate much of a crowd. Nevertheless the staff were very nice. I appreciated the personal touches of bringing the key around the desk to hand it to you in person, and the offer for assistance with not only luggage but unpacking as well. While I declined the unpacking I did end up calling the butler for assistance with touching up a shirt for a concert that night. Ok - I did feel a bit odd the first time, but the service was so professional and helpful (I was brought some tea while I waited for the shirts - impeccably finished I might add, with tissue in the sleeves and silk links on the french cuffs!). I quickly became used to calling for my coffee first thing in the morning. My room deal (if you can call it that at that price) included a continental breakfast in the main restaurant, a beautiful space off the lobby. It was great, although I thought $43 was a touch steep! I used room service once and it was prompt, good food and beautiful presentation. The room itself was beautiful and equipped as one would expect at this price point - bedding, bath amenities, etc. were superb. The turn down service was wonderful. No charge for small things like bottled water, coffee, etc. A small thing perhaps, but many expensive hotels still nickel and dime you on such things. I used the spa for a facial and massage which were great. The gym is in the same facility - it is nice, but rather small.

I was satisfied with all of them, and slept well at all of them. I'm also from the NYC area, and the St. Regis is about 45 mins. from my house (w/o traffic), so this was only my second time staying in an NYC hotel even though I know the city fairly well (I commuted for 10 years and 4 jobs). I would have given the St. Regis a better rating, were it not for the fact that it took me 2 hours of tossing and turning to fall asleep, only to wake up every hour or so due to discomfort. Granted, I didn't see other travelers reporting this issue, so I'm guessing it was just the bed in my room. I took a peek under the sheets at the mattress and it looked _old_. It was lumpy and too forgiving in some areas and not forgiving enough in others. My wife slept better than I did, but not terribly well (but she can fall asleep most anywhere). As I said in the preface to this review, I've stayed at many other hotels and have never had a major complaint about the bed, so please don't think that I'm a picky sleeper. A few other issues I encountered: 1) A literal turn-off: The lights in the room were on motion sensors. If I sat still for about 10 minutes, they'd all shut off. Only some would come back on when I waved my arms, but the ones that couldn't \"see\" me would obviously stay off. That's irritating and cheap. 2) Both sinks in our bathroom were partially clogged. In the time it took me to wash up before bed the sink was completely full. It took a considerable time to drain after the water was shut off. 3) The toilet ran. It didn't make noise nor bother me, but it shows poor attention to maintenance. 4) The wired internet in our room didn't work, though the wireless did. 5) The desk lamp would either turn off or it would flicker intermittently. The bulb was screwed in tightly, so I think it was a flaw with the motion sensor that was screwed between the bulb and lamp holder. 6) The in-room entertainment device crashed twice while I was navigating the menu. It took about 5 minutes to reboot, during which time the TV was unusable. It was also ungodly slow such that pushing a button on the remote could take up to 10 seconds to change the channel or move the cursor on the menu. 7) 90% of the staff were absolutely polite and helpful. However we were there for a wedding that was at the hotel and during the wedding: One bar tender made me wait while he wrapped up a personal conversation with another employee (we'd made eye contact as I walked up, so he knew I was waiting). Then he just glared at me until I ordered a drink, and he practically slammed it down on the bar without a word, returning to his personal conversation. At the wedding dinner there was a time where the staff was trading out our dinner napkins for dessert napkins. I had my dinner napkin on my lap, and was talking to my wife. I saw the waiter coming for my napkin so I reached down to hand it to him -- he got there at the same time that I did such that if I hadn't been reaching for it already he would have certainly hit me in my .. ahem .. area with some force. It was very weird, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that he grabbed for it forcefully. Most of the waiters at the dinner were gruff at best, but that guy went to a whole new level of rudeness. (I should point out that I'm generally an easy going and polite guy -- please don't think that I was going around being rude to the staff and getting my comeuppance). Despite the issues enumerated above, I can see how someone would love the hotel if they stayed in a different room and didn't encounter unpleasant staff. As I said, the vast majority of the staff lived up to the St. Regis' claim of excellence. The hotel itself is beautiful and well appointed. I particularly liked the touches of the elevating TV, the hidden electronics, and the room control (lights and HVAC) from the bedside phone/alarm clock/etc. (I am a tech person at heart). Although we didn't make use of the butler's services, she was very polite and seemed ready to help. I only ate at the hotel during the wedding, and in that context I would give the food a low-4-star rating. It was very good, but not great. Also, one amenity that I love to see in a hotel is in-room coffee. When I wake up I like to roll out of bed and have a cup. I don't want to wait for room service, and I certainly don't want to leave my room. Hampton Inns, Holiday Inns, most Marriots (and others) provide this gratis. Yet 5-star hotels (in my experience) prefer to not give you the option. I wouldn't even mind if I had to pay for it, but for heaven's sake, put a coffee maker (or better yet a Keurig machine) in the room. Speaking of which, most hotels offer free local calls and free internet these days. The St. Regis charges $1.50 for a local call (up to 60 minutes IIRC), and up to $9.95/day for internet access. I'm surprised they don't charge for electricity and running water. (I know this complaint is general to hotels of their class, but it bothers me nonetheless). Finally, I'd like to point out that my dad has stayed at the St. Regis numerous times and has always gone back. Since most of my complaints were specific to my room, I'll just leave the reader with this: Request a room change immediately if you're put in 1711.", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely LOVE the St. Regis - 5 stars all the way!\u201d", "Author": "leetlesasa", "ReviewID": "UR53648741", "Content": "I stayed here one night for a mini vacation on a weekday/night.

I must say up front that decor-wise, this isn't my style of hotel. I prefer contemporary, tropical, industrial, quirky designs over the gilt gold old classical decor any time, but decor-wise aside, I must admit I was very disappointed with the overall service at the St Regis. Yes, the rooms were large and comfortable, and the beds heavenly. We had a view of Central Park from the living room and that was very cool. The bathroom was also very large but the shower area was quite small and cramped and poorly ventilated, trapping a lot of stifling steam during a hot shower.

Considering they make up the room everyday and there should have been a turn down service in the evenings, shouldn't they notice these things? Plus, shouldn't the Butlers come in to check once in awhile instead of waiting to be called? Frankly after the second day, we didn't see a single butler and a broken glass that was there on the FIRST DAY we checked in was still there on the day we checked out! And they didn't replace used dirty glasses with clean ones. If we didn't wash them on our own, we wouldn't have clean glasses at all. Honestly, for the money one pays to stay at the Presidential Suite at the St Regis (or in ANY room at the St Regis for that matter), this shouldn't be the case at all. I was also shocked to find that housekeeping attempted to poorly hide the bedcovers behind the curtains! I really don't know why they didn't just fold it neatly and place it in the almost empty armoir instead. They also seemed to want to get their jobs done in a hurry and kept hovering outside the room and appearing every fifteen minutes even though the do not disturb sign was on and we kept telling them that there was a meeting taking place and to come back later. Other than that, the tv in the bedroom was actually quite small, and wouldn't come out properly from the armoir. You also couldn't turn the aircond or heating on permanently, it was either on AUTO or OFF, and left the room feeling very very warm during the night while we were sleeping. And on the last night, housekeeping didn't even put the drinking water out at all. I was also a bit annoyed with the much too large bathroom rug that was too thick to allow the bathroom door to open without bunching it up. The lift was also kind of small and very rattle. Probably time for an upgrade or serious maintenance. Oh, and if paying that much money for a room wasn't enough, they charge you for internet too! I've paid $165 for a room in NYC before and got free internet even then! Also, there were issues with the key swipe every single night. Even when we went down to get it reset, it still didn't work! We were so exhausted to go down again that thankfully the adjoining room was open and we went into the suite from there. Now if I were paying $100 a night and had to deal with these issues, I would understand, heck, we wouldn't even have a butler in the first place. But I have stayed in cheaper hotels with better service! And like I said earlier, for a St Regis, these issues should not happen at all. And I have been lucky enough to accompany my mum on some trips and even in China the butler always comes in to check to make sure everything is alright and the room gets a full cleaning the minute everyone leaves and is in tip top condition when we get back. That is not to say that everyone in the hotel was a horror though. Some of the concierge were very helpful and one guy even pulled up an extra chair in a lobby for me after he saw me standing for an hour waiting for the rest of the entourage to arrive. Some of the guys out front were also pretty good conducting the arrival of guests, traffic and bags. Other than that, I do think the hotel needs a bit of an upgrade. It could wait a few years or so, but \"old\" as opposed to \"classical\" is the first thing that pops into you mind when you step inside. And the fact that the recent reviews I've read here praises the hotel's services makes me doubly disappointed that we did not receive the same service.", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding\u201d", "Author": "forgetdomani", "ReviewID": "UR47210871", "Content": "We visit NYC twice a year and always stay at the St Regis.

We decided to use some points and stay at the St. Regis after we found that all the other starwood hotels were booked for the three nights (4-5-6-7) From all the great reviews about the St. Regis, I was excited! Here's the lowdown: The Good: 1) Location (if you want to do mega shopping aka. chanel, LV and if you want to see big touristy places like the empire and rockafeller)-which we did none of bc this is my millionth trip to ny. 2) The butlers. These people were SO very nice and attentive. They would bend over backward if you asked, and they all had amazingly funny, friendly personalities-yet never intruded, or pressed for money. We had Hong, Albert, Adelberto and two other men. 3) The beds! We stayed in the largest of the Grand Luxe rooms and the beds were great. Super plush and clean....somewhat small thought for a double in American standards(could only fit one person). 4) The bathrooms. If I could have brought this home, I would have! Pretty large for Manhattan standards, marble everything, Lcd and phone and a \"rainforest\" like shower with amazing water pressure. The bath products from their spa work incredibly well, too! 5) We did not hear one thing our entire stay. No other guests, just the ringing of our doorbell as the butler came to bring things. Very peaceful and calming. The Bad 1) We had to change rooms because there was not enough space for three adult people. We reserved a grand luxe (all they had) with two double beds. We asked for an upgrade but they said they were all sold out. When we got into the room, the beds were much smaller than standard US sized doubles, and only could comfortably fit one adult. They did offer a roll away free of charge each night for the confusion. 2) Awful reception (both internet and cell phone). My mother has verizon and our friend has At&t. Verizon got NO service, and at&t got light service. So annoying. 3) Service in general in the lobby as a bit poorer than expected for that class of hotel. Doormen were only stationed at one entrance, bell men were spotty and sometimes not available and we took our own bags from our room to the lobby when leaving. The feel of the hotel was a bit snobby. Many guests were dripping with designer products, in and out of luxury cars and no one EVER smiled or said hello! I didn't get it. There was virtually no lobby (probably to deter people from the streets to come in to use the bathroom). The whole hotel had a heavy european influence with a lot of gold and and chandeliers. Not my personal taste, but for some I bet this was luxurious. One amazing thing the St Regis did do, was order a cake for our friend to be brought to our room after dinner. I gave our butler little notice, maybe 4 hours, and when he brought it up, he said that the hotel had to send away for it because they had no cakes on hand to my specification. So nice! Obv. it cost an arm and leg, but well worth it. Overall, I would not choose to stay here again. I prefer the lower east side, greenwich Village and battery park to midtown bc midtown is so very touristy, but it was definitly NOT awful. One word of advice, don't order food from the hotel room service! A child size hamburger without any sides at all or drink cost $30 oops!

Somehow, the doormen knew my name when I pulled up at the hotel the first time, must have been the last guest to check-in I guess. Check-in itself is very quick and when I gave the girl my Starwood number, she instantly offered me an upgrade to a suite, even though I probably have 4 Starwood stays over the last 2 years.

In general, I do not like classical-style hotels in the US, but the excellent service and very comfortable rooms won me over. The St Regis is an exceptionally well-run hotel with fantastic staff in a perfect New York location. For this style of hotel in NY, I still prefer the Peninsula but it is a very close race. Right from the moment I arrived, everyone was unfailingly friendly and polite: nothing was too much trouble, and every single person who met me greeted me with a cheerful smile. The butler service was much more practical and useful than other hotels I have stayed at: the butler was very friendly and seemed to take a great personal pride in sorting out whatever you requested. Room service breakfast was excellent, and good value compared to other NY five star places. The rooms themselves do the very best they can around the old bones of the hotel. They are decorated in a clean, classical style--my Astor Suite was in a muted yellow with silk wall panels, while my colleague's Grand Luxe room was in a light duck egg blue. Both were good sizes and well laid out, with classical marble bathrooms that are a good size and well-equipped. The Astor Suite suffered from the very small windows you get on the top floors of the building, but in return for that the views were good. For me, given the hotel's short height and location, none of the views are spectacular: just nice views up and down the grand streets. The Grand Luxe room was much brighter, but you only really saw the fronts of other buildings from the windows. All the facilities worked excellently, as expected at this level. Good high-speed internet and excellent climate control in both rooms.

We stayed in a Grand Luxe room which included a couch and living area and a plasma t.v. that would pop up from the foot of the bed by remote control. It swiveled around so that we could watch t.v. either from the living area or the bed. The bathroom had a separate soaking tub and a shower, as well as a dual vanity. The butler would bring in fresh fruit every day and upon request delivered complimentary coffee and tea in the morning hours. Each floor has it's own butler, so there is never much of a wait. The hotel is in an excellent location, right near Park and Fifth Ave.. Designer shopping is around the corner and Central Park is within walking distance. It was exciting to see the thriving city of New York from one of the best parts of downtown Manhattan. The rooms were always very clean and the staff would leave them a bit perfumed after servicing them each day. The service in this hotel was excellent and unobtrusive. Each request was granted quickly and efficiently. I wanted to give this hotel the five stars it should deserve but gave it four for the following reasons. First of all, the room had no light. It was always dark, even during the day. The only rooms with light were on the top floor. Second, except for the new restaurant by Alan Ducaisse, the food was only average and that includes in room dining and at their restaurant near the lobby. Third, the spa, while having good actual massage treatments, had no real waiting area. In the hallway that leads to the treatment rooms, two chairs are set up for people waiting for their massages. You can't make any noise because the people receiving their massages are in doors right behind you. Two other people came for their massage while we were there and there was no room for them to wait anywhere. The last problem had to do with the noise, which really wasn't the fault of the St. Regis. Every night we were there, a heavy garbage truck screeched through the streets of Manhattan to pick up some type of garbage. On Monday night, it was regular garbage, on Tuesday, it was recyclables, Wednesday it was organic materials. They would operate between 12:00 midnight and 2:15 a.m., which made it very difficult to sleep. I think this is just part of being in Manhattan. Other than these problems, this hotel is exceptional, especially in beauty and service.

The Concierge was able to get us a dinner reservation at Daniel and everything was in place for a wonderful trip. We drove in from Connecticut and arrived at the St. Regis at 12:15 p.m.. We took advantage of the valet parking and our bags were taken care of smartly by the very professional doormen working the sidewalk. We we're greeted very warmly and we followed the porter inside to the magnificent lobby. We proceeded to guest registration to check-in. I was greeted warmly by the woman checking us in and she told us because of our early arrival, our room was still occupied. However, she said she had a very nice room for us, a very, very, nice room. She handed me the key cards to our room and we were shown around the hotel by a very charming young woman. We were then taken to the elevator and we proceeded to the 18th floor. We got off the elevator went through the french doors, turned left and proceeded to the end of the hall and there was our room. Room 1803 is also known as the Imperial Suite and we were led inside by our butler. The Imperial Suite was gorgeous. You walk into a marble floored foyer with fresh flowers in a vase on the table. We turned left and proceeded to a beautiful bedroom with french antiques and crystal chandalier over the bed. The marble master bathroom was exquisite and spacious. On the other side of the foyer was the living room with two large circular windows. The oval window looked out to the west on 5th Avenue and the Peninsula Hotel across the Avenue. The other round window faced north with a breathtaking view up 5th Avenue with the trees of Central Park verdant in the distance. Next to the living room was an elegant dining room with a six foot round mahogany table surrounded by six elegant chairs. Off the dining room was a full kitchen with granite countertops. Beyond the dining room was a rich paneled study in the most handsome, masculine wood with a beautiful wood desk and chair. The Imperial Suite also had a total of two and one half baths, four flat screen TVs, crystal chandaliers in every room and luxurious empire furniture. I kidded my wife that I felt like french royalty in this fabulous suite. I could have sat on the padded window seat looking out over Central Park for hours. We left and walked over to MoMA. After about three hours at MoMA, we returned and dressed in only our slippers and robes went down to the Spa and were treated royally with our massages. My masseuse was wonderful. My wife reported that her masseur was also fantastic. We returned to our suite and I decided to take a bath. It was a perfect compliment to the massage. I was totally relaxed. We got dressed for dinner and the doorman hailed us a cab and we were whisked away to Daniel for dinner. What a fabulous restaurant. The food, the presentation and the service were all incredible. After dinner, we decided to walk back to the hotel since it wasn't that far and it was a beautiful spring evening in the city. We returned to the St. Regis and walked into the King Cole Bar for a drink. After a round of Red Snappers and catching up with my cousin the artist and musician who met us there, I told my cousin that he had to see our room. He had been to many 5 star hotels throughout Europe and he said he had never seen such a great suite. After he left, my wife and I sat on the padded window seat and took in the city from our big round window. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud and our bedroom was quiet and peaceful.

He tried to book a suite but was told that there were none available but not to worry---the room would be the best of the rest. He also wanted tickets to South Pacific and was told that the seats, though terribly expensive, would be the best in the house. He also asked to book a private boat for a Sunday morning Hudson River ride... When we arrived, the greetings and help from the doormen and front desk staff just weren't what we expected from this class of hotel. (I had just stayed at the Ritz Central Park South the month before, where the service was absolutely 5 star, and I could see the difference immediately). The room the butler brought us to faced a wall. We asked for another, and they offered a far better room, but at that point, I was wishing we had booked the Ritz. As we vacillated, the butler said the Madison Suite would be available in a few hours if we wanted to wait. So we did. The Madison Suite was spacious, with a foyer, separate living room, and two baths. It was spotless and really quite lovely with all the old architectural details. No complaints at all. Maid service during the day was excellent; the room was always pristine when we returned. (At night, they always missed at least one thing..we stayed 3 nights total.) When we picked up the tickets for the show, they were *not* the best seats in the house. They were in the loge, not in the orchestra. My husband said no to them, which caused a bit of fluster. Ten minutes later, someone called the room saying there had been a mixup and the seats were now 500 dollars less, far more acceptable. So in the end, we experienced the show and loved it, but this is the kind of thing that adds up to a disappointing hotel experience overall... Also, no one ever followed up on the boat trip. Similarly, everyday service was always polite and friendly but spotty. Sometimes someone would be at the door, greeting you and pushing it open, other times you would have to wrestle with it (it's heavy) yourself. Sometimes someone would be at the elevator to ask you which floor; most of the time, not. It *was* nice to stay in a place with such history, built the way nothing is built nowadays, and I'm really glad I did, but I wouldn't stay here again.

St. Regis, Mandarin Oriental, Le Parker Meridian. The Mandarin was our first choice but they didn't have the availability. St Regis was a wonderful second. The ambience and decor is definitely old style luxury. Your are brought to your room and soon, your \"butler\" arrives to introduce you to the amenities of the room including a new touch screen control panel that controls everything. You can ask him for assistance with a number of things but we didn't use the butler service. We got a deluxe room with a very comfortable and plush king bed and sitting area. There is a flat screen tv that comes out of a stand by the foot of your bed for some relaxing in-bed TV. You can swivel the TV around so its facing the couch for viewing there as well. When you are done, press a button and TV lowers out of site. The bathrooms are clean and fancy as well. Definitely let them know if its a special occasion. We mentioned it was our anniversary and when we returned to our room, we found a small bottle of Veuve Cliquot champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us. The only drawback is the steep price. I think we paid $850 + tax for the deluxe room. Its a hefty bill but no more so than the other 5 star luxury hotels in New York.

After gratefully receiving an early check in and a spacious room we received a telephone call not to use the bathroom because there was a sewer problem which would be fixed \"in a little while\". Meanwhile we could go across the street to the Sony Center to use the bathroom. However, I was not feeling all that well and had to stay in our room waiting to be told the problem was over. After four hours we telephoned and were told it was all right now. I do not know if we would ever have been notified. In the evening, still not feeling well, I ordered room service and was told the \"24 hour room service\" would open at 7 pm. When I finally was able to order most of the items on the menu were not available due to \" a problem in the kitchen\". Meanwhile we attempted to find the Silver Sea cruise representative desk and were sent from one floor to the next looking for him. No one seemed to know where he was or when his desk was open. At breakfast the service in the dining room was forgetfull: toast but no bread plates or butter, an unasked for glass of truly awful carrot-ginger juice, a long wait for everything. Then when we checked out we were charged again for the breakfast, although at check-in we had verified that our rate included breakfast. After all these inconveniences we were not offered any complimentary items or compensation, which would have, perhaps, overcome the need to write this negative review of a truly beautiful old-world hotel.", "Date": "June 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo", "Title": "\u201cPleasant if stuffy\u201d", "Author": "TonyTokyo", "ReviewID": "UR7720684", "Content": "In NY for business, I stayed at the St Regis for about a month in total.

Small difference were present: the first room had a DVD player, so the second time I bought a DVD only to find the room only had a VCR. The beds are very comfortable, and the staff take their service levels very seriously - arguably a little too seriously for most people's comfort. It all attracts an overly self-satisfied crowd. Still, small details were annoying, like having the dry cleaning come back with everything steamed perfectly flat and proper, but with so much steam having been used that buttons on $500 shirts were cracked. Not just once or twice either. And returned as if nobody noticed, despite the careful folding and two or three layers of wrapping. Contrasts with a far cheaper hotel I stayed in in HK where my casual shirt came back unexpectedly with a missing button replaced and nicely sewn on.

The comments about the hotel's tight lobby and rooms are all accurate, but what is most disturbing about a hotel at this price point is the disappointing service we experienced. Here are just a few examples - Upon check in, we were informed that we would be provided with a bottle of wine and cheese platter in honor of a special occasion. During our stay, this never arrived. We also dined in the hotel's restaurant for breakfast and afternoon tea. The service during both did not impress. To the hotel's credit, the tea was delicious, but we were unable to finish all the sweets and asked for a box to take them to our room. The waiter offered to deliver them and we accepted this offer. The sweets did not arrive until several hours later and we charged for them at checkout. After two nights at the St. Regis, we decided to leave the hotel early and see if the similarly-priced Penninsula would deliver a better experience (it did - see review).

What a wonderful stay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d go back again in a minute. This hotel boasts a kind of hushed elegance that strikes just the right counterbalance to the hustle and bustle of New York City. The location, on Fifth Avenue in the mid-50s, is far enough away to avoid the crowds of the theater district but close enough to make getting around simple and straightforward. The lobby and public spaces are both grand and intimate and the hallways are hushed and elegant. The flowers and fine decoration everywhere make it seem the height of luxury. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s layout, design, service and amenities are all as top-notch as you would expect. The highlight of our stay was the room. We were upgraded to an Astor Suite and greatly enjoyed the extra space. The rooms are traditional, but with modern amenities and the result is a nice blend of both elegance and technology that is not an easy thing to pull off in a hotel room. The St. Regis succeeds very well in this regard, probably because it has always been a high-end hotel and changes made during the renovation simply updated what was already there. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not sure if they added soundproofing during the renovation or if the hotel has always been so quiet: either way it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a truly relaxing escape, with no outside sounds to interfere with the wonderful ambiance of the rooms. The front desk service, housekeeping and concierges are all excellent. We particularly enjoyed the food and beverage presentations, complimentary pressing and shoe shines and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no problem\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd attitude of the wonderful butler service. The only drawback to our stay was the service in the restaurant and bar. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re Four Seasons people and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re accustomed to service in the bar and restaurant being one of the highlights of our stay at those properties. Despite the elegance and luxury of the St. Regis, the bar service was perfunctory at best and the breakfast service was slow and mostly unfriendly. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shame, because the space (even with the current construction in the restaurant) is beautiful. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sit in the bar itself because the small space was overflowing with people (we sat in the lower bar/restaurant area instead), but it looked very nice and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend at least seeing it during your stay at this hotel. This is not a hotel for families on vacation in New York City: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a more refined and elegant space than the typical tourist hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably also not a hotel for serious business travelers who need service beyond their rooms: the business center is a dark room off the staircase with what looks like discarded furniture and very little privacy. This is a hotel for people looking for an elegant, luxurious, relaxing place to stay in the heart of New York City.

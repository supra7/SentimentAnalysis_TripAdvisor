While I'm usually wary of non-branded hotels I took a chance on the Pacific Inn. In general, we were pleased with the value for our money. Check in was quick and painless and I was able to get my room even though I was there 30 minutes before check in time. My key didn't work but I went back to the front desk and got a new one. No great inconvenience there. The room was functional, though it's missing some of the amenities in just about every other place I've stayed: no hair dryer, no iron/ironing board, and no coffee maker. Apparently some rooms have fridges and microwaves, but not mine. They are updating some rooms though, based on the comments here, this seems to be a continuous work in progress. As for the noise, I wasn't really affected by it. Yes, there are railroad tracks right behind the hotel and the airport is close by and you will hear the noise but they didn't bother me. The continental breakfast consisted of individually wrapped bagels and danishes, fruit, coffee, and cereal. If that isn't enough for you there's a Jack in the Box next door and a Denny's up the street. The convention center is about 1.5 miles away. If you don't want to walk you can take the trolley though you will need to change trains. Or you can just drive since convention center parking is $10. I would definitely consider staying here again if I'm going to the convention center.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGREAT Deal for the Money!\u201d", "Author": "indietravelgirl", "ReviewID": "UR123998582", "Content": "I am usually on the go when I vacation.

And the trains had stopped running by the time we went to bed. This is a small, 60's style hotel with a very small front office and rooms accessed from the outside. The only thing I didn't like was having to lug my very heavy suitcase (for a two week cruise to Hawaii) up the outside stairs. Our room was very tastefully decorated. It had been recently renovated. The bathroom was small but had decorator tile and a granite countertop. The king sized bed was quite comfortable. The room also had comfortable furniture and decorator colored walls, and nice bedspreads and bedding. The front desk lady when we checked in was fantastic and so helpful. She called a taxi to take us to the cruise port the next morning. It arrived in less than 5 minutes. The hotel even had maps on the counter showing all the eating establishments in the area. (However, the guy behind the front desk the next morning seem disinterested and not particularly friendly.) The continental breakfast consisted of your typical bagels, pastries, fruits, cereals, etc. as well as coffee and juices. The only place to sit was at several tables on the covered front porch, but we just brought our food up to our room and ate at the nice table in there which was just fine. It may not have been the fanciest hotel in the area, but it was close (walking distance) to everything, and the room itself was not that much different than at the nicer hotels I usually stay at.

GOOD: The location is somewhat convenient as you could walk into the downtown core of San Diego for any night life (15min walk). For anything else, such Old Town, San Diego Zoo, Sea World, you will need to drive, but they are all pretty close. The continental breakfast is actually good and has quite a bit of selection.

BAD: Nothing really negative comes to mind. I guess the nearby train tracks could cause grief for some travelers, but we only found it mildly inconvenient more about the fact that we had to wait for passing trains during our walks into downtown (to go across) rather than the noise. We really enjoyed San Diego, with its Old Town and fabulous Mexican restaurants, the gorgeous Balboa Park which reminded us of Seville, Spain, the nightlife downtown and the splendid sunset seen from the Sunset Cliffs where the sun came down from clouds and then vanished gloriously into the horizon.

However, I list it as a con as a quiet restful sleep is important to most travellers. - The air conditioner was very old and as loud as a Ford diesel truck engine. - The housekeeping staff never smiled, always had a tired disinterested, look on the faces, making us wonder if they were treated well.

Only a two mile drive drive up Pacific Hwy to MCRD. The Marriott, it's not. But at a reserved price of $75, it's a really good deal. I'd definitely say that the Pacific Inn & Suites are a good go between upper end (Marriott) and budget (Motel 6).

I suggest getting there early in the evening and parking. Downtown/Gaslamp is a short trolley ride. And the complaints are true about the train that passes through twice a night. Light sleepers should get a room towards the front. It's not anything that the hotel can do anything about and is something you will have to deal with if you stay along that line. Also, there's no convenience stores close by so if you plan on having snacks/beverages in your room, pick them up before you settle in for the night.

I booked my room through trip advisor, I think in went through travelocity, anyway the description said jacuzzi suite upgrade, the only reason I booked the room. When I checked in I was told the website has an error and should read jacuzzi upgrade available!! Sounds like a scam to me, I'm traveling for business, I'm not paying for the room so I decided to stay anyway. I was offered the upgrade for 30 bucks, normally 80 but after seeing that little jacuzzi tub (I'm 6'3\") I decided to stay in a regular room. I'm paying more here than I paid for a real suite last week that is about 3 times the size of this room! I'm checking out tomorrow and staying there, they were booked today (Columbus Day). The room was terrible, old, beaten up furniture, the bathroom mirror is loose, some areas are in desperate need of paint, the train tracks are right behind the hotel and that friggin horn is LOUD! The pool is pretty disgusting, there are little buckets outside of each room to catch the water run off from the AC units, what happens when the fill up? I asked for an iron and board at the front desk, they had irons but no boards! The room descriptions also claim pillowtop beds and newly remodeled rooms, again another reason why I decided to stay. I'm kind of pissed off at trip advisor for allowing that to be posted on their site. Nothing here is new and if this is a pillowtop bed, them I'm Donald Trump!

My daughters and I needed an overnight place to stay near the Star of India in San Diego Bay for an event and the Pacific Inn fit our needs just fine. It's an older \"motel-style\" property with only about 40 rooms, but the rooms were clean and adequately furnished. No bugs, no mold, no overly obnoxious smells, everything worked, etc. The window-model air conditioners were noisy, but if you've ever stayed in a motel, you know this is usually the case.

We didn't have a reservation anywhere and everywhere we tried to check in was booked due to the Comic Con International, the American Idol auditions, and the Rodeo being in town at the same time. My mother was starting to panic! We were heading down Pacific Hwy when we spotted the Pacific Inn and Suites. We checked it out and we liked what we saw. At the Reservation Desk we met Sherrie, who was very pleasant, helpful and understanding (her grandmother is about my mom's age, so she knows what it is to travel with an elderly parent). Sherrie got us checked in and even though our room was not ready yet, she allowed my mother to use the facilities in another room. Again, Sherrie was very accomodating to the elderly. After a great lunch at a restaurant nearby, we got settled in our suite, which was neat, clean and cool, as it was extremely hot that day. Sherrie gave us perfect directions to get to the San Diego Zoo, and directions on how to get back to the Hotel that night. Later, the evening staff gave us directions to Old Town so we could get a Mexican meal for dinner that night. The next morning we had a great hot breakfast there at the Hotel and again, Sherrie gave us directions to Sea World with directions on how to get back to the Hotel from the park. We truly enjoyed our stay at the Pacific Inn and Suites. The entire staff was very helpful and accomodating to our every need. And please give Sherrie a big raise.

After looking at the reviews at this site -- in retrospect, unfortunately --, I wished that I would have done more research beforehand. While we had better luck than others with customer service, the reviews here appear to be dead on about the accomodations. Be warned of: (1) The non-existent wireless connection. As others before me had said, the wireless internet service was not working, which was one of the primary reasons why we booked this place. Technically, the wireless aspect worked; we got a signal to the router, but was the router connected to the internet? Apparently not. (2) The overpowering scent, which never went away. Everytime that we entered the room, even after airconditioning it and/or airing it out with open windows, the room reeked of a cheap-smelling fruit-flavored air freshener, strong enough to take you aback upon opening the door. What's odd is that we never found a source of it. And, it never went away. The scent was so strong and pervasive, it only felt like we were victims of some weird practical joke. How could it be that bad? (3) Comfort, i.e. lack thereof. Everything felt cheap all around from the bed to the linens to the shampoo. The towels were small, really thin, and worn out to the point of being scratchy than soft. There were only two of them, which usualy isn't so bad, but given their size and lack ability to absorb, it wasn't enough. One could feel the springs in the bed. (4) Renovated? How? We read some unflattering reviews on other websites, but had still given this hotel the benefit of the doubt due to their claims that they had renovated the property (and that it had wireless internet). After seeing our room, we repeatedly wondered -- what was renovated? The bed was hard and old. The furniture in the room appeared to be old and outdated too. The picture frames in the room -- again, old and outdated. The bathroom, barren and dingy-looking. If this was renovated, then how bad was it before? Conclusions In conclusion, I have traveled extensively and under a budget. I felt that my expectations for this little hotel, as for any hotel, was reasonable. No matter what the price, I expect a clean, comfortable sanitary room. However, what we got was more of a cheaply furnished, scantedly supplied, overwhelmingly artificially-freshened room with no internet connection.

Since all other hotels were booked and we couldn't produce the paper confirmation (that night was added to the reservation over the phone), we agreed to pay an extra $36. Only then did they inform us that they had moved all of our stuff out of our room and it was sitting in the lobby! They had just thrown our laptops, clothes, etc, into our bags and moved us out. Incredible (and probably illegal)! We had to move ourselves back in. The staff was incredibly rude at all times. On checkout day, they handed us a credit card slip and told us to sign. I asked for an itemized bill and there were $18 of bogus charges on it. $8 for the 'room safe'. $10 for 'water'. Despite the fact that we never touched any of their bottled water, and never had a key to our safe, the counter clerk said they were standard charges and refused to remove them. When I went back up to the room to prove to him that the safe had a key-lock with no key, the maid had already come by and removed money we left on the counter. Granted, this was eventually supposed to be her tip, but we hadn't checked out yet, we were still in the hotel, and our keys still worked. Isn't that technically robbery? A sign behind the desk states they're not responsible for lost or stolen items. So they charge for a safe, and then they're not responsible if something gets stolen from it? Nonsense.

My room was a smoking room-REEKED of smoke and goodness knows what else-I sat on a towel after removing the bed cover. There was urine on the toilet seat and even with all the lights on, you could barely see, I had hoped for a bathtub but without a can of Comet there was no way I was doing that. There was really nothing I could do-the price was right but I was really depressed and would suggest anyone staying here to bring a strong scented candle-there was also trains going by until late hours of the night. Pluses-very close to the convention center, Little Italy, and there's great Mexican food on the corner.

We were visiting San Diego to attend the Holiday Bowl and had driven 13 hours from Northern California to San Diego. The day of check-in I called the hotel at noon to let them know that we would be arriving at approximately midnight. I wanted to be sure that they did not give away our reservation. At 1:15am I received a phone call from the front desk manager asking where I was and why I had not called him to tell him I was going to be late. When we arrived at the hotel about ten minutes later this man was so rude to me. He told me I was inconsiderate and had no concerns for him, making him stay up all night until I arrived. I have never been treated so rudely by a member of a hotel staff. I reminded him that I was the customer... this didn't seem to matter to him. I got the feeling that he spoke to me this way because I was a woman... he did not speak to my husband rudely when my husband came to the lobby to find out what was going on. The reason we chose this hotel was because we were traveling with our two (elderly & well behaved) dogs. What a mistake. The room was filthy. I spent both nights sleeping with a hooded sweatshirt, sweatpants, gloves and socks so I wouldn't have to touch the sheets. The bathroom was a disgrace with old, stained towels.

The walls actually were smeared with dirt on the inside. The bathroom had tons of mold and the towels were old and dingy. The soap provided was the cheapest quality you could offer. They did not offer shampoo in a little bottle, but a TACO BELL type packet. All staff that worked there were completely rude and did not even care if you were unhappy. The soda and snack machine on the premises were completely empty. The only good thing I could say about this motel was the location.

We checked in around 2am due to delayed flights and a long baggage wait in Miami. The taxi attendant at the airport chose a van for us, which turned out to be un-metered. If it wasn't so late at night and we weren't so exhausted and miserable, I would have requested a different van. We had a gut feeling we were getting hosed when the driver quoted us $55 for the ride to the hotel, but were too tired and inexperienced with Miami and the area to make a fuss. (Later I found out it should have only cost around $35). The fellow who checked us in was friendly enough and efficient. When I went to purchase a bottle of water from the vending machine and discovered that the entire machine was out of stock of everything, I enquired with the front desk about alternatives and he very kindly provided us with complimentary small bottles of water. Nice touch. I booked a one bedroom suite, with a pull out couch in the living room. My parents got the bedroom and said it was quite comfortable. However, the pull out couch was the worst I have ever had the displeasure of \"sleeping\" on. All wires and coils and very little mattress. My husband and I kept rolling into each other in the middle. The bathtub/shower was in the bedroom and had a tall and wide side to climb over to get into. If you have limited mobility it would have been very difficult as it was very awkward. Breakfast was okay. A couple of cereal choices (raisin bran, rice krispies and fruit loops), bread to make toast, yogurt, some yucky looking patties of egg and sausage. The highlight was probably the make-your-own waffles. But with the line-up of people wanting that, I didn't have time to try it. It was difficult to get a taxi to take us to the port due to the distance of the hotel from the airport (where there are always taxis in the neighbourhood). It took an hour for one to arrive after calling and cost about $35 if memory serves. Overall I'd say this was an average hotel, but for meeting my two requirements I have to give it a thumbs down. The pull out couch was a nightmare and the distance from the airport and the port make it very inconvenient. Google map it before booking and expect to pay high taxi fares to/from, as obviously other reviewers who rate this hotel as being convenient for cruises have very different ideas of what that means. The hotel we stayed in post-cruise was a much better option for our needs (Hyatt House Miami Airport).", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Silver Spring, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cClean, nice amenities, soft beds\u201d", "Author": "Abby A", "ReviewID": "UR126054137", "Content": "We like a firmer mattress.

The hotel was conveniently located near Florida International University, where I was meeting a client and some students. I slept comfortably and the breakfast was okay. The staff was courteous but not as concerned or empathetic as I would have liked. (I'll explain) I woke up the next morning searching for my phone. I figured it had fallen through the crack of the mattress and the headboard. I reached down to discover all types of hidden treasures (not really). First I pulled up an old remote, which lead me to believe that they do not normally check the head of the beds because the room had a new remote. Next, I touched something that felt like satin. I immediately pulled the bed back and to my disgust I found a pair of panties (I would upload a picture but I don't want to offend anyone. I have one available by request.) How gross was that? I informed the hotel staff and they didn't seem the least bit alarmed or concerned. One of the receptionist even made an excuse saying the the cleaning person probably couldn't move the bed. I informed her that I, a very petite lady who barely weighs 120 lbs, had no trouble moving it so I don't see anyone else having a problem. She offered to send someone to clean the room, but I informed her I was checking out in a couple of hours so it was unnecessary. It kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. I kept thinking: 1) the room should've been thoroughly examined upon my arrival and 2) what if the person wearing those underwear last was infected by something.

I prefer under $100 hotels with good reviews however in the Miami area it seemed all hotels in that price range had somewhat scary reviews about the quality of the hotels, service and/or the neighborhood - such as crime. I picked Comfort Suites because it seemed to be one of the lowest price hotels that had great reviews. It turned out to be a good decision and I was satified in this case to pay $144 for the night using Comfort Suites web site and early payment. For the area it seemed a reasonably good value and it was a very nice hotel and one night stay. The standard room was a true suite with a sitting area with couch table and chair and wired and wireless internet. Good furnishings and very comfortable beds gave us a great night's sleep. The room had a nce flat screen TV and large selection of stations, good amenities, a refrigerator - pretty much everything you could need or expect in a qulity room. The free breafast included do-it-yourself waffles, also very nicely done scrambled eggs that were not wet and browned sausage as well as cereals, bagels, oatmeal, juices, etc. Coffe and tea are available 24 hours as well as in room coffee makers. The front desk staff was friendly and efficient and made us a restaurant recommendation - Sergios for Cuban food - that gave us one of the best meals ever and at very low prices for dinner. I also posted a review of Sergios. The hotel is at the edge of a shopping center with a CVS Drug Store and a Publix grocery store where we bought our \"take aboard\" wine for our cruise. Comfort Suites provided a great one night stay in Miami. It looks like hotels in the area are expensive.

Next morning was hard boiled eggs with bacon. There is a waffle maker you can use, a small selection of cereals (3) and fruit juices. It is very basic.

We were accommodated in some 5 Florida hotels before, so we have possibility to compare them.After only one day and night in this hotel we decided to cancel our plans and no travel anywhere else, simply stay in the best hotel of all . And do you ask me why? There was everything we needed in one place in this hotel. Good nice and clean accommodation, really suitable, good service, pool, PC room, Fit room, good way equiped room and specially nice and good people -staff, open and all the time ready to help and give an advice . So I felt , that I return from our trips not to hotel, but simply I went home.I was a bit sad to leave this nice place, where every morning kind and keep smilling Mr. Ernesto J. Vaca , wished me and other quests to enjoy our breakfast and have a nice day. And the breakfast service waited to last guest, not closing during eating . I felt, that it was really over duties of common personal, when I wanted to buy some souvenirs , which I couldn\u00c2\u00b4t manage to discover enywhere and I was with great style given by the exceptional man.

We were looking for a suites based hotel offering complimentary wireless internet , free parking, breakfast and with reported good service from staff. The Comfort Suites hotel at Kendall met all of these requirements, and was able to offer an excellent deal. They offered a \"stay 4, pay 3\" package on their own website, and we were able to take advantage of this discounted rate fro our 6 night stay. Our experience at the hotel was excellent.

The manager, Senor Ernesto Vaca, aims to please and will go the extra mile for any guest. The desk attendants are courteous and helpful and they, too, will do whatever it takes to help guests out. The person responsible for the breakfast, Senora Eva, puts out one of the finest breakfasts anyone could reasonably expect of a hotel -- hot eggs, sausage or bacon, a variety of breads and bagels, lots of different cereals, fruits, yogurt, Danish, flavored creamers, waffles, coffee, four different juices.

The second week the front desk staff greeted me by name, even though I had not identified myself when I requested the shuttle, same for the third week. All the staff were friendly, even at 4:00am in the morning when I had to catch the bus to catch my flight. The Bistro was a nice place to get dinner for the evening, nothing extravagant, but better than going out.

The room was of nice quality, flat screen tv, spacious bathroom, but the room overall seemed just a bit small- designed for two people basically. The free internet was ethernet only- no wireless. The breakfast we paid for was in a room that was cramped. The service during breakfast was mediocre at best. There were two plates left when my girlfriend and I arrived for breakfast, those after us had to wait for new plates to come out in order to serve themselves. There were no clean cups, we had to ask the young lady who was overseeing the service for beverages which she brought out promptly to us and with a smile, but the solution in my eyes would have to bring out clean cups for other guests not just us. The same goes for silverware. Needless to say, the young lady overseeing the breakfast service seemed overwhelmed and inexperienced. But we got our breakfast, ate, enjoyed it and all was well.

Airport. Hotels in Philly commonly have lots of problems -- high prices, poor service, bad maintenance, lousy management -- so this hotel was a BIG surprise. There was a lot of thought put into the refurbishment that was done a year or so ago, and it was implemented well. And as a previous poster noted, the building is very solid. I never heard a sound from another room. The carpeting, linens, furniture and toiletries are a cut above what one would expect, as is the free breakfast: Not only is there an ample buffet, but they'll cook to order an omelet or other hot dishes at no cost! And unusual for Philly (the \"City of Brotherly Shove\"), I found all the employees to be pleasant and relatively competent; no \"attitude\" here. Other small but nice touches include an excellent desk/work area (with free high-speed Internet); excellent lighting throughout the room; and a curved rod for the shower curtain, which gives the feeling of much more space in the shower. There are a small, unimpressive \"fitness center\" and a small swimming pool; both are clean and offer nice thick towels. Minor minuses: I'd have liked a \"central\" heating/cooling system; my room had one that was built into the wall. It worked fine but created a draft when I was working at the desk. Also, a refrigerator would have been welcome. Some might disagree, but I found the location and layout to be an advantage: It's in an industrial area very close to the airport, there's free parking, and easy access to both of Philly's major freeways. (I-76 and I-95). It's a 15-minute drive to the sports stadiums and to a wide selection of excellent restaurants in South Philly or in suburban communities like Media. This hotel deserves to be solidly in the three-star category. I gave it a five rating both because of the factors I described above and because of the weak competition.", "Date": "October 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Annapolis, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Airport Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ljk73", "ReviewID": "UR8753406", "Content": "We went to Philly for a long weekend to celebrate a birthday. Many of the downtown hotels were full and the ones that weren't were ridiculously expensive. Having never been to Philly before, we were worried about finding our way to downtown from an airport hotel. Happily, it all worked out very well. Although there is no shopping or restaurants readily close by, it was an easy drive to downtown. We found out upon arrival that the hotel was undergoing some renovation. At first I was disappointed, but that quickly went away. Our room was very nice, completely renovated and it seemed as if we were the first ones to use it! The renovation was continuing in the hallway outside our room and all of the ceiling tiles were taken out, exposing the wiring and pipes above. However, the workers conducted their job as absolutely subtly as possible. In fact, we never heard a thing. They totally cleaned up everything each day so that you couldn't tell they had even been there. Congrats to Marriott for really making the renovation a non-issue. Our check-in went smoothly except for a glitch with our room key which did not work. We had a nice courtyard view and did not notice the airport traffic at all. This is an older hotel that was obviously built back when they built them properly. The walls and floors are very solid and thick. We never heard a peep of noise from anywhere. The beds and linens were great. The room stayed at the perfect temperature with a very quiet thermostat. But the highlight of the stay was the shower head. My goodness, that thing was awesome. Wanted to bring it home with us. Our checkout was smooth, billing, rates, and coupons were all correct. One of the front desk staff gave us a great tip and directions for a breakfast stop.

Pros -- 1. Friendly, efficient check-in. Had to sign \"no party\" agreement -- fine by me! Guests at hotel are not to have more than 5 people in their rooms. 2. Comfortable lobby with WiFi and good, free coffee & tea. 3. Breakfast buffet was very nice and cost $8.95. 4. Clean, nicely decorated room. 5. Very comfortable bed. We stayed in \"King Room\", which also has a pull-out double-sized sofa bed. 6. Abundance of non-smoking rooms. 7. Very close to airport. Terminal is on east side of I-95 and hotel is on west side of I-95. Free airport shuttle. 8. Except for lobby door, all other entrances to property require room key. Pool and workout area both require room key, as well. 9. Large desk in room. 10. Take-out from local restaurant can be delivered to hotel and charged to room. 11. Nice choice of in-room movies. Used pay-per-view to watch a movie that hadn't yet been released on DVD or premium tv. 12. No problems with water pressure or temperature. 13. Free high-speed internet access in rooms. (If you want WiFi, just go to lobby.) 14. Quiet rooms! Average -- 1. Exercise room could stand to have updated cardio equipment. Three treadmills, exercise bike and stair stepper not exactly latest equipment. Cons -- 1. Parking lot is not fenced in. Signs all over that you park at your own risk. This area of Phila is very peaceful, but still...keep your vehicle locked and watch yourself at night. 2. No \"park and fly\" packages. Probably because hotel parking lot is not fenced in. (Hint: Airport parking lot is sometimes very crowded with long walk to shuttle stops and even longer wait for shuttle. There are private lots nearby where you drop your car at the office and hop right on a shuttle. Priced the same or cheaper than airport lot.) 3. What is it with the temperature of indoor pools at hotels lately? I guess they save money by keeping the temperature low, but we couldn't swim. It was just too cold! 4. Large hot tub was the temperature the pool should have been -- which is too cold for a hot tub. 5. Hotel policy is that children are not to be in the pool are at all after 9 PM. Hotel policy is also that children under 16 must be accompanied by parent at all times in pool area. Hotel did not enforce policy. We could not stay in pool area due to ten youngsters in a group that were apparently dumped in the pool area one evening instead of staying with a babysitter. They tended to follow us everywhere we went and used the hot tub as a pool - splashing and yelling all the time. We asked them to stop splashing and bumping into us (little boys hurt when they keep plowing into you at full force!), but they got worse. Decided to leavy anyway, due to temperature of water and lack of chemicals in hot tub. (It was \"slimey\".) We actually picked this hotel for the indoor pool and hot tub. VERY DISAPPOINTED!! They have such a nice pool area...they really should take care of the water chemicals, temperature and enforce their \"children\" policy. 6. Along same lines -- hotel is supposed to stock towels in pool area. The children seemed to have beaten us to them and they had them scattered everywhere. 7. Restaurant (except for breakfast) and room service only available Monday through Friday. Still giving hotel above average rating due to overall facility and good staff, but they really should work on the pool situation. If you don't go to the pool (which I admit most people don't), this hotel is just fine.

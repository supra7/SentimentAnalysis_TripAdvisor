{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good in Parts First of all, this is the Super 8 CLOSEST to Fisherman's Wharf. That does not mean close. It would not be decribed by most people as within walking distance. The rooms are perfectly clean and adequate and the location is good for restaurants, shops, public transport. Breakfast area was a joke - when it opened - which was invariably about an hour later than advertised. The couple running the reception desk were more concerned with looking after their baby, quite rightly some would say, than with running their business. Do not try to book a taxi through the motel. I asked and was amazed to overhear the conversation where the motel reception asked the taxi firm to add $35 on for their cut. We knew the fare should be about $12-$15 so were amazed to be told that it would be $80! Needless to say we declined and got one outside for the $12 we expected to pay to the cruise terminal.", "Date": "Jan 2, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR944720730", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "dragonannie"}, {"Content": "Not worth the money! I stayed at this hotel with my mom on our trip to San Fran to check out Pier 39 and Fisherman's Warf. I booked this hotel because I thought it would be within walking distance of the Warf. It is not within walking distance, in my opinion. It took us over an hour to walk there and we took a taxi cab home (taxi cost $10 if that gives an indication of how far it is)Also, the room was sub-par at best. I payed $ 169 a night for 2 nights. The room was old looking, the bathroom door wouldn't stay shut. It didn't have an alarm clock in the room. Could hear noise all night long. The free breakfast consisted of cold cereal (fruits loops and corn flakes), pre-packaged danishes and orange or apple juice.I wouldn't recomend staying here unless your options are limited.", "Date": "Oct 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR294755554", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Pharmerjess"}, {"Content": "Don't book your room directly with this place - go through super 8 We reserved 2 rooms at this place for Saturday, September 6 at the exhorbitant price of $149 plus taxes for a Super 8. Not exactly a budget motel in my opinion. The woman who took my reservation was being distracted constantly by small children in the background and took a long time just to book the room. I was given a confirmation number for my reservation and wrote it down. Within hours of making my reservation, I called back to cancel because I got a better deal elsewhere. The second call was handled by a man who again was constantly distracted by small children in the background, these were not children of guests as the people that I was talking to were dealing with the children as parents. When I completed the cancellation, I asked specifically for a cancellation number and was told that my cancellation number was the same as my confirmation number and that I would receive an email confirming so. I never received the email and should have called them back but didn't feel the need and actually forgot about the whole thing. Until today....When I checked my card balance online this morning I found that I have been charged $400 for two rooms that I cancelled the same day that I made the reservation!!!!! Upon calling the motel, I was told by the manager that I never cancelled the room because it would show in their system. I was also told that they would have given me a cancellation number had I cancelled and since I do not have one, then my reservation was never cancelled. So I am being overcharged for 2 rooms that I did not use based on the mistake of the front desk operator. I cannot even rate this motel because I didn't stay there last night in the rooms that I obviously didn't know were there for us. My advice - don't call this place directly if you want to book a room, go through Super 8 reservation system so that you talk to a professional and get the information you need.", "Date": "Sep 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR552588917", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "l_smith6196"}, {"Content": "Decent but some better options near by I travel through S.F. 2 times per month on business.

Right Price Myself and two others stayed in a room here for two nights. I have to admit that I was skeptical going with a small Super 8 in San Francisco, but I was pleasantly surprised. The rooms seem to have been recently updated with nice crown molding and light fixtures. The beds were actually quite comfortable and provided a good nights sleep even with two grown adults sharing one bed. The front desk folks were extremely helpful and always available when needed. I had actually seen a hotel down the street with a lobby closed for the night sign at the front door and some unfortunate man locked out and unable to check in. That was not the case at this hotel. While we were there I saw many people walk up to check availability so you can tell the location and price was right. Just a block walk from a major bus stop that brings you wherever you want! Parking is a pain with only about 8 spots for the entire hotel. I would suggest leaving your car elsewhere or not moving your car during your stay if you actually happen upon a parking spot. A great little place to stay and well worth the price! I will definitely be staying here again if I go back to San Fran on vacation.", "Date": "Sep 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR444227369", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "PickyTravelerMN"}, {"Content": "Fantastic Location After a long 'Around the World' vacation San Francisco was our last port of call, then home to Australia. Staff in attendance of this older style Super 8 Motel, welcomed us warmly, and cheerfully gave 'local' information. The spotlessly clean double room had everything you need and everything worked. This area is a haven of stylish Restaurants and trendy little shops; a wonderful surprise for us, not knowing the area. Bus's in the street behind the Super 8 were frequent and took us to the City Centre  back; and just a short walk from the 'stop' to Fisherman's Wharf (where we spent a lot of our time).

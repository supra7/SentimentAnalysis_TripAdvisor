It begins with the friendly greeting you receive in the driveway when you leave your taxi or turn your car over to an attendant. It continues with reception: the greeting is genuinely warm, and if you're a regular, don't be surprised if you're recognized and remembered. One of the pleasures of the Four Seasons Beverly Hills is the explosion of color which greets you in the lobby from the flower arrangements. Nowhere is this more stunning than in the area facing the elevators. Every time I check in, I'm in anticipation, wondering what floral delights await me. Excuse me for harping on this, but I think the flowers are one of the most striking aspects of this hotel's distinctive personality. The rooms are beautifully appointed in the classical sense \u00e2\u20ac\u201d meaning that they are devoid of the trendy nonsense which mars so many luxury hostelries these days. The beds are comfortable and luxurious, there is a comfortable easy chair with lamp. and the work area is excellent. There's a large flat TV screen with a good selection of channels. The cooling and heating is simple, reliable and doesn't drive you into an apoplectic rage. The marble bathrooms are a continuing pleasure. Internet access room charges seem questionable, given that this is an era where free wi fi is available at the most lowly Motel 6 or Best Western. However, take note that it's also free here if you go to the business centre and use one of the four desktops available 24 hours of the day. Valet parking is pricey but less so than at the Beverly Wilshire, the other Four Seasons hotel in the area. The hotel bar is a lively meeting place for many of L.A.'s beautiful people, and it tends to be noisy at night. However, all customers receive the same warm and friendly treatment from the staff. There is a good short food menu at the bar, fairly priced. As for the restaurant itself, which was recently redesigned and now offers Italian cuisine, it is outstanding, and will not bust your budget. Room service is fine, and so is the food. Still, the room service menu is getting a little dull. But that's a minor quibble. And I can recommend the chicken soup, Cobb salad, and lobster sandwich", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service, True Four Seasons Experience\u201d", "Author": "oceanman18", "ReviewID": "UR125498507", "Content": "This is a great hotel with excellent service from Concierge Desk to Housekeeping.

Yeah, yeah, I know the passport photo trick hotels like the 4S use to identify their guests, but it felt warm and genuine and I went for it- hook, line and sinker. I had a suite (God bless Amex Platinum) big enough for one of my BFF's to stay one night, and a a balcony that looked over the mountains. Breakfast was amazing- there's a mixed juice drink called the Italian Mob you must get. The spa was great- had a massage with a wonderfully attentive massuese.

Room service food was incredible. I'm still in awe of the Jet-Lag smoothie from the breakfast menu. It's like a miracle tonic. I had room service for about 4 of the meals and each time it was perfect from the service to to the speed to the food itself. They even had online ordering via the in-room iPad. Even the mini-bar had an impressive selection of goodies. We ate at Culina one night. I had the simple spaghetti and it was hands-down the BEST spaghetti I've ever had. And the slices of bread (cannot remember what it was called) are amazing. Everyone at our table ordered something different and not a single person was disappointed. They gladly held my luggage for a few extra hours after I checked out (I was finishing up a press event). I didn't get a chance to check out the pool or workout center, but others in our party sang high praises for both.

The gym is good, and the locker rooms beautiful and spotless. Room service was perfect, but as others on TripAdvisor have noted, unbelievably expensive. A breakfast of one fruit plate, one bagel w/ cream cheese & salmon, coffee, two juices, with 20% included tip and $4 service charge added, was $96. A lg. pot of coffee is $16. Go downstairs or eat everything in the minibar; it's going to be less painful. Here's another stab at a perennial complaint with almost every hotel in this level: WiFi was $15/24 hours. Note that it's 24 hours, not for a \"day.\" if you check in at 10 and out at 12 the next day, that's TWO 24hr charges. When will these hotels realize that this makes everyone's blood boil? My colleague now has a Verizon MiFi, which provides him with a 4G connection everywhere for about $50/month. Just pointing out to management that these charges won't last forever.

We actually stayed twice. For our first stay, we had booked one Studio Room and one Deluxe Four Seasons Executive Suite. While checking-in they tried, as they always do, to upgrade us to the next categories for a fee. I do not do that. Rooms were great if not huge, as they should be here. Bellman got there a couple of minutes after we did, which was great. We had the standard welcome amenity of water and fruit. I have that standing request for 4 bath towels at any time, + toiletries both in the shower stall and the bath tub, not split between them. Had it since I started staying in FS properties, not that any one ever cared to implement it in my well used profile. It sometimes goes smoothly, sometime it is a struggle. This time, as last year, was a struggle, taking several phone calls to housekeeping and visits to concierge to at least fix it the way I like. Thumbs up to the staff : pool attendants, valet, most servers at Culina, concierge. They do a wonderful job. Except one server at breakfast, which messed up the order, did not really fix it, keeping me waving for coffee. At check-out, when they asked if eveything had been OK. I said yes, except a few things which did not even made me an angry customer, but just were unnerving at that level of price. Especially since they had been the same last year, I then took the time to fill in the guest comment survey, no one ever reverted to me, and obviously even read it, as things were the same. Did anyone care ? But of course I like FS ... One assistant manager came out, made flat apologies, took precise notes, waved one breakfast charge as a compensation, and ensured that upon returning newt week, everything would be as should be : perfect and reproachless. We left, leaving them to store 3 heavy pieces of luggage. Upon returning, check-in was as good as before, only the usual offer for upgrade was complimentary, to one full suite on the top floor. We already liked the basic suite, and found we liked the better suite even better. Corner suite with 2 balconies (awesome view over Hollywood and Beverly Hills at the back), one of which wraparound, 2 bathrooms, and really lots of space for storage. Better headbords over the bed, improved quality of bed sheets, and probably also of bedding, although I could not be positive, similar to basic suites only darker pattern of carpeting on the floor. We had a great time, and really appreciated this. The luggage was waiting for us. Towels and toiletries were plentiful and replenished all the time. Service was brilliant throughout the stay. Even that time when we went to the pool, only to be asked for my name as ot was \"fully booked\". Can you believe that ? Is it still the arrangement with a neighbring hotel ?

This feels like a boutique hotel, and if you hang around you'll see a few celebrities. Location was great---not in the middle of all the traffic like the other Four Seasons in Beverly Hills, but close enough to Rodeo Drive to walk (abotu 10 minutes). We took the house car several times---a Rolls Royce with tinted windows---which is available on a first come first serve basis. It was fun to see what life is like for the stars as people try to see who's inside the car. My one requirement for a room: to sleep. Beds of course are not a problem at the Four Seasons, but I was concerned because the hotel isn't very high, and our room was facing the front of the hotel and a busy street. But with the A/C on constantly we heard nothing all night long and slept for 10 hours the first night. Compare this with the Ritz in Laguna Niguel---a sprawling beachfront resort---where we stayed later in the week where we heard people walking above us and everytime the A/C came on it woke us up. This seems like such a minor thing, but sleep is important whether you are on business or pleasure. Only a few complaints, which of course are minor compared to other hotels: *When we made the reservation and when we checked in we asked for a quiet room. We were given the one RIGHTNEXT to the elevators. It's a pain to go to your room only to have to then go back to the desk and then wait again for a new room. *During breakfast one morning we heard two of the waitstaff complaining to each other about their manager---guests really don't want to hear that. *One morning we had a long discussion with our server about one of the smoothies, we ordered it, but never got it. We weren't charged, and decided to forgo it, but it was strange. *There is only one pool, and it's relatively small---if there were kids there, it would not have been relaxing. One thing I would like to mention is that the staff is fabulous---no snootiness like what you'll encounter in the service people on Rodeo Drive.

Although not wealthy, we are loyal Four Seasons guests, and had high expectations ; we feared we might be disappointed, especially in the perspective of swapping from an opulent old style resortlike place hidden in the canyons, to a high rise city hotel. Different it was, but we had a great time. First approach was not on the best note, as we litterally had to wait in line to reach the valet parking area. From then on, all went smoothly. Front desk attendant welcome us asking how the drive had been from the Santa Barbara property (good system). Wa had booked a Deluxe Four Seasons Suite, requesting the highest possible floor, which was only the 9th floor. Asking for a higher floor, she proposed a room upgrade, that would be on the 16th floor, for a fee. I felt it was stingy, as 7 of our last 10 nights had been at Four Seasons properties. It showed on her screen. I declined. I only take complimentary upgrades, and felt that a token of recognition might sometimes release the pressure of the $$$ hunt ... The front desk manager fgot out of his office for a personal welcome. We proceeded to the Suite, along with the Bellman. It was exquisite, albeit rather smaller than we thought it would be. Not a problem. The view was awesome, from the Design Center to Griffith Observatory to the Hollywood sign to Downtown to the ocean : we felt the 16th floor would not have purchased a better view. Exquisite decoration (special mention to the carpet pattern), plush bedding and seats, 2 large flat TV sets, ample storage, 2 french windows (seats and coffee table out there would be nice), beautiful marble bathrooms (showing its age : toilet in the bathroom, so un-Four Seasons) (special mention to the oversized shower stall with a great shower head and at last good water pressure). We only used the restaurants for breakfast each day. Perfect outdoor seating, great menu, beautiful execution, spotless service, Four Seasons price tags (possibly Beverly Hills price tags, too). We tried once the pool area for breakfast, but service was not up to standards there. Although quite compact, the pool area is very pleasant. The upper deck allows for a quieter scene, away from kids, and for some sun until 6.30 pm (in august). Pool attendants are very gracious. We did not order food there, but it looked very good and tasty. On our last day, in order to catch the last Air France flight to Paris, we wanted to have time to carefully pack our 240 lb. of luggage, and requested a late check-out, hoping for some recognition of 10 nights in Four Seasons properties across the South West. Well all we had was a blunt no, even for an hour ; until I said I was ready to pay (the all around $$$ hunt) : so it was 50% of the daily rate, for occupation until 6.00 pm. Well, we shelled those out ! This is a great Four Seasons property. It has been beautifully renovated. It is up to all and each of the brand standards. We had a lovely time, and thoroughlly enjoyed what was offered. Being loyal FS guests, we know and appreciate all this. I really find bothersome is the obvious $ hunt. Not nickel-and-diming you really, but the slightly sour note that they are your big dollars at every opportunity, never acknowledging the obscene amount of money you are spending there. I understand this is a business, not a charity, but come on. I remember discussing the company policy with the GM of One&Only Reethi Rah in the Maldives ($1.800 per night), to whom we expressed how surprised we were by all the daily attentions : the owner's directions is that they splurge on customers, it does not cost them much margin, but the customer feels cherished. Unfortunately, this is what is lacking here. Would we return ? In a heartbeat, until Hotel bel-Air resume business.

Good example is that I asked for an adapter for my computer. In most hotels it takes 20 minutes to get, but within 3 minutes they had already brought it to my door. The decor is very LA 1980's. While very lavish and opulent, it's certainly not modern, design and stylish. They do have a beautiful garden and there's always these enormous, beautiful floral arrangements everywhere. They upgraded my room so I was staying in an executive suite. The room was huge, the bathroom as well. The decor is classic 4 Seasons. Pale green, old English furniture. Going back to the 1980's comment, I had 2 old school TV's in my room with a VHS player. I didn't even think they made VHS anymore. They did have an ipod dock in the BOSE alarm clock - but that's really the only modern amenity in the room. Food is quite good - I only had breakfast (once in the garden and once in the pool) but it was delicious. The pool is beautiful and a great place to hang out, but the pool water was really hot. Jumping in you definitely didn't cool off from the humidity outside. Fitness center is nice and up to date with the latest equipment. It's outdoors so whatever temperature it is outside is the temperature you're working out in. It sometimes got insanely hot. I could only really work out in the morning.

During one stay we had arrived early, and my husband had to go to a work meeting, leaving me in the lobby awaiting the keys to the room. This snooty blonde (nothing against blondes, I'm blonde myself), told me that someone was just cleaning my room and it would be ready shortly. I waited for 2 hours, write in front of her face, sitting in the chair in front of the desk. She was well aware that I had just gotten off a long flight from florida, and wasnt feeling well. I watched as she and some other guy flirted, while I waited for my room to be cleaned. When she called room service the second time she found out that my room was ready, as I overheard the conversation, and I walked up to the desk to get my key, but she \"acted busy\" then made a phone call while I stood there waiting to get my key. I actually didnt get to check into my room until 20 minutes after check-in time, because of the slow service. Call me crazy, but it seemed as though she was being a b...on purpose. They have NEVER let us check in even 15 minutes before their check in time..we actually paid an entire nights fee to check in at 8 am because we were flying in on an early flight from Hawaii and figured they sure as heck wouldn't let us check in THAT early. (Although we asked) On another occasion, I walked into my room when it was clearly in the process of being serviced, however, I sat at my computer to work, and realized the maid was nowhere to be found, she left my room a disaster, vacume in the middle of the floor, wet towels in the walkway, sheets halfway off my bed. She didn't come back for 45 minutes The gym here is rarely serviced, even though they are supposed to have an attendant. I've yet to be there when there was actually water in the water dispenser, or clean towels by the machines.

Like in my more recent visit in March 2008, I could not find a hotel employee who did not personally say hello and smile. I am truly curious how this luxury property has figured out how to get their entire staff on the same page of perfection with regard to service. They are just warm and artfully tuned into the guest experience. Remembering the slightest detail is not just their focus for me...but you can sit and watch the same level of intimate touch happening around you if you just hang and watch. They just get it. BEST SLEEP I have rested my head on virtual every luxury brand's bed and pillow in North America and beyond. When I lay my head down here, I can't put my finger on what it is exactly, but I know one thing for certain that I never forget about this hotel. I sleep better here than anywhere else on the planet. BEST SPA I think this is exactly what Goldie Locks meant when she said \"just right\". Intimate, refined, understated elegance and massage therapists who have proven to be the best. It's location on the 4th floor of the property keeps it feeling very private and secluded. Just on the other side of the spa is the pool and an outdoor restaurant. My favorite thing to do is to stretch out on the comfie pool chair with a friend and pretend I live like this everyday..a pool attendant and staff bringing you drinks and food from the restaurant..walking by to spritz some evian spray and offer a cool towel on a hot day. It's hard to believe you are right inside L.A. because it feels like paradise. BEST BAR Extensive wine list and wines by the glass plus a thoughtful menu and excellent food that make this an easy spot to grab a light bite along with laughs with friends. (Though the restaurant and outdoor terrace dining on site from their amazing chef ashley is one of L.A.'s best kept secrets.) It's also the spot in town for power drinks and power meetings and it shows. If I grab a drink at the bar alone, I inevitably end up meeting interesting people without ever trying hard.

Overall the stay was great, friendly ,nice, service.The restaurants are great and so is the service.I'm not a celebrity but was treated like one.

As you approach it , you can see the architecture went out of fashion some time ago. The pool is painted and old fashioned in style. There was construction activity across the road, which should have been brought to my attention or in some other way compensated for. However in the 5 days I was there it only started once at 7:30 am and then sproradically on weekdays. it was a nuisance. But thats all thats negative. This is a GREAT hotel. The service is impeccable. Each person has been trained. The food is outstanding (especially the Sunday brunch). The pool was a bit busy on the weekend, but thats due to the fact that it is small relative to the size of the hotel. And you definitely dont notice that its an old building. The maintenance is good. We had breakfast each morning on the patio and could easily have been in acres of garden. The setting is tremendous and you do get to see stars. One day we saw four easily recognizable major actors. The hotel is located in a residential part of Beverley Hills so expect to walk or use the hotel's Rolls if you want to go places. But thats LA for you. if you want to stay in a more pedestrian area, Four Seasons has another hotel in the area.", "Date": "August 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis", "Title": "\u201cThey Read Your Mind\u201d", "Author": "pfitz", "ReviewID": "UR5573554", "Content": "My family and I recently stayed three nights at the Four Seasons in an Executive Suite. I can't even begin to tell you how much we enjoyed ourselves. From the moment we checked out, the service was outstanding. The bellman, while dropping our luggage off at our room, suggested a place for dinner and contacted the concierge for reservations. The service at the restuarants was top notch. The Four Seasons provides complimentary car service within a two mile radius of the hotel making getting around town very easy The rooms were beautifully appointed and the common areas just as nice. My husband and son used the work out facility and liked the fact that it was outside but covered by a tent.

I've heard there are many famous faces who stay there. Well, I am not famous and I'm guessing that is why I received the substandard service that I did. Upon check in there was no bellman available. The bellman delivered the luggage about 15 minutes later. He did not offer any explanation of the room, nor did he point out fire exits, but I beleive he was in rush as one of the elevators was out of order and he seemed backed up. The room service order was cold. An order for one person is usually delivered on a tray. This was delivered on a table with one lonely plate in the middle, not even any flowers. Quite disappointing. The worst part of my stay was when I did not receive my wake-up call in the morning and missed my flight! An apology was offered by the doorman as I left the hotel, but no one in management has apologized. Truly disappointing. I highly recommend staying elsewhere when in LA.

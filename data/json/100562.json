When I booked the Sheraton, I told them my situation and asked if they had any rooms they would be able to upgrade us to given the circumstances. I want to be careful and objective in this review, but it was unfortunately a disappointing experience. When we arrived and I surprised my husband, even more surprising was the $44 a night valet charge. My jaw dropped at the outrageous price to park a car. We drove a block down and parked in a $15/night garage instead and trekked up with our bags. When I checked in, the front desk staff had complimentarily upgraded our room to a junior suite which was such a considerate gesture that we appreciated! They left us a nice card, some roses and chocolate covered strawberries which was very kind of them and such a nice touch. However, our room was located directly in front of the elevators, and for the entire evening we could hear the doors opening and closing right out front of our door as people got on and off. Not a great start. When we sat down on the bed, we immediately bounced right up because the beds are SO hard. One of the hardest mattresses I have ever slept on, and we have been to many hotels around the world. Even a tempurpedic mattress pad would solve this problem. I had trouble falling asleep because the bed was so hard, and I woke up with a crick in my neck. When we entered the room, we noticed that it probably hadn't been vacuumed in awhile because the floor had pebbles, small rocks and barkdust all over. It was as if someone before us went hiking during the day and brought their dirty shoes back in the room. Literally there was this kind of dirt all over the floors and I had to wear socks so I wouldn't step on them. Finally, at about 4am our next door neighbor decided to conduct business from his phone, which we could hear the ENTIRE conversation of. And it's not because he doesn't have a right to conduct business at 4am, or because he was talking incredibly loud... it's because the walls were SO thin we could literally hear his entire conversation word for word at a normal talking voice. This kept us up until 6:30am, when we finally were so upset (and tired) that we decided to just get up for the day. We went down to the lobby to ask if there was any way we could switch rooms, but they said there were no other kinds of rooms in that category and they would have to downgrade us. We decided that a downgrade in a quieter room was worth a good night's sleep instead of being kept up in a bigger room, but it was quite disappointing having to pack up and move on our romantic weekend, and then be placed in a much smaller room without any compensation. I understand that it was kind of them to upgrade us from our queen room in the first place, but it was disappointing that our anniversary weekend turned into this kind of experience. The location was good, but I just can't think of any reason why I would want to willingly return to this hotel when there are so many other great ones in Seattle.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cNice area but....\u201d", "Author": "madprofessor", "ReviewID": "UR126339724", "Content": "As many reviewers said, the hotel is centrally located, close to every tourist attraction.

I I checked into the hotel(room 723) on March 12 after my check in was complete and I was about to walk away I was handed a letter stating that the hotel will not have water from 10am - 2pm that day. At this point I find it extremely rude to give this to me after I have checked in as an oh by the way type of approach this information should have been presented before I completed check in. At 4pm on March 12 I tried to take a shower but when I turned the facet to the hot water it was extremely cold. I turned the facet to the cold water section thinking maybe the streams where crossed during the outage but that to was cold. I ended up using the warm section but this was lukewarm at best. I chalked it up to maybe the water system just needed time to get warmer since the outage. I went about my night. During the night I kept hearing a loud metal clinking noise which I believe was coming from the heating system. This loud noise happened every 15-20 minute needless to say I did not sleep. On the morning of March 13 I went to take a shower after my night of no sleep. I turned the water to hot and it was still flowing as ice cold water. I tried the cold section again and it too was ice cold. I once again took a lukewarm shower. I went to the desk to check out around 7:45 when asked about my stay I told the \"trainee\" who was completing my check out about the noise and water situation. She apologized for the issues and I asked for the number to your corporate office she did not know where it was and told me to wait for the other woman to come back. I waited and when the other front desk worker came back as there was another guest waiting she helped that person first before assisting her trainee. She was very dismissive and handed the trainee a business card that was for the Seattle location when I had asked for the corporate office. I pointed this out to the trainee and again she tried to talk to the person training her. I waited for five minutes but needed to leave to get to work as the other person working the desk was obviously trying to avoid having a conversation with me.

I met a close friend that needed to stay there to attend a conference at the conference center next door. Other than some glitches with the reservation process, I liked this property. I especially liked the location. It is downtown within walking distance to shops and restaurants. Across the street in one direction is the Cheesecake Factory and a movie theatre. Down a block is a shopping center with another movie theatre. As others have said, it is about a 5-10 minute walk down to Pike Place Market, where we bought flowers (and then had to search for a vase!) and Rainer cherries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yummm! There was a lot of hustle and bustle on a Friday in June. There is a small market up the street where you can buy wine and beer and munchies. If you want a full liquor store you have two choices each being about equal distance from the hotel and quite a longer walk. Keep in mind, when you get to the liquor store, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t carry mixers, so you have to go back to the market! There is also at least one supermarket downtown right on your way down to Pike Place. I liked that you could opt out of daily cleaning service and by doing so, receive a $5 coupon to use toward dining at the hotel. I also appreciated that you could take things out of the mini-bar and put your things in and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charge you for weight changes. We ate a couple of times at the in-house restaurant, The Daily Grill. Nice setting. We started out sitting in the bar lobby area which was very comfortable. The food was pretty good. My friend raved about the fish tacos which I wish I would have had the chance to try. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feeling well and had a Caesar salad which was marginal. I would definitely eat there again though and try some of the other choices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially those fish tacos! Small annoyances: the little market downstairs in the lobby where they have food to go closes very early \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 4ish. It just would be nice to have something like this into the later hours. Also, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feeling well our second day and thought the chicken soup on their expensive room service menu might be just the thing. Their room service food is provided by their on-site restaurant, The Daily Grill. It stands to reason then that it should be available at the restaurant itself. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case. They only had lentel soup that day in the restaurant and when I asked about the chicken soup, they said that was only room service. Hmmm\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really make sense to me. I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bore you with all the details, but I had some unusual difficulties with my reservations. I had a morning of pacing, on hold with the reservation center, while they tried to figure out why my original reservation was replaced by a one night stay and, because they were completely booked didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if they could get me in. Yikes! I ended up talking with the Sheraton Seattle reservation person who got me a room. Everyone that I talked to within reservations was friendly and helpful, but somehow in the process of getting this booked one person made a major mistake. Whether they knew this or not, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know, but check-in was nice in that they had already made sure that my friend and I had rooms across the hall from each other. Somehow I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get my king room that I had reserved, but ultimately I was happy that we had rooms close to each other and weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on different floors or, worse yet, in different towers. On an aside, my friend had some big problems with her room. She got to the hotel after I did and just dropped her stuff in her room so we could go downstairs and have drinks. Lots of catching up later and back in her room, she noticed many things that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t add up and looked like someone hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t completely cleaned the room or someone had gotten in and used the facilities. Creepy feeling for her. The front desk was perplexed too and compensated my friend with free wi-fi. Which brings me to a complaint, not just for this hotel, but for so many of the large, nicer hotels. Why isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wi-fi free? It seems ridiculous to me to pay for it in this day and age. With my Mi-Fi and iphone, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really NEED it, but still. I also wish you could see their room service menu online before staying there. I did a thorough search and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find anything other than some blogs about it.

She said there was a nice North-West facing room, which seemed to meet my needs. The room actually faces west--but it is a solid wall. It was a funny shape--so the only windows were on the north wall--and there were fewer windows than most rooms.

It made no sense to put me in that room which would have definitely not been light. I called and requested a different room (I cannot recall the last time i did so). They were literally flummoxed.

In the past my stays have been wonderful and the hotel has lived up to its reputation as a Sheraton. The Gingerbread Display in the lobby each year is always a real treat and this year was no different. What was different however was the very poor planning by the hotel event staff. On this particular weekend a large corporation was hosting their holiday party. Presumably the company was so large that they needed multiple locations within the hotel to serve their needs. These locations were on the Ballroom floor, the 20th floor and the 35th floor of the Pike Street tower. What this translates to was a nightmare of epic proportions for hotel guests who wanted to get up to their rooms (or downstairs to leave) between the peak hours of the party, which happened to be between 8 and 11 pm. During this time it was impossible to get on the elevator because each and every elevator was packed full of party goers. It was so crowded that party goers were getting on the first elevator that came along and riding it to wherever it went so that they could \"reserve\" their space to their desired floor. Myself, along with many other paying hotel guests waited around 10 minutes or so just to secure a spot in the elevator. To me this was unacceptable. The hotel should have had the foresight to know this was going to be a problem and blocked off a group of elevators strictly for party goers. Whether they simply program the elevator to only stop at the party floors or put someone there to ensure paying hotel guests can access the elevator, it would have made for a much better experience for PAYING hotel guests. I know the hotel gets paid quite a bit to host these types of events and a large portion of attendees actually stay at the hotel (been there, done that) but for the other paying guests such as myself, we expect to receive the same level of treatment. Not to throw out the \"do you know who I am\" card, but I am also an SPG Platinum member so I have also contributed a lot of money to this hotel chain and expect to be treated as an elite guest every time I stay at an SPG property. Sadly at this time, it was not happening. Other than that fiasco, my stay was great as usual. The room was clean and spacious and the front desk staff was always friendly.

The lobby is nice and checking in was painless. The room was exactly as expected - your standard box hotel room. Now, the bed was unusually comfortable and comparable to higher end hotels. All things being equal, a comfortable bed is probably my number one factor that distinguishes one standard to hotel to another. I was disappointed with their internet access, a key need when away on business. I usually seek hotels that include internet access in their rate, but when you pay $10+ per day extra for access you at least expect a good connection. Not here. I barely got above 1 Mb/s on their line. To give you an ideal, I get that on my phone and at home I get 20Mb/s. It was not adequate.

This hotel is pretty nice. Everyone I met was pleasant and helpful. They even have an awesome program where you can opt out of daily housecleaning in order to be more sustainable which works for me since I don't need my room cleaned daily. The incentive that comes with the program is a $5 credit towards a food service for each day you opt out. It was great! The rooms were nice and clean and I loved the bathroom. It wasn't anything super special, but it was nicely appointed. As soon as I drove up and the valet opened my car door, he said \"Hello, you know there's cheaper parking in a garage about a block away\". I'm pretty sure I didn't solicit his advice for cheaper parking. I always valet my car when I go to hotels (and usually it's some kind of rental car), but the way he said it was as if I would struggle with affording the valet fee because I wasn't driving the right type of car. It's a steep fee, but I can definitely afford it. Wasn't a great start to my arrival. The front desk team and the bell desk attendant were pleasant though, so I kind of let it go. But that was the thing that stuck out in my mind. Any other time I went to the valet to get my car, the other gents were very nice. Two people even came by when they thought I had been outside too long waiting for my car to ensure that someone was getting my car. One gent even offered to go and check on the car because he thought I had been standing out there too long. I hadn't been out there longer than a minute or two, so that was appreciated. Never have I ever had such bad back pain from sleeping in a hotel bed. I tossed and turned all night and the bed was a bit stiff in places. I woke up with the worst back pain. I have never experienced back pain before and this was pretty intense pain across the entire top half of my back for the rest of that day. Other than these two cons, this hotel was very nice.

We had never been to Seattle before but we assumed there were more than \"a few\" restaurants around and that she couldn't be right. We had to speak to her for a few minutes before she would even make a call to try and get us a table. We ended up getting a 9pm seating and when we got to the restaurant it was 3/4 empty. We both thought that the concierge may have been a little out of date with the happenings of the city and did not have the proper connections to fulfil her role. We also asked about night clubs and after dinner drink bars and she was only able to recommend the stuffy bars more suited for older adults (we are 28-36).

We stayed for 2 nights in mid August. We are a family of 4: mom, dad, son 7 and daughter 10. When we arrived we were able to check in without a wait but they tried to check us into a room with one kind sized bed. I had reserved, I thought, a king room with a sofa bed. The gentleman at the front desk assured me that I was being given a room with one king bed although it was on the club floor. I said, club floor or not, the 4 of us can not sleep in one bed. About 8 months prior I had called the hotel directly as I was having no luck using the computer or 1 800 number to find out if they offered sofa beds as we find this combination works well for our family. I finally, after over 2 hours of my time over 2 days and a weekend, spoke to the front desk manager who provided the upgrade to the club floor and assured me, I thought, of a room with a king bed and a sofa bed. When we got to the room it in fact only had one king bed and had no sofa, bed or not. There was room only for a chair in the room so we went back to the front desk and asked for a rollaway bed which they informed me would be a charge of $20/night. I said I didn't feel it was fair to be charged as they booked me in a room that couldn't accomodate our family. They then waived the fee and we slept 3 in the bed and 1 in the rollaway. The pool is small and cold but good for the kids as it only went deeper in the middle. The view from the pool was stunning. There is also free computers to use in the lobby and we found this very usefull to book tours and check on weather while we stayed in the hotel. WE used the concierge a few times and found her helpful to a point but the wait for her services could be up to 30 minutes and she seems to book things for other guests but would tell us to use the computers on the other side of the lobby. We would never have known the computer were there without her telling us. The club floor gave us access to the club lounge which provided a good breakfast and evening nibbles. There was side selection but also a lot of people. We appreciated being able to have access to this lounge and having free fruit and water available 24 hours. The room didn't overlook the mountains, water, or even the Space Needle, but we enjoyed seeing the sun rise and the window was deep and the kids liked to sit there and watch whatever was going on below.

The room itself was functional, though the carpets are probably a good 10-15 years old and need replacing. Size was decent by big city standards. The bathroom was clean and decently furnished, but again the tub and hair dryer need are showing their age. The lounge served excellent hot and cold breakfast. The best thing was the location - a 7 minute walk to Pike Place Market, 5 minutes walk from where the famous Duck Tours start, and 3 minutes walk from the wonderfully designed public library with the zany architecture (which is a must-see 30 minute activity). Pier 66 was about 10 minutes away by taxi, and cost us $12. From Seatac airport, we were able to get a limo service for $40. There's a lot of casual dining restaurant chains nearby - PF Changs, Applebees, Chipotle etc. And of course, you wont go 100 yards with a Starbucks!

We chose the \"go green\" option of not having housekeeping change the sheets, or towels and had no issues. If you choose this option they provide you with a $5 voucher that you can use in the shops in the hotel - we chose to use them for breakfast. My son is 6 ft 1\" and for the most part he was comfortable in the double bed. We had a room with 2 double beds as the Sheraton only offers 1 king bed or double beds, no queen size beds. Our only complaint with the room, and I've read this in other reviews, was that the sheets and pillow cases were very \"crispy\" and if you toss and turn like I do, the bedding is a little noisey. We had an incident while staying at the hotel where when my son was in the room alone (he's 17) in the early evening, a lady (who was not known to us) was able to push open the hotel room door. My son was coming out of the washroom at the same time the lady peeked her head around the door and apologized saying she must have the wrong room. When returning to the hotel room a couple minutes later, I called guest services who took down the information and advised me that they would pass the information on to hotel security. Within a couple of minutes, the security manager called our roon to inquire about the details of the incident and came immediately up to the room and had me open and close the door from the inside at which time it was noted that the door did not fully \"lock\". What he assumed happened was that when I left the room earlier, the door did not fully close behind me and the lady was able to just push the door open. Security was able to \"read\" the door access information to confirm that access to the room was attempted with a key card but was not granted access to the room, however because the door was not \"locked\" the lady was able to push the door open. I was advised that maintenance would adjust the door closure in the morning after we checked out to ensure that it was closing properly. Although the incident was disconcerting and worrisome, I was pleased with the hotel security's quick response. We did not use the gym or the pool while we were there, maybe during out next stay. Although it was very busy in the hotel check-in and check-out went smoothly with not too much of a wait. I opted for the self park option at the 7th and Pike parking garage (across the street - entrance on 7th down from the Cheesecake Factory). I went out and about while my son was at the convention and when I exited the parkade the day after we arrived (we arrived Thursday) I prepaid for the full 3 nights at $30 per night. The only parking option at the hotel was $40 plus tax per night for valet. The hotel is located close to shopping, Pike Place Market, the monorail that takes you to the Space Needle and the Experience Music Project and other attractions at the Seattle Center. It's not too far a walk to the Seahawks or Mariners stadiums for football or baseball games. We'll definitely would stay here again.

It took forever to book in...very busy front desk...but when we finally got settled into our room, my mum and I decided to go for a short walk around the block as it was still light out. No sooner had we stepped out of the front doors onto the entrance \"porch\", which was again exceedingly busy and chaotic, my mum walking with a cane and holding onto me, she didn't see the step to the driveway, stepped out and fell full length on the driveway amidst all the cars. I was horrified to see my elderly mother flat on the ground, I tried to pick this small woman, couldn't, and though the area was FULL of Sheraton personnel, bell hops, captains and such, another guest helped her to her feet. We sat on an outside bench for a few minutes as she was shaking, and then we went for a very short walk to see how she felt. We came back to the hotel shortly, went to the restaurant for a cup of tea, and when my mother took off her coat (which thankfully she was wearing over a thick sweater) it was apparent that she was bleeding all around her elbow. The waiter noticed us looking at the blood and went to get a couple of bandaids. We then went to the front desk to ask for bandages, antibiotic ointment, anything...and while waiting there, a burly security guard arrived and insisted on accompanying us back to our room to check her arm. Absolutely no offer was made of first aid, medical assistance, only to check if her injury was valid. Hmmm....lots of concern re: legal action, but no concern for my mother, which in itself is cause for legal action, I'd say! But all we wanted was some first aid, some humanitarian concern, and all we got were a few bandaids! When we checked out after two nights, I asked if perhaps as a goodwill gesture (since the hotel had done nothing else!) if they would consider crediting us for the $55 room service bill for one OJ, two pieces of toast and a pot of coffee!! And after quite a wait, all we got was an offer of a couple of $5 coupons for our breakfast...which we'd already eaten. When we returned home, I took my mum to see her doctor and we were told that she should probably have had at least a couple of stitches as it was a very bad laceration. It took three weeks of daily cleansing and bandaging until the wound finally closed. The hotel should have offered first aid. However, I WILL NEVER STAY IN ANOTHER SHERATON HOTEL...

When we got to our room we were pleased at first... for a minute. All of the surfaces of the room were dusty, so we thought maybe it just hadn't had guests recently. Then we noticed body hair in the tub and on the commode. We changed rooms. The second room had long hair in the tub, which we were just going to rinse out. Then we noticed on top of the dresser there were food crumbs and rings from glasses that hadn't been cleaned. The desk had been eaten at too. So we changed rooms. Our last room, 2614, was cleaner than the other two, but still dusty everywhere. There is a marble ledge next to the window, this was very dirty and had obviously not been cleaned well in quite awhile, there were finger marks in it where someone had drawn their name. We were too tired to change rooms again and just went to bed. The bed was VERY comfortable. There is not a fan in the bathroom, or at least one you could turn on to get the steam out when you take a shower. There wasn't a dressing table or mirror outside the bathroom, which is nice so you can do your hair and makeup away from a steamy room. The AC didn't cool the room very well, the halls were very hot. Ok, the dirty room behind us, here is a review of the rest of our experience. Parking, with tax, came to $43. Internet is not free, it's $10.95 a day (we were very surprised at this). Our car has auto headlights, so we never turn them on or off. For some reason the valet turned them on, which we didn't notice when we went out shopping and to dinner. When we came out our car was dead. We called the hotel. They told us to call the valet company, which we did. We were informed they had absolutely no way to come jump our car even though we were only 6 blocks away. I called the hotel manager who seemed like he was trying to help. After 45 minutes of being on hold and going back and forth my husband flagged down a stranger who had battery cables and he jumped the car. Thank you stranger! After all this the hotel did comp us the $43 for parking. We bought our room through Priceline, so not sure whether that had something to do with such a crappy stay or not.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGreat location pre & post cruise!\u201d", "Author": "MnJH5", "ReviewID": "UR116518067", "Content": "The Sheraton Seattle is a great location if you are taking an Alaskan cruise.

We stayed in the tower on Pike Street. The location is excellent, right next to the Convention Center and within walking distance of everything. We used the Downtown Airporter Shuttle Service that we had booked ahead of time - definitely book that ahead of time - you have to catch the ride from the parking deck at the airport (confusing system). It did pick us up at 4:30 a.m. at the hotel to return to the airport, but the hotel staff are not friendly if you are using the Downtown Airporter Shuttle for some odd reason. Many people were trying to catch the early vans and the staff would not tell us where to wait (you have to go outside and wait on the street - not the drive of the hotel). You must have a reservation to catch a ride on the shuttle vans from the hotel to airport. Takes you right to the ticket counter door at Sea-Tac. There is free wireless in the lobby that was quite fast - the hotel concierge told me to put in my last name and room number - don't do that, that is only if you want to be charged for it in when you are in your room. There is 'lobby' access and 'guest access' one is a huge charge and one is free. I was able to get the free wireless one night in my room on the 19th floor and then another night I was able to get wireless from att.net which is the Roosevelt hotel nearby. The room was average at best, not as fancy as what you would expect for $200 a night, plus a $31 room tax charge. We had two double beds that were tiny, as in silly small. We are 5'2\" & 5'7\" respectively and even we thought the beds were small! I don't know how tall people use these beds. They were very comfortable though and obviously fit us. The room was super quiet and the safe in the room was huge - larger laptop fit in it easily along with purse and other items when needed. You get $5 a day vouchers for either the restaurant or snack stand in the hotel if you agree to skip housekeeping. Just realize this means no restock on soap, shampoo, or conditioner, and no fresh towels, no bed made, no trash emptied, NOTHING! Does keep people out of your room, though. Room looked old and could have used updating, fairly clean though. There is a cool ledge in the room that you could practically sleep on! It is a nice place to sit and look out over the city. There is a basket of food that sits out in the room with $3 candy bars, etc., wish they would lock that up like the mini-bar in the room, so that there is no mistaken charges for food that you don't eat. Seems weird to have a basket taking up so much room. Can't use the $5 vouchers for any of that food, which seems weird. When you check in they ask if you want a key to the mini-bar, but then leave out a basket of expensive snacks. Pool was next to the work-out room on the 35th floor. Work-out area is more than adequate. The pool was okay, bit chilly for an indoor pool and quite small - about the size of what you would expect for a kiddie pool. Deepest point was 4'5\". Hot tub was 'HOT', could barely stand it for more than a few minutes, plus the chlorine smell was so strong you felt like you were eating chlorine! Few chairs around the pool, but lots of towels, which is nice if you don't have maid service for your room ;) We walked to The Market, Space Needle and two museums there (although you can walk about 2 blocks and take the Monorail for $2 a ride to Spaceneedle if you don't want to walk) as well as walked to the Safeco Stadium and caught a Mariner's game one night. We were able to catch a bus to the Flight Museum at 3rd and Union which was only a few blocks away. Go into the Convention Center and use the Visitor Center Desk there for directions and ideas on how to get around - that's how we learned how to take the 124 bus to the Flight Museum, as well as got a bus route map for that bus. Buy the CityPasses if you have a few days and want to see several attractions for minimal money - great value. For $60 we had admission to the Space Needle twice, Pacific Science Center Museum, Experience Music Project -museum (EMP), Flight Museum (where you can board Air Force One), Argosy Cruise around the harbor, and the Aquarium - we could have chosen the zoo over one of the attractions, but didn't. The front desk staff were very helpful, but the concierge wasn't helpful on where to take walks, run, etc. Use the Visitor Center Staff next door at the Convention Center.

Both were good hotels, but with subtle differences... Location: Sheraton is in the heart of the downtown core. The front is packed with cars and taxis, bringing in people for conventions and from the cruise ships. If you're looking for a fun time right at your doorstep, the Sheraton is the place to be. Places to eat (Cheesecake factory kiddie corner to the hotel) and shopping (H and M next door) are easily in walking distance. You can feel the energy as soon as you step out the door. Great place to stay with friends. The Westin is about 2 blocks away from all the action, so it's a bit quieter. Not as many cars in front nor does it feel crowded. So, if you're staying with younger kids, the Westin may be the better bet for a quieter stay. Both are walking distance to Pike Market (6 blocks from the Sheraton, 5 blocks from the Westin). Parking There is valet parking for $43, or you can self park at the 'hotel' off site parking for $30. If you go through the side entrance of the hotel, it's across the street (next to the Cheese cake Factory). It seemed secure, with a 24 hr attendant. I dropped off the family first at the hotel then swung around to the garage. But, it did get a bit crowded while unloading luggage as it's a very small drive way for all the vans, cars, taxis. At the Westin, the self park is next door, attached to the hotel by a sky bridge. It's only $25. Check in Definitely a lot longer line up at the Sheraton, but it does go by fairly fast. At the Westin, the line ups are barely there. Rooms We stayed at the 29th floor, in the older tower. The rooms were fine, nothing to complain about. It looked like they updated the rooms fairly recently. Flat screen tv, king bed (couldn't get 2 doubles!). Bathroom was adequate. The Westin rooms are similar in style, but definitely noticeably bigger. Not sure about previous complaints about paper thin walls. I couldn't hear my neighbours. But, we did hear the little child running back and forth in the room above us for a while. Also, the doors definitely slam a lot louder than at the Westin. Both give you a $5 voucher every day you decline house keeping services. Beds The pillows at both hotels are amazing. The only difference in bedding between the two hotels is that it seemed like the bed sheets at the Sheraton made a lot louder 'rubbing' noise whenever you moved. Sounds strange, but true! Overall The Sheraton is definitely the place to be for all the action, literally across the street. A lot of 'energy' as soon as you leave the hotel. The Westin is just a couple of blocks away from the action, so it's a quieter hotel. Both are good hotels, you can't go wrong with either.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood central Seattle hotel\u201d", "Author": "Manningsp", "ReviewID": "UR115267628", "Content": "Good location, clean and tidy I still struggle to understand why big hotel chains still want to charge for wifi in room", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in close to everything!\u201d", "Author": "dreamsincold", "ReviewID": "UR115232829", "Content": "We've stayed here several times when we party in town.

They allowed us to check in early (about 2 hours) and we went up to a great hotel room in the newer side of the hotel. The front desk even asked if we had any preference to our room and we said that we wanted a higher level. We were put on the 20th floor and our room was right by the ice machine. I am not a complainer whatsoever (I really felt bad complaining), but I had my husband run it while I was in the room and it was extremely loud. I was in sessions for the conference all day long and really needed some sleep. So, we called down to guest services and they said they can definitely change it. I told them we would come down with the old keys and request a new room. When we got down there, the bell hop/consierge who had greeted us asked us if everything was alright. We explained and he told us that we could have stayed in our room and had someone come up with a new room key. So, note to whoever needs to change rooms! We were changed to a gorgeous king room with a partial view of the water. The area that we were in was very quiet and still on the 20th floor. I would highly recommend the 20th floor - there is an entire block of elevators that goes up to only the 20th floor and beyond (since these elevators are linked to the 20th - 35th floor - and only go to these floors along with the 1st and 2nd). So, basically you are the last stop on the way down and the first on the way up. Very convenient!! The only negative I would have say (my husband reminded me of this)...although it is not only the Sheraton - the taxes on hotels there are crazy! We had a discounted rate of $185 - and it was almost $30 in taxes each night! But, that is Seattle in general...it is just an FYI for hotel reservations - expect to pay a lot in taxes (almost 16%). I guess we just didn't realize it would be that much!! But, in general this is an incredible hotel.

It took about 40 minutes by Link LIght Rail from Seattle/Tacoma Airport to the nearest station (University Street Station). From there it took about 5-7 minutes to the hotel on foot. (It is just 3-4 blocks away, but be prepare for uphill) The lobby of the hotel is spacious and clean, there was a hotel staff in the lobby but he did not seem like helping any customers at all. Checking-in was smooth and I did not have any problem but the front desk staff was unfriendly. There wasn't any welcome atmosphere. The room was spacious, clean and I had a nice city view from the window. I liked the bed, it was very comfortable and I had nice sleeps at night. The bathroom though, I found lots of hairs on the floor and around bathtub, it was a little disgusting. Also there was only one electric socket I could use for my cell, and the socket was nearby TV cabinet (a few steps away from the bed), so I could only put my cell on the floor while charging. There should be some more sockets near working desk or side table. I went to ball games at Safeco Field, and it was about 30 minutes walk from the hotel. It was a nice walk to the stadium through historical Pioneer Square. Also it is possible to walk to Seattle Center where Space Needle locates (about 35-40 minutes), though you can also take mono rail from West Lake Station which is 5-7 minutes walk from the hotel. You can also easily walk to Pike Place Market and there are many stores and restaurants around the hotel though there are no convenience stores around the hotel. This is a very nice hotel with decent price and very good location, but there are some places for improvement, especially the front desk staff and other hotel staff in the lobby. I would stay again if there is more friendly and welcoming atmosphere in this hotel, but otherwise I would look for better service hotel with similar price when I visit Seattle again.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cA great stay\u201d", "Author": "AZBearDown", "ReviewID": "UR114248970", "Content": "Stayed at the Seattle Sheraton for 5 days in June and everything was great.

We are currently staying at this hotel and we are very disappointed at the level of service we come to expect from Sheraton. We initially called up registration to ensure there is a refrigerator with a freezer and microwave available in the room, the agent assured us this can be and will be arranged for us. Upon checking in, talking to registration desk to double check on the refrigerator and microwave. We opted not to go with the microwave, as we were not told it would cost $30/night, however, the refrigerator we need, as we require to freeze some of our pre-made baby food. She mentioned the refrigerator will be in our room later tonight and asked in the meantime to freeze our food in the hotel freezer, as even if we get the refrigerator it will take a bit for the freezer to be cold enough. We proceed to give our cooler bag to the bell service to put in the hotel freezer, and talked to registration desk about other things, afterwards we noticed the bag we left with bell desk was still there with no one around, so I waited until a bell attendant returned which was another 15 mins, and asked these needed to be put in the freezer as they cannot be defrosted, he mentioned he will take them to the freezer when he gets the chance, and left it on the floor. I was very agitated by now so I waited in front of him and he looked at me and said he will put them in the freezer shortly. So I said they have already been out here a while, fortunately another bell attendant came and took the bag (which I assume he is taking to the hotel freezer right away but who knows). Later that night our refrigerator did not come so I went to registration and asked when is our refrigerator coming, she mentioned she did not get back to us yet as she found out the mini fridge did not have a freezer. I told her I called ahead to ask and was infromed there is a fridge with a freezer in the room, and now in both cases there seems to be an assumption there is. Why would registration agent and the registration desk both assume there is freezer available but now to find out there isn't, all she can say is she cannot do anything as there is no fridge with freezer, and understands there are cases where customers would require it, that does not help me a bit. We end up having to go to the bell desk everyday asking to take out items from the freezer and put it back in, which may not be bad but bell service is not the greatest to say the least.

They have enough wall socket so you can charge your laptop. They also have a starbucks store on the first floor which is very convenient. THey have a nice restaurant and lounge bar on the first floor too. The hotel is only 5 blocks from the famous pike place market and is surrounded by shopping areas, restaurants and theaters. Just across the street and It is only a block or two to the freeway. I was able to leave my luggages at the concierge and walked around the area. They didnt give me any problem at all. We didnt even rent a car until the third day we were in downtown because we needed to go to the outlet store. Everything is walking distance from here. You can also take the monorail to the space needle or you can walk less than 2 miles. The cab fare is about $40 from here to the airport. There is no free parking here. They charged $40-45/day to park your car but you dont really need a car if your just wanna see downtown seattle. They provide umbrellas for your convenience too. The view in our room is not the greatest but it was compensated by the elegance of the hotel and friendly, accomodating staff.

It didn't, however, seem to translate into anything special in terms of the room we were allocated. We were on a Club Floor, but the look of the hallways and our own room was very ordinary. Beige, beige, tan, beige, blah. While the room and halls seemed to be in good repair and clean, the style/decor was rather outdated. Also, while I certainly wasn't expecting the Four Seasons or the Ritz, I did expect a little more in terms of quality/luxury in a Club room.

My husband was helped by a very friendly staff member who showed him the layout of various rooms so he could choose which room would be most suitable for us. Since my husband is an SPG member we were able to get a room on the floor reserved for SPG members with a king sized bed and a fold-out sofa bed.

The competing hotel we stayed at was horrible and we felt in danger staying there (drunks, drug use, death threats and fights right outside our door) and the staff refused to help us with this. After not sleeping one single minute, at 4am, I had had enough, I called the Sheraton to check availability because we knew the hotel was clean and safe. Greg in reservations, upon hearing our story, found us a brand new room, in the quietest part of the Sheraton, at an amazing rate (less than the horrible hotel we were currently at). Not only did he do this, he told us to come right over and they would have the room ready. When we arrived, it was like they rolled out the red carpet for us. The valet men were fast, efficient and so nice. The concierge personally walked us up to our room and at one point, acted as almost a personal security guard when a drunk party goer wanted to see our baby. The room was clean and we felt safe.

It is within 5 minutes walking distance to Pacific Plaza, Macy's, and a heap of other department stores and retailers such as Banana Republic, Nike, Levi's etc. The lobby of the hotel is very bright and elegant. The front desk spans more than 10 metres and has several counters but there is a lack of staff at all stations - the front desk, concierge and bellman. Only one person worked at the front desk checking-in/checking-out more than 5 or 6 clients. The line was long and there was no one else to help; check-in was slightly slow and delayed. Furthermore, I visited the concierge and bellman desk but there was never any staff there to assist me - it became quite frustrating. What I found even more surprising was that the front desk, the concierge and bell man were not able to offer guests the facility to make any external phone calls (even toll-free calls) from their desk telephones because the telephones were only capable of in-house and emergency calls. Instead, they asked me to use the public pay telephones on level 2. The corridor in which the 3 pay telephones were situated was dark; I was slightly concerned of my safety especially since the whole floor was so empty. Another example of poor service was the lack of complimentary umbrellas. Unlike many other hotels such as the Fairmont and the Hyatt, this Sheraton did not offer any complimentary umbrellas. When I asked the gentleman on the guest services line, he just directed me to purchase one at their gift store. I found this rather annoying, especially when I was only going to be Seattle for one night and since it was pouring outside. I just settled without an umbrella. However, there are many positive points. The room was quite spacious, albeit that some of the furnishings and furniture are old (e.g. the light switches). There are tea/coffee making facilities as well as an in-room safe, but internet is not complimentary in the room. One must go down to the lobby to use free internet.

Walked to the Space Needle, Pike's Market, and my wife did some solo exploring to the museum, which was a bit further of a walk, but walkable nonetheless. There are plenty of restaurants and bars nearby and plenty to do. The room itself was as good as it can get given the older, smaller configuration. But the bathroom was clean, hot water is instant in the shower, water pressure good, view was great on 23rd floor, bed very comfortable, flat screen TV on wall, small desk to work at and some reading chairs. WiFi plugged in and worked right away and was very fast. No complaints. Was it the nicest room ever? No, but no complaints and we didn't spend much time in the room anyway.

There is a computer/printer kiosk in the lobby specifically for print boarding passes, which I appreciated when departing.

I liked how convenient the Light Rail was to the hotel and enjoyed all the wonderful shopping boutiques in the area. Do take the Light Rail from the airport as it was SO convenient and economical. Time to reach the hotel from the airport was approximately 30 minutes. Location was definitely a premium. Pike's Place was 3 blocks west and there was plenty to see and do. We passed on the daily housekeeping to receive the $5 vouchers. If you forgo the daily cleaning, you can receive a gift card for $5 to be used in the hotel for food or drink. We stayed 3 nights so it added up to $15...You could also receive Starwood points if you wished but a nice cup of coffee/cocoa in the morning sufficed, to say the least. Coffee can be found anywhere in Seattle. We were able to find a great rate where you buy 2 nights and get one free. This was offered on the Sheraton website. I noticed also at check-in that we were place in the newer tower and on the top level! the 26th floor!! As we exited the elevator, I noticed that it said the floor was for Starwood preferred guests so I was very grateful that they had \"upgraded\" us to these newly renovated rooms. The fitness center was open 24 hours and the pool was open until 11 p.m. every night so their hours were more than flexible. I did dine at the on-site restaurant and the food was great. I opted for the buffet which was nice and used my voucher toward the total price of the buffet. We certainly enjoyed our stay at the hotel.

Also, the flat-screen TV was standard-definition (not something I care about, but my husband does), and took a long time to turn on, and the \"guide\" was difficult to use--it was generally poor quality.

Business center was also nice and they had someone there if you had any computer/printing problems. I've complained before about the charge by high end hotels for internet service in your room and this one is no exception. $10.95/24 hours. Rip off but if you'd like it's free downstairs in the lobby, at one of the godzillion Starbucks or of course McDonalds. So you do have other options. All in all, really enjoyed our stay and the beds were great.

The Concierge was very helpful at finding a place for lunch (the Brookyln Seafood). This property is part of Starwood's Green effort. Guests are given a choice to decline housekeeping each day in exchange for a $5 food voucher or 500 Starwood Points. It is fairly easy to participate as you hang a sign on the doorhandle each night. I elected to take the Starwood points, but they have not yet posted to my account. I checked-in a few hours ahead of the standard check-in time and was able to get settled into a room right away. My room was right across from the elevator bank, which gave me initial concerns. Fortunately I did not experience any noise issues. The room was very spacious. There was a complementary bottle of water in my room when I arrived (I am not sure if this is standard for all rooms as I was on a Starwood Preferred Guest Floor).

We booked through Hotwire and then phoned 3 times to ensure we got a king bed, which we were assured we would get, however upon arrival were informed that the king bed rooms were all booked for a convention and that we were in a 2 twin bed room, and reminded that when you book through a 3rd party such as Hotwire, your room choice is not guaranteed. We spent the first night in the 2 twin bed room, not so romantic. I went to registration the next morning and again asked for a king bed room, but was reminded that when you book through a 3rd party such as Hotwire, your room choice is not guaranteed. The only king bed room in the hotel was a junior suite and the clerk offered it to us for an additional $50 a night. I agreed and she said they would call our room when the room was ready. They called our room 3 hours after they said they would to say our room was ready and they would drop the key by our old room. Then the bell captain called and said they were too busy, so please stop by the bell desk, not great service in my mind. We got the key from the bell desk and went to \"our\" new room, only to find that the room was still occupied, and there was a child asleep on the bed!!! We went down to the desk and explained the situation and they gave us the key the actual correct room. They did agree to waive the $50 per night upcharge, but it is unbelievable to me that they would give us the key to someone else's room! The junior suite sucked, it was dated and had no bathtub. The Starwood suite was above us, which had a hardwood floor that someone in high heels started stomping around on at 6:30 every morning, and then someone else was moving furniture or something after midnight one night. All in all, I have to say how completely disappointed and unhappy we were with the staff and the service they provided us. We have used 3rd party booking engines before, and in every instance were treated just like any other guest.

We were very angry to find out-dated furnishings, mold on the bathroom ceiling above the shower (with hair on shower curtain), and a stiff king bed. Walking down the hallway even gave off a musty smell. Upon reading trip advisor Saturday evening with only one night remaining, we found out that the Union Tower was the one newly renovated, so we immediately called the front desk to change. They offered to move us and we obviously accepted. Got to the new room to find what seemed to be a completely different experience/hotel. Updated contemporary furnishings and nicer bathrooms. This was the room we expected to find when booking using several thousand Starwood Points. We expressed our frustration at the front desk upon leaving and they gave us 1000 Points back to send us on our way.

If we did needed a car to rent, there are two rental company that are 1 1/2 block away from hotel; so it was no big deal for us. There is a public parking across the street for less price but of course no in/out privilege. The hotel does not have firm pillow, so we requested more pillows to compensate for the lack of height / firmness which worked out. As for the sheets, it was simply noisy as everyone said. This is something we've never come across starwood properties before. However, we knew of this issue before booking by reading tripadvisor's reviews. As starwood members, we used cash and points to stay here for seven nights at $60 per night. Similar to what most people on this board get on Priceline. We were traveling as family of three with a nine month old who's a good sleeper. During check in we asked if they have a suite with separate bedroom as an upgrade to avoid waking up the baby while my husband is on his laptop for work. The suite cost too much for our pockets and instead we were offered a $15 upgrade room per night that does offer a little privacy for the baby. It was a corner room at the new remodeled building (est. 3 yrs ago) which has a large closet section where the crib fits perfectly without blocking the closet door and away enough from the working desk. The baby had her own view of the city. There is also a tall shelves that we utilized for the baby supplies. See photos. The up grade corner room was great for the little... it kept her busy looking at the vehicles and people passing by on the street. We also needed a fridge for the baby's food and we were given the key to the bar fridge. We just moved some bottles around and made enough room for the little one's homemade food. The hotel also offer high chair to make those solid food feeding much easier. Most important to us is an inroom safebox which they do have in all rooms. We did not hear our neighbor though walls but you can hear door closing from other guests. However, in the hotel's defense, guests around us does not realize how loud they closed their doors. Speaking of noise, we were on the 14th floor and you can hear the street noise... not too much but for someone who comes from a very quiet area, there were noise. The fan in the bathroom also is On 24 hrs and we closed the bathroom door at night to cut down the fan noise. We did grew into both noises during our stay and our baby wasn't bothered at all by either one. We did not use the hotel pool. We did visit the pool area and at the time there were only two kids playing, and that was around 3pm on a wednesday. It's not always busy as other reviewers states. The place looked cleaned including the restroom and changing rooms. We did use the business center to use their printer for dinning coupon. When logging on from their computers, use your last name and room number... a great way to keep only hotel guests from using the business center. Outside the hotel, we had everything we needed for the baby's comfort. We went to Cheesecake Factory (1 short block) to meet a friend for dinner. Cheesecake Factory if kids friendly; they gave use complementary bread and cut up banana for the baby and it was given to us right after we were seated. Walgreens was I think 2-3 blocks towards the Pike Market. Children's Museum was two blocks walk to the monorail from the hotel. The only thing Sheraton Seattel is lacking is in-house spa service. I think even though this hotel is market to mostly business travelers for the convention, a spa service would be a treat to all guests including those hard working conference attendees. A nitpicking... it would handy to have a restaurant listing and activity center directions that are near by the hotel available in the guests room book information. Going to the concierge seems to be a waist of time to get this information. Tips for those who are budget conscious: The hotel food cost way too much for breakfast. Across the entrance from Sheraton (where cars arrive), there is a mall. At the second floor you will find a small store that sell danish. The building also has Starbucks coffee which I believe cost less than the Sheraton's cafe. Get your snacks, drinks, etc. at Walgreens to save some money. Overall we would stay here again for our next visit because of the customer service, location and... because they are one of three hotels in Seattle that offer swimming pool.

First, when we checked in which was late at night (around midnight) my husband and I were assigned a room with double beds which was not a big deal at all, except that my husband had called the day before to tell them we would be checking in late and would like a room with a king. The front desk person quickly resolved this for us though and we were in our new room quickly. The only other thing we didn't love was the pool area. It was very busy with kids splashing around, even at 10pm when my husband and I went to use the hot tub.

I asked for a low-ish floor (don't like heights, and quick/uninterrupted elevator rides are nice) with 2 double beds, and got 8th floor in the Union Street tower. The room felt very spacious for a downtown business hotel, not sure if it was just the layout or the actual size, but it didn't feel as cramped as other 2 double rooms I've stayed in. The small sitting area was nicely set up for reading. Furnishings/bedding/carpet were all perfectly clean and looked new. Had no problem with noise. The heat/AC fan is loud, but the one time we changed the temperature, it was only on for a few minutes, so not a major disturbance. The concierge desk was very helpful- when I asked for a map that would show a particular park, she printed up google driving directions for me as well, which was much appreciated. Having to go to the lobby for free internet was annoying, but given that their main clientele is business travelers, it makes sense for them to charge for it. That said, the lobby was very well set up to hang out in, with plenty of comfy chairs. Location was great- very close to Pike Place Market and the waterfront, about a 15-20 minute walk to Seattle Center (Space needle, EMP, Science Center). Used the 'Green' option- declined housekeeping and received a $5 coupon that we used for coffee and juice at the lobby snack bar. What a great idea, and I wish more hotels offered it. On a two night stay I don't care if my bed is re-made and the floor vacuumed, and it must save the hotel way more than 5 bucks in labour costs alone to skip it. It's such a win-win concept. Never used the parking- we arrived on Saturday afternoon, so paid for street parking until 6pm, then parking was free until Monday 8am. Sunday night after dinner we moved it to a garage 1 block away from the hotel on 7th and Pike (same building as the Cheesecake Factory) for $28 per 24 hours. Still pricey, but on par with any other garage in the area, and much better than valet at $40 plus taxes and tips.

Throughout the weekend however we kept smelling the odor off and on and we finally figured out it was coming from the comforter which was making everything else smell.

I come the next morning and ask a different person who says no shuttle until 6:15. Huh? I wait outside anyway. The guy outside says the shuttle will pull right up.

Hotel managers please pay attention: lose the free papers and start giving free internet instead. Parking: Onsite parking is valet only and pricey ($40+/night I believe). Self-park is only available at the unsecured public parking at the convention centre a block away and is still expensive at $28/night, but that's just the price you pay to be in the city I guess. On the other hand, if we stayed outside the city we would have just ended up driving downtown and paying for parking anyway, so it probably balances out.", "Date": "November 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cConvenient downtown hotel to Pike's Place\u201d", "Author": "travelsafe2006", "ReviewID": "UR47730371", "Content": "This hotel was only a few blocks from Pike's Place and the tram, so it was convenient to walk around if you wanted to stay downtown.

I must admit that I booked through priceline and got a great price and from reading other reviews I expected service on par with what I paid. I did not get this at all. From the time we arrived (early check in at 1pm) we were served with a smile and exeptional attitude. When I acknowledged that we were early but hoped to be able to change before heading to a matinee performance at the theatre the lady at the front desk genuinely seemed happy to let us check in early. I asked if our room had 2 beds as per my email request and it did. The only mention of the fact that I had purchased the room through priceline was a mention that the room was already paid for. Our room was on the 25th floor and afforded us a slight view of the water and a great view of the Westin (where my husband and I usually stay when we travel alone to Seattle). The room met our needs - it was clean and well appointed but not the luxurious feel of the Westin rooms we have stayed in. The housekeeping supervisor knocked on our door and asked if she could check the caulking in the bathroom. She was quick to say she could certainly return if the time was not convenient. Her friendly attitude and offer of more towels when she noted that there were 3 of us in the room (it was already made up with towels for 3) and more coffee was just a signal as to why she occupied her management role. While in Seattle we visited the Market a couple of times and the Sheraton's location is fantastic...when we are at the Westin it is a steep climb up a hill to return to the hotel but with the Sheraton it is such a gentle incline one barely notices they are walking uphill. We ate in the hotel at the Daily Grill for supper and were pleasantly surprised. I had expected a more casual dining experience from the reviews I had read but my hazelnut crusted mahi mahi was prepared very well. The selection of wine was expansive and well priced for any budget. The children's meals were very much to the liking of my girls. The service we received was timely and friendly - noting that it was 7 when we entered the restaurant our waiter asked if we had any time constraints ( a nice touch for a family if they need to eat quickly or get to a theatre production or game). We used the pool for a 1/2 hour on Saturday after dinner since it was occupied by older teenagers playing pass in the pool and young adults getting cozy in the hottub. Several other families arrived during that time frame. On Sunday morning we got up and headed to the pool by 8:30; there were several families playing and others who were swimming laps. Warning:The hot tub was murky so we got out quite quickly. From the valets to the reception desk to the restaurant staff and beyond the service made the Sheraton one of the shining stars of our weekend.

A couple of shopping malls are within a five minute walk. The Metro station is about a block away and very convenient and easy to use. As Starwood members, we had a room on the 25th floor of the Union Tower. The hotel chain designates certain floors (higher floors) for its members. Our room was large, clean, and very comfortable.

Great afternoon lunch of fish and chips amongst the scrap seeking seagulls! Mexico, a restaurant in Pacific Place Mall, is reasonably priced with delicious food. There is a section that is less formal where tapas may be ordered instead. The Underground is a great tour in Pioneer Square.

As most of us had traveled together to Seattle before and had stayed at the Westin (had an amazing time there too), we knew we wanted to stay with a Starwood hotel for this trip. It was Easter long weekend and those of us going to the concert travelled on Thursday April 9th, a day earlier than everyone else coming down. We checked into our beautiful room with a fantastic view of Pike Street. Our room was very clean, the staff was very courteous, we checked in early and I signed up to become a Starwood Preferred Guest, allowing for extra value on future visits. The feel of the hotel is like being in a resort outside of the city\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.not right downtown like we were. The hotel has a great location, virtually within walking distance to all major attractions. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drive our car anywhere when exploring during the day (only at night to the concert in Tacoma). Our trip coincided with a convention called Sakura-con, which was taking place at the adjacent convention centre with most attendees staying at the Sheraton\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.it was Japanese Anime inspired I believe, and was entertaining to see everyone dressed (very elaborately) for the convention to say the least. The conference made the pool/hot tub area and the nearby restaurants extra busy, and while it would have been nice to have a bit more relaxing time in the hot tub, what can you do, the hotel was busy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing! My parents who joined us early on the 2nd day of our 4 day weekend in Seattle, and who tend to travel to the same destination, usually further away that just a few hours from home, absolutely loved the weekend and the stay at the Sheraton in the city. On a side note, it was nice to spend this fun time with my parents in this setting before I moved away\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. The only issue I had at all was the cost of parking. If you wanted to park at the hotel, it was strictly valet and was $33USD per day (not including tip). If you wanted to self park (for $28USD per day), you had to drive a block up and around the corner and park. We chose the latter option, and although we had no problems, I always wondered if we would see our car when we went to use it! We were however permitted in and out privileges at no extra cost, which was nice. My aunt, trying to be ever resourceful, chose to go between, evening street parking (free after a certain time), and then to get up early in the morning to grab early bird specials at some lots not too far away). Parking tends to be like this in every big city though, so no real surprise. Now that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a Starwood Preferred Guest (anyone can become one I believe, membership was free), I will definitely be taking advantage of the Starwood brand more often and look forward to another stay at the Sheraton Seattle when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m back on the west coast.", "Date": "August 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "SetSail0917", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, location for the price\u201d", "Author": "SetSail0917", "ReviewID": "UR37849651", "Content": "We paid $99 per night through a Priceline deal over Memorial Day Weekend and this hotel more than met our expectations.

Our room was clean and comfortable, with a good hairdryer, iron, flat-screen TV, lots of cable channels and- score!- toiletries provided by Bliss. Because we were so high none of the windows opened, so we did find that the room got a little hot at night (even with the air conditioning on). We used many of the hotel facilities, including the twenty-four hour gym on the top floor, the pool and hot tub, the free internet in the lobby (wireless or with desktop stations if you didn't bring your laptop) and the fun Microsoft-powered tables with screens on the surface allowing you to zoom in anywhere on the planet (Google Earth, perhaps?). Needless to say, zoom-in table tops provided hours of fun at 2:00 in the morning after a few All-Day Happy Hours. As an aside, the older women working at the concierge desk didn't know much about \"cool places to go\" or \"budget travel\", which made the lobby internet stations that much more useful. The location of the Sheraton is great.

There were bagels, pastry assortment, cereals, yogurt, fruit juices, coffee, tea. Really plenty for almost anyone to get through the morning. The early evening appetizers were somewhat less appealing. The hot choices were pretty low quality. The cheeses and crackers were nice. Drinks were expensive at 9.00 for glass of wine. The downstairs happy hour drinks were very reasonable and I would recommend they extend the happy hour prices to the Club guests. The soft drinks were free, but seemed restricted. You had to sign a sheet with a spot for gratuity, even if you were just grabbing a cold drink. I had never seen such a thing before in a Club type facility, as we had to use our card to gain entrance. Kind of felt poor class for his level of facility.

The woman who kept my room neat and clean was very good. Quick and efficient, plus very kind. The staff were very nice and efficienct overall. The concierge had many suggestions for dinners, which I found very good for the most part. She specifically told me to avoid some of the Douglass restraunts as she did not think they were too good.

The concierge lounge was too small given the number of business travellers trying to use it, and the waitstaff keep the coffee and soft drinks hidden away, then bring them out to you with a piece of paper asking for your name, room and place to indicate a tip.

We stayed on the Starwood preferred guest level, floor 30 in Pike Tower and had club lounge access. . however the hotel was quite busy with some conventions and the club lounge was very busy and not well stocked on our first night, breakfast was much better prepared with a wide selection of fruit & pastries. The valet and bell hop services are very welcoming with having small children. I had forgotten my sons medication in the car and was quickly escorted to my car to retrieve it but was also informed they would be happy to get it and bring it up for me but I wasn't 100% certain where I had put it. I'm usually not one to have assistance with luggage but after a 5 hour drive and traveling with small children it was VERY nice to let someone else help with the bags. As I said, check in was simple and I found we'd been upgraded to a suite and the extra living-room space made our trip 100 times more enjoyable. Since the club lounge was always busy it was nice to be able to bring breakfast and snacks back to our room to enjoy, the club lounge staff was very accommodating, providing trays and fresh hot coffee & tea. I have to say this little extra is probably one of the biggest reason I often select the Sheraton over the Westin (have not stayed at the W), and with the kids they really enjoy the pool on the top floor. (I love the Westin beds though and we did enjoy a wonderful dinner there at Coldwater Bar & Grill, GREAT seared salmon and halibut and perfect Cosmo). Guest services is always helpful and informative, we required a bit of information on the carriage rides around Seattle. After walking around all day we took a 30 min ride through downtown Seattle and it was very enjoyable. When at the Sheraton don't forget to check out their Coffee Table computer's in the lobby (surface computing http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlF0YllW7Gg). This was another reason I selected this property so I could let my kids see this very cool piece of technology. Housekeeping did a very nice job and we received evening turn down service with chocolates, check out was just as easy and again we used the bellhop assistance with our bags and stored them for a bit before departing the hotel. For me the Sheraton always seems very well staffed, clean, and friendly. I do prefer a softer bed but as far as hotels go i'm happy they aren't hard and always clean bedding. I've only stayed on club floor rooms so I can't review on the lower floors but if going to Seattle for a fun trip or for more then a couple days then I highly recommend booking a club level room. I'll be returning in Aug with my husband and friends for a concert at Qwest field.

Maybe I just thought Seattle would be a little friendlier given the great reputation they have as being such a \"liveable\" place. The room was nice and comfortable. About what you'd expect from a four star hotel. Service was okay but not quite the same as a Grand Hyatt or similar. From what I understand we stayed in the newer renovated tower which is supposed to be much nicer than the other, older tower. We were nearly at the top so views, while not spectacular, weren't bad since you see above most everything other building. I'd suggest staying away from the in hotel restaurant. Quite expensive and service was mediocre. Just across the street is a ChesseCake Factory which is a much better deal for nearly the same quality of food. Only problem is that the Factory doesn't open for breakfast. My suggestion would be to have a donut and coffee for breakfast, you're in Seattle after all! There really aren't too many simple places to eat in the near vicinity unless you go to the food courts in one of the shopping centers nearby.

However, it is now 3:00 and I have just been told that I need to wait another hour. Apparently, in this entire hotel, there is not room ready for a guest?? No effort at all from the front desk except \"housekeeping is working as fast as they can.\" They did not have a perky response when I noted that other people are being checked into their rooms. I know because I have been here for 2 hours watching! I have not even seen the room and I already dislike this place.

State Convention Center this summer, and the Sheraton was in the best possible location. This was one of its sole redeeming factors.

Our pillowcases were stained, and the room had not been very thoroughly cleaned. We were paying nearly three hundred dollars a night and had booked the room for four straight nights. We considered this cost, though fairly staggering for us, to be worth it. However, when we got there, we were constantly nickel-and-dimed. Over thirty dollars a day for parking. What respectable hotel, especially one with such expensive rooms, would have the gall to also charge lodging for their guests' cars? For what we paid for those rooms, they should have been courteous enough not to ream us on parking. Added to that were the $10/day charge for internet, which I could have gotten for free at just about any coffee shop, and the pay-per-view movies which cost between $10 and $15 dollars each. I understand that these are luxury services and that some fees usually apply, but the blatant avarice of the Sheraton on such matters when they were clearly not hurting for revenue was just appalling. Besides their convenient location, I would mention that the attentiveness, friendliness, and efficiency of the staff with whom we interacted were consistently excellent, and it is this, more than anything, that prompts me to give more than one star. The parking attendants in particular were very helpful with allowing us access to the garage if we needed to get to the car, but weren't going anywhere in it.

However the worst was yet to come. After having a meal in the Daily Grill, which was fairly good, we went to bed. That is when the doors started slamming............all night! The door mechanisms failed to work so when everybody entered or exited their rooms the door slammed. You could hear doors slamming 10 rooms away and it coninued into the early hours of the morning. Hence, we did not have a proper nights sleep for 3 nights. When I raised the issue with the front desk, they knew immediately what I was coplaining about, so why has this not been resolved? This just shows contempt for the customer. This is unacceptable for any standard of hotel, never mind a four star establishment.

If you choose to self park your car, the garage at 7th and Pike (behind the Cheesecake Factory) is 28 dollars/day with in/out privileges as well. Make sure to see the valet booth outside to get your pass to hang on your mirror to give you these privileges. If you don't want in/out, convention center parking is probably the way to go. If you can, catch the Greyline Downtown Airporter (roughly 10/11 dollars each way) to/from the airport (about 45 minutes). Metro city bus is 1.75 to 2.25 and takes 30minutes. Check in is at 3, but, if you arrive early, the front desk will try to get you in. Because it is the largest hotel in the Northwest (I think), there are plenty of business men and convention-goers and it gets pretty noisy/hectic in the lobby, so I probably wouldn't recommend it for a romantic getaway... Once cruise season starts, be prepared to have to wait for your room until \"normal\" check-in time at 3pm, and sometimes after. Of course, if you prepay on Priceline/Expedia/Hotwire/Orbitz, you are not guaranteed a room type. It gets difficult to try to switch room types in the Spring/Summer because the hotel is consistently full! Connecting rooms are very hard to get, too, so try and call ahead and as often as possible until they give you them. When they are sold out, they might try to offer you a \"parlor\". This is basically just a living room with no beds! So they will put a twin sized bed in there (its still comfortable) and will drop your rate to 99 dollars! It's great if it's just you, or you and your friends. There are two towers: Union (the \"new one\") and Pike (the \"original one\"). The only way to be guaranteed a room in Union is to book a \"Deluxe\" room. Otherwise, they can put you in either tower, and the rooms are completely different. Pike is 35 stories and has the pool/fitness center in it, as well as the Club Lounge. Union is 26 stories and has the business center in it. The views are better from Pike because half the rooms in Union stare straight back at Pike. If you can book a corner room (they cost a little more... like 20 bucks?) take it. They are awesome rooms. Bliss products in the room, Starbucks coffee, too. They are pet friendly and offer doggy beds to be brought to your room for free! The fitness center/pool area needs work, though. Free wi-fi in the lobby, 10 dollars to connect internet in your room. DO NOT USE THE PHONE! Local calls AND toll free are charged!! They just added a coffee shop, and gift shop, which are much needed additions to their lounge and their restaurant (Daily Grill). Check-out is at 12noon, and free late checkout is at 1pm. If you are Starwood Gold or Platinum, you get 4pm free late check-out! ALSO! Gold members don't get free upgrades to the Concierge Floor.. but \"SPG floors\" which have free bottled water. You can store your luggage at the bell desk, and leave your car in the valet and take a quick stroll to Pike Place or go shopping!

I did not purchase anything at the hotel restaurants so I can't say anything about the food there. I was disappointed that the gift shop did not have milk, and I wasn't about to pay what they wanted in the restaurant for a glass of milk. I didn't try the swimming pool and workout area. The main reason is that they were in a separate tower. It seemed a little inconvenient to take the elevator down, walk across the lobby to the other tower and then take the elevator up to wherever that was located. I was also disappointed in the internet service. I tried to connect from my room, but the connection was slow and did not work for very long. I eventually went downstairs to the lobby to use the free internet which worked much better. The hotel was very good about refunding the price of the internet service that I had paid for, but if they are going to make you pay they should at least offer dependable service. Another thing that I didn't like is that they did not give me all of the credit for my stay with the Starwood points program. I only got credit for $2 worth of expenses for a 4 night stay, so I had to send proof of my expenses to get credit for the rest of the expenses. Otherwise, I was satisfied with the room.

The central location downtown was why we decided on it. Booking was easy with the hotel's website and was a really good price with their stay friday promo ($129) which is great considering it is a four star hotel. After we got the confirmation number, we called the hotel to see if we could reserve a room in the Union Street Tower (UST) which is the newer (2007) slightly shorter (26 floors) building, as opposed the Pike Street Tower (built in 1982, renovated 2004). The front desk said she would put a note on our reservation which was confirmed when we checked in. Amazing lobby! The room was perfect. At the end corner of the floor so with windows on two adjacent walls (only could hear the ice machine a little). Only on the 7th floor, and facing the highway exit, but not noisy from street at all. Super clean room, immaculate bathroom. Big king bed and flat screen plasma (note: go to TV guest services to get local weather in Celsius). To top it all off, we totally lucked out with an all sunny weekend (in Seattle no less!!) Only one downside was parking. In heart of downtown have to pay, but we took another reviewer's tip and did not use the hotel's $35 a day (out by 6pm but with in-out privilages) which has to be declared upon check-in (add added to your bill). Instead tried the convention centre which is one block north of the hotel. First nite parked at 6:30pm and got the car out by 6:00p the next day = $30. Second nite parked 9:30pm (after the convention centre closes) and got the car out 1:30pm=$22. No in-out privilages but okay since we were mainly walking downtown.

The new tower is a bit of walk to the elevators, so if that is an issue, I would ask for the old tower. As others have said the pool and gym are not in the new tower, so getting to the pool/gym, you must walk through the main lobby and go up to the 35th floor of the old tower. Room was fantastic, with a good view of Puget Sound (in between other buildings of course). This property is very close to all major shopping, dining, etct in DT Seattle. The Market is three blocks down the street (tough neighborhood, so be aware on your walk). Parking is brutal, but it is brutal everyplace downtown. Valet is the only option and is 27 a night.

You can also park on the weekends in parking structures around the area for much cheaper, but during the business week it is a wash (five bucks less, and much more of a hassle).

Our room was clean, comfortable, and quiet with a partial view (between nearby buildings) of the water. The hotel itself generally was a nondescript downtown Sheraton-- not the nicest we've ever stayed in, but certainly more than adequate for our needs on this business trip.", "Date": "January 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfield County, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Great Location!\u201d", "Author": "kabooty", "ReviewID": "UR12958851", "Content": "We stayed here over MLK Weekend and we really liked this hotel. Per other users' recommendations, we requested a room in the new tower. However, our flight was delayed and it was around 2 a.m. PST when we pulled up to the Sheraton. The gentleman working the front desk when we entered was having a very difficult time figuring out how to switch us to the new tower. Finally, he succeeded, and we went up to our room -- turned out he gave us a handicapped room, which meant having a strange bathroom with a seat in the shower and no counter space, as well as railing everywhere. It was way too late for us to have enough energy to ask for a non-handicapped room so we made do and went to sleep. Other than that, the room was quite nice -- brand new everything, including a nice flat-screen TV. Can't complain there! We did head to the original tower on a few occasions to use the gym. The hotel is very large and the pool/gym are on the top floor -- complete with beautiful views of Seattle and the Puget sound! However, for being such a large hotel, we were surprised there were only 4 treadmills. They were always in use and they had a sign on them about a 25 minute time limit when people are waiting. Not a huge deal, but definitely room for some improvement there. As mentioned by other reviewers, parking is also a problem. $35 to valet is insane. We parked at the Convention Center as it is one of the very few lots we could find in the area that allowed overnight self-parking. However, we were not lucky enough to experience the low rates as posted on the Convention Center website -- we paid around $22/day which is still a good savings from valet but by no means a bargain. I would highly recommend not renting a car if you're only going to be spending your time in Seattle proper, especially if you're staying at the Sheraton. There is a $10 Seattle Airport Shuttle that drops people off directly at the hotel which is definitely cheaper than parking!

I used Priceline to bid on a 4-star hotel room and managed to snag one for $99/night. What a great deal! I did some research at tripadvisor and discovered that the valet service was inconsistent and expensive, so my friends and I opted to park at the Convention Centre, which was quite close, although there are other garages around which may be a better price. We ended up spending $18 a night which apparently is a lot less than the valet (over $30). The check in was incredibly efficient, and took literally less than 1 minute. Also, I requested a room in the 'new' tower, as per the advice of many other reviews on here. The hallways were wide and fairly clean, although it seemed that room-service food sometimes sat around a long time before being cleared away. The rooms were clean and the beds were incredibly comfortable with nice thick pillows and a very nice duvet. The TV was a 36\" LG LCD that did receive some channels in HD, although most were analogue SD. We also had an OK view on the 24th floor (again requested a high floor upon check in). Be aware: the food and minibar items are incredibly expensive and will cost you a lot. Also, local calls are not free and cost $1.75. The only negative was that the pool is inconveniently located in the other tower, which meant we had to trek across the lobby in our swimwear, although that was funny given the looks some guests gave us. Also, the pool had a lot of kids at it, so we avoided the hot-tub and just sat in the sauna. I guess we should have expected this, given the number of families checking in. Location wise, it is right in the middle of downtown and just off the I5, so it is very easy to locate. It is also fairly close to restaurants and next door to lots of shops.

I initially made the request when I made the reservation and again when I reconfirmed the rooms from home the morning of our trip to Seattle. Each time I was told \"No Problem\". However, when we got to the front desk, the clueless receptionist couldn't find our request in our reservation and said there were no connecting rooms available. At one point, she said she didn't even think there were connecting rooms in the hotel. Wrong! We finally got checked in and upgraded to the new tower which does, in fact, have connecting rooms. The rooms themselves were quite nice and decorated in a modern style. However, the spiffy new coffee machines didn't work.

The hotel's lobby is a good place to people watch and there are several computer stations with wireless connections, although you have to search a bit to find a printer.

If you like to swim, be advised that the pool and spa are very small. If you're staying in the new tower, getting to the pool (located in the old part of the building) is difficult. You have to go down to either the lobby or second floor and traverse across. It's not well marked and, for some reasons, the hotel does not provide robes in the rooms. One really positive thing happened during our stay that has never happened to me at any other hotel anywhere: maids actually wrote little \"thank you\" notes after I left them tips in the morning. We stayed three nights and I always made sure to leave a nice tip for the housekeeping staff. My thought is, you give a waiter a tip for bringing you a meal, you tip a bartender for making you a drink, and you tip a valet for parking your car. Why not leave a decent tip to the nice people who clean your room and make it nice for the next person? I was pleasantly surprised to see the \"thank you\" note the first time, and surprised again to see another note from a different housekeeper on subsequent mornings.

This is a smashing deal considering you're right smack dab in the heart of Seattle. If you're a tourist and hate to drive, you can be dropped off by taxi and not need a car for the rest of your trip (you can walk to everything in the downtown core, and at any given moment, there are several thousand taxis swarming around the place). *The staff were perfectly adequate, and actually quite pleasant. *We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant, the Daily Grill. As at most hotel restaurants, they'll stick it to you with inflated prices. However, the continental breakfast buffet @ $11.95 was a good deal. It might sound gross, but if you fill up on oatmeal and smoked salmon, you can probably skip lunch and splurge on dinner! Now, those 3 criticisms, one of them admittedly incredibly petty: *My mom and I had to schlepp our own bags up to our (smoking) room. This is one of Seattle's largest hotels, especially after they renovated and built a 2nd tower. You're telling me that they don't have enough bell staff, especially the Friday night before a UW home game? Even if you're short-staffed, you tell the guests to check in and that their luggage will catch up to them eventually. You don't blithely look in the other direction and let the guests awkwardly corral their own bags. Boo. Minus stars. *The first room we were assigned reeked of smoke. I know, I know--the whole property is non-smoking; they can't help it if a few jerks--err, I mean, die-hard smokers--flaunt the rules and stink up the place. Anyway, we asked for a new room and were moved promptly. *My last complaint is really, really petty. I know Sheraton is a Starwood chain, and I fondly remember staying at a W a few years ago and ransacking their Aveda toiletries. (I mean, I practically absconded with my weight in tiny Aveda bottles.) So, imagine my puzzlement to discover Vaseline-brand body lotion in the bathroom! (The Rusk shampoo and conditioner was nice, but still--I love Aveda.) So, to summarize, if you can get a screaming good deal on Hotwire or wherever, by all means book/stay at the Seattle Sheraton.

They had to pry us off the Vision of the Seas, after a fantastac Alaskan cruise, at around 10:00 on a Friday morning. By the time we got our luggage, and got a cab ($10 cab ride from Pier 66), we arrived at the Sheraton around 11:00 in the morning, expecting to check our bags and check in later in the day. No! We approached the check-in desk, telling them we knew we were way too early, and she said \"let me see what I can do\"...uh...room, ready...now! We were thrilled! After the fast and friendly check-in, we headed for the elevators, lugging our 4 bags that were only minorly troublesome. We had been cruise-spoiled for a week, so we were fine handling our own luggage. When we got to the elevator, there was a rather insistent bell-hop who really wanted to put our luggage on our cart. We appreciated it, but reassured him that we were okay. Somehow, because of this, we all managed to miss an elevator, and the bell-hop (Henry) expressed great concern that the General Manager was on one of those elevators. Afraid that we'd gotten him in trouble somehow, we let him take our bags (which we should've done to begin with), he led us to our room and we tipped accordingly. He gave us a card for when we needed him again. The room didn't look like it was one of the renovated ones, but it was perfectly fine, with a great view of the city. We ended up spending very little time in our room, as we were out for lunch through about 4 am the next day, due to friends in Seattle. :) Leaving Saturday morning for the airport, we were happy to see Henry quickly come up after our phone call, to retrieve our bags and get us a cab. He was so sweet and friendly, telling us that there had just been another guest in the hotel with the same unusual last name. We were sorry to say goodbye to the Sheraton after such a whirlwind stay, and would not hesitate to go back. The location is perfect!

Our first two trips to this hotel were both Christmas trips (2005 and 2006) and our last trip was during the last week of August 2007. The first year that we booked this hotel we called them directly (after booking our room with an on-line service) to comfirm that they were the same hotel that hosts the famous Ginger Bread House competition for the local chefs. Once we arrived to the hotel, we were very surprised to find that the hotel was not only in shambles from being under construction, but that they had moved the Ginger Bread houses to another location entirely (an imprortant fact that they forgot to mention when we were calling to confirm that the Ginger Bread houses were indeed going to be there). On our second Christmas trip we decided to try bidding on a hotel with priceline.com. We were a little disappointed when we found out that the hotel that accepted our bid was the Sheraton. We decided that we would look on the bright side though and give the hotel a second chance. We thought that there was no way that the hotel could still be under construction, but once again we were greeted with the confusion and mess of construction. The place was a mess and the Ginger Bread Houses were still no where to be found. This last trip (and it will be the last) we tried hotwire.com for the first time. And once again we ended up with the Sheraton. I again decided that I would be optimistic and hope for the best. I can say that I was happy to see that the lobby and new tower were no longer a construction zone, but I was still very disappointed with the floor that we stayed on and the room we were given. The table outside of the elevator had garbage on it and the hallway had bits of garbage all throughout that no one bothered to clean up during our stay. The room that they gave us looked out into the alley and there was scaffolding hanging outside of our window all three days that we were there. Not at all what I would expect from a four star hotel.

If you're looking for a clean, comfortable room in a great location, this hotel will be perfect for you. We got the room for about $210/night (including taxes), which seemed to be the going rate on the travel Web sites and the SPG Web site in July and August 2007. The hotel is right on Pike Street and a close walk to everything Seattle has to offer. The room and location get the 4-star rating, but there were several problems with the hotel service. On the downside, the hotel is used by massive numbers of convention-goers, which makes the front desk VERY unorganized. We arrived at 1 p.m. Pacific time after a LONG day of travel from the East coast, and they would not let us check in despite my SPG Gold membership. We had to keep checking back at the front desk every 30 minutes or so, only to be told different things by different staff members. It was clear that there were rooms available, but that housekeeping just had not communicated that they were ready. It took over 3 hours to check in, and the front desk wasn't very helpful throughout the process. Other guests had problems checking in, too. The lobby was full of tired, grumpy people. There seemed to be no order to who got the available rooms first. Other negatives include a broken shower that was not fixed for a whole day (we had to call back when we returned in the evening), long hold times on the phone, and the pool and hot tub were closed for a day and a half without signs saying when they would re-open. Also, we did not receive a wake up call we had scheduled, so be sure to set 2 alarms if you stay here. Free WiFi is only available in the lobby -- not in the rooms. The gym is in the Pike St. Tower, so you have to go through the lobby to get to it if you are in the Union Tower. This Starwood property does not do free upgrades to the Club Level. I honestly don't think that having an SPG membership means anything to this hotel, because there were no obvious benefits.

Fortunately a big tip to a porter got us adjacent rooms on the club level, but in a VERY noisy area--right next to the club lounge and elevators that ding nonstop and feature a recorded lady's voice \"You are on the 32nd floor.\" Parking was $35 a night.

It is basically across the street from the convention center - perfect it you are attending a conference. It is only a few blocks from Pike Place Market and lots of restaurants and shops. There is a restaurant and a bar at the hotel, but I didn't visit either. No place to get a quick cup of coffee at the Sheraton though. I tried to get \"take out\" coffee from the restaurant, but the request seemed to confuse everyone. It took about 20 minutes for them to figure out how to sell me some coffee in a paper cup. I couldn't believe it was so difficult to get a cup of coffee in SEATTLE! Luckily there are coffee shops on every corner once you leave the hotel. Overall, the Sheraton Seattle was OK. Its location made up for its weaknesses, but that is only because I was attending a conference and appreciated the proximity to the convention center.

However, we were a little disappointed with the selection and quality of food served in the club. Our main concern with this property was that the staff overall was not very pleasant. It seemed that we were a nuisance to most we came in contact with and timeliness of service was an issue as well. Of course, the valet was pricey, but we read the reviews ahead of time and worked it into our budget.

The Sweet Sleeper bed is comfortable and on the soft side. The bed covers and accessories are a level above the usual standard Sheratons'. The mini-safe in the closet is the largest in-room safe that I have seen. It is almost as big as the mini-bar and can fit my laptop and still have plenty of space left for my SLR camera and lenses.

This was the conference hotel, so their rate was reasonable $209. As a Starwoods Preferred Member - Gold, I stayed on the Club floor - which allowed me access to their club room - serving continental breakfast and light food during the evening. Also, room had a nice view, television, internet and printer access and was open 24 hours. Free local and 800 phone use from the room. Hotel under major renovations currently, so the front door/lobby was missing. Adding a second tower to their facilities and moving the front door to match a driveway for drop-off. Be that as it may, they had temporary counter for check-in, concierge, bellman, etc. Check-in was slow though, as there was at first only one person at the counter, regardless of preferred member status or not. Hallways were all narrow given the temporary walls up for construction, so a queue of people waiting for check-in blocked easy access to the door and hallway leading to the concierge/etc. After check-in I had a room on the 34th floor w/ the 35th floor housing the pool, gym and meeting rooms. At night I would hear the staff moving furniture across the floor on rollers. Room was typical size, usual amenities. A larger size safe was available, which fit my laptop and other gadgets well. Bathroom was typical - no special amenities. Coffee machine serving Starbucks, mini-bar and assorted munchies available. Be careful - water bottles at $5.00/bottle. I was initially overcharged $28 for mini-bar use, when in fact, the key from the last guest was still in the fridge. Bed and bedding was nice. Two robes, towels fine, shower typical. Small desk with free internet connection available, though I was unable to connect to wi-fi, and had to use the wired connection taking me to the Sheraton website for log-in. Newspaper - Seattle Times and USA Today left at the door. Room service menu was not very appetizing, given the availability of local seafood. Not many restaurants nearby - Cheesecake Factory across the street. Other restaurants - Ruth Chris steakhouse, sushi/pan asian nearby in the Fairmont Hotel. Didn't eat in the hotel restaurant as it had the same menu as room service. Best part about the Sheraton was that it was directly across one street into the convention center - no other hotel that close. Also, plenty of security at the doors to limit traffic, as I noticed plenty of young kids and homeless panhandling in the area. Very typical convention hotel. I imagine once they open the 2nd tower the Sheraton will have a typical lobby, front entrance, drop-off area and other restaurants. No store available to offer toiletries, drinks, newspapers, etc, though I noticed behind the temporary counter they had a box of asundries available - toothpaste, brush, mouthwash, etc. Other reviews seem to indicate the need for fresh paint and new carpeting - I didn't see that in my room.

Nike Town and a great Adidas store are across the street. Great restaurants are nearby as well with a Cheesecake Factory across the street. Gameworks and a movie theater are across the street.

They charge something like $5-$7 a box if you have them delivered to your hotel from your office from FedEx/UPS. Maybe this is common, but I've never seen this and it's kind of ridiculous. 2. Parking is $36 a night! I've stayed in Chicago, San Fran and NYC and have not seen this - this is Seattle, not a top 5 sized market! 3. The room/furnishings are average at best. Hopefully the remodel helps this. The rooms isn't dirty or gross - just in need of some updating and the bed pales in comparison to a lot of hotel beds I've seen.

So instead we were given a room with double beds, and they brought a crib up. Now 2 double beds and crib makes the room feel completely claustrophic and tiny. Not good. The front desk gent did give us the kindness of putting us on a much higher floor. The 30th floor, which is not concierge level, but is a 'preferred floor'.

My partner and I stayed on the 32nd floor (club level) and had access to a nice lounge that provided evening wine and munchies as well as a large continental breakfast in the morning. Complimentary wireless internet access was available in the lounge and access in the room was via an ethernet link. The Sheraton bed is as comfortable as any with a fluffy duvet and silky smooth sheets. A very nice, though small, pool is located on the 35th floor; however, it was long enough to do laps. Next to the pool is a well equipped fitness room with up-to-date cardiovascular equipment. The only problem here is a lot of equipment crammed into a relatively small space. It was quite dramatic using treadmill while overlooking downtown Seattle from 35 floors up! I wouldn't consider dining at the Sheraton until construction is complete. A breakfast and dinner buffet are available in the Cirrus Lounge on the 35th floor, but it's clear this is being offered as a stopgap measure. There are many choices for restaurants at all hours very close to the hotel. (Parenthetically, I do remember coming to the Sheraton in the early 80's when one of Seattle's finest restaurants was located in the hotel. Perhaps that will happen again.) In summary, staying at the Sheraton isn't unpleasant. It just feels functional and not especially elegant, and this is all due to the hotel being in transition. Like a restaurant that has just changed chefs, judgement should be deferred until a later time.", "Date": "December 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "TeriHarness", "ReviewID": "UR6517065", "Content": "Be careful with this hotel.

The room itself was warm (a first in my experience with hotel rooms, which tend toward the chilly side), and cozily decorated in sandy tones, with a very appealing bureau instead of the typical TV cabinet with bottom drawers. The room was clean and nicely turned out when we arrived, comfortable bathroom, closet, etc. The hotel employees I spoke to were all very pleasant. The hotel's in an excellent location for tourism - the Pike Street Market is a very easy walk down the street, and taxis are readily available nearby. There are three upscale malls of various sizes in the immediate area, with two large movie theatres, Borders, Barnes & Noble, Williams Sonoma, Anne Taylor, the original Nordstrom's, Nordstrom Rack, and I would say every other high-end retailer on the planet is represented. While much of downtown is hilly, Pike Street is very walkable, and not at all steep. Grayline Tours has a desk in the lobby, and picks up at the hotel for tours and for airport shuttles, which is handy. The bad - The hotel pool, which is inside on the top floor, was ill lit and rather chilly. Obviously heated, but not very well. The jacuzzi was very nice, however. The soda machine on my floor and on the floor above me were both broken, and the ones which did work refused to function if you used change rather than bills. The rather pleasant little porch area on the corner entrance was closed Sunday night, as part of the construction going on at the hotel, forcing everyone to enter and exit the hotel through the badly designed main entrance. This is essentially a driveway where the taxis, limos and cars are constantly arriving and leaving, so it's a bit hazardous to navigate, especially since there's no pedestrian walk that extends down to the public sidewalk; you just have to hop off the apron near the hotel doors and hope an SUV isn't about to swing around the corner, which is pretty much blind since there's a construction overhang. The lobby area was dark and uninviting. I'm guessing the Chihuly sculpture I kept reading about was removed during the construction, for safekeeping. Summary: overall, a nice hotel but with a few bad spots. I'd be a little concerned about the entrance issue if I was elderly, or travelling with someone elderly or shaky/weak on their feet, as getting from the door to the sidewalk is clearly a bit dangerous.", "Date": "October 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairmont, MN", "Title": "\u201cWe were very pleases with the Sheraton Hotel and Towers.\u201d", "Author": "Allgoodonesgone", "ReviewID": "UR5823268", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Sheraton for two nights prior to our Alaska cruise.

I stayed in this hotel in November, 2005. The room was on climate control and it was very cold. On the first day,the shower pressure was so low that I couln't wash the conditioner out of my hair. The second day, I was unable to take a shower because the water was either very hot or cold. It would not reach a warm temperature. When I asked the clerk at the front desk, he said that the hotel was under construction and all of the pipes were messed up. Room service at breakfast was 1/2 hour late and the server showed up just as I was leaving to attend a meeting. I did not have time to eat. I tried to have a quick cup of coffee but it was stone cold. I had to argue with the staff to take the meal off my bill. Two personal items of mine were taken from my room and again, the staff argued. I spent two hours in the business center preparing business related emails. The center took my $50 and then notified me that the emails could not be delivered due to technical difficulties. When I approached the front desk for assistance, I was told that there was nothing they could do, and literally responded that it was not they're problem. Fifty dollars were added to my bill for items from the mini-bar which I did not order. It was explained that I was charged for items from the previous customer. When I questioned how they did this, the staff argued with me rudely and insulted me. A client of mine reserved the room and intended to pay for it. I became aware at check out that they had charged my credit card. The staff shugged their shoulders and stated that that was the way they did things. Since the arrangement was for the client to pay for expenses, the hotel staff made him come down to the hotel with his credit card and to add insult to injury, made him fill out a long document which delayed an appointment by 10 minutes. As someone who travels internationally, he commented on the rude and hostile behavior of the clerk. I left a note for the general manager and asked for his comments. I also left a telephone message for him but he never returned my call.

The room was great, we didn't use any of the restaurants or cafes in the hotel so we can't comment on them. The bads: While valet service is easy to use, it's way too expensive in my book. $36.00? Yikes! Plugging in to the Internet service in the room cost $9.00, unacceptable to me considering the hotel and star rating, and also considering I've stayed in many hotels at half the price with free DSL or free wireless. I expect more from a Sheraton. Elevators are slow, often quicker to take the stairs. Check in was a bit of a hassle. Tried to check in 30 minutes before official check-in time, was told to come back because my room wasn't ready. Came back 15 minutes later, told to come back again. Came back to counter at exact check-in time, my room was ready. Coincidence? Doubtful. I got the impression they were making me wait until the actual check-in time to let me register, not cool.

I was there for a conference from 5/27-5/31. I give it an above average rating because it is better than say a Days Inn or EconoLodge type place. The location really can't be beat if you are there for the conference center or for if you're just dithering around downtown Seattle and want to stay in slightly upscale digs. It's very easy to get to Mt. Rainier from there as well. Check-in was a bit of a wait but the staff person was nice. I know that it was a holiday weekend but the hotel was one of the conference hotels so it wasn't like they were ignorant of our arrival. Later on in the stay I had to go back twice at different times of day to talk to someone about splitting the bill with my colleague. I thought it was a bit strange that the staff was having such a hard figuring it out. Very polite, though. The in-house restaurant is ridiculous. For a cheap breakfast go up a block towards the Hilton hotel and there is a reasonable breakfast/lunch kind of place. The owner lived for a long while in Hawaii and has dressed up the place with photos and knick knacks from the place. Very yummy egg sandwiches and his pancakes have a nice hawaiian twist to them. ;) The bed was SO comfortable and the room was kept up each day. There is a mini fridge in the room but it is locked up due to all the goodies stored inside. We didn't eat anything from the fridge but asked for the key so that we could store our cheesecake slices from the Cheesecake factory right around the corner. By the way, the hotel is in an excellent location for casual shopping at Pike Market or two mall type places. The hotel is only one short block from the conference center. It is also within easy walking distance of the monorail that takes you out to the space needle and science fiction museum. I rarely use the concierge at any hotel but we did this time at two different times. One person made a reservation for us at the Space Needle restaurant (it revolves and the food is decent) and another gave us directions for getting to Mt. Rainier. Don't use the hotels computer room, though. If you didn't bring your computer and you want to check your email or make quick copies, just run over to the Kinko's in the conference center.

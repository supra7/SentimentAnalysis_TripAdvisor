Well, we should have known that Marriott would live up to its good reputation! The unit was spotless! Wonderful facilities, great corner unit with view of the golf course, full screened porch...and the best for us as grandparents of 3 very active grandgirls...we had full access to the Marriott World Hotel next door so they could swim, slide, play, and run to their hearts content at the great hotel pools and activities center. Check in was slightly delayed by about an hour, but we were offered all sorts of distractions to keep us 'busy' including a big screen TV and computer stations and the timeshare pool. The location is very near Lake Buena Vista, Disney's shopping venue, and World Drive which leads to Epcot and Animal Kingdom. Plenty of dining venues nearby so don't worry that there isn't an onsight restaurant. Shuttle service to the Marriott World Center is on call always, so you can always get there for 3 meals a day!

We had four generations staying and everyone was pleased and all needs were met. The two bedroom suits with full kitchen and living room and dining area was all we needed. The master bath is wonderful with a HUGE jacuzzi tub. There is added seating at the kitchen counter area that took care of the kids. The screened in patio was wonderful for those who stayed up late to drink some wine and continue chatting into the night. We had minor issues like the ice maker was broken and a bathroom sink drained slowly however with one phone call within minutes a gentleman arrived and fixed everything. Great service. The surrounding view is a beautiful golf course and its fun to watch as some hit the green and others end up in the sand traps or worse. The Palms is an easy drive within minutes of Disney.

We did not spend a lot of time at the resort as this was a Disney trip except for 1 day that my wife and daughter spent in the pools and spa (I played golf). Location: It is 3 miles from Disney Parks - the main entrance to the resort group (Royal Palms is part of 5 other Marriott resorts in the same location - though spread out) is on the highway that leads straight to Disney Parks. The Royal Palms snakes around Hawks Landing golf course (more on that later). It is 6 miles from Sea World (easy route to and from) and 35 mins from Lego Land (no doubt the best park of them all). Resort: Clean & spacious with great staff. They were accommodating and pleasant to deal with. The 2 bedroom suites were spacious with usual but latest amenities (washer, dryer, flat screen TV's, iron/board, etc.). The balcony is covered with table & chairs - so no bugs or debris gets in - great for morning breakfast! We could see the 16th green and the lake which was great. The master bedroom has a jacuzzi tub, which was great - plenty of towels and soap/shampoo/toilet paper (they do not service rooms if u are resort exchange - so unless u are a messy person/family then you will complain). The rooms come with safe's and flat screen TV's - the living room has a DVD player also. There are pools all over the resorts (you can use ALL the pools in ANY of the resorts on the property - great deal since they have a large indoor pool as well). You can grill and even do simple grocery shopping in the Royal Palms check-in center (Market Place) - but as expected it is expensive - par for any resort/hotel you may travel to. There is plenty of parking, and they even have transportation to take you to/from to other resorts/golf course/restaurants in the Marriott community. Onsite basketball, tennis and shuffle board courts - small but functional workout room. So all in all, a lot to do and be comfortable with. Restaurant: The restaurants in the Marriott resorts are expensive, the food is good but it's wiser to eat out for better quality with the same prices - and there are plenty of restaurants within 10 miles. We went to Orlando convention center area (about 10 miles) and there are a lot of choices - including upscale retail shopping. They have a lot of delivery services that come to the resort so you have that option too. Spa: The wife used it and said it was good...and they have packages for kids too. Golf: Hawks Landing is a good course. Not overtly difficult but water is in play on 15 holes (with Gators!). The greens are 8/9 on the stimp meter and the course is in great shape. The staff is friendly (the manager ended up being from my home town!) and it is easy to get on. However - this place is pricey ($124 with rental clubs in the afternoon) for the type of course it is, so I would recommend that you look online for coupons - the guys I was paired with did that (golflinks or tee-time watch). But easy on and u can get the local shuttle to/from the resort. Timeshare: The exchange was easy and we got no peer pressure to go sit through a presentation. When we checked-in we were directed to the timeshare people - they were very polite and not pushy but tried to offer me a free round of golf to come sit thru a presentation - a polite no was all that was needed. They did give us a lot of travel maps and visitor info however so I was pleasantly surprised. If you do decide to go (they can give u a lot of cool perks - parks tix's, golf rounds etc.) make sure u drive yourself to the presentation center and not take the bus - as then you are at their mercy - prior experience! Parks: The entrance to the Disney parks is only 3 miles. Then there are splits to all the different parks once u enter the main gate. We visited Magic and Animal Kingdom (our daughter is only 5 - so other parks did not make sense - too young) and the drive is simple and easy from the resort. Parking is $14/day but it is VERY efficient and I still marvel of how coordinated it is (you have to take a people/shuttle to the park). Though after a full day coming back and waiting for the people movers can be tiring for some though we did not have a problem at all. Word to the wise - if going to Magic Kingdom - split the park into two days (left side and right side of the parks). Animal Kingdom is fun but can be covered in one day. The water rides are awesome. CAUTION: ALL Disney rides are VERY short (except Peter Pan) so going off-season is recommended (we were there Dec 3-10) - I cannot imagine going peak season and having to wait 30 mins to 1 hour (which is very common) for a 1 or 2 min ride. We never waited more than 5 mins for any ride except one. Sea World is amazing and worth the trip. The Dolphin and Killer Whale shows (35 mins each) are worth the admission price and they do have cool rides there! Lego Land is by far the best of them all...it brought the kid out in me. It is about 35 mins from the resort but an easy drive. EVERYTHING is made of Lego including life size Darth Vader, Ford Explorer, etc. The rides are amazing - perfect for young kids - my daughter and i rode each ride atleast 4 times and she LOVED it (Coastasaurus rocks!). The driving school is fun and the kids actually drive their own car! The miniature cities will dumbfound you - did I mention everything is made of LEGO!...the details of DC, Seattle, Paris,etc...amazing and you need to spend time reviewing everything...don't pick it as the last event to see!", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Omaha, NE", "Title": "\u201cGift Card Issue\u201d", "Author": "NESteven", "ReviewID": "UR122597507", "Content": "Our only concern with our stay was using a holiday gift card to pay part of our bill.

Check in was a breeze. We had an early flight and arrived before noon. Unit was clean and well maintained. Lovely golf course view. We are Marriott time share owners, so familiar with basic layout, amenities, etc. The bonus of nightly stays is the daily tidy service. The master bedroom is large, with a king size bed, 2 night stands, a dresser, flat panel TV, and desk. There are dual vanities, a jacuzzi tub, and a closet with safe (not laptop size) within the bedroom. There is a separate water closet and shower. The second bedroom has a queen bed, and as has been said before, a futon style second bed. The second bed is not very comfortable, but was ok for my 11 y/o son. It was nice to have a separate bed, as my children were sharing the room. There is a closet, a nightstand, dresser, and flat panel TV. The second bath is just outside of the bedroom and has a tub/shower combo. Kitchen has been updated recently. The cabinets are in great shape, and the pots and pans all look very new. The kitchen is very nicely equipped and large enough to actually move around in. There is a counter with barstools (3 or 4, I don't remember). The dining area has a large table with 4 chairs. Ours was an end unit, so we had a window in the dining area. There is a laundry room with full size washer and dryer. Living room had a sofa bed and 2 chairs. Large TV cabinet, flat panel TV, DVD player (which we never could get to work). Screened balcony with table and chairs. We would have enjoyed a few dinners out there had we stayed longer! It was nice to sit out with coffee in the morning. The unit has an abundance of storage. Free wi-fi connection is nice. There are also computers and printer in lobby for a fee. I needed to print SeaWorld tix and had some difficulty with the printer. Alejandro was incredibly helpful and printed them for me at the front desk. In fact, he was outdtanding from the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out. The kids enjoyed the pool areas at both Royal/Imperial Palms and the adjacent Marriott World Center. There is a shuttle that will take you back and forth. They also enjoyed playing basketball. They have balls, tennis rackets, and other recreational equipment to borrow. Parking is free and easy. Elevators are available in all of the buildings. They do recycle, which is nice - so many resorts do not. SeaWorld is a short drive and Disney is just across the highway (we have stayed at Sabal Palms and the Marriott for Disnay in the past).

It is a Marriott Vacation Club property but we stayed there as rental guests which meant that the room was fully serviced each day just as in a hotel. The apartment we stayed in was in the 42xx block near the swimming pool and as far from the road as possible. Some ofthe other blocks were quite near to S Apopka Vineland Road (SR 535) although all apartments overlooked the golf course from their balconies. Our apartment had two bedrooms. The small bedroom was entered through a small lobby off of which there was a bathroom. The small bedroom had a standard double bed and a single bed. It had a TV and roof fan. The large bedroom was very large and had a king size bed, desk, large drawer unit, TV, double vanity sinks and a large spa bath. Off of the room was a separate shower and WC. The living area of the aprtment was very large. It had a well fitted kitchen (over, hob, microwave, dishwasher, waste disposal, coffee maker), dining area with large round glass table and a lounge area with a sofa a three arm chairs. There was a also a utility room with washing machine and tumble drier. The lounge area led to a balcony with a round table and four chairs. The balcony was well located to wasn't really visible from anyone else's balcony. The whole aprtment was immaculate and finished to a high standard and it really did feel like home from home. There was a good sized swimming pool, basketball and pickle ball courts just outside the apartment building. There were also free to use gas barbeques dotted around outside as well. The reception area of Royal Palms is like a hotel lobby and includes a small shop for essentials. They organise a schedule of daily events for kids there as well.

A shuttle bus runs on demand from Royal Palms to the main hotel when you want it to. The pool in the main hotel is huge and includes waiter service to your sunlounger and you can charge back to your Royal Palms apartment - too easy!! We didn't use the golf course but my son asked if he could try putting on the practice greens and the pro shop lent him a putter and some golf balls - a really nice touch and something that would never happen in England where we live!

Although our confirmation certificate clearly states that Marriott Royal Palms is a smoke-free resort and there are signs everywhere on the villas and the property, we were really disappointed about poor enforcement and the lack of regard that some guests have for others. We had to close the sliding door of the lanai to keep the smoke out. We were really turned off at the Royal Palms pool because we noticed several employees and guests smoking and drinking. Even though there were lots of children playing in and around the pool, there were cigarette butts on the pool deck and near the BBQ grill. To avoid these conditions, we took the shuttle to the World Center pool. Midpoint during our stay, we encountered guests in the next villa who said that they requested to be moved because of the smoke, but could not be accomodated because of high occupancy. Smoked away, they left. Eventually, the smoke did go away and we could enjoy being on the lanai again. I'm glad we stayed to complete our vacation.

WONDERFUL!! I will admit we stayed for a timeshare preview and we were very leary. The staff when we arrived were all very nice and they quickly checked is in and sent us on our way. We arrived at our complex which was at the very end of the property across from the highway. Not loud at all, in fact is was really peaceful. We had a view that overlooked the golf course and the pond, really a great spot. We walked into our room and our jaws hit the floor. It was so beautiful, tile on the floors and granite countertops, fab decor, huge master bedroom with a whirlpool tub that would probably fit all four of us, the bedding I wanted to bring home with us and the best thing off all was the cute little bottles of Bath and Body Works shampoo. If your are anything like me that shampoo made my whole stay. The kids room was smaller than ours but it had a queen bed and twin daybed which they took turns sleeping on. We slept and felt like we were at home. I think the unit was around 1300 sq ft. Not bad. We had access to the Marriott World Center pools and tose were big hits with the kids too. Finally our presentaion; it was not all that bad. It took about 180min instead of the 90 they tell you it will be but we did ask some questions. They wanted you to buy dont get me wrong and they pulled out all the stops but when we said \"NO\" they listened.

We had to hit that right away before even checking in - my daughter couldn't wait! Now we did book this place on exchange w/our timeshare, so we did not go to the timeshare presentation they wanted us to have, but the offer was good. They said $100 disney money. Anyway... The resort had elevators and luggage carts to take your stuff upstairs, which was GREAT! The resort was absolutely beautiful. I couldn't tell you a THING wrong with the place. The kitchen had a frige, toaster, oven/stove, microhood, all that stuff. Had pots/pans/bowls, utensils, large spoons and stuff/TONS of storage space. Now our toaster did burn the crap out of everything we put in it but we called and within an hour they brought us a brand new one. The kitchen counter had 3 stools and the dining table had 5 chairs. The living room had a couch and 3 chairs. The patio was screened and private. The master bedroom had a sliding glass door like the one in the living room, and both rooms exited to the same patio. The master bed was not \"Marriott soft\" but the bedding was of Marriott Quality. Two sinks in the bathroom with a HUGE mirror. Jacuzzi tub was great but NOT round as photographed in earlier units. There was a big closet with a safe in it, a shower/toilet area within a separate door. The second bedroom contained a queen or full size bed and a daybed, a bit small - but it worked. There were tvs in both bedrooms and of course the living room. Also, your unit does come with a full size washer and dryer. The descriptions I saw said \"on property\" - but I found that we had our own. That's really all there is to say except the staff was really great, no real complaints, and I have uploaded some photos but I've got many more to put up. I probably took 30-40 pics.

Most I could tell they did was take out trash, replace towels and run the dishwasher with the coffee maker in it. I do not agree with some reviews that the kitchen was fully stocked.

Lots of glasses, cups, plates, utensils, etc. Our check in was great (around Noon on a Wednesday) and we had a pack and play delivered immediately upon check in. I asked for a high chair that was also immediately delivered. Very nice when you have a one year old with you. We also had a nice golf course view.

The resort is on the property of the Marriott Convention Center and has full use of all of their facilities including the large outdoor pool and an indoor pool as well.The location is perfect for families driving to Disney World. It is on rt. 536 which is very close to Downtown Disney and will bring you right to all the parks without even getting on the major rt. 4. The resort itself is very clean. The pool is nice and we found it to be warmer than the large pool at the convention center. The two hot tubs were nice and hot and clean as well. I was a little worried that our room wouldn't be ready for hours when we went to check in around 3:30,because the gentleman checking in before me had a list of requests for his room. He wanted a first floor room as far away from the pool as possible. The woman at the desk politely told him his room would be ready around 5:30. When I checked in I didn't request anything specific and was immediately given a very nice room on the second floor. Maybe a total of 10 steps up, not a problem at all. The pool area is quiet , most of the kids want to go to the big pool because it has a water slide. The units have all been recently renovated with granite countertops.

We were on a mini- family reunion and booked 4 villas with mixed reviews. On the plus side, the location is fantastic. Very close to disney, sea world and outlet shopping. The units are large and have been \"renovated\" (more on the renovations later). The beds were comfortable. The men in our group enjoyed the golf course and the facilities at the World Centre are nice ( you had to call for a shuttle bus to get there because they do charge for parking even it you are a guest at the villas). Now for the negatives. I have to say that the hotel did not set a good first impression because although checkin time is 4pm, half of our rooms were not ready until 5pm and the other half not until almost 6:30. We were travelling with 5 young children aged 4, 3, 2, 1 and 6 months and had nowhere to let them rest. When we inquired at the front desk, they were unable to even give us an approximation of when the rooms would be ready, citing \"it's different every day\" and refused to even try to find out. We could not understand how difficult it would be to call housekeeping to get this information. As far as the renovations go, on first glance the rooms looked quite nice. The kitchens appeared to be recently painted and countertops and blacksplash may have been upgrade. Upon closer inspection, there were many problems. In three of the four villas the outdated dishwashers leaked in leaving a puddle of water in the middle of the kitchen, one of the refrigerators leaked. Throughout the villas things were not completed (eg: electrical outlets loose or not working). Not a huge deal, but the inattention to details was obvious. Again not a big deal, but the clock radio was like the one my parents used in the early 70s! After the expense of going through a \"renovation\" to modernize the place, they did not even bother to change the clock radios. I am aware that I am nit-picking but these details just affected my overall impression of the resort. Outside of maybe the kitchen countertop, the rest of the renovation did not feel very luxurious. The other issue I had was the cleanliness of the units. The carpets were obviously seldomly vacuumed. Our first day there the kids' feet were black after running around the carpet for an hour. The most bothersome was the brown and black mildew all along the bottom of the shower curtains in the bathrooms. When we mentioned it to housekeeping, they tried to clean it with a bar of soap, initially denying my request to have the curtain replaced. After some insistence they did eventually replace it. However, in my sister's room she decided to avoid this bathtub but made no mention of it to housekeeping. After a whole week, the mildew was still there. It just seems that the staff do not pay attention to details. We go to Orlando once or twice a year and would most likely not return. We stayed at the Hilton Grand Vacation Club on I-Drive last year and loved it, beautiful units and a much more luxurious feel. We chose Royal Palms this year because of the ability to use World Centre facilities and the advertised \"complete renovation\".

I was a little hesitant that I had booked this resort because the reviews were not all very appealing on trip advisor. We even had discussed cancelling our stay here. We were so glad we didn't. The location to all the theme parks was excellent and an easy drive. We arrived at the resort at about 1am due to our flight being late. The desk clerk promptly gave us our room keys. We had ordered groceries from [--] and the concierge brought all the groceries to our room and put them in our refrigerator even though we had not yet checked in. (i had scheduled to have the groceries arrive at 5PM since our flight was supposed to arrive at 4pm). The room service did a wonderful job each day cleaning up after us. The kitchen had all the amenities to cook a thanksgiving dinner! Although we made little use of it except for breakfast every morning and a couple of dinners. We were always out at the parks. The grounds were also very well taken care of. The pool at Royal Palms was very nice although we spent a whole afternoon at the Marriotts World Convention Center. There the pools are amazing! The shuttle was always available to take us as soon as we asked for it. Our sons used the pool a couple of other times after we came home from the parks! We booked the Royal Palms on a marketing package with the obligation to to listen to their 90 minute timeshare pitch at the Horizons. This too we were a little bit skeptical at first after booking but we could not refuse the great deal! $199 for 4 nights! The presentation lasted only about 75 minutes since we made it very clear that we were not interested in buying into the timeshare. The saleslady did here speech and quickly signed us out. We had a 7:30 AM appointment, only my husband and I went. After finishing the presentation, we went back to the Royal Palms woke up the boys and headed to Universal studios!

I was traveling with a friend, and we wanted to be near bars and restaurants, and the Maui Coast Hotel did not disappoint. The room was quite nice, comparable to something like a Hampton Inn or a Doubletree. Staff were generally pretty friendly, and they didn't seem to mind that we brought our own beers to the hot tub area. One thing worth noting is that the pool / hot tub area tends to attract a lot of locals who live nearby. In fact, the majority of the people we met there told us they lived nearby, and that the hotel doesn't mind them being there because they buy drinks from the pool bar. I didn't get too upset about this, but the hotel charges guests a $17.50 per day \"resort fee\" which includes use of, among other things, the pool and hot tubs. Locals don't pay the resort fee. Most of the folks we met were very friendly, but we got a sense that some try to rip off tourists; they'll strike up a lively conversation and then casually ask your name and what room you're staying in. With that information, one could charge drinks to your room from the pool bar or the adjacent restaurant. So just be careful what information you give people. The hotel allows guests to use their (very nice) Trek mountain bikes. Since you probably won't read the fine print on the waiver you have to fill out, make sure you get the bikes back by dusk. They don't like when you keep them out later. Finally, bring your own soap and shampoo. The stuff they provide in the bathrooms looks fancy but it's useless.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "gilyb", "ReviewID": "UR126338665", "Content": "This hotel is the best ever!!

Really??!!\u201d", "Author": "Chompypf", "ReviewID": "UR126292340", "Content": "I will start by saying that we were able to stay at the Maui Coast Hotel in Kihei because of a great online package deal with airfare and car rental included. And, I will say that this is a VERY nice hotel. Our room was large, clean, comfortable and updated. The cleaning staff knew our names and always asked us if we needed anything even if we did not want service that day. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. The premises were well-maintained and the atmosphere quiet. But, I will complain about the $17.50/day resort fee. What?! You heard me right. This fee was advertised in the very fine print in our package information and I didn't notice it prior to purchasing the package. I'm not sure I would have changed my mind on purchasing the package had I seen it in advance, but now that I've been there, it will be something I keep in mind for future visits to Maui. What do you get for your $17.50/day resort fee? Use of the pool (uh, shouldn't that be included in the room price), towels to use at the pool or the beach, access to the tennis courts with equipment, bike rental with safety equipment, and free shuttle to Kihei and Wailea. What your $17.50/day resort fee does NOT include: cooler, beach chair, umbrella and boogie board rentals. You can rent coolers from the hotel's gift shop for $5.00/day and beach chairs for $2.50/chair/day. We did not inquire about boogie boards or umbrellas. For $17.50/day, I would think that the resort fee could include borrowing at least coolers and chairs. For the length of our stay on Maui, our resort fees added another $200 to our bill. Disappointing. As far as the room, it was very nice. We had a king-sized bed, a sofa, dresser, closet, room safe, porch, flat-screen TV, small refrigerator, microwave and coffee machine. This allowed us to go to the local Safeway (about 5 minutes away by car) and purchase some food for breakfast and lunch. The bed was very comfortable and, I have to admit, the pillows were the BEST EVER and my husband and I both want to purchase some! We had plenty of space to spread out and unpack for the 6 days we were on Maui. The bathroom was updated and clean upon arrival. We had plenty of soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion and mouthwash for our stay. A hair dryer was provided. This is the first property I've stayed at where a magnifying mirror is provided! If you have read any of my other reviews, you've noticed that this is a complaint in my recent hotel reviews. I was THRILLED by the amenity. Thank you Maui Coast for getting it right! The towels were fluffy and absorbent, even the ones you borrowed for the pool or beach. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant in an attempt to keep costs down. Drink prices at the pool were what you would expect at a large hotel. My iced tea cost $4 for a small plastic cup but there were free refills (and it was the best iced tea that I had during my Hawaiian vacation). We were walking distance from a very nice beach. Drive time to Old Lahaina was about 40 minutes one way. There are plenty of amenities within walking distance or a short drive of the hotel. Drive time to Haleakala is about 2 hours one way. Would I stay here again? Definitely! Would I recommend this property to friends and family? Absolutely! Will I continue to grumble about the resort fee? Yes because I feel you are not getting your money's worth. Maui Coast Hotel should consider expanding amenities included in that fee to cooler and beach chair rental. I'd suggest dropping the free shuttle only because most vacationers rent a car on Maui but I get the feeling that there are a lot of business travelers that stay at Maui Coast so they probably like the shuttle (but, they are also on expense, so a small fee for the shuttle wouldn't be that big of a deal).", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cNice place to start our vacation.\u201d", "Author": "Bc2go", "ReviewID": "UR126146713", "Content": "Only spent one night but it has been very nice.

The hotel was clean and comfortable with a very friendly staff. Location was perfect for both the days of relaxing on the beach and the days spent exploring the island. I would certainly suggest this hotel to anyone looking for a hotel in the middle of it all..if you want a nice quiet beach vacation and nothing more, then I would suggest going further up Kaanapali way. There are lots of restaurants within walking distance (or a short couple minute drive) and the beach is only about a 5 minute walk from the check-in desk. This hotel isn't situated on the beach, but you only have to cross the road and walk a few minutes to find a spot. Activites are plentiful in Maui...I would suggest the drive to Hana to anyone. There are many oneway bridges, but the road is paved and as long as you're careful you shouldn't have any issues. For any divers out there, I would suggest considering diving in the shark tank at the Maui Aquarium. They only accept 4 divers a day, 3 days a week. I was able to book the day before I dove and was the only person that day. You start with a backstage tour for you and your friends/family. We were able to touch full grown jelly fish, see the process of raising the creatures that later make it into the main tanks...then the instructor and I spent 45 minutes in the shark tank with about 20 sharks inclduing hammerheads, reef sharks and a tiger shark. Best of all, we were able to hand feed giant stingrays that acted like stray dogs begging for food. I can't stress enough how amazing an experience this was...and I'm not an experienced diver, just a novice. (You must be certified). There are also many beautiful (private and busy) beaches up and down both coasts. If you like quieter, we found that the northern tip had the largest areas with the fewest people.

We got a one Bedroom Suite, and I have to tell you it was huge. We are a family of four (2 and 6 yo girls). The bed on the main bedroom was super sized, and there was a sofa bed on the living room, where our girls could sleep more than comfortably. The hotel is situated right across Kamaole Beach Park I. This was the first beach we visited in Maui (a couple of minutes walk) and it was really nice. Very calm ocean. The pool area is not huge, but really nice. You have a restaurant (Tradewinds Poolside Caf\u00c3\u00a9) by the pool which I very much recommend, and did not find expensive at all. Good selection of food and happy hour for drinks in the afternoon. And most of all super friendly staff. The hotel Staff was friendly enough, but ended up with the impression of the whole hotel as being impersonal. However, I have to say we were very comfortable. Check in was super fast, and when we had to check out, as our flight left for LAX at night, we stored our luggage with the front desk and used the pool for the rest of the day, which was great. Too bad, that there was no place to take a shower and change clothes before heading to the airport, but it was not a big deal. We used the pool restrooms. As nearby attractions and places you have some shops and restaurants, down by S. Kihei Road (including a Denny's), and there's a mall really close in Wailea, but I can't comment as we have not experienced them. Parking was never an issue (at least to find a spot), but spaces are really small. There was complimentary water with the room, which we received half the days of our stay. Regarding noise from the hallways, and the parking lot, we never had a problem. We rested wonderfully, as the bed (besides from being big) was super comfortable. The bathroom was very big too with a modern look. Nice set of amenities. Super clean and maintenance of the premises was excelent. Our room had a microwave oven and a coffee maker (with complimentary coffee provided daily). There was also a mini fridge. With all that, plus a trip to Wal Mart and KMart (from which I recommend the later) we had a breakfast solution. Our room faced the parking lot, so there was no sea view for us, but again, we did not spend much time at the room. Not being a hotel with direct access to the beach, I can't imagine how good an ocean view can be. All in all, a great place to stay. For the price we paid we received a huge room, which I presume was bigger than the one we would have gotten at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. I would also recommend that area as a nice place to stay in Maui.

I have to say I have never had such a hard time booking accommodation on any trip as there are so many options in Maui. It was just myself and my boyfriend and I knew we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make use of a kitchen in a condo, and the pools in most of the condos in Kihei looked dated, so we decided to book the Maui Coast hotel after reading reviews on Trip Advisor. We booked the Romance Package so had a car rental included and bottle of champagne when we arrived in our Junior Suite. The room was large and spacious- best things about the room were the huge bed, which was really comfortable and lovely plushy pillows and the strong shower. The room was clean and room service was good every day (another thing you do not get in a condo!). We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the fitness centre, laundry or Spices restaurant (which was always busy). The pool area was lovely, lots of tropical plants and fairly quiet and relaxing (even though it was peak time in Maui) and clean and modern. There is happy hour every day with good prices and I recommend the Blue Hawaiian cocktails! We also made good use of the shuttle that is part of the resort fee charge- very handy to be taken anywhere in the area, although you can walk to plenty of shops and places to eat. All staff were very helpful and friendly, especially the shuttle drivers! The shop in the lobby is also pretty handy, selling everything you might need. The only negative that I can really say about the hotel is that they do not have a shower that you can use after check out (except the outdoor shower by the pool) and our flight was not until late at night- getting changed in the reception toilet was ok but not ideal. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel to couples. Kihei is a fairly busy resort during the day but nothing much going on at night time. We mainly used the beaches nearer Wailea as there are less crowded and larger than those by the hotel. Beautiful sunsets from the beach across from the hotel though.

The bar fridge and microwave were more than sufficient for our needs. We usually get a condo but decided to try a hotel room instead as we normally end up reheating leftovers or having fruit as opposed to cooking full meals. The pool is perfect sized for a hotel across the street from the beach. Enough cabanas and loungers for those who wanted them. It was full but rarely overcrowded. A perfect place for those who love Maui and are out all day but still need a peaceful, comfortable retreat at the end of the day as opposed to just any old place to rest your head.

Hahah.. thanks Manny for all your assistance during our stay) The hotel room was clean and take it as you will, this city slicker hates messy messes and dirty places. This hotel room was clean.. we stayed in room 439 and it was really quite nice. The bed is so comfy and the furniture is updated and modern. The only complaint I have is the bathroom is really tiny so be careful. the bathroom ceilings could use updating too. but all in all it was fine.. and besides, when you visit an extraordinary place like Maui, do you really stay in your hotel room the whole time??? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think so!! The beach is across the street which is fine because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maui\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6ITS HOT THERE.. so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind the walk. The pool area is really busy but the staff are very friendly and anytime my husband and I ordered drinks, they delivered it very very quickly. SPICES restaurant- we ate valentines day dinner there and the food was phenomenal. I had the lobster with mashed potatoes and fresh crisp steamed veggies, my husband had the pasta alfredo topped with an abundance of seafood. (we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re Italian, and we know what good pasta tastes like LOL, and rest assured, this was one delectable dish) the cocktails are amazing and the appetizers were very very tasty. The coconut shrimp and the calamari are to die for. Great job and great service at spices.

You can pay the excursion bus to take you on the Hana tour, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like $250.00 per person. If you drive the highway yourself, you are bound to drive right behind one or more of the excursion tour buses, so just stop on the highway were they stop! Its not rocket science. Also, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste your time with the submarine excursion, if you go to the maui ocean center you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see WAY more.. and it will only cost ya 45 bucks a person there, the sub will run you about 170 per person. Also, take a trek to big beach past the town of Wailea, its so awesome there but be carefull as the waves are strong and the tide comes in quickly. you must also do a luau! They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fun and they feed you and you can drink all you want all night. we also enjoyed a sunset dinner cruise whic was nice, and we also did a whale watch.. that was boring cause we saw nothing. also enjoy the road side farmers markets too, fresh pineapple and coconuts...so delish. if you drive the road to hana, you can purchase an abondance of fresh fruit for literally pennies. enjoy your trip.

Our rooms on the 4th floor were clean, had a small balcony and the wireless signal was very strong. The hotel was set back about a half block from the road so there are really no ocean front rooms, but that did not diminish our stay there of 5 nights. We ate dinner at their restaurant the first night and the food was really good and the specials were priced reasonably. Not too far either up or down the road we were able to find other restaurants and stores. The hotel is about a block from an ocean beach which was very peaceful and serene. The hotel provides towels 24 hours a day. The pool on site was clean and you could spend your time either in the sun or shade around the pool. The hot tube is only a few steps from the pool but is isolated from the pool and you can also spend time in the shade or sun as you wish. Your drink or food needs are tended by personnel that walk the area quite frequently to take care of the guests. As part of the resort fee, we were able to do our wash and dry it for no charge (except for the detergent which was 75 cents). This was great for us as our vacation had us on the road for 17 days, so we only had to pack 8 days worth of clothes which saved us $$$ on airline baggage fees (we had 5 separate flights) and hauling an extra suitcase.

It was right by the entrance (with obviously lots of people going in and out, close to the elevators and the pop machines and there must have been more than a dozen condos that could see what was going on in our room. So we asked to change and had another room. It was better, but frankly, you're not going to have any kind of view at the Maui Coast hotel: The hotel is perpendicular to the road away from the ocean. The most irritating thing we went through was the room cleaning. It's not acceptable to come back at 3:30pm and realize that the room hasn't been done. We told the cleaning lady not to bother the first time but the second time, we had to go and wait in the lobby until it was done. Not cool when you are paying a resort fee. I believe you can ask them to make the room earlier but you have to ask them every day. The last major problem was with the safe. The safe is unusable. It's in the closet and getting it open will definitely make your blood pressure rise. But the unacceptable thing about it is that it's ridiculously small. I travel a lot and I'm always able to place most of my camera gear in the safe. Not in this one. In fact, my digital camera could not fit in it.

Happy hour or hours I should say (3-6pm) everyday a select number of drinks are only $4.00. The staff throughout the entire hotel really get to know you well. I would argue, you receive way better personal service than you do in ones of those 5 star resorts hands down! Free shuttle to local places, bikes to use anytime across the street from the beach and everything else you need within a short walk. I want to extend a special thanks to Rudy at the front desk, he went out of his way every time to accommodate my family during our stay. The pool bar staff was also amazing ... Thanks for the exceptional service Molly and David you both made our pool days amazing . There is no need to look any further, super clean well maintained recently renovated, with clean rooms and comfortable beds.

Also, what was totally awesome and appreciated about the room was that they have a ceiling fan right over the bed so you can opt for that to give you air/cooling instead of air conditioning. It was refreshing and nice to not have the staleness of air conditioning blowing. Rooms were quiet. The staff was helpful and offered tips for our trip on the Road to Hana, which was also greatly appreciated since if you don't travel it at the right time (like in the dark) it can be quite harrowing, but it was incredible! (Highly recommend the trip, leave in the morning, you'll be back in the afternoon. Sights are incredible and the road itself is FUN - cliff side drives on the water, waterfalls...) The resort is conveniently located, so even though Kihei isn't a walking town (it's pretty big for an island town), you're in a walkable area. There is a public beach across the street, and the resort is located on the strip where there are lots of places to eat. We luckily ran across Cinnamon Roll Fair just a block or two down the road, Maui Tacos (which we thought were a mom and pop joint and sadly found out is a local chain, but still good), Maui Gelato, and lots of other places down in that area that we didn't try but looked good. The resort offers bicycles for guest use so if you don't rent a car, you can easily tootle around the area on bikes, which is great (no extra fee). It's also a very short drive (10 - 15 minutes) to Wailea, which is a gorgeous town with resorts like the 4 Seasons and the Grand Wailea and that's where you can find the nice beaches and coastal walk.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas, United States", "Title": "\u201cGreat property for the price.\u201d", "Author": "Keith B", "ReviewID": "UR122096786", "Content": "This hotel is nice, clean, and it is in a great location in South Maui.

The rooms are nice with a king bed, small couch, desk and drawers, large flat panel TV (with 'Lodgenet' PPV). I particularly liked having a fridge (and there's a microwave). Size wise the bathroom was very small, and for some odd reason we could hear the bathroom upstairs being.....'used' (but no noise from the adjacent rooms). Facilities wise the hotel has free laundry facilities (1 washer + dryer on alternate floors), free rental bikes (rusty chain's and only during daylight hours), free local shuttle, free beach towels, free wi-fi, 3 internet terminals, \"free\" parking, and \"free\" bottles of water every-day. There's also a work-out room, but I didn't use it (don't judge me - I ran/swam outside!!) I use \"free\" because you have to pay an $18/day facilities charge. There's a pretty nice pool area with 2 hot-tubs and a childrens pool. Personally I was a wee bit disappointed as the pool wasn't big enough to do laps in, but there was plenty of space for when we were there - which was low season. Not quite so sure in high season. There was a poolside bar with snacks, but we used it once and weren't impressed. We never used their \"Spices\" restaurant as we'd read poor reviews - the pool-bar food came from the same place. We thought the locations was great. It's on the southern-edge of Kihei. It is literally across the street from the excellent Kamaole I beach park. There was pretty much enough restaurants and bars within a 10 minute walk on Kihei Road, and Wilea and the rest of Kihei Road was a short drive away. Don't go if you're looking for an \"on-the-beach\" or a 4 or 5 star resort hotel.

We booked a one bedroom suite which was perfect for our family (2 adults and 2 teenagers). When we first checked in we were assigned room 202 - I highly recommend avoiding this room! It was a one-bedroom suite, but small, loud, and situated so that the lanai was right above the elevator machine room, and rather than railing had a cement wall around it. Depressing! We asked for another room that evening and they said to check back in the morning. They called us before we even asked and were able to book us into room 533 which was perfect. The bathroom was twice the size and there was plenty of room for a rollaway bed. The suite also had a roomy fridge, microwave, and 2 bottles of water along with coffee were delivered to the room daily. It can be a bit of a hike from the back of the hotel (where 533 is, about half-way) to the front desk; we finally figured out that if you park around the back near the side door, the second elevator bank takes you to the half-way point of the hotel so you don't have to walk as far. Location is fantastic, as noted by others. We enjoyed walking to the beach for sunset each day and then easy stroll to several excellent restaurant choices (LOVED Cafe O'Lei and 808 Bistro!). Wailea and Makena are close by as well. It's a longer drive to Lahaina than I remembered - so if you're planning to go in for dinner go early and make a long evening out of it! There is an Expedia activities desk in the lobby and Tiffany was very helpful and didn't try to push or hard-sell on the snorkel trip we asked about. We didn't use the tennis courts or the available bikes, even though we had planned to do both! There are plenty of bikes and they looked to be in good condition.

You can get the number and call it to pick you up. Some very nice places to eat around the hotel too. My only problem with the hotel is that it has nowhere to shower or change after checkout. We had to checkout by noon but were not flying until 9pm so we wanted to spend the day on the beach. Having to fly for 11 hours without a shower would have been quite uncomfortable. The staff at the front desk suggested using the pool shower and changing in the bathroom. I really feel that the hotel should provide a small courtesy room for guests in this position.

I must say that, thanks to overall good management and maintenance, timely remodeling and consistency in providing very good service to guests this property remains my favorite when staying on South Maui. The free WiFi internet access from every room is now a real plus as well as is free parking. However, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fooled: these perks and others are not really free so to speak and come with a mandatory USD17.50 + tax daily resort fee, something unique and contagious within Hawaii\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resorts that is simply extorsion to me. The deluxe minisuite room I was given was clean, quiet and smelled good with each and every items serviceable and was in line with my booking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s requests. I was therefore disappointed by the somewhat noisy window mounted not split A/C unit that made me use airplane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earplugs in order to be less disturbed by the loud rumbling and vibrations. The flat panel TV set is hooked on a wall facing the sofa. However, since this TV is not moveable watching programs from your bed is not comfortable since you only get a limited side view.

I researched many hotels in the area and this one kept coming up with positive reviews - and now we know why. We had a fast and smooth check in and check out and had no problems with our bill at the end. We were even upgraded to a one bedroom suite for free since it was our anniversary which was a super nice surprise! Our room was gorgeous! It was super clean and all the furniture is fairly new. The king size bed was the comfiest bed we've ever slept on and it is one of the things that separates good rooms from great ones. The linens were clean and super soft and we had tons of clean pillows. Working in healthcare I'm a fanatic about cleanliness and bugs - and this was the cleanest hotel we stayed at in Maui (it was our third on this trip). The tub did not drain properly but this was a problem in every hotel and I imagine it has something to do with everyone's sand and suntan oil. We also loved the fact that we had two air conditioners (one in the living room and one in the bedroom) plus a fan over the bed so it was very easy to cool off after a long hot day. The free in-room safe was very shallow. It met our needs but it wouldn't fit a laptop or anything. We had large flatscreen TVs in the living room and bedroom but they blocked all the connections so you couldn't hook up your iPod. But we did have free wifi in the room which is more important to us. Parking is included in the $17.50 per day resort fee but beware of the extremely tight parking spaces (don't rent a big vehicle or you might have trouble finding parking spots at the end of the day). I'd complain about the resort fee but all the hotels do it so I'll save my breath. We had a nice little lanai with two chairs and a table. Our view was of another building and a garden pathway but we could see the ocean in the distance between the other buildings. We didn't spend much time in the room so the view didn't bother us at all. Although this hotel is not on a beach, it is located right across the street from Kamaole Beach Park. It is also located close to lots of shops and restaurants. We enjoyed some seriously good sushi at Sansei Seafood Restaurant - highly recommend the \"panko crusted ahi in wasabi butter sauce\" appetizer. The sauce was so good we even dipped our edamame in it. The Expedia staff were helpful in booking some excursions from the lobby but they called every day leaving messages introducing themselves even though we already went down and met them. They need to keep track of who they call. We booked a kayak/snorkel tour at Makena Landing with Maui Kayaks and had an amazing time (I'll write a separate review)! We also took in an evening at Ulalena with the optional VIP dinner at Ruth's Chris Steak House in Lahaina which was also awesome and one of the best steaks we've ever had! This was also an ideal location if you want to drive up to the top of Haleakala Summit (which we did) and La Perrouse Bay (which we did as well)! We would absolutely stay at this hotel again and would highly recommend it to our friends and families! You definitely get your money's worth here and we didn't even take in the pool, tennis courts or other facilities here. You won't regret staying here one bit.

Therefore, if you are going to Hawaii in order to have a few late night walks along the beach in front of a resort, this is not possible at Maui Coast Hotel. However, through the Expedia concierge at Maui Coast Hotel, we booked tickets for the show of Cirque de Polynesia at a different resort, and at that resort, we did in fact have an opportunity to walk along the beach at night, after the show. Also, we walked along the ocean after going to a luau at the Marriott in Wailea. On the plus side, we definitely enjoyed the updated/renovated room, especially the rather large mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee-maker. The king-size bed was quite comfortable, and the furniture was fun and updated. Also, when we asked for the Hotel to waive the resort activity fee, which seemed a bit exorbitant, the first clerk did waive the fee, since we were staying at the hotel for 9 nights. However, it took a little while to convince the clerk to waive the fee, and he did so only after I gave him a truly grumpy and angry look and told him that we understood that the fee was waived for other people who stayed for longer than a week. On the negative side, the room door's lock appeared to be flimsy. Also, the pool is much smaller than it looks on the hotel's website, and the pool was really crowded on windy days and on the weekend, with the exception of Sunday night. We were mainly swimming in the ocean, so it didn't matter too much that there were no open chairs around the pool for about 70% of the time the pool was open in the afternoon and evening. Moreover, the pool attendant was quite grumpy and, in fact, volunteered to me that his day would have been a lot better if he was not working. I thought that was a little rude, given that this was a vacation for us, and we work the rest of the time. Additionally, we were told by the first clerk that we could be moved to a different room when the hotel was less busy, but we later checked to see if we could do this, and the hotel staff was not accommodating. We were not given a different room. Overall, we loved the central location of the property, since it is located between Wailea and Lahaina, though much closer to Wailea. And we certainly loved that the beach was only a short walk away, and the beach near the hotel is one of the most swimmable beaches in Maui. The hotel is also close to a huge variety of reasonably-priced restaurants, coffee places, and stores. We would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a reasonably-priced alternative to the bigger resorts--which tend to have less ideal locations but perhaps better views from the rooms. The best part of the Maui Coast Hotel is its location, followed by the comfortable and updated rooms. However, as a warning, if you want to swim in a deluxe resort-style pool, this is not the hotel for you. That being said, all of the outdoor activities that can be enjoyed in Maui are accessible with a rental car and staying at Maui Coast Hotel, and the beach and ocean are just a short walk from the hotel. We would stay there again, since we prefer to save on the hotel and spend on activities, such as sailing, snorkeling, jetskiing, dining at luaus, seeing shows, and taking a trip to the nearby Island of Lanai.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat choice!\u201d", "Author": "lss_11", "ReviewID": "UR118581057", "Content": "Very nice hotel with huge and new rooms.

The hotel has undergone a major refurbishment and it is clear to see and nicely kept. Beautiful, clean rooms awaiting all of us, although our room which was a double was fine but if you have a twin room the bathroom is very very small indeed! Bear this in mind when booking! Check in was pain free, however we were celebrating our 1st Wedding Anniversary whilst there and this was not acknowledged by any kind of hospitality! The beach isn't too far away at all, but be aware there are no areas of shade so those with children or fairer skin need to be prepared. The pool is nice and it seemed to be gently heated to take the usual chill out of the water, but sunbeds can be limited. Whilst we were there one family tended to monopolise it and had there towels on the same sunbeds day in day out, this was the only area we saw a difference in staffing attitudes as this 'loud' family liked the bar and I assume tipped therefore gaining them residence around the pool! The hotel is not centrally located, so you do have to walk a bit further for shops and restaurants. The nearest ones been about a 7-10 minute walk, be aware that it can go very dark quickly and the lighting is not the best when walking to said shops and restaurants. Maui is a beautiful island and must be explored and enjoyed, we hired a car and took the Hana highway which is breathtakingly beautiful. We hired from the local Avis in Kihei, they were very good! We didn't eat at the Spices restaurant, but did at the pool bar it was ok nothing special but edible. However there is a great deli called the 808 it's probably a good 15 to 20 minute walk depending on your pace (quicker if you a speedy gonzales!!) and boy they do amaaaaazing food to either take out or eat in.... Very reasonable too! The Resort Fee is mandatory and does seem to be one of the sticking points for me for this hotel, you seem to pay for a lot of things you don't tend to use! And the prices are already increased to reflect the refurbishment: as we booked in Feb 2011 and my Mum who accompanied us on our holiday paid \u00c2\u00a350.00 more per night!! That is a lot of additional money!! My only other complaint about this hotel was on our last day, we stayed in Room 252 of which there was a meeting room next door. There was no bother until the last day when at approx 8.00am we were both woken up to the sounds of hysterical laughter, banging, shouting, chanting you name it, it was going on... It continued, so I called the front desk as we thought it was some kind of kids party (I know at 8.00am?? But that's what it sounded like!!) and asked if they could look into what was going on. She called back and informed me we could move rooms???!!!!! I said why should we move rooms, you need to ask them to move rooms!! So she said she would find out more and called back again to say it was \"wrapping up in 10 mins\" and can I offer you free breakfast by way of an apology!!! Errr no I'd like to go to sleep please! Then as the noise reduced and we heard the door open, out troop a load of staff members!!! So if you get a room near a meeting room avoid like the plague and ask to moved room before unpacking!!! Other than that nice hotel, is it worth the money? I am sure there are worse, but I am certain there are also better....", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cPerfect\u201d", "Author": "Roluke", "ReviewID": "UR118389959", "Content": "Great hotel across the street from beach.

The only CON I have against this place is that they charge for late check outs at $20 HR. which I find wrong being that most flight don't arrive to OGG (Maui) until 3pm or so. so the hotel could accommodate a FREE late check out.

The beds were very comfy -- wonderful for naps after a long day and getting that beauty rest! There is also complimentary wi-fi in the rooms which we loved -- allowed us to watch movies and search for things to do in Maui! The whole staff at the hotel was very welcoming and friendly.

There are a few different doors you can go to, but there are not enough if you get stuck in the back. Make sure to go to the local restaurants and what they call the \"bar\" area - I dont see bar area cause its still super family friendly, BUT there are great cheaper food places. The breakfast shop off the main road (you cant miss it, it is always busy) . I ended up actually saving money when we went... HORRAY! There are 2 local Sushi places also in the Kihei area, bit pricey but amazingly good - I say well worth it! Make sure to get the flash friend macadamia nut ice cream log with caramel sauce if you come across it. (YUM! YUM!) Also for the souvenir/gift giving idea, go to the swap meet at the community college. GREAT deals, and great prices. Found the same items in Cancun and shops in Hawaii (things like carved wood turtles, etc.) with the same quality, but most everything was twice as expensive at these other place (especially in the hotel zone in Lahaina region) . Avoid the dinner boat, the pictures are misleading and it was horrible food. Beautiful views, but still not worth it. Make sure to the the road to Hana and ask about the banana bread stands. You'll wanna leave early - the road gets busy fast with tourists and the good bread will run out. The 3rd bread stand we came across is the BEST! its on a little off road. Watch out though for the locals driving on the roads. The lanes merge into 1 lane bridges and they are usually corner bridges and they are unforgiving speed demons. I will have to say I preferred driving in LA with a huge truck - these people are rude as hell and dont care if you get run off the road. Worst part it there are drop off rocky cliffs - soooo yea... teeth grinding. Snorkeling is fantastic up in Lahaina, there is this black round rock which has great snorkeling.

So, since it was a lot cheaper than the resort hotels and I wanted to be centrally located, and spend most of my money on exploring what Maui had to offer I went with Maui Coast Hotel. My husband and I were both pleasantly surprised. All of the positive reviews were right on point. Kihei, where the hotel is located, isn't full of the glits and glam like the resorts but it is located in a very quiet and quaint town which we loved. The hotel itself was immaculately clean, and I am VERY germophobic. The decor of the rooms were beautifully done and the bathroom was really nice. We reserved a basic King sized room but Chris, the very friendly and awesome supervisor, whom we actually made our reservations over the phone with a month prior, upgraded us to a one-bedroom king and had wine and a little note waiting for us in the room because we were celebrating our 6th wedding anniversary. The hotel is 100% non-smoking which was an extreme plus for us and it offered a lot of free stuff; free bicycle rentals, free internet access in the hotel rooms and downstairs in the lovely open air lobby, free pool/beach towels, and free usage of the washers and dryers, which were very convenient for us. All of the staff members were awesome and very helpful. The rooms were very spacious with two lanais in the suite which included a refrigerator and microwave and two televisions. The bed wasn't as comfortable as it could have been but I slept very well every night. The hotel isn't centrally air conditioned so each room as it's own a/c which didn't bother me at all since everything was brand new. I wouldn't recommend eating in the hotel restaurant because it's pretty pricey and there are so many lovely eating places around the area. We particularly loved Stella Blues Cafe for breakfast, lunch and dinner!

The hotel is also across the street from one of the major beaches so we spent hours enjoying the ocean without having to drive anywhere at all. The hotel staff keep the grounds and hotel very, very clean and were kind and friendly as well.

I didn't notice that there was a spa of any sort (though I could have missed it). Stations that would have been \"manned\" at a resort were often empty (example: it was nearly impossible to get a towel near the pool, the station was always empty).

Nice balcony for fresh air. The only downside is that the balcony overlook into the parking lot so its not very private. The hotel is across street and one door down from the beach.

Its a quick walk to the beach, or to the nearby ABC store, or a short drive to restaurants and shopping in Kihei. The hotel also had a very comfortable bed, and the poolside bar with nightly entertainment and great happy hour specials was wonderful! The staff was exceptionally friendly! Alohas from all the cleaning staff each day, and the front desk quickly attended to our requests with a smile. There were just a few negatives - the bathroom was very small. When you swing open the door, it quite literally comes to rest agains the shower and you really have to close the door if you plan to use the bathroom - not just out of privacy's sake, but really out of necessity. The other negative was the A/C unit. We kept it on full blast, and it stayed cold in the immediate vicinity of the unit, but on the other side of the room (where the bed is), the AC seemed to do almost nothing. Thankfully they had a ceiling fan too, which we ran all the time at full speed and this helped. The hotel charges a $15 a day resort fee, which does include free bike rentals. My only complaint with it was that it includes a bottle of water only on the day you arrive. I think if it were every day that would be a nice touch. It's just a bottle of water after all.

The weather was perfect everyday and the trip around the island which left at 7 in the morning and took all day was well worth the money. The driver was very informative about the history of the island. That winding road to Hana was the best trip with all the waterfalls and awesome scenery of the coast. The stop to the Seven Sacred Pools is a must stop. Take a dip in the warm waters and jump off the cliffs. We stopped at the Hana ranch for lunch, was most welcoming. I loved it all. To finish it off we stopped at the Winery for a wine tasting, could of stayed there longer. That was the only thing that I would of liked to have a longer stay there to check out the surroundings. Maui is so diverse, so by taking a tour of the island is a must do. Next time I would rent a car and do it all over again and maybe stay at one of the B&B's for a night. I felt so safe in the area that I stayed, much more so than Mexico. The beaches are cleaner and no hassels from Vendors anywhere.

Yes the parking spaces were small but that seems to be the rule and not the exception on the island, so consider it good practice! :) We spent most of the time out on the island but when we were at the hotel, we were by the pool. They have happy hour drink specials everyday between 3-6 and live entertainment each night by the pool from 6-9. We ate at Spices twice, the onsite restaurant, once for breakfast and again for dessert. When we went there for dessert, it took 20 minutes which was unexpected since they weren't really busy and my husband's Creme Brulee was like soup. They did take it off our bill but we felt we were being ignored when we were ready to pay, had to wait 5 minutes when our server was in plain site standing in the entrance to the kitchen. Breakfast was fine and the food from Tradewinds(poolside bar) was pretty good, which also comes from Spices. It's possible they were just having an off night?? Definitely check out Cafe O Lei, Stella Blues and Fred's Mexican Cafe. We also had an amazing dinner at Humu Humu in the Grand Wailea resort, which I would totally recommend but make a reservation! They had a pre-fixe menu for $39 which was a great deal for a fancier restaurant and it was very romantic!!! All in all, the hotel was great! The staff was friendly, accomodating and full of smiles.

Since the prices were reasonable (for Maui), we opted for a two room suite, which was quite comfortable. All of the positive things we read about the hotel were true--there is a fine beach across the street, for example, and the hotel restaurant was pretty good. There are washing machines available on some floors. The concierge was helpful, although you may get slightly better prices if you do your own research and book your own activities, getting your advice from other people. We would definitely stay here again, but there are a few things you should know. First, individual room air conditioners really struggle to keep up with the humidity and heat during the day. If you envision taking an afternoon nap when the sun is at its peak, you may have trouble with how warm and humid your room is. If you only plan to be in your room in the mornings and at night, you probably will be just fine. Second, the hotel pool was being repaired and the alternative solution provided was to use the World Mark pool next door. The World Mark is a timeshare and was really crowded. We checked a couple of times and there was no way I would have gotten in that pool with all the children splashing, yelling, and doing all the other yucky stuff kids do. It would have been nice for the hotel to offer some type of financial compensation, but they did not respond to my request that they do so. The Maui Coast pool should be fixed by the onset of winter crowds, but you might want to call for a status report or timeline before you book. Third, there is a resort fee added to your bill, so look at your room rate and then figure on paying about $15 more per room. Theoretically, the fee covers the cost of providing free shuttle service to nearby locations, bicycles and tennis raquets that you can borrow, pool towels, etc.. We did not use these services, but still found the hotel price to be reasonable enough even counting the fee. Finally, I want to weigh in on comments others have made about the parking lot being hazardous for your rental car. Some of the spaces are smaller than others. If you want to protect your car or have a big SUV or something, just pick one of the larger spaces. You might have to walk an extra 100 feet, but it's worth it if you worry about stuff like that.", "Date": "October 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cFelt very at home and great stay for a smaller hotel\u201d", "Author": "Spinellz55", "ReviewID": "UR83883583", "Content": "My cousin was getting married at the Grand Wailea and it was only a 7 minute drive down the road.

The suite was really nice - completely renovated - and had a wet bar and mini fridge in the living room area. The living had a flat screen TV as well as the bedroom. The bed was comfortable and the air conditioning worked great in both the bedroom and the living room. The patio was a bit small, but had two chairs and a table on it - we could see the ocean when looking over one side of the patio, but it generally wasn't an ocean view.

The hotel exceeded our expectations in every respect: the room was large, clean and modern and the location was just a few minutes drive to Wailea.

I also stayed here about 4 years ago or so. \"Budget traveller\" conjures up images of people who will forgo many ammenities and ignore the negatives b/c they know they are getting a good deal for thie money. However, it's almost unfair to use the word \"budget\" in the title of this review because for a nice and NON-chain resort hotel, they do it pretty well! Perhaps on the \"negative\" -- It's not ON a beach (across from Kamaole Beach I), the parking lot is pretty darn tight, the bathroom is pretty tight, the closet is small....but if you're the kind of traveller that isn't looking to stay in your hotel room (which its not bad, just maybe smallish) and you will be out exploring the Island all day and need to save money, consider this place. The staff were all very friendly, check-in always goes smoothly. The main entrance is even set up with an open-air style Hawaiian hotel lobby. Furnishings and flooring make you feel like you are in one of the pricier Wailea resorts as you first arrive. They even have laundry facilities on site. The pool is decent, nice people at the bar attached, too. They have bands for happy hour. You are not a long walk to other shopping, restaurants, etc. in the tourist-y Kihei area (but I still like it here for deals). Bottom-line: I would recommend for 5 nights or less. Anything more, I would get cramped sharing hotel room with someone or kids. That's when I prefer condos on Maui to a hotel stay (more than 5 nights) as to me that becomes a better deal but it's hard to beat the deal you can have here and not feel cheated. But that's me, plenty of people stay here longer and enjoy it, considering what you're getting for the price (AND not getting nickeled and dimed like other resort hotels). Other notes: -I'm \"bed picky\" -- had a King and it was awesome -- very comfortable place to put your head every night (great, soft bed, nice pillows, clean bedding) - small fridge, small microwave, coffee pot, desk, little couch and coffee table, dresser, small closet, very small bathroom with the one i had -No real views to get excited about -- view of parking lot on North side, view of greener grounds on the other (backside of other condos) -Clean and looks updated (decent carpet, clean, updated furniture) -UPdated flat panel TV -Quiet enough", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel but Kihei itself is trashy\u201d", "Author": "MikeSF", "ReviewID": "UR66791607", "Content": "As a hotel, it's pretty good.

Our suite was quite nice and I was pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately, since my spouse is handicapped, the bathroom was a disappointment. The supposedly ADA compliant bathroom was not. Everytime we took a shower the floor would flood. The shower curtain was placed too high and did not meet the floor and could not be adjusted, therefore a flood. I was told that most hotels are like that in their experience. I guess they haven't had the opportunity to go around the corner to Wailea and check out the Fairmont Hotel's handicapped bathrooms - wonderful. Not to mention any Embassy Suite properties which do a great job. I could list several other hotels that get it right. Customer Service was great at times and then really bad sometimes. Although I would not discourage anyone else from staying there, we will not return. The $15.00 resort fee would be OK if this really was a resort type hotel with those type of amenities. We never used the internet (have the iPhone), plus the internet stations were for those who could stand, again not ADA compliant. Also, our room was on the 3rd floor - hello???

View from the lanai was decent, one direction partial ocean over the buildings and the mountain in the other direction. Wonderful! Bathroom was pretty large. Tub was extremely tall, not for anyone with leg issues. DH had a difficult time getting in and out. Staff was extremely helpful. Room was always clean. They always obeyed the Do Not Disturb sign. Pool area was small but we thoroughly enjoyed the hottub when there weren't a bunch of kids out there. :) Tradewinds is the bar. Drinks were good. Happy hour was a decent deal. Service was hit and miss. Ariel was extremely pleasant. Heather was a bit excitable. Avoid the food if you can. It was lousy. Live entertainment, same thing, some times fabulous, some nights just okay. Very enjoyable though. My only complaint about the hotel is the parking. We were in the back of the hotel, so we used the side entrance the most. As previously mentioned hubby has mobility issues, all the handicap spots were at the front of the building. None at the side entrance. Some evenings, he would have to get out and I would go park and then walk back by myself. The hotel golf cart was even parked in one of the spaces each night. I thought that was a bit annoying. Two handicap spots near the side entrance would make this a perfect hotel for us. We were celebrating an anniversary, the hotel gave us a decent bottle of champagne. Nice surprise! As others have mentioned, there is a mandatory $15 a day resort fee, not included in the booking price. Allows for bicycle use, beach towels, etc. But the bicycles are 20\" bikes, way too tall for most normal people. Tennis court seems a waste of space but who knows.

The pool was part of a bar area. They had a great happy hour every afternoon and entertainment each night., The entertainment varied, sometimes great sometimes only fair. We did enjoy it though. As I said the staff was very accommodating. They offered many great suggestions regarding restaurants and tours. They also rented out umbrellas and beach chairs for use . The beach chairs were only $2.50 per day. They came in handy on our trips to Napili Bay and Big Beach. They also gave guests free use of a number of bicycles during tehri stay. We never used them but they would be handy if you did not have a rental car. One thing I really liked about the hotel was the business center.

Great location for Kihei. Right on the 'border' of Wailea. That's good to know since Kihei is long - North Kihei is 10 minutes away. Hotel is across from the beach (there are many public beaches). Anyway, the reviews are accurate. Nice place. The hotel was recently refurbished and you can tell. Everything looks and feels new. We stayed in a two queen room. The beds were fantastic, new flatscreen TVs, updated granite bathrooms and lots of sitting area. Our room was a long way from the lobby, but that wasn't much of a concern. The parking (free) was at least close. Pool was not large, but adequate space. Great sun in the morning until 2. The 2 hot tubs give you some privacy options. Open air bar is right next to the pool, with full food service, happy hour and nightly bands until 9pm. Gym is brand new with 6-7 aerobic machines. It is tucked away and somewhat isolated - I of course felt safe, but it was one of the things my wife mentioned - she would not feel safe in there alone. There is a restaurant on site, but we didn't partake. Hotel front desk staff were great and friendly (especially Edwin), but the cleaning and pool bar staff were more just about getting the job done. Great value, but I don't think it will stay that way for long. Nicest place in Kihei really. There is a $15 daily 'resort fee' that you won't find out about until you check out. I had heard about it on here though. ABC store on the corner for all your supplies. Hit the Safeway shopping area off the highway if you need lots of items or are quite cost conscious. The Kihei Cafe down the road is stellar for breakfast. Cuatro is probably the best restaurant in town and you can eat higher end, well presented food for around $100 a couple.

It served its purpose for our trip. The hotel is very clean and the room was fresh and decorated nicely. We reserved a Garden View, but received a room on the ground level in the back with a tiny lanai and a view of a 6 foot untrimmed hedge. Kind of a disappointment compared to other Garden View rooms on Maui. The rate was comparable to a popular resort we frequent in the Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali area, but the quality of the hotel, amenities and service was less at the Maui Coast. When we reserved the room, the hotel had not implemented the $15 resort fee. We specifically asked when we called to make the reservation whether there was a resort fee. But when the fee showed up on the bill, I questioned why and the answer was, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We just started implementing the resort fee.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They should have waived the fee because of the timing of the reservation. But no such luck. The pool is small and you have to walk through the main entrance of the hotel and across the covered driveway to access it. The parking spaces are small too. We had to back the car out of the space to open the door most of the time. However, we were pleased that we could come & go without worrying about tipping a valet each time. The hotel restaurant and fitness center is detached from the main building and past the pool area. Kind of a strange design, but might have been pieced together after the fact, due to limited space. Kihei is a very bustling area that reminded us of Southern California. It did not have the Hawaiian feel as much as West and East Maui do. To access the beaches from the hotel, you have to walk across South Kihei Road, which can be very busy. However, I should note that Kalama Beach is a good area to watch whales during the season. Although our experience was average, we might choose to stay here again if the Maui Coast offered an exceptional rate. But the price we paid was not equivalent to the quality or location when compared to other resorts on Maui. However, if you need to stay in South Maui, this is probably one of the more updated, yet economical options.", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brule, Alberta", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Vacation\u201d", "Author": "Stormin10", "ReviewID": "UR60567073", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay, employees are amazing they would do anything for you.

It's not on the beach. It's not in the loveliest part of Maui (Kihei in general is looking pretty old). The restaurant needs a complete overhaul. So, why stay here at all? Because you will not receive finer service anywhere. The staff, from front desk to housekeeping to the shuttle drivers, are all simply wonderful. Your room will be short on luxury but very long on comfort. Our one bedroom suite had a fabulous king bed as well as a sofabed in the living room area, and had 2 plasma TV's. I believe most rooms come with a mini fridge, microwave and coffeemaker. The room was kept spotless by our kind and lovely housekeeper, who always asked what time she should service the room. I locked myself out of the room one day with no ID etc. One of the desk clerks actually delivered a new room key to me where I was sitting by the pool. Now that is service!!! We liked the complimentary shuttle, which will take you 3 miles in either direction. To the north you'll find plenty of strip malls with grocery stores and casual eateries. To the south you can get a ride to Wailea, full of gorgeous resorts, restaurants and a shopping mall. Also complimentary are bikes and use of 3 computers in the lobby. The pool is okay, nothing fancy but attractive enough and we could usually find a vacant chaise. We did not care for the adjoining bar or the restaurant. Breakfast is fine, but we were served a couple of inedible lunches and decided to skip it for the remainder of our 2 week stay. We also liked that we could walk to a great beach in about 5 minutes, and 2 more great beaches were beyond that. There re plenty of small sandwich joints across from all the beaches, so having a picnic on the beach is no problem. We'd highly recommend this place overall. If you are coming to Kihei for any length of time, you may want to consider renting a beachfront condo with a kitchen. If you're going for business, or for a short stay to check out this side of Maui, you couldn't do any better.

It was a recently remodeled hotel, and we like the laid-back vibe it gave off. Upon arrival, we were surprised at how spacious the lobby is. Check in was quick, and we were surprised to learn that the hotel is at 100% capacity. The front desk guy told us they were fully booked for 4 months. Not bad for a terrible economiy.

The Maui Coast Hotel lived up to this ranking and then some! We chose Kihei because we were going to be leaving on dive charters at 6 in the morning and did not want to drive all the way in from Lahaina. Wailea is nice but we were not looking for the big over priced resort experience. We were on Maui to do things not just hang out at a resort. All the recent reviews of the Maui Coast were great so we decided to go with the hotel. The hotel was running a stay 4 nights get the 5th night free promotion. Upon pulling up to the hotel, the open air lobby was beautiful and had a very welcoming feeling. We were early and our room was not yet available. They offered to hold our luggage for the hour or so till the room was ready, but we just left it in out trunk and went grocery shopping. We figured having some drinks, muffins, and munchies was a benefit since we were on Maui for 7 days. (We had already spent 4 nights on the big island) The halls in this hotel are very long but there is a mid hotel elevator so you can park on the area near your room without having to walk the distance of the hotel. There are three computers in the lobby for free guest use. In room internet has a charge, but we had our Verizon card so did not need to access their in room internet. There are guest laundry rooms on every other floor which was very nice as we needed to do mid trip laundry. Also we were able to wash clothes after diving and sightseeing. Washers and Dryers are free, just either bring your own detergent, or buy theirs. The pool area while not a resort pool is very nice. It is framed by palm trees, tiki torches at night, two hot tubs, a free form pool, and poolside bar / grill. We never had a problem finding somewhere to lounge. During the earlier part of the day the pool area can be hot without much breeze, but during the afternoons when the trade winds pick up it is wonderful. We felt hanging out at the beach in the morning when the winds were low and at the pool in the afternoon when the winds were higher were perfect. (When we were not out doing all the things that Maui has to offer.) We did not eat at the restaurant but did have a round of drinks poolside. There was live music poolside in the evening. We thought we would stop in and listen, but reality is by nightfall we were pretty tired since we were active early each day. Though the hotel does not have a direct water view (though it appears some of the higher level rooms at the front of the hotel might.) it is right across from King Kamole II Beach and just a two minute drive from King Kamole III / Kihei Boat Ramp. (Dive and fishing charters) The hotel offers free shuttle service within Kihei and Wailea, but we did not need to use it. The few nights we went out for cocktails we were able to walk easily to several restaurants. There were many good dining options for reasonable prices available in Kihei. (You can see my other reviews.) Free parking is available though many of the spots are very small but there was plenty of parking available. The front desk staff was wonderful. You check your pool towels out from them, and after a couple of visits, they get to know you. I have rave reviews for Edwin, who was working during the day each day. I lost my room key several times and also requested pool towels each day. After the first couple of visits to the front desk he knew our room number and names. He also had a wonderful bubbly personality that really added a glow to the hotel. As for the room it was great. We booked a standard king room, but were upgraded to a Junior Suite as this was an anniversary trip. The standard rooms also seemed very nice. The larger room adds a sitting area, and bigger bathroom, about 150 SF. The descriptions of the rooms online are spot on, no exaggerations. Nice balcony with two chairs. We were on the 4th floor, and though our balcony faced the parking lot the trees and vegetation made it a pleasant view. Never any noise from the parking lot. The hotel had one of the most comfortable beds of any hotel I have stayed in. The refrigerator, wet bar, and microwave were great to have. The bathroom was well designed, spacious, had a large soaking tub / shower combo. Also a neat feature that I had not seen before, there was some kind of defogging heater in the mirror that kept the back lit and center portions of the mirror heated so they did not fog. Too Cool! Bathroom was well stocked with toiletries and blow dryer. Room had a nice iron, plenty of plugs, and a nice work desk and plenty of closet and drawer space. The only thing that would be nice to see in the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a swivel on the TV \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was a bit hard to watch from the bed, but easy to watch from the couch. (Also you could not watch TV and work at the desk.) This is a very minor nit picky item\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..nothing major! The curtains do an excellent job of blocking out all the light. The AC worked well and had the ability to keep the blower motor on for white noise. There was a ceiling fan over the bed. Rooms were quiet. Housekeeping did a wonderful job of keeping the rooms clean. It seemed that no matter what time of day you walked the halls there were always housekeepers around. Any time you called and asked for the staff to clean your room at a certain time, it seemed to be promptly taken care of. A+ Maui Coast Hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We will be back someday!

We have taken week-long vacations at moderate to luxurious accomodations each year for about the past five years. Our stay at the Maui Coast Hotel was a replacement for a return trip to the Fiestamericana in Puerto Vallarta that got cancelled because of Swine Flu hysteria. The Fiestamericana has a private beach, each room has a view of the ocean, and there is a moderately priced restaurant serving delicious food on the premises. The Maui Coast Hotel has none of these amenities, yet I was not disappointed during my 9 night stay there. Here is why: LOCATION: Kihei is maybe not the nicest part of Maui, but it does have a lot going on. You can't swing a dead cat without hitting 3 souvenier shops, 2 surf/snorkel rental places, and an activity booking outfit. It's crowded, but this makes it easy to find things to do. You could probably walk to most of these places, but it's hot enough (in the summer) that you won't want to. Kamaole Beach I is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. It's better for swimming and sunbathing than snorkeling or surfing, but it's pretty nice and it has the shower/foot wash station. During my stay, I discovered this made a trip to the beach a lot more enjoyable. PROPERTY The hotel is situated on a long, narrow lot. Even though it's on a busy street, the hotel is on the furthest part from it, so road noise was not an issue. It was hard to tell what it was between. I guessed condos, but the important thing was that it didn't bother us. Parking is free and plentiful. I don't know if this is the case at most hotels in Maui, but I appreciated the savings. $15-$20 a night x 9 nights would have really added up. We stayed on the \"garden side\" (facing south) of the property. I was disappointed to get a room on the first floor, but hey, no waiting for elevators. The north side faces the parking lot, and that would have been a lot less attractive, especially on the first two floors where headlights would shine in your room. I advise inquiring about this when booking the room. We met a couple who were on the seventh floor, and they said they couldn't really see the ocean from there, either. Every morning, the cooing of masses of pigeons is noticable at sunrise, but it's likely that you'll be waking up early anyway if you're coming from the mainland. Also, turning on the fan in the room drowns out this noise. That was the noisiest thing I noticed during my stay. ROOM My wife described the room as spacious. I wouldn't go quite that far, but aside from the bathroom, it felt more than adequate. Like probably everything in Kihei in July, it got muggy in a hurry, but the air conditioner cooled it down quickly. It was nice to not have to leave it running while I was gone (even if it wasn't my power bill.) Our king bed was very comfortable. The 37\" flatscreen was nice. We liked the seating area and the table. The balcony was kind of small, but we only used it for drying wet things. I made the mistake of eating a pastry on it and half a dozen chicken-like birds immediately came from out of nowhere and pecked up all the crumbs, then returned every morning expecting more. I appreciated the mini-fridge (sort of big, as those things go). We didn't use the microwave, but it was nice knowing we could have. The only thing I would have wanted to be different was the size of the bathroom. It was too small for two people to stand in front of the mirror, and the door would catch the bathmat or the cord to the hairdrier. Also, it didn't have a fan, but the bathroom is a very minor complaint. Finally, it was hard to tell if the hotel was not very full or just really quiet, but we rarely heard people in any other rooms (doors, pipes, etc.) POOL Upon seeing it, my first thought was, \"This is it?\" It was comparable to a pool in a large apartment complex. However, the pool ended up being my favorite thing about the hotel. It certainly didn't take much effort to swim across it, and there wasn't very much shade from about 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM, but we were always able to find a lounge chair. It is surrounded by palms and other tropical landscaping, so you really feel like you are on vacation. All kinds of people went to the pool (couples, singles, foreigners, people on business, families, teens, and unattended kids - more on that later) so there is something for everyone and no one group dominates. There was a jacuzzi adjacent to the pool and another one in a more secluded area. There was a bar that was part of the Spices restaurant that would sell you drinks, but the service to come around and bring it to you was infrequent and slow. The best part of the pool was at night when live music would perform from 6-9 and the tiki torches were lit. They were well-rehearsed lounge acts, and it was pleasant to float in the pool and listen to it. I got the sense that people from nearby accomodations came to this hotel for the pool scene (it was easy just to walk up to.) I didn't always want to leave at 10PM when it closed down and I certainly didn't appreciate parents dumping their kids there while they went and drank at the bar, but this was in infrequent occurrence. RESTAURANTS The Spices restaurant occupies the \"frontage\" of the property near the road. It is separate from the hotel, as they will tell you when you ask to charge something to your room and they have to call the hotel. I only had a few drinks from the bar (expensive outside of the 4-6 happy hour) and breakfast there once. The food was good, but entrees for dinner seemed to be in the $20-$30 range. This is probably because there are numerous less expensive (though hardly inexpensive) options nearby, so Spices is where you go if you want nice ambience. As far as other restaurants go, my personal favorite was Maui Taco, about a mile south of the hotel. It combined the best of Mexican and Hawaiian cuisine into an unlikely but delicious combination. I initially avoided the Moose McGillicuddy's / Fred's restaurant (also to the south) because it seemed a little too \"TGI Friday's packed with tourists\" and to a certain extent that was true. I doubt locals eat there, but I'm not sure why that matters, actually. The food was good and reasonably priced (even more so with BOGO coupons) and if you sit upstairs you have a good view of the beach. OTHER The staff was friendly and seemed to like their jobs. Edwin, the desk clerk, was adorable and reminded me of \"Mango,\" the Chris Kattan character from SNL. We didn't really require anything from them so there wasn't much opportunity to review them further. My wife described the housekeeping as \"inconsistent.\" Sometimes our room was cleaned by 9:00 AM, other times, it still wasn't when we came back at 11:30 AM. Soap and Q-tips (important if you swim in the breakers where it's sandy) were not always replenished as quickly as we would have liked, and they gave up on placing the accent blanket on the bed after the second day, but the important things were always clean. The hotel had tennis courts, which we intended to use, but 88 degrees of humid weather made us change our mind. There were two free computers in the lobby that were occupied 90% of the time, but it looked as if they were installing 4 more stations while we were there. It looked as if there were Trek mountain bikes for rent, too. I cycle 80-100 miles a week at home and was eager to try this on Maui, but after reading about the biking scene there, I talked myself out of it and don't regret it. It's a shame, because Kihei and the South Maui coast is flat and everything is close together, so a bike would be ideal, but the roads are filled with gawking tourists driving unfamilar rental cars, and motor scooters use the bike lanes that didn't seem to be quite as continuous as one would have liked. Biking would have been a hot, dangerous experience. Besides, they were pretty cheap Treks (as would be expected.) I would definitely stay here again, and hope to do so in the winter months when it isn't quite so hot and I'm not missing the best weather of the year back home.", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "loansmaxjuan", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel I've ever stayed at!!!!\u201d", "Author": "loansmaxjuan", "ReviewID": "UR34977764", "Content": "First let me start by saying that i did not experience any of the negative things that other reviews mentioned.

Decent size small refrigerator in the room. Front desk personnel always greeted me coming and going and check-in and check-out was quick and accurate.

Our pillows were horrible. Two of them were feather pillows, when you would lay your head on them, it would flatten down to nothing, and the other pillow was so lumpy we just tossed it off the bed. We were initially excited about our balcony, but unfortunately it was located above the air conditioners (we were on the second floor) so we didn't even venture out there, it would have been too loud to even hear each other speak. They also knew we were on our honeymoon, and still placed us in that location; We were a little disappointed but we quickly got over it, we were like a dime a dozen in Hawaii!

Definitely a great choice. More value for your dollar. The hotel certainly lives up to its description. It is a very nice hotel and exceeded my expectations. The front desk/conceirge are wonderful. They were knowledgeable and more than willing to help. The pool/hot tub area are clean. There is an outdoor bar located right near the pool. The restaurant offers a nice breakfast at a reasonable price. Three months prior to our trip my husband proposed and we decided that we would get married while visiting Maui.

The only complaint we had was when the Expedia fun desk person in the lobby referred us to a condo sales pitch in Lahaina for a free $100.00 activity voucher. All you had to do was go to Lahaina and listen to a presentaion over the Fairmont resort condos. She kept telling us how great it was and how it wouldn't be a high pressured sales pitch, just go listen, eat free lunch, and leave. She was so wrong. It was very high pressured. They ran our credit without telling us and were just complete jerks. We got up and left in the middle of it. Do not get suckered into this! I would not do it again even for $1,000. Anyway, The hotel could not have been in a better location. This was our first trip to Maui so we didn't really know where to stay. Everyone kept telling us to stay up North in Kaanapali at one of the big resorts but I'm so glad we didn't. All the great sites and beaches on the west part of Maui are down south, not in Kaanapali like everyone tells you. We traveled to Kaanapali a few times and realized how far away it was from all the great stuff. All they had were big hotels with nice pools and bad beaches. If that's what you're looking for, go to some random beach resort in the US. Tips: Make sure and visit Makena Beach down South, aka Big Beach and Little Beach. Big Beach is beautiful! Use caution though, Little Beach is a nude beach. If you are looking for all the beautiful and amazing women of Maui, go to the windsurfing beach Paia any day of the week! To go swimming with dolphins, go to La Perouse Bay down South right at sunrise. They will be there feeding with their babies....amazing!!!

Unfortunately at the time of our check-in we were told that they have a first come first serve basis and at the time we had gotten there (which was about 3pm (check-in time)) they had all their suites with 2 beds out. I asked if it would be possible to get a new room as soon as it came available and they told me that they would let me know if any guests left early since they were booked till the 15th. Well That was that.. so we got ended up getting a one bedroom suite (on the 5th floor) which had 1 king sized bed and 1 sofa bed. It also had a mini fridge, a coffee maker, a separate counter and sink for food prep, TV, big closet, complimentary safe, iron and iron board, hair dryer and a balcony. The room was clean. I did not see anything wrong with it. I am really picky when it comes to hotel bathrooms. This bathroom passed my test. The tub was clean, the non-slip mat was free of mold, the shower curtain looked new, the toilet did not have a yellow ring and the sinks were really clean. The housekeeping staff provided fresh towels everyday as well as mouthwash, shampoo, body lotion, cotton balls and q-tips. We had a balcony that had the view of a building that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beside the hotel. If you walked out on to the balcony you could enjoy the view of the ocean. The one thing that I did not like of the room was the sofa bed. You could feel the bed springs on your ribs. However the king sized bed was really comfortable to sleep in. I slept like a baby in that bed. The pool area is really small. The pool is only 5 feet deep and small in size and it has one toddler pool and 2 hot tubs. But who needs a bigger pool area when in Hawaii. The beach is only across the street and the hotel provides towels that you can check out to take to the pool/beach.

We chose the Maui Coast because it was the cheapest hotel that I felt comfortable staying at without seeing it for myself beforehand. I decided this based on the reviews on this website. If you are looking for cheap, clean, & comfortable, this is your hotel. If you are looking for new, spotless, good beach views/access this is not the hotel for you. If you are wanting to walk everywhere from your hotel, Kihei is not the town for you. I would suggest Lahina or Kaanapali. The Maui Coast is located across the street and down a little from Kama\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcole Beach Parks I, II and III (which didn't look like they were the best of beaches). There may be a few hotel rooms where you can see the beach from your room, but don't even hope for this at the Maui Coast. We could see a small piece of the ocean if we leaned way out of the balcony, but there are residences with walls and lots of trees on the beachside of the street directly in front of the hotel. Normally I would want to stay at a hotel that was directly on the beach so that I could walk out to it at any time, but we stayed here for only 2 nights after 7 nights at the Grand Wailea and we were planning on driving to the perfect location each day anyway. Unless you are staying at a resort and are planning to spend your entire time there, you need to rent a car no matter where you stay. Our room: We reserved a standard room at the AAA price of around $165 plus tax. When we arrived we were upgraded to an Alcove Jr. Suite (supposed to be about $30 more according to the website). The suite had almost 200 more sq feet and a wet bar, so this was nice. The furniture in the room is very outdated beach type furniture/decor. (You know, white iron/wood furniture with a pink and light blue decor. A little 80s.) It does look like the pictures on the website, but a little dingier. The cushions on the love seat were definately dingy from use, but nothing was really gross. The bed was nice and comfortable with down pillows (but they were small - the king room came with 3 pillows). Our bathroom was spacious with double sinks, but the standard room looks like it would have been a tight squeeze. There was a large refrigerator in the room (which was nice after having to pay $25 for a small one at the Grand Wailea even though it is a mega dollar resort!). The hotel: This hotel has restaurant(s) and a pool, but we didn't use them. They have towels that you can check out to use at the pool or take to the beach - just make sure you bring them back. There are multiple laundry rooms in the hotel. Usage is free, there is only a charge if you need to buy single use detergent or dryer sheets from the vending machine. Nice if you need to dry a couple of bathing suits before you pack up to go home! Remember this hotel is not located on the beach so there are no cabanas, umbrellas, or chairs to use at the beach. If you want to pay a fee you can use tennis courts and bicycles provided by the hotel. Check out is at 11:00, but they let us stay until 12:00 when we asked even though they were sold out. Overall, I would recommed this hotel for short stays, tight budgets, or if you plan on traveling all over Maui and don't care about having a beach on your front lawn. I would stay here again if for a short stay, but would try to find something on the beach up near Kaanapali/Lahina if I were staying for a long time. Other Info: We ate at: 1. Lahina Fish Company in Lahina (Moderate to Slightly High, approx. $18 - 39/entree), good food, O.K. service, great view - it sits out over Lahina Harbor). 2. Paia Fish Market in Paia (Inexpensive, approx $10-13/entree), great fried food, counter service only, a few bench style tables that you sit with other people at, no view). 3. Buzz's Warf at Maalea Harbor (Slightly High, approx. $23-45/entree & drinks are club service - no refills), FANTASTIC shrimp - read up about it - O.K. other food, O.K. service, O.K. view of Maalea Harbor, but not directly on the water, so you'd have to sit at the window and look over the parking lot. 4. Canoes in Lahina (Moderate to Slightly High, approx. $18-39/entree) O.K. food - I didn't really care for my Mahi, good service, good view of the ocean if you sit at the windows near the north end of the restaurant. We shopped at: 1. The Shops at Wailea - really only good for high-end shopping, not much entertainment. Only a couple of restaruants.2. Front Street in Lahina - nice to stroll & do some Hawaiian market shopping along with a few clothing stores, nice jewelry stores, and art galleries. Lots of restaurants. Stop and check out the huge Banyan tree. 3. Whaler's Village in Kanapali - similar to the shops at Wailea, but on certain nights they offer free entertainment. 4. Hagusegawa (sp?) General Store in Hana - junky place to pick up a t-shirt or a snack or some motor oil after traversing the road to Hana. 5. ABC store - the ultimate Hawaiian convience store. Good for cheap souveniers, snacks, etc. We surfed at \"The Cove\" in Kihei. Good, long breaking 1 foot swells for beginners. It is where a lot of surf classes take place, but you can keep away from them by surfing in the actual cove where commercial activity is forbidden. We rented our board from Maui Waveriders which has a shop out of a truck between the Marketplace and the 76 Gas station near the Cove in Kihei and somewhere in Lahina. They were great. Provided you with booties - the sand can be dangerous from rocks - a rash guard - and of course the board. A soft top is $15/day and a hard top is $30/day. *The Cove is right up the road from the Maui Coast. You could walk, but if you're carring a surf board, you wouldn't want to. We traveled the Road to Hana. If you like seeing a lot of different areas/beaches and waterfalls, you should do this, ONCE. But it is a loooong winding road. There are lots of places to stop to swim, body board, and see waterfalls. You can even swim in some waterfalls, but it's not always advised depending on the conditions. We went to Big Beach in Makena - this is more like the beaches you'd be used to in the US. Most beaches in Hawaii are small, but this golden sand beach is long and wide. The shore break is right on the beach, so bodyboarding and body surfing are fun, but dangerous. The waves have some major crashing force here.", "Date": "May 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cLoved Maui, eventually LIKED the hotel\u201d", "Author": "Average_Jo_and_Jane", "ReviewID": "UR7551078", "Content": "We stayed at the Maui Coast hotel in June 2006 as part of our honeymoon. Despite what some people have written, we had no problems at all with the location of the hotel. It was set back off the main road through Kihei and a maximum of 5 minute walk from the beaches and 10 minutes from a small shopping area in Kihei. We did not notice any noise from traffic, and no loud music or rowdy guests/locals. It was a very quiet and relaxing hotel and area. Always plenty of free parking at the hotel, and we did indeed hire a car, which was well worth it as there is so much to explore in Maui. The hotel looks pretty and the pool area (though it is a small pool) is pretty, clean and has plenty of sun loungers. The hotel has lovely greenery and clean, pretty public areas. The beaches in Ki'hei were beautiful, as they were all over the island, and Maui itself was exactly as we had pictured it. Wonderful scenery, very friendly people. Tropical paradise with the comfort of an American holiday (written from the POV of Brits you understand!!). There are convenience stores and food such as pizza hut in Ki'hei but little else. The nearby town of Wailea (about a 10 min drive away) is fantastic for shopping, with lots of designer stores such as Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Guess, etc, as well as lots of souvenirs and standard shops. The hotel itself was very disappointing for us when we first arrived. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, our first room was on the ground floor, was very small and smelt very badly of damp, which was only made worse by the airconditioning unit. There were cigarette burns and stains all over the carpets, chairs and sofas, and there were hairs in the bed sheets!! The bathroom suite was discoloured and it smelt of sewage. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW BAD THIS ROOM WAS!! I cried and we both wanted to leave. Plus we did not get the champage we were promised as honeymooners! This realy upset my husband who had planned the holiday as a surprise and it did not live up to expectations. Having said that, when we complained, the hotel manager was very hepful and let us have our pick of 3 other rooms, two of which were junior suites on higher floors, and (eventually) agreed to no extra charge for this. The third was a room similar to ours on the ground floor, which had all the exact same problems. I was told this hotel has been refurbished recently, and I firmly believe that is a lie, otherwise not all the rooms have been done yet. We refused this room also, but both the suites on the higher floors were much larger and did not smell of damp. There were still some stains but no where near as many. We couldnt move hotels as it was too expensive, so we picked one of these rooms and stuck with it. We decided to hire a car for a couple of days to get us out and about, which was a fantastic idea and we got to see so many wonderful places. Ultimately, we really enjoyed the holiday and started to appreciate the hotel more once we were in better room. The junior suite was much nicer, cleaner and more comfortable, and we really enjoyed the holiday! Plus they gave us 2 bottles of champagne to say sorry! The restaurant served good value, local and American cuisine. We never once had a bad meal there, although tended only to eat breakfast at the hotel. Good sized portions too, and very attentive, friendly staff. Overall, the hotel itself is very pretty, nicely located, and has very friendly and helpful staff. It is NOT an exclusive hotel, so do not go expecting facilities at that standard. It was a bit like Russian Roulette for us in terms of room quality, but we got there in the end!!

If you want a very nice place to stay while you explore the wonderful island of Maui then this is it.

After requesting a change we were given a much better 3rd floor room. This greatly enhanced the 7 nights we stayed in November. This room was always clean and smelled fresh after we returned from a day of exploring. There are plenty of local style eateries within walking distance, but you can also drive to many more. I would suggest Kihei Caffe, Da Kithcen, and Maui Thai. Speaking of driving, Maui has to be one of the easier places for a stranger to get around in. The streets are well marked and the other drivers are polite. Since it's an island I suppose it would be really hard to get lost. Yes, the beach is across the street and requires a short walk. Once you get there you'll find a very nice, sandy, life guard protected beach. Just go in the morning because the trade-winds kick up the sand in the afternoons. Don't restrict yourself to this one beach though. Beautiful beaches are everywhere! The hotel will let you check out beach towels so that's one less thing to pack. Rent a car. Relax. Don't stay in your room. Explore. Have a little fun! I heard the hotel has a nice pool. I didn't fly 4200 miles to sit by the pool although the heated spa is nice after a long day! I suggest that anyone considering a visit to Maui to research, research, research. Skip the day one orientation/breakfast. This will enable you to see the sunrise on Haleakala while you body clock is still on mainland time instead of listening to a sales pitch and eating small muffins.

We booked a room at the last minute through one of the travel sights (Travelocity) and got a rate of $215 for a standard room. I had to do a double take because only 1 sight was offering this rate, all others started at $240 or $245, unless you were a triple A member. Also, some sights showed no availability -- so we made sure we had all the phone numbers and customer service numbers before leaving home, just in case. Check-in was swift and friendly and without a hitch. The whole hotel is non-smoking (yea!) The open air lobby was large, but not cave-like and nicely decorated. We opened the door to our room and we had been up-graded to a 1-bedroom suite -- one of their best rooms! The bathroom appeared to be equipped for handicapped persons; however, this was on the 5th floor about as far away from the elevator as possilble. This made for a very, very quiet stay for us, but if one of us were truly handicapped, you'd think the room would be closer to the elevator and/or on a lower floor. The king size bed had it's own bedroom with a Juliett balcony and TV and closet. The bed was ok (I love Marriott, Westin, & Sofitel beds -- so I'm spoiled). No feather pillows (and me, leaving my favorite down travel pillow in a hotel room last year...I guess I should order myself a new one...) There were 5 pillows for the 2 of us, which was nice for reading in bad and planning the next day's activities. The separate living area had a sofa-sleeper, which we had no use for, a table and 2 chairs and a TV. There was probably more to this suite, but we didn't spend a lot of time in our room and when we were there, we were on the lanai, or the bedroom, or the bathroom. The lanai was large with 2 chairs and a small table. The view was OK. The Maui Coast Hotel only has \"garden\" views. Our lanai faced a condo complex and some nicely land-scaped grounds. The view to the left was up the mountain that leads to Hale'akala crater and was quite pretty, especially as the sun came up in the morning. And if you looked to your right, you could see a bit of the ocean through the trees. I'm a very picky person. I do not stand for dirty or smelly hotel rooms. If there's mold in the bath or hairs on the sink or anything else that could be cleaned up easily, I figure that if the maids cannot clean the easy stuff, then what is lurking that I can't see? Happily, this hotel room was clean. No mold. No hairs. No dusty corners. My only negative comment would be that the carpet was very light color with a raised pattern and could use a deep-shampoo, or replacement, even. The raised areas definitely showed the dirt. In-room coffee, hair dryer, refrigerator -- we had everything we needed. I thought the coffee we made in the made tasted horrible -- like cleaning chemicals -- my husband thought it was fine and drank the whole pot. Maybe it was \"just me\". I sent him to the lobby to see if he could get me some different coffee and he came back with 2 cups and it was slightly macademia nut flavored and wonderfully strong, too! Overall, our room was fine for 1 night for us. We knew we had not booked a resort, or even an ocean view. We had a last minute opportunity to go to Maui and our hotel choices were limited. That said, I'm glad we stayed here. Kihei town was lovely -- gotta go to Kihei Cafe for breakfast -- and a great \"base\" for us, with an ABC store a very short walk away and a beach across the street. We could've spent a lot more money and not have been any more satisfied. We did drive by the 2 hotels in Kahului, near the airport, where the rooms were less expensive. I'm so glad we didn't stay there -- not a good location for us and the town itself left a lot to be desired. In fact, surprisingly, we couldn't find an ABC store in Kahului to pick up some last minute souvenirs. And turned to Longs Drugs, instead -- just not the same! Once again, the Maui Coast was a clean, comfortable hotel in a good location at a reasonble price. Thanks fellow trip-advisors who had written informative reviews that helped us to make this choice. No, it is not a resort. If you want a resort, chances are, you'll have to pay significantly more for those amenities. This was perfect for us -- a younger, middle-aged couple with no kids who wanted a place to stay to use as a \"base\" for exploring and dining out. Aloha.

Our room was on the ground floor and the hotel guide in the room suggested using the spy holes on the door to check if anyone was outside before leaving the room and locking it when in the room. This made me a little apprehensive. The bathroom was fine - a half bath with shower over the bath. They were a little stingy with the soap, body lotion and shampoo - not replacing these as they were used. We loved the pool and hot tubs and especially enjoyed swimming when the pool was floodlit. Awesome lying on your back looking up at the stars. During the day there were free towels for use at the pool which was a good service. Plenty of sun loungers and a nice shady area to escape to if you'd had enough sun. The food at the poolside bar was very good - particularly enjoyed mahi mahi and chips washed down with mai tais.

You get lot of food for two people under $20.00. The only negative thing about the hotel was the small pool. But in my opinnion if you go to Maui you should be on the beach. We had the one bedroom suite. The room was big and the whirlpool was nice to have especially after a 7 hour flight. The refrigerator was nice to have especially if you traveling with small children so you can fill it up with milk, juice and water. The Hotel would be perfect if it had a microwave in it. If you have a rental car I recommend to drive up the street to Waliea. A very richie area. I felt like I was in Bevery Hill, CA. Maybe in the furture we will save for a 4/5 star hotel. Another thing about this hotel location is it about 50% local and 50% tourist. To me that was a plus. We check out Kannapili area. To me it felt like I was in Florida beach location. To many people and they are all tourist plus you are force to pay high $$ for food. You really felt like you were a local at the Maui Coast Hotel location.

The computers in the lobby were always accessible and proved to be very helpful. I loved this hotel and immediately liked the openness of the lobby when we first drove up. Although, we never ate at the restaurant Spices and the drinks at the Tradewinds Poolside Cafe weren't that great. Overall, it was more than we ever imagined it would be and we will definitely be staying there again! Kihei is the place to stay if you want to get away from all the \"touristy\" places. This is where the locals live and there are many small shops and fast food places to stop for something quick and cheap. We're so glad we chose Kihei instead of Ka'anapali...too many people to really relax and enjoy your honeymoon. It's also not far from Wailea which has some gorgeous hotels...I suggest driving through and daydreaming about where you might stay the next time you have a little more money to burn. I suggest heading over to Activity Warehouse and sheduling all your Maui adventures. They are so nice and eager to know all about you and what brought you to Maui. They can get you in on things that are already booked and they love honeymooners! We signed up for the Maui Dinner Cruise on the Maui Princess and it was so romantic! My husband was a little sick, but the food was unbelievable and all the drinks were FREE! Don't forget the Dramamine! February was part of their whale season so we saw plenty of whales breech with the colorful, breathtaking sunset as their backdrop. Speaking of the whales, we were on a whale watching tour the next day (scheduled by Activity Warehouse) and took pictures of the amazing creatures. There's nothing like it! Through Activity Warehouse, we made plans to take surfing lessons with Hawaiian Ultimate Adventures. MAKE SURE YOU GET THE RIGHT DIRECTIONS! We got lost and we were 20 minutes late for our lesson. They had already started and we thought we were out of luck...BUT to our surprise, the instructor, \"Surfer Mike\", called me later that day and scheduled another lesson because he didn't want to ruin our honeymoon! He was awesome! We probably have some of our best memories of Maui because of \"Surfer Mike\"! Don't forget your underwater camera so someone can catch the moment you actually ride a wave! As far as gifts go, there are several stores in the Lahaina area but can be very expensive. If you're just looking for something cheap and reasonable for family back home, just head into an ABC Store and pick up some things...it will keep souvenir costs down! Make sure you get some real Hawaiian Shave Ice while you're there! Visit the Banyan Tree that shades almost a whole block and we were lucky because there was an art show there one day and we bought a few reproductions to enjoy at home. If you're there with a significant other and you want a romantic dinner, check out Plantation House Restaurant in Kapalua! It's well worth the drive (about 40 minutes in evening traffic) and the views are magnificent! My husband's parents gave this to us as a gift and we immediately made reservations when we arrived at our hotel. Make sure that you time your dinner so that you're sitting and watching the sunset over the island of Molokai. The restaurant is located on the Plantation Gulf Course and seems so far from everything. Entree prices range from about $19-$30. It's an island cuisine with a \"splash\" of Mediterranean. Get the Bananas Foster for two for a sweet ending to a romantic experience. As for the Road to Hana tour, do it once in your life! There are so many beautiful things in nature that you'll miss if you skip something like this! Yes, there are many tight curves and bridges and it takes at least 7 hours roundtrip if you are stopping to look. Like I mentioned earlier, start before 7am and go to the Shell gas station by the airport and pick up the \"Road to Hana\" guided tour tape/cd. It tells you where to stop and what different things are along the way. You might get confused if you don't make sure that you're on HANA HIGHWAY first...makes a big difference! Anyway, I hope all of this helped and my husband and I can't wait until we get back to Maui and will definitely be staying at the Maui Coast Hotel again if we're on a tight budget!", "Date": "September 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dorset", "Title": "\u201cGreat start!\u201d", "Author": "ScandiPeacock", "ReviewID": "UR3806154", "Content": "This was the first hotel we stayed at during our island hopping Hawaii holiday.

The two things I liked best about this hotel were the location and the pool. The Kihei location was GREAT. We visited Lahina twice and then tried to stay away from it because there is only one way in and out of there and the road is always backed up, especially going into Lahina at dinnertime. The Kihei location has two access roads, S. Kihei along the ocean and 31 which is inland a bit. So, if one is busy, you can try the other and usually get where you want to go pretty quickly. Having a car (or motorcycle) on Maui is essential if you want to sightsee. Though, I noticed that the hotel had a lot of bicycles out front, I wondered if they rent them but I didn't ask. The pool was wonderful, offering lots of chairs, shaded and unshaded. It was always hoppin' but there always seemed to be just enough chairs for everyone. There is a separate hot tub in an alcove behind the pool that has lots of shaded chairs and is a bit quieter if the pool is quite active. One thing I didn't like is that people could smoke by the pool but we were able to avoid sitting by those folks and ran into the same problem at the beach and many of the restaurants so really, this has nothing to do with the pool. Just something to keep an eye out for before you choose your chair. As for the room itself, well, it wasn't as good as I had hoped but I still thought it was good for the price (compared to brand name hotels and resorts that wanted upwards of $380 per night). We got the upgraded \"Alcove Suite\". The room layout was good and I liked having a fridge in the room to keep bottled water cold. We were able to put all of our electronics (laptop included) inside the in-room safe which was a nice feature. I LOVED the tub which was very clean. No matter how much sand I brought into that tub, the next day it sparkled... despite it being a bit \"outdated\". I also liked having free laundry on-site (yes, I actually did some laundry on my vacation). The sixth floor washers and dryers were brand new and required no coins to operate. Because of the free laundry we were able to travel a little lighter (I'm sure my husband doubts that after carrying my suitcase). And, like many have said before, I saw no bugs inside the hotel, which, I understand is terrific for a tropical place. My husband used the free internet access downstairs a couple of times but it was always very busy. This hotel could improve by 1) replacing the carpet in the rooms 2) cleaning the couch upholstry 3) getting bigger sheets for the king beds 4) getting a second concierge and 5) adding more internet access stations and/or adding a wireless internet option which would probably take some of the burden off of the two free stations in the lobby. Our room had a cigarette burn on the carpet in one area and a mystery stain (the size of a half dollar) in another area. Thankfully, the carpet was otherwise okay, not smelly or sticky or anything, just a couple of burns/stains that were an eyesore. On our last day, we saw some contractors measuring the carpet in the hallway presumably for a quote. Hopefully they do the rooms as well because they are more in need of carpet than the hallway! The couch upholstry was dirty, but we didn't really use the couch except to put our suitcases on so it wasn't a big deal, it just would be nice to see this change as it, like the carpet, is a real eyesore. As for the sheets, we had a king bed and for some reason, the bottom sheet was not large enough to stay tucked around the mattress properly. It was as if they were using flat queen sheets on a king bed. As for the concierge, we tried to work with them to get some activities and dinner reservations set up but they were always busy when we visited so we ended up setting stuff up ourselves. Maybe they need two concierges if they plan to book the hotel solid which is what happened when we were there. As noted by other folks, don't expect a view, except from the front elevator! The beach is across the street but you need to walk a block or so left to access it. I highly recommend renting a beach umbrella, both Boss Frog's and Snorkel Bob's are down the street and they rent umbrellas, chairs, and more. Makena beach is the best beach (way down past Wailea) but we had some good afternoons at Kamaole too. Despite the many reviews of great food at the pool, we never ate there, though I had a couple smoothies while sunbathing which were great. We did try Spices on the last two days for breakfast and it was very good, though, the options for $4.95 breakfast as advertised on the sign out front were very limited. The service was a little slow on the day we ate around 9am but when we ate late (around 10:45a) it was fine. The KKO(?) is also within walking distance and serves breakfast with an ocean view. Denny's is down the street too and we heard tons of complaints about that. Our favorite breakfast place was the Big Wave which was in one of the shopping centers north of the hotel, maybe Azuka marketplace? Anyway, I thought this hotel was a good value. Maybe a little outdated but clean in the places that count, and a good location. We'd consider staying here again. Sorry to write such a lengthy review. I used these reviews when I booked my trip and found that the ones with the most details were the most helpful.

The staff was really friendly and there were no bugs! The room was ok but is starting to look very tired. Although we were in a no smoking room there were cigarete burns in the carpet and coffee and side tables. The bathrooms are very plain and need to be upgraded. The Maui Coast needs to be refurbished or it is really going to be a dump in the next 10 yrs. Dont bother eating at the Hotels restaurant.. service is bad and food is worse. There are some really good places to eat but you will have to walk about 8 blocks to get a great breakfast. The best place is the Kihei Caffe. What I mostly found disappointing was the location. I had not been to Maui in 20 yrs so was very disappointed at the uncontolled building on every square inch of land available! The hotel is not in the best of areas and I found it upsetting to have to walk past the drunks and druggies on the way to the beach. The area is noisy, the traffic is brutal and we did not feel safe at all walking at night. There are very few street lamps and a lot of dark and creepy areas that if I was a woman alone would never venture out alone. The beaches and the ocean of course are lovely and its easy to forget what you are paying everynight for accomodations. I think the best bet in Maui is to find a private rental condo with the best features you can afford. My recommendation is to stay out of Kihea and if you can find a deal try Wailea. You will probably get a lot more bang for your buck. You will probably have to pay more however Kihei and Wailea are worlds apart in the kind of people that hang out in each area.The minute you leave Kihei and enter Wailea you know why you came to Maui!

THE HOTEL The hotel is nice and is very clean. No bugs. While the hotel cannot be classified as a 'luxury' hotel, it is far more attractive than a Holiday Inn and as nice as some Marriott hotels. Unless you are a person who needs a Hilton, Four Seasons, etc., you should be quite happy there. The pool area is nice, clean, and gets lots of sunlight throughout the day. Lots of free beach towels which you can borrow for the day even if you're going off-premises to the beach. There is a pool-side bar/restaurant which is good. We did not try the main restaurant, as neither the menu nor the atmosphere appealed to us. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Parking is free and convenient, as is the internet access. We received a free upgrade to a suite that was quite nice - it had a fridge, safe, balcony, double sink, hairdryer and jacuzzi tub (but the tub was far too powerful to use comfortably, believe it or not). If possible, ask for a room facing the mountains (i.e. not overlooking the hotel's parking lot). From our balcony we had a view of beautiful mountains and the ocean. You will be hard pressed to find a hotel in Kiehei built right on the beach - you'll have to go to Wailea for that and pay a lot more $. In our view it's just not worth the extra expense, as all of the beaches are nearby, accessible to the public, and none were crowded. LOCATION & NEARBY ATTRACTIONS The hotel location is great for a number of reasons: (1) you are across the road from a park and beach and only a few minutes' drive to several other great beaches; (2) it is close to several good restaurants (definitely try Stella Blues (great fish and dessert), Five Palms Beach Grille Kihei (delicious international cuisine with a beautiful and romantic sunset view outdoors), and Sansei Kihei (fantastic and creative sushi in a fun & relaxed atmosphere), but we did not enjoy Roy's Kihei at all); (3) it is very close to virtually anything you may need - i.e. groceries, restaurants, bars, gas, rentals of snorkelling/diving/boogieboarding/beach gear; (4) it is a few minutes' drive from Wailea and you have access to a great beach in Wailea just behind a couple of the fancy hotels there - all the fun and beauty at half the price!", "Date": "February 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice\u201d", "Author": "mitchmurr", "ReviewID": "UR3168473", "Content": "Excellent hotel.

Hotel definitely Recommended.", "Date": "October 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kiama, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at Maui Coast\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2758800", "Content": "We stayed in the Maui Coast for 3 nights. It was excellent value. Our room was clean and comfortable with a fridge and a small balcony. The use of the free internet was a great feature, although the two computers were constantly in use and we usually had to wait to use them.We also appreciated the free laundry facility. Our only complaint would be the standard of the food in the restaurant and the staff who were unfriendly unlike the staff in the hotel itself who were very obliging. This is not a major problem because there are lots of nearby restaurants.

Nice and very clean room. No bugs to report at all. We were upgraded to the one bedroom suite 432 at no extra charge; we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have to ask. Staff was very nice and helpful. Large bathroom is nice to have on a vacation. Bathroom shower is also very strong, unlike the ones in the mainland hotels. The bedroom has a large king size bed and TV. Living room is large with a TV, sofabed, small fridge, and a wet-bar. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supposed to be an internet wi-fi in the room, but this room was in a dead-spot and no-way to connect to the internet, except dial-up. Do not connect by dial-up; you will be charge a whole lot of bucks! Just use the free internet access at the lobby. There is free laundry and dryer in each floor too. The beach across the street is nice, but Black Rock at the Sheraton is the best for snorkeling; lots of turtles and fish. We were lucky to see dolphins on our last day of our vacation at Black Rock.

The staff could not have been more friendlier or helpful. We were always given a warm greeting when we walked through the lobby. The spacious room was kept impeccably clean. The towels smelled good. The large jakuzzi tub and generous shower head were a luxury I appreciated. Our housekeeper gave us unexpected good service with extra attention to little details. The hotel is in a good and central location for reaching any part of the island. There are numerous shops, restaurants, and services within walking distance. There was fine Hawaiian entertainment each night as well as food and drinks available at the beautiful pool. Parking is free and close-no long walks to get to your car. No valet service is provided but it is not needed. It is a luxury room for an economy price. The economy comes because you are not paying for a lot of wasted lobby space and facilities the average family will never use but must be included in the price of the room. From Maui we went to the Big Island and stayed in an expensive \"luxury hotel\". The room was much smaller, the room was not kept clean, housekeeping was sloppy, the staff was surly, and we were a very long walk from our car. I will never stay there again, but the Maui Coast Hotel WILL see us again. We were given the royal treatment there. OH YES. At the Maui Coast Hotel computers were available in the lobby for guests use for no charge. At the expensive \"luxury\" hotel they charged $5 for 15 minutes on their antiquated computers. You will be pleased with your accomodations at the Maui Coast Hotel. Oh yes, the road to Hana is not as bad as they say. Just drive slow and take the curves easy.

Very clean and very affordable hotel. Most of Kihei is Condo and the only other hotels are old or expensive. The restaurant on site was not part of the hotel proper, and a bit expensive so we preferred to dine locally. A nice clean beach is only a short walk away, and unless you must have the oceanfront views, this is a great choice. Our room was a standard with King bed and also had a small living area.(Divan, chairs and tables etc). The staff were friendly and helpful. Located in South Kihei in a quieter part of town we found it was easy to relax when we wanted. The location was also central enough to allow us to explore the rest of Maui easily.

The worst part was that when I checked in there were long black hair on the bathroom floor, clearly from the room service lady, and used coffee filter in the brewer machine. Even worse, on the second day both hair in the bathroom and used coffee filter were still there. And bed sheets were not even pulled straight, just the blanket was pulled over. Clearly the room service lady is not going into all her checklist. These were not details but basic cleaning items.

I have a friend who works for the company who gave me the friends and family rate before she left to go out of the country.

Long story short, he didn't budge. Total jerk! I couldn't get a hold of my friend, because she was out of the country. No where was it written on line that I'd have to have a form to get that rate. I would not have stayed at this hotel if I wasn't getting a good rate. Here's why- when you pull into the hotel, there are signs everywhere telling you to take in your personal belongings. Barbed wire cover the top of the fencing around the hotel, and to make matters worse, most rooms are not located inside the hotel. (outside entrance). It must be a very dangerous area, because the gas station across the street has bulletproof glass around the workers! If you are considering this hotel- reconsider!!!

Grounds especially didn't seem to be kept up to very well. Outside of my room the grass was dead, their was garbage on the sidewalks, 6 cigarette butts littered outside my door, and a nearby maintenance room was leaking water through the door the entire stay and made the nearby entrance to my room wet. The other problem, which isn't the hotel's fault, but the hotel is right off the freeway and you can hear the cars all night long.

All the problems mentioned in earlier posts have been dealt with - all the rooms are being renovated, the back parking lot has bright floodlights and the breakfast is substantial and free. We have traveled extensively and usually stay at Hyatt's, and the interior is on par with most Hyatts we have been to. We booked a 2 bedroom suite which was the size of a small apartment with a kitchen with granite countertops, and 2 bathrooms. There were 3 flat screen TV's and an ethernet line. There was a full breakfast in the morning and an evening social hour with basic, but filling fare (grilled chicken sandwiches, chili dogs) which changes every day. There was also a self serve wine and beer bar. Staff was wonderful and friendly. Some have alluded to the fact that it is not in a great area - well, this is true insomuch as it is right off the highway and it is in a \"business\" area with gas stations and repair shops as its neighbors, but for the price, what do you expect? We have small children and we felt completely safe here, even at night. The doors are to an exterior, outside hallway, but again, we felt very safe. The only other issue is that it is still under renovation and even thought the unit next to us was being worked on, I can honestly say we didn't hear one bit of construction noise. The courtyard has a small but clean pool and whirlpool and a basketball half court. The lobby had fresh cookies and coffee available all day. The fitness center had fresh fruit, water and towels and 3 pieces of high end Life Fitness work out machines each with its own TV as well as weights.

The layout is very peculiar, with exterior (outside) entrances to many rooms. These exterior entrances allowed unobserved access to guest rooms, which is a very poor security risk in this area - a total stranger could walk directly up to my door. Additionally, the layout allows for several unlit potential hiding places for criminal activity. When I arrived to check in, I noticed several rather unsavory-looking characters loitering in the area. I always stay at Marriott, typically Residence Inn for the value and comfort. This is definitely the worst of at least 15 Residence Inns I'm familiar with. My room does not have basic silverware. I'm sure I could get some if I called the front desk, but I shouldn't have to. My neighbors are in an out of their room continually, and my whole room shudders as their door slams. The kitchen is tiny, with a two-burner electric range, instead of the typical four burners.

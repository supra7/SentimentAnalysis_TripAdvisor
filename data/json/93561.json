We liked the hotel overall, but there were also a couple of negatives. Good points: - Great location downtown - easy to get to most things we wanted to do. - Public areas are lovely, including a cool bar that's also really comfortable to relax in, and we really liked the music they played. - The room was nicely decorated, with a comfy bed and good bathroom amenities. - Staff were friendly and helpful in the main. - Continental breakfast included in the room rate was nice (although it was repetitive having exactly the same pastries every morning - varying them would be good). Areas for improvement: - Our room was very hot. No matter what we set the aircon at, it didn't work and the temperature never fell below 26C. In the end we gave up and left it off. We left the windows open when out, but when we closed them the room quickly heated up again. We didn't sleep very well because of the heat, and didn't want to open the windows onto the noisy street. This was February, so would have doubts about staying in summer! - Our room was paid for in advance, and we had a voucher confirming this, but at check-in there was no record of our reservation on the hotel system. This was sorted out quite efficiently, so we were fine with it. At check-out, though, we were billed again for the room. This was rectified again, but it all just seems a bit inefficient for a hotel of this standard.

My enthusiasm has dropped every time Ibhave stayed there. I usually stay at The Carlyle when I can, but sometimes the SoHo area is a better location for work trips. My favorite hotel in SoHo is Mercer, but it could be very pricy. I do like the location of SoHo Grand and I used to love the lobby and the bar that served a seafood platter as well as other platters in the old days (I am not sure when they stopped serving these but they are not there now). The people in the lobby are friendly, but I feel that they have little understanding of how to run a hotel. This time, it was the state of the room that bothered me the most. The first room I got had the dirtiest bathroom I have ever seen! It was just unbelievable! Also, there was a used Durex rubber package under the bed as well as a faulty aircondition unit that made loud sounds. There were issues with the bed also, but the issue with the dirty room turned out to be a nightmare. Trying to correct it went poorly as the person from housekeeping barely touched the really dirty parts of the bathroom (they managed to remover old hairs from the drainage system. Management got my attention the second time around, which led to a visit by a confused \"acting\" manager. She started to tell me that they had no other rooms in my category left and that she could not upgrade me to the next (I was not fishing for an upgrade). She then got my full attention as I gradually got more angry over her total lack of understanding for my rather basic problem! As I had to leave for meetings I did not have time to find another hotel and I had also a friend booked through me at the same hotel on my advice thus giving me more logistical issues (as we both had to find one new hotel). So I gave the hotel another chance. They did not, even on the third attempt, manage to clean the bathroom nor did they give me a new room. This went on until I left the hotel as planned after two nights. I got nothing from the hotel, not even a simple apology! I would not eat the food at a place like this where they can't clean what you see properly - Imagine what goes on in the kitchen. No wonder they have stopped serving shell-fish... In general, I would like to add that these design hotels should learn from the professionals how to run their so called luxury hotels like a normal well run luxury hotel.

However, he said I would not be able to make a reservation at the time as the reservations office is closed... Then through emails, another gentleman named George helped me. He was kind and professional too, except that he was not aware of the 'Weekender Double Upgrade' package's existence initially, until I lead him to the according website. I found their online advertisements of 'Weekender Double Upgrade Package' under 'Special Offers' deceiving and misleading. Once I click 'Book Now' and enter the dates, it lead me to a number of rooms with associated prices; which hints to the idea that it is valid on those dates (I do not know if the next steps prompt the visitor of the unavailability of such a promotion as the rest of the steps don't work at all on the reservations website). If there are no such promotions, then simply they should not put it under your 'Special Offers'. Once I made my complaint George handled the situation well and granted the associated 'Special Offer' by giving a complimentary double upgrade to the room. The room was OK-sized, considering it was in the middle of Soho, New York... I LIKED: - the view of Tribeca, the lighting, - the stylish design, - the complimentary coffee on the floor. I DID NOT LIKE: - finding an opened 'Body Lotion' on the floor in the bathroom, - having stain on the main window (the last guest had obviously liked the view so much s/he put his forehead stick his forehead in the middle of the window, and the housekeeper did not realize it; honest mistake...) - having been charged a fortune for a sub-par breakfast, which was supposed to be complimentary (extended my complaint to George, and he fixed the mistake for us; though we did not even eat the second day's complimentary breakfast there, it was that unimpressive) I have been to Soho Grand Hotel on numerous occasions before and thought of the service and the atmosphere as charming, however never had the chance to stay until this one. It was OK; the lobby and the decor was impressive, and the service was friendly at all times; but for such a pricey stay, I would have expected more attention to detail and a more impressive overall stay to be frank...", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place\u201d", "Author": "Copleton", "ReviewID": "UR122557678", "Content": "Great location for those wishing to partake in the 'Big Apple experience' all the major retail districts are just a short cab ride away and of course, Soho, Nolita etc are right on the door step and only a short stroll away.

One nice touch is that you can ask for a goldish in a bowl, which really improves the mood of the room.

The hotel made a small mistake in the total bill amount and they were supposed to refund us some 20 dollars.

It's an iconic hotel: its interior is designed to pay homage to the cast iron that characterised Soho's lofts and warehouses over the last century, so the lobby staircase is an amazing creation of metal and lights. Some reviewers have said it looks dated, but I hope the hotel keeps it - the interior is about acknowledging the history of the area as well as looking cool. The lobby can also be a bit intimidating: some of the door staff are a bit too cool for school, as are the bar staff (the bar is next to the front desk check-in area - which means it can be loud and dimly lit if you arriving at night, as I did). Rooms can be small, as people have noted, but that applies to many NYC trendy/cool/ boutique hotels. If you want to be sure of getting a decent-sized room, book one in a category such as Deluxe King or Executive King. The rooms are beautifully decorated: luxurious bedding, fantastically comfortable bed and pillows, great leather chair, good curtains and black-out blinds; cute wallpaper in bathrooms, excellent tub, great toiletries (Main & Goetz). Good support services: free local phonecalls, free printing (good if you are there on business, as I was). Staff: the cleaning staff are great, friendly, thorough etc. Front desk: variable: some are pretty unsmiling; others are extremely helpful. When there was a problem with the heating/cooling unit in my room (it started to pump out warm air, despite being set to cooling), they said 'an engineer' would look at it. Twice 'an engineer' apparently came, but all that was done was to set the thermostat lower, which totally failed to have any effect. When I complained that nothing had changed, they moved me to a different room, with an upgrade to compensate for the inconvenience. Room service: avoid, unless you have an unlimited expense account/trust fund. Ludicrously expensive. Nice touch: they will provide a goldfish if you ask. If you're staying on your own, as I was, it's nice to come home to! (You should ask about food for the fish - I discovered that I had to feed the fish, after a few days - the poor thing must have been starving; no-one had provided food for me, but house-keeping did after I asked about it.)

The positives (a short note: I am almost 7 months pregnant and not the easiset guest to service due to ths!): - Really good rate on the internet - we had booked a King; when my husband checked us in, he mentioned that due to his wife being pregnant she was a bit sensitive to noise, so could we please have a quiet room - they reception immediately offered an upgrade to a room on the 15th floor with no noise. What an incredibly nice gesture - fabulous room - absolutely wonderful views, light and airy and very classic and soothing colours and furniture - I loved it. And the bathrooms are very nice as well - beautiful lobby - very Grand! and in general a chic hotel - perfect for urban, creative people, and families alike (I noticed this in particuar given that I am due to have a child myself - and would definately stay here with a child) - wonderful courtyard to enjoy a drink weather permitting - perfect location for a weekend amidst shops and restaurants in Soho - great service - from reception to bellman, to housekeeeping - I did not in any way recognise the reviews. The staff is helpful and sophisticated in any way - without expecting a tip for everything they do - Free internet, all the TV channels in the world, Movies on demand and whatever you can expect of a hotel this standard any negatives: Not really; The only thing I can think of is the minibar prices that seem a bit steep, but normal for NY hotels - and we decided to book a car to the airport through our regular limo service rather than the hotel as the hotel quote for a car was 3 times the price we pay with Carmel Limo in NY (but my guess is that the car service the hotel offers is far more comfortable/luxurious than our regular service - though I would recommend Carmel Limo anytime when needing a car in NY). In regards to minibar: there is a deli across the hotel where you can stock up if you feel prices are a bit too steep for your budget - and I am in general not prone to spend my money on a minibar diet coke at 5 dollars - regardless of where I am. We did not eat at the hotel - but regretted not doing so as the eating areas were georgeous and the room service menu alone looks great At night the hotel bar (both inside and outside) is somewhat lively but not to an extent where it is annoying for guests not wanting to join in - you can easily access your room without being confronted by partygoers at the entrance - and you cant hear any noise from the bars. All in all, an incredible joyful and pleasant stay at Soho Grand - and we are definately coming back.

Grand hotel is very clean, very pet friendly but has average rooms and some unpleasent suprises. For example the business center is actually a room with 5 computers and 1 printer. The printer has the functions of fax and scan which you are not allowed to use. And neither the machine nor you know this. So you can try all day until you give up and ask reception. The lobby of the hotel is in deed a bar&restaurant. So although you are a customer of the hotel, you are not allowed to sit there unless you order something to eat or drink. This is the part actually decreased the value of the hotel in my point of view. I didnt really enjoyed to be kicked out of my hotels lobby because I do not want to drink anything at the moment. America is known for huge sizes, but unlike its name Grand Soho Hotel rooms are ordinary. Maybe this isb normal for New York. I do not have any other New York hotel exprience to compare. The hotel is rustic. Some really enjoy this. I personally do not like it. I prefer more coosy,comforatable and modern design. But it is totally a personal taste, so I'm just telling you to know. The design of the hotel is indeed mostly beautiful and charming. But personally I would enjoy to have a dinner or pass through this kind of a place, not sleeping in it. The A/C is a lot noisy.

(Both times it was my lack of technical skills that lead to the problems with the phone and TV, so hotel is not to blaim for the problems..) Stayed at 11th floor. Room on the small side, with really, really boring furniture. A table and only one chair. Bed was nice enough, we slept well. Bathroom OK, plenty of shelves to leave your stuff, and nice soap, shampoo etc. Nice towels. Bath tub not tempting. Free wireless in the room. Turn-down service. The \"gourmet\" minibar is just a regular minibar... The in-room safe was large enough to also take the computer. The hotel is so dark, dimmed lights in the lobby, elevator etc, but it certainly has a personality. Had breakfast at the hotel just one morning. Expensive and nothing special, although my daugther loved the ricotta pancakes. Service professional, but no outstanding friendliness, I would say. Lot's of restaurants in the area that serves better breakfast at a greater value. For instance; Le Pain Quotidien. And what's the deal with the \"doormen\"? You have to go through two double door to get in, and the doors are quite heavy, at least when you carry lot's of shopping bags. Sometimes they opened one of the doors, but not the next, some times neither of the doors. Very patchy. On check -out we left our luggage in storage for a couple of hours before heading to the airport. The person handling this is really bored and uninspired, no smile. When we picked it up he did't even bother helping us down to the entrance (we did tip!), so again we had to struggle the luggage through the double doors ourselves. When getting a taxi to the airport the \"door\" man (who, again, did not help us with the doors) suggested we take a hotel taxi, as this would be only USD 65, while the yellow cab would charge USD 72 and upwards. This sounded like good deal, but as the tourists we were, we wanted the New York experience of taking the yellow cab, so we opted for that. And guess what, the yellow cab was also USD 65... The location of the hotel is very good both for shopping in Soho, Greenwich village and you can walk to the ferries if you want to see the Statue of liberty and Ellis Island.

I say that because each of the staff treated me more like a member of the family than as a guest at a hotel. The front door/bell stand guys were not only welcoming and professional, they were always eager to help. When I arrived at the hotel at 8PM on a Sunday night and approached the desk, the gentlemen was very nice and when I said \"checking in\", he addressed me by name. [Now stop and think about that one for a second - he was not only expecting me, he had taken the time to know me first - so here I stand in the middle of Manhattan and this guy knows my name. INC-RED-U-LOUS!) Yes, the room was a bit small, but it was clean and beautifully appointed in rich, subtle furnishings. The bed was comfortable - but forget all of that. Let's come back to that remarkable staff. During my brief stay I encountered no less than 10 hotel staff, all who treated me like they were really happy I was there. Example: I step out the front door one afternoon and they are doing a photo shoot of the hotel. The general manager takes me by hand, a block away, and hails a cab for me. When I return to the room later that day, some gifts and a lovely note were in my room. I was embarrassed by the level of service I received and I'm not a cornfield hick by any stretch. I have found my new home in NYC and I am happy to be able to post such a positive review of this establishment. Yes, I saw the negative remarks about the staff before I went and was a bit nervous - BUT - there is a truth to life, you reap what you sow. I hope those reviews mean that the staff have this attitude: \"if you're going to be nasty to us, we're simply going to reflect that back to you.\" Only dislikes: -> The curtains are not \"blackout\" so your room lights up at dawn; -> I could hear the water in the bathroom next door.

For this trip, I decided to try something different and stay downtown. The Soho Grand is ideally located to take advantage of all that Downtown Manhattan has to offer. The Soho neighborhood is one of the most interesting parts of the city, with great shopping and restaurants and within easy walking distance to Lower Manhattan, Tribeca, and Greenwich Village. The vibe is definitely younger and more casual than Midtown, catering more to residents than to tourists. Find a favorite coffee shop, a neighborhood bodega, and a favorite park, and it's easy to imagine yourself actually living in the city for a few days. The Soho Grand's location is its biggest asset. As a hotel experience, it's good but not great. The decor is \"Soho chic\" circa late '90s / early 2000s... very dark, heavy fabrics, \"distressed\" finishes. Tastes have changed, however, and what once was cutting edge now seems unnecessarily gloomy. The hotel is 15 years old; it's time for a refresh. The room was small, but that is to be expected in New York. The bed and bedding were comfortable, and all of the basics were in place. Internet access is free, which was a pleasant surprise. Service was uneven but overall good. Check-in was efficient and friendly. I wasn't impressed by the concierge services, however. The concierges didn't covey much enthusiasm, and their suggestions for dining and entertainment weren't inspired. One thing to be aware of... if you're coming to New York to do a lot of \"touristy\" things (e.g. museums, sightseeing, etc.), you're probably best staying in Midtown. Otherwise, you're going to be spending considerable time on the subway or taking expensive taxi rides.

The check-in was done by a friendly and attentive receptionist. Our room was available straight away. The check-in desk is on the first floor but there are lifts and these were working great and fast during the whole week. I asked for a goldfish to be sent to my room (it's something special they do for people who miss their pets back home). The next morning, I found a big bowl with a cute goldfish (it is fed and cleaned by the staff). The room was a little bit on the small size but considering it is New York City it is reasonable (I have been in smaller rooms). It is elegantly decorated: sleek & modern with a retro feel to it (check the towel rack & sink in the bathroom, very Art Deco). There was a small walk-in closet (with mirrors, it reminded me of the Orient Express) and a sort of tall boy so there was plenty of room to put all our clothes and hide our suitcases in the \"closet\". The bed was not big but it was comfortable. I always find beds too small as I have a king size bed at home, it is hard to go smaller! There was an ipod alarm clock (it charged my ipod nano), a flat tv screen, a dvd player, a phone and an iron/ironing board. The bathroom was small as well but there was a decent bath/shower and space to put your toiletries. The lovely touches were numerous so among those I enjoyed: the most: the goldfish, free wi-fi, free apples, magazines & coffee machines on every floor, the decor (trendy with a retro feel) and my favourite: a decent list of dvds to borrow and watch in your room (complimentary). The staff is extremely efficient (in all categories) without being obstrusive, which means that they were always polite, very helpful and friendly but they keep it professional. It is a trendy hotel but it still manages to exude some class. Spotless rooms, lifts, corridors, clean & tidy housekeeping.

However, the place is really dark and sombre looking - everything is brown and in the lobby and bar areas you cannot see outside so it feels quite claustrophobic. The rooms are also a little cramped (we had a standard room so I guess if you pay more you could get bigger rooms. We were on a highish floor but we were kept awake by traffic and shouting from outside so we didn't sleep that well. Also the heating in the room was impossible to turn down so having spent a couple of nights dehydrated and feeling like dry old prunes we had to ask for a technician only to be told that it was either that or having the heating turned off altogether - which wasn't as bad or as cold as it sounds. As previous reviewers have mentioned, the staff are very friendly, helpful and attractive and the clientele are also stylish and certainly not short of a bob or too so if, like us, you don't dress head to toe in designer gear and are looking for something a little more relaxed then this might not be the place for you. A few other words of warning - you do have to pay for the bottled water that is in your room and we didn't discover this until check out - and I know I am starting to sound really mean but $10 a bottle does seem a liitle on the steep side - we liked the fact that you vcould help yourself to tea, coffee and hot chocolate which are available on each floor off the corridors - but it's not great quality and it's coffee mate not milk?

It's unique in that for a trendy hotel with plenty of high profile guests, we as a family are made to feel very at home by everyone, from the desk clerks and concierge to the doormen (the Grand has the BEST, most charming doormen in the City!). There are far more expensive rooms at other hotels in the City, and the Grand's rooms are small, but I think very reasonably priced for the value. Learn the subway system and you're not only within walking distance of great ethnic restaurants in Little Italy and Chinatown, not to mention fabulous fashion shopping for all ages, but you can be in downtown Manhattan in a matter of minutes for meetings and all that that neighborhood has to offer. I've entertained well-known clients in the hotel's fabulous bar lounge, and even spent Thanksgiving weekend there with just my daughter, enjoying a festive and wonderful feast in the dining room this past season.

At the US government per diem, however (probably 30 percent less than the rack rate), it was excellent. Several reviews I read before my visit suggested that rooms at the Soho Grand were tired looking. That was not a problem. Both the common areas of the hotel and my room looked first-rate. The furnishings in my 6th floor room were all in excellent shape. The decorating scheme was more muted than I would have anticipated. While not as neutral as what one would find in a national chain, it was far less idiosyncratic than what I've encountered in several other similar properties south of Midtown. And there was nothing weird about the room design. The furnishings, however, seemed a bit too large for the room. While the size of the room was not small compared to other New York properties, it did seemed cramped. Two people might find it claustrophobic and someone paying top dollar would find it inadequate. The room lacked a lounging chair because there was simply no room for one. The bed, however, was extremely comfortable -- among the best I have ever encountered. The bathroom (in contrast to the main room area) was spacious and well-designed. There were a few snafus. I could never log on using the supposedly free Wi-Fi. Fortunately, I was able to get a good AT&T cell signal from my room (which is often a problem in Manhattan). TV controls were overly complicated, and the remote control functioned in a non-intuitive manner.

They do not have central AC which is annoying. Bed was small for 2 people and was average as far as comfort of sleep. Bathroom doesn't vent well and steam from shower takes up entire room. Overall, this was an average NYC hotel, but it has potential to be a great property with some renovations to the rooms. We were only here to sleep and shower, so the room was not a big deal to us.

And there were plenty of nice touches - like glasses of champagne at check-in and a lovely black goldfish in our room. The hotel is very stylish, especially the grand reception area and very cool bar/restaurant. The rooms are a really decent size and well laid out with plenty of wardrobe space - which was good for us as we were there for a reasonably long stay and arrived in New York after a week with family for Xmas, so had a lot of luggage. The bathroom was also a decent size - no larger than necessary but enough room so that it didn't feel cramped, and with great toiletries. The only thing I would really change about the rooms is to have tea & coffee makng stuff in the room. There is a tea/coffee machine on each floor, but that means if you want a cup of coffee when you wake up you need to schlep down the corridor to get it which is a bit of a pain. The hotel is in a great location, with all the great restaurants and bars of SoHo on its doorstep and close to several subway stations if you're heading a bit further afield. The hotel bar/restaurant is great for pre-dinner drinks and a relaxed meal, but probably not the best place if you want a full 3 course meal (atmosphere probably a bit too relaxed for that). It's popular with non-guests too. We celebrated NYE there and they put on a great evening for a pretty reasonable price.

It was a super trendy spot where media and entertainment types stayed when visiting NYC. It was the first cool hotel to open downtown. The bar buzzed at night, power breakfasts happened in the lobby, and actors on junkets demanded to stay there. But since then, a variety of hotel options have opened below 14th Street -- The Bowery, The Tribeca Grand, The Mercer, and more. And the Soho Grand has not been updated since it opened. I stayed there recently while in town on business, and moved out after one night. The location is good -- at the intersection of Soho, Chinatown, and Tribeca. But not as good as the above mentioned hotels which are in the middle of neighborhoods, not on the fringes. The rooms are tiny. And when it first opened, you could forgive this as it was truly the only option downtown. But now there are more options with spacious rooms. All the above would be OK if the owners had kept up the hotel. And the lobby is still in good condition (although the decor is dated.) But the rooms are dumps. Mine smelled like cigarette smoke. I was assured by the management that the room had always been non-smoking, but it was clear that a lot of people had smoked in it -- and the carpet/vents hadn't been replaced in ages. With the AC off, the smell of stale smoke held in the air. The AC unit itself was very noisy and uneven. The windows were filthy. The TV (flatscreen) got fuzzy reception as if the cable was illegal. The sheets were scratchy. (Come on, people, even the W hotels have high thread count sheets these days.) The mattress was old, worn, and sunk in towards the middle. I had a restless night's sleep in a sunken bed with scratchy sheets and a loud AC. Woke with a neckache and stuffy nose from the smoke smell. My co-worker who was staying in another room said to me \"What in the world happened to this place?\" He had the same experience. I moved in with a friend for the next night. It felt like the management knows it can't compete with all the nicer hotels that have opened so aren't putting money into the place. Judging from all the Euros on a holiday in the lobby, this is a package hotel. No more cool actors or models here. Our rate was good for NY --$225 a night -- but the room was the same as if we had stayed at Chinatown Holiday Inn. The owners can't improve on the room size but they could: Rip out the old carpets and put wood flooring in the rooms, wash the windows (interior and exterior), brighten up the rooms, upgrade the AC units, get new mattresses and sheets and fumigate. Service was good. Bathrooms were nice and calm (they should used the bathroom as an example of how to make a small space feel comfortable).", "Date": "March 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Astoria, New York", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Stay.\u201d", "Author": "synthdoll", "ReviewID": "UR26151005", "Content": "I stayed at the Grand Soho Hotel during a very busy night, Valentines day.

I'm generally more a fan of the raw and gritty NYC and often choose to stay in hotels like the Chelsea Hotel to avoid too much of the trendy and \"sceney\", but this was just right. Comfort, culture, colorful people. And I found the lounge a great place to take it all in. We stayed in room 1606 with a great skyline view, featuring the Empire State Building.

I go a lot.. and I love staying in SoHo. For my fiance's birthday this year we wanted to go bak to NYC for a special weekend, but wanted to be sure to create new memories & not tamper with the old, spectacular ones from the previous year. So... I booked the SoHo Grand thinking it would be a great location.. and has a good reputation with a fair price. Well- we walked in & were immediately wow'ed by the vintage touches & unique design. We were very impressed. We were given Champagne at check in & the front staff was amazing to accomidate us while they finished preparing our roo (we were in by 10am.) When we got to our room, we found a typical NYC tiny hotel room. Not very impressive- but expected. So we trudgd on... soon after, the smell of cigarette smoke started to come into our room, and we all know that isn't allowed in NYC (*the floor was called Non Smoking). When we called the front desk & they told me they couldn't handle my question, but someone would call me back. An hour & A half later, no call back. We were leaving for dinner so I called again. Same thing-- no one could help me.... but they'd get back to me & I made the kid promise me SOMEONE would call back. When we got back from dinner, our room was SUPER hot & the smell of smoke was enough to keep us from falling asleep. Still no call back from a manager. The next morning I got up & called again.. this time they said they would change our rooms for us \"No problem\"-- after 3 guest calls just to get someone to listen to me? I'd say there's a problem. The manager didn't apologize for the lazy response or offer any discount or any relief for the awful first night we spent @ their hotel. The next room was bigger & the temperature was more comfortable. The mini bar was hot-- so they had to come & change the whole thing out for a different one which took 45 minutes... and still out requested ammenities as prt of their \"Grand Guest\" program had not showed up (Ipod player, newspaper, pet fish fo the weekend... hey- they offered!) When we checked out on Sunday-- no mention again of the room change disruption or \"how was your stay?\" Just took my credit card & said goodbye. When I asked to speak to the manager again about the lack of response to our uncomfortable stay-- she offered little more than the assurance that thir communication as a team was being addressed so it wouldn't happen again-- but nothing for us, the poor saps who endured it for the 2 nights we were in the city @ their hotel. When I got home-- it irritated me more & more. The rooms were not cheap by any means... and frankly I have had much better service & stays at other lower cost hotels in Manhattan. So-- I tried one more time to write a letter to the manager. I penned an email almost identical to this descripion just saying I am in the service industry & if i heard any of my clients had received treatment like this-- I'd want to know about it and make it right with the customer. The manager called me & left a message for me to return his call. I did so-- to get his voice mail. In the message, I stated clearly when I would be availble for him to reach me-- and of course-- NO CALL BACK> I'm sorry but the SoHo Grand dropped the ball bigtime with me.

Again, after several minutes, I called the front desk asking to be transferred to another room so that I could shower. Now, the staff told me that this was neighborhood problem and nothing could be done to correct the problem. The staff then connected me to room service, who after explaining the situation, sent up four glass bottles of ice cold Saratoga water.

The room is very small, but big enough to hold the bed, and dresser, and wardrobe (no closet, a travesty) -- but just barely. The bathroom was a decent size, but not a palace. We did have a queen bed with some awesome Frette linens, but the drapes and blackout blinds were in really sad shape (holey in places). The TV is an HD TV without cable or a HD converter for the over the air signal -- it's possibly the worst image quality I've ever seen in any TV of any kind. But you don't go to NY to watch tv (unless you're a guy)... It has a really good location. It's right next to the 1, 2 stop on Canal St, and just a 5 minute walk to the other Canal St station (6, N, J , Q), so you can go uptown to either the East side or West side really easily. It's also right between Tribeca and SoHo, so you get to be uber chic, or uber uber chic. Excellent noise insulation. We were on the 4th floor, facing Canal St and Tribeca, and we actually faced a club, but couldn't hear anything, which was amazing. The hotel is shaped like a T, so if you're at the base of the T, you might have some noise from the Holland Tunnel, which spits up a block away. If you are a partier, they have a faux-club in the lobby, complete with bouncers. It makes getting to your room a bit hairy at night as there are these big guys in black between you and the elevator who don't really believe that you're staying there (if you look like a grad student, like me). If you're on the 3rd floor, your room might be REALLY noisy because the club and the 3rd floor share an atrium -- there's no wall between them to hold out the noise. Which gets me to the staff. Cleaning staff = got the job done, beautifully. Front desk = efficient, professional, no unexpected charges. Concierge = I don't think they're from NYC because they didn't know some basic things about museums (I wanted to find the Cooper-Hewett Design Museum, which is part of the Smithsonian). The security thugs = for my own good, but really, do you need to be quite that rude? Overall, a great deal for NYC on short notice.", "Date": "August 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cNot what I hoped for\u201d", "Author": "BeforeSunrise", "ReviewID": "UR18610130", "Content": "Let's start with a few positives before getting into why I recommend you stay elsewhere.

In hindsight, he probably enjoyed the night life there and thought the hotel would be as good but never actually experienced the Hotel itself. When I walked in I was impressed by the original architecture and decor. The space has a bit of a \"Blade Runner\" feel to it; decadent-hip-retro-modern if that makes any sense. The check-in process was efficient, the service was nonchalant. The shock came when I entered the room - it was tiny, the decor was out dated and the use of space was completely inefficient. There was not even a spot in the room where you could sit comfortably. The in-room safe was not functional. The bathroom was big enough, but the soap had a strong mint perfume which became overbearing after a while. The water pressure in the shower was good. The next morning there was no newspaper by the door. We went down for breakfast and asked for the morning paper at the front desk and for some reason they made us feel like we were bothering them. We had breakfast in the gorgeous living area by the lobby (the one you see on the web site). The food was good but the service was non-existent. After breakfast, we stopped by the front desk again and mentioned that the safe wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working. They said they would send an 'engineer' right away to fix it, but that i had to be in the room for \"insurance reasons\". After waiting in the room for 45 minutes and 2 calls later, no one had showed up so I gave up and decided to go out and start my day. We only stayed 2 of the planned 4 nights and moved to the Four Seasons hotel. We did enjoy the convenience of the Soho Grand's great location and we did enjoy the night life. However my general impression is that the staff at the Soho Grand doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t receive adequate training and doesn't know how deal with clients and solve simple problems without attitude.", "Date": "July 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Louis", "Title": "\u201cFun weekend\u201d", "Author": "campbesa", "ReviewID": "UR17989239", "Content": "Great hotel - my husband and I were unexpectedly in NYC for 4th of July weekend which is an \"off\" weekend for the city, but we had a great time.

We had much the same expereince. The hotel overall is not guest friendly, is statring to look dated, the rooms are very small and the attitude - even for a so-called \"hip property\" is unaccepable, through the roof. In my opinion, hip is great if it can be backed up with across-the-board service and quality accomodations. The Soho Grand may have been all that a few years ago, but now it's just all flat. Just a few of our disapointments with the hotel on our recent stay. When we booked our room, I specifically told the reservationist that we were bringing our daughter down to the hotel to see the July 4th fireworks. Naturally my first concern was that we'd have a high floor room with a view toward the fireworks. No problem, assured the reservationist. There was a problem. Upon checking into the hotel they only had a higher floor room on the opposite corner of the hotel facing away from the fireworks. Note: After scoping out the surrounding buildings I determined it was highly unlikely any room would have given a view of the Macy's fireworks. By the way, when we checked in and explained this to the front desk clerk he told us we'd be able to see them since they were shot off from around Macys! I didn't have the time or energy at this point to explain that the fireworks are shot off from the East River. This was the second desk clerk to help us, and at least he made an effort. The first one didn't know anything about anything, but she made sure to give free champagne to three people who walked up to the desk while we wre attemptiong to check-in. I eventually asked a third desk clerk if we too, paying customers, might actually be granted the bounty of their kindness with a glass. She instructed clueless clerk # 1 to pour us some. So anyway, that first clerk upon being told of the fireworks-view room didn't even seem to realize it was the Fourth of July. Then she said, rather disinterestedly, that she had no idea if the room had any view. I inquired further if I might have a look at the room, and she said they couldn't allow that since housekeeping was still cleaning. Okay. Then she tells me I should tallk to the concierge. Now, I go from attitude to super attitude. She hands me the phone and the concierge is on the other end. I explain that the front desk connected me to her (though I'm not sure why) and that we were told our room would have view of the fireworks. The concierge is obviosuly mad that the front desk would lay this on her, and I have to somewhat agree (the front desk should know their own rooms), but it didn't call for Super Attitude. Her cocky reponse was \"Are you kidding?\" No I wasn't. I should have cut my losses right there and gone to another hotel, but I had my wife and baby and we were all getting tired. An hour later we checked in to our closet and had a nice view on the wrong side of the hotel. The service throughout the stay was cold, or at the least aloof. And it's not aNew York thing, I lived there for years and have stayed in numerous hotels across the city. This place is just run bad and the physical look of the hotels just shows that they don't care anymore. as oftentimes happens when a new hotel opens (the Tribeca Grand) the better staff make abeline to the newer property. I don't know if that's what's happened here, but I threw away $500 for arotten stay. We ended up trudging downtown in the rain and saw about fifteen minutes of the fireworks. One major exception: Did these guys even work for the same hotel? The guys (part of the bell staff) out front and the man who delivered our bags to the room were top-notch, friendly and professional.

The room wasn't huge but overall the quality of the bed, bedding, bathrobes and bathroom was excellent. *Bathroom wallpaper is very entertaining.

The barman came over twice to say that he was not the person to serve me and my waiter would be with me shortly.

We were greeted by the friendliest doormen I have ever encountered, who continued to be really helpful throughout our stay, recommending bars, restaurants and really going above and beyond the call of duty. The front desk gave us a glass of Champagne on arrival, although they, along with the concierge were a bit aloof and the concierge on two occasions said she would arrange guest list and reservations for us and then booked it under the wrong name. This was eventually sorted but caused delay in getting into the club and restaurant. Overall though it was a great stay. The bar was beautiful, the location was perfect with lots of great shops and restaurants a stones throw away. Plus a few celebrity guests! It is also a pet friendly hotel so you'll spot lots of dogs which we liked but I'd bear in mind if you are allergic.

We'd had drinks at the hotel before, on previous trips, and this time decided to stay here. As others have pointed out, the location is great - bang in the heart of Soho and really easy to walk everywhere, lots of good restaurants nearby, fantastic shopping, everything you want really. The hotel itself wasn't bad - our room was OK, although we were upgraded to a higher floor, twelth I think, on check-in, which I think meant we got a better view than we would have done originally. And the view was pretty impressive - a downtown shot of the Empire state and the skyline. But the room itself was on the small side I thought, although normal for NY I guess - and a bit of a tight squeeze for two in the tiny bathroom, no separate shower, just an overhead. But it was all clean, the bed was comfortable and decor fairly well done out. Didn't feel shabby, as some have mentioned. And I liked the CDs in the room and the free coffee bar on each floor. I think the only slight issue I had was with the bar and lounge area - this is obviously the hotel's key selling point and it does get very busy, but even if you're a guest, you're not guaranteed a seat. We had to be quite firm with the girl holding the clipboard, who decides whether you 'get in' or not, and after being relegated to a tiny table in the corner of the bar one night, we did put our foot down and insist on a table in the more comfy lounge area but it was a bit of a stand off. Slightly annoying, but still. It also gets very busy with parties, so if you want to have drinks, or you're meeting people, I'd definitely suggest booking a table.

Let me say first this is a great location - the journey from the airport is quick, lots of very trendy shopping and nightlife nearby, and well located for subways or taxis uptown. I appreciate that I am older than most of this hotel's clientele, so my head was not turned by the uber trendy bar and restaurant which by all accounts are hugely popular and deservedly so. All I was hoping for was a comfortable room. Our expectations were managed on arrival when we were told that we had the biggest room in the hotel and a wonderful view. (This was actually quite worrying as we thought either we had been allocated the boss's room or he had taken one look and decided not to stay.) What we found was a reasonably spacious room with just about adequate furnishings, though nowhere but the floor to open our bags. The lighting was probably meant to be romantic, but as in many hotels was simply inadequate, and served only to emphasise the decorator's very dark palette. In the morning we discovered the view was of two building sites and an 'interesting' skyline. The bathroom was very cold, no soap until I asked for it, a very violent toilet flush and no proper space for toiletries. The worst thing was the wall socket that tried to escape from the wall each time I unplugged the hairdryer. Room service breakfast was very good as was housekeeping (apart from the soap) and along with a previous reviewer I have to say the cheerful doormen were absolutely wonderful - helpful with directions, calling taxis, always there to open doors and so on, rarer than you might think. Overall I think this hotel is overpriced at $800 a night.

This hotel was booked by the company that flew me out, so fortunately we didn't foot the bill. We had a bad experience from the moment we stepped in the door. We arrived exhausted at around 11pm. The registration is one level up from the ground floor and the concierge on the ground floor was extremely snappy to us when we mistakenly took him for the check-in desk. We then went up to the check-in desk and the two men behind the counter gossiped with each other for a full minute before even acknowledging our presence. Our room was minuscule which we weren't too surprised by, it being New York. But the smallness was exacerbated by the large, unattractive wardrobe that took up half the floor space, and several large and useless pieces of furniture that were obviously meant to be decorative. With a room that tiny I would have appreciated just a simple desk and chair. Once our portable crib was set up we could not walk across the room -- we had to climb over the bed to get from the desk to the bathroom. It was extremely uncomfortable. The bathroom was good-sized and pleasant. Their shampoos and soaps were very nice. What was not nice was the fact that all of the toiletries sitting on the ledge above the sink were covered in shaving cream splatters -- apparently the hotel has splurged on fancy amenities but doesn't change them between guests. But what really made this stay one of the most unpleasant I have had was an experience we had as we returned to the room in the evening. The hotel was hosting a party on one of the upper floors and the elevators were blocked off with a velvet rope. The area was fairly empty, with just two enormous bouncers standing there. We waited for over five minutes for the one remaining elevator to open. My husband (carrying my seven month old daughter) finally tried to enter one of the newly \"private\" elevators and a bouncer bellowed at him \"SIR, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BOARD THAT ELEVATOR!!!\" My husband said \"But I'm a guest at this hotel\" and the bouncer yelled \"I DON'T CARE!\" I actually thought for a second that the bouncer was going to strike my husband -- he was very threatening. This incident reflected the attitude of the entire hotel. You could stand there for forever with an infant trying to get up to your room and the hotel is more interested in catering to a party whose guests haven't even arrived yet. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The service was horrible and nothing about it is particularly nice.

It's also true to say that at times, even the best hotels can disappoint a jet lagged, tired guest. And yes, it's also fair to say that at times, hype can get the best of us. The Mercer was full so I tried my luck at the Soho Grand. My first and last stay at the Soho Grand combined a tiny cookie-cutter room with completely hopeless customer service and a feeling that the hype brings many first timers and few repeat customers - but as they say, \"fools and money....\" Location: Great for Soho, not as good as the Mercer, but most of the commercial fun in Soho and surrounds is within walking distance and travel to the hotel from the aiport is easy. The Checkin: Lets face it, the price of top-line hotel rooms has skyrocketed all over the world in the last four years. In some cases spending the money is a joy and in others you feel completely abused. After negotiating my way through the six porters and doorman all of whom were doing nothing but their hair, I entered through the dim, urban lobby and signed my life away on a room rate of a purely insulting $780 per night - good thing I have two kidneys, one is now for sale... This was only after \"Sascha\" (yes, how typical) had finished her flirtatious interlude with an elderly gentlemen while keeping five guests waiting in line. Conclusion: Checkin is a glamor job fielded by 'trendy', slightly clueless & unprofessional staff who are a touch on the rude side. In short, these guys are glorified cashiers ringing the till and gelling their hair. You get none of the 'chop-chop' and impressive attention to detail from more professional outfits here. The staff want to spot a celebrity so that they're 'with it' everyone else is chopped liver. So having established that the first impression was basically a joke and having my expectation for the room 'managed down' well, we headed upstairs... The Room: Fortuntely there was an area near the ceiling where a piece of rope would have supported my body weight - such was the disappointment. This room looked like somewhere depressed single dudes come to die, or where hookers come to do trade. Cheap, Best Western setup. $780 for a Deluxe King room bought us a (truly) miniscule bathroom, a dirty carpeted floor, a few cheap lamps and bedside tables, a flat screen TV that didn't work, scuffed walls and a very mean little bed. My heart sank as I surveyed the room as I was truly hoping for something special given the great location and price. Strangely, about one quarter of the floor area was taken up a closet like installation which stuck out from the wall, this enroached on the already small room and increased the sense of tight containment - alas I felt like a Soho cockroach in a glass jar. I called down to reception to see if we were given the right room category. After the phone was left on the desk for 3 minutes while the attendant checked (god knows what in that amount of time) I was informed that I had actually been upgraded. Too tired to bother with sarcasm, I hit the shower. Bathroom: Worth a special mention here as a fantastic bathroom can easily make a room and a stay that much more special. In this case, small, cheap & nasty says it all. After 5 seconds in the bathroom I had visions of a mean little hotel baron dressed as the little man with a top hat from Monopoly screaming at his managers 'cut all costs and maximize profits!'. There were no toileteries other than three little bottles of super new age \"we hurt no monkeys making this product\" body gel and shampoo. The toilet seat was off its hinges. No shower cap, no cotton buds, no bath slippers, only 1 little robe, no cotton wool, no comb, none of the regular things you rarely use, but find comfort in being there and make you feel just a litte bit special. On the plus side, the shower over bath had good water pressure - little problem though, if you have a high pressure shower, make sure you have drainage that can cope with it. Sure enough, after 30 seconds, the bathtub was 3/4 full and I was pretending to be a vietnamese farmer wading through monsoonal rice paddies - \"Diddy Mao!\" I called this one down to housekeeping and they informed me that in fact the drainage was fine, it wasn't broken and that it was normal - clearly American Idol was mesmerizing that evening as it seemed no one wanted to work for the guests (If only my Doctor could give me an over the phone checkup like this...) Oh by the way and yes you guessed it, the plastic shower curtain (yes plastic) did cling to my body and ofcourse, there was mould around the edges of it. Rather unfortunately, the power outlets DID have safety switches so dropping the hair dryer into my rice paddy bath did not kill me. Truly a shame by this point. The food: Did not trust the kitchen after seeing dirty knives and forks, very wilted lettuce and tired looking food. In short, unimaginative and awful scrapings from Soho gutters. Enough said. Concierge: A really simple job here. Concierge (yes with the by-now-customary five person queue at his/her desk) points towards the shops \"over yonder\". Anything else forget it. These guys just don't care and don't have a clue compared to switched on concierge desks like The Peninsula in mid town and The Mercer in Soho. Once again for this place, the emphasis on hiring young (and cheap), trendy looking staff comes wayyy ahead of hiring competent people. Conclusion: Checkout said it all to me. Once again a queue of 5 people and a 10 minute wait standing in the lobby. No \"we'll be just a minute\" or \"thanks for waiting, how can I help you\". Far from it. They just took the money and offered very little in return. This place is basically a honey trap; first timers and the curious will go and rarely return. Suckers with no appreciation for what service and quality actually is will surely come back. Value for money was non-existant, staff totally hopeless and too few of them, almost no efficiency, dirty scuffed walls and cheap looking rooms supposedly covered up by an expensive fit out downstairs and trendy kids playing \"hotelier\" for a few years before moving into the media or arts world. Burn this dump to the ground, collect the insurance check and build something that gives guests a feeling of excitment, value and slick prestige. The tradition of Soho has given alot of its sould away to commercialism over the years, the least such commercialism can do then is to honor such a special part of the world by attempting to enchant its guests, not pillage them. Management clearly has alot of work to do here. Oh yes, getting a cab to the airport took 45 minutes despite the six doormen/porters/concierges milling around the outside. Prognosis: Marginally preferable over a park bench and newspapers...I would get more joy smoking bad weed with the $100 bills I used to pay for this place... Where instead: Book the Mercer. Great food, Great location, relliable, big rooms, great bathrooms, smart concierge, smooth checkin/out. Can't go wrong. If The Mercer is full, try Soho House.

We booked two rooms online on a Sunday morning, and showed up at about 7:00 P.M. that evening at the hotel. There was no bell man at the door offering to take our luggage, although this is admittedly a theoretical concern for us on this trip, since we were staying for just one day and had only minimal luggage. But things got worse when we got to the front desk. The person there could find no record of our reservation in the system. He acted like he didn't know what to do, and seemed ready to send us away, but I had my blackberry with me and had the confirmation emails and confirmation numbers for both rooms. I showed him the emails and gave him the confirmation numbers. He still couldn't find the reservations, and seemed unsure what to do. Finally, he asked one of his colleagues, who apparently advised him to call somebody that deals more directly with online booking. Finally, after about 15 minutes of waiting, our reservations were found. Here's what the employee helping us said: \"Well, you do have a reservation.\" Of course, we knew that, because we had our confirmation numbers. I think this person must have been new. He wasn't malicious or rude (at least in my mind); he was clueless, but my wife but ready to jump across the desk at him. If he's new, the hotel should have a big \"trainee\" sign clipped to his lapel, and somebody supervising more carefully what's he's doing. Also, it's not the employee's fault that the online system works so poorly. His problem was the way he dealt with it. Seems to me this would take only minimal training. Maybe the hotel should upgrade its online booking system? If I book a room at 11:00 A.M., and the system hasn't swept it into the hotel reservation system 8 hours later, that seems like software that doesn't work very well. Finally, our room was great. Our only complaint about the room is the TV, which had two, confusing remotes. For reasons that I still can't explain, depending on which remote I used, sometimes the TV would stay on for just a few minutes and then the screen would go dark, although the sound would continue. By experimenting with both remotes, I finally got it to stay on, but I'd have to be there for several more hours to replicate what I did. Again, the room price was good, but for $300 + a night, one expects decent customer service and a TV that works without an instruction manual. The checkout people, concierge and bell/valet people were great on the day we checked out.

Anyway sadly worse was yet to come. We were showed to our Deluxe King room - I was absolutely appalled by the decor! We were paying $400 a night and the decor was that of a midwest Best western! Apparently I was told that $15,000 dollars had been spent on each room and they had tried to evoke the old Soho style - well I dont know who their design agency was but they conned you and had no taste!! There are so many talented interior designers how did they manage to choose a design agancy that totally destroyed the credibility and stylishness of the hotel!! I can imagine old Soho style and what I imagine is industrial, vintage, stylish, slightly quirky, good quality - not cheap, depressing and tasteless. The bathrooms were cute and had nice touches but the bedroom was a mix of shades of muddy brown, faded earthy orange, beige, plaster - yeuk! There were awful patterns all mixed together, brown and orange plaid mixed with swirly brown carpet. The blinds were hessian of some sort that had faded and looked cheap and old. The cupboards were made out of some hideously cheap chip boards and coated and just looked awful. The headrest was out of some kind of faux antiqued leather with studs - it was awful. And dont think this was just one room - they all have the same decor!!! I am so saddened ( I am a designer myself) that what was once a minimal and luxurious hotel has been utterley cheapened by poor qualiy tasteless design - this is not just a matter of differing tastes this is poor quality this is not luxury. We did change room to a corner room and I have to say it had the best view I've had in manhattan - but even so I had to leave I felt depressed and we had agreed to pay $400 on the basis that this would mean a luxurious trip - wrong!! We moved to the London New York - stunning modern art deco design - simply stunning!! But it's high rise and if you dont like big hotels we also stayed at Chambers ( make sure you have a room with a view over w 56th St!! there are big fans at the back not pretty!) - perfect in every way, cosy, stylish etc. During my trip I visited about 12 other hotels and I was surprised at how unimpressive and pricey they all are!! I also loved the new Bowery Hotel - the rooms were divine very Italian-especially the large King rooms with sliding panels that open up the bathroom onto the bedroom, mixed with a bar thats old english hunting lodge glamour!!! - but until they clean up Bowery a bit more I would not feel happy staying there as a single woman.

We didn't need to adjust it throughout our entire stay. It has to be said it is the first time I have returned home and found my bed to be less comfortable than those in the hotel. The Concierge and door men were very friendly and knowledgable assisting in booking restaurant reservations and recommending the best bars in the area. Taxis were always hailed within minutes of our request. Food was of a high quality both for breakfast and lunch (we didn't have the opportunity to sample dinner). The bar was often busy but not uncomfortably so and the business facilities within the hotel were perfect. All in all a very laid back but professional establishment and one I have already recommended to friends and associates as the place to stay when in New York. We will definitely be returning, hopefully for a longer stay in the future.

I arrived *very* early on the day of my check in as I took an over night flight and was expecting to wait for my room as is customary with most hotels. I couldn't have been more pleased when the gentleman (very nice and personable Aussie) at the front desk made an adjustment and assigned me a room that was immediately available. I was thrilled and this act set the tone for my stay. The room was very clean, well appointed and had a great view from both windows. The house keeping service was exceptional: friendly, accommodating and most importantly, I never felt rushed to exit my room for daily cleaning. Every morning the hotel delivered a wonderful continental breakfast of various pastry and muffins as well as coffee and juice. I loved that you get to choose your breakfast arrival time and change your order daily - nice touch! The front desk and concierge were always helpful and friendly when I asked questions about local shops and locales. When I needed to ship some items back to San Francisco and needed the location for a local FedEx, the front desk offered to ship them for me - unbelievable! The only glitch in my entire stay was an errant fire alarm sounded at 3 am for quite some time. I thought a note under my door the following day would have been nice, but I know that may have been expecting too much for a true glitch with their system. My check out was very easy and the doormen and bell hops (bell men, really) arranged a car service to the airport for nearly the price of a Yellow cab. The Soho Grand does it again! Just great!

The Soho Grand was for me a much better choice than the Tribeca Grand. The hotel seemed to have tourists, and business people staying there.

The entrance, lobby, bar and restaurant area are great to look at,unfortunately, they seem to have spent all the refurbishment budget there and forgotten about the rooms. The rooms are small and shabby,when we got in, the curtains were stained and hanging off the curtain rail, everything was scuffed and stained, and it all looked like it'd been cobbled together by the \"Changing Rooms\" team, we called the manager and asked for another room, something newer with less wear and tear,we were curtly informed that these were the new rooms and that was that, no apologies or helpful suggestions. The thing is, that not only was the room tired and dingy, it felt and looked grubby, the cleaning staff is really not up to scratch at all.The bathroom was small but cleanish, although, it looked as if everything had been bought at Ikea and don't expect an American Power shower experience, there is one non-adjustable shower outlet over the bath and a plastic shower curtain - the shower head was covered with black,flaking gunge.The toilet wouldn't flush and we asked if they could send someone up and waited and waited, finally a guy arrived, poked about a bit and said it was fixed, it wasn't-I think it actally worked about one in four times. In fact, don't expect anything above the bare minimum of amenities,there isn't even a chocolate on your pillow or even a complimentary bottle of mineral water.We called down to housekeeping to borrow an adaptor, to charge a phone and were told we couldn't borrow one, but they would sell us one for $10.It all seems really miserly and mean in a hotel that is charging this amount of money- $550 a night + taxes. The doors to the rooms haven't been fitted properly, so every time someone shuts their door, it reverberates all the way down the corridor, it's noisy and there always seemed to be room service trays left along the corridor,the rooms hadn't been double glazed(hello!!!, this is New York- the city that doesn't sleep)so it's really noisy outside as well.. The staff simply acted as if they couldn't care less about their guests, there would be a 20 minute wait to get a waiter to pay enough attention to you so that you could order a cup of coffee and then another 20 minutes to actually get it.I ordered breakfast there one morning and it arrived after a wait and managed to be both cold and burnt - after that we just went out-I didn't want to spend another penny in the hotel. The concierge was rubbish, as well, we asked him to book a table at Pastis for 8:30 pm the next evening, and he said he would,we had no confirmation message, so the next morning we asked if it had been done, Oh! he said, hadn't we got a message?- No, Well they could only do a table at 10:30, so he'd just left it, we asked if he'd called again that day and he looked as if this was a completely new idea to him- he called and got us a table, but we found out when we arrived it wasn't in the restaurant as we'd asked, but the caf\u00c3\u00a9, which is much more tightly packed,so we cancelled and went somewhere else after all. The staff all seemed to be under the mistaken impression that because they work somewhere\"hip\" that this makes them somehow stars themselves and therefore feel they can treat paying guests with condescension and snottiness and a good dollop of New York attitude- all of which you are supposed to be tipping!. I couldn't recommend this as a hotel to stay in, as I said, the common areas are nice, so drop in for a drink at the bar,don't bother with food, everything I had was decidely mediocre.The area is wonderful and if you could get a really good rate and don't mind grubby rooms and lacklustre service, then it might be ok for you. The problem is that the New York hotel industry has been spoilt for far too long,they can keep the prices exorbitant and the service poor and people are still falling over themselves to come; so I guess there's not a lot of incentive to change anything.

I checked in late in the evening, and when I arrived I was promptly greeted out front where my bags were taken and I was directed to the check-in area which was on the 2nd floor. The two gentlemen at the front desk could not have been nicer. I was thankful for the friendly faces and the glass of champagne which was immediately offered to me by one employee while the other took care of checking me in. By the time I had my room key, I was in a much better mood than when I had arrived, and was even offered a refill on the champagne to take up to my room. The bags did take awhile to get up to the room, but I'm not one to just sit and wait, stewing about the delay. Knowing that I was the only person that had checked in recently, I waited about 15 minutes before I telephoned the front desk. I had my bags in 5-minutes with an apology for the delay. The room was nicely appointed, typical New York in that the room was very small, but not a problem. If there was anything I wasn't crazy about, it was the armoire for the clothing. It was made of wood, so when I slid the doors to open it, it was kind of flimsy. The room had a flat panel TV as well as a Bose sound system alarm clock. There was no work desk, which was a bit of a problem for someone traveling for business, but the internet access in the room was wireless so I was able to get comfortable on the bed to work. There was a small, round table in one corner of the roof with a chair which could have been used for work, but I found it to be uncomfortable. I also never did find the in-room safe. Room Service was spotty, and quite expensive, but the expense is to be expected in New York, I suppose. I did have one morning where my breakfast order was promised within 30 minutes, but at 45 minutes I called downstairs and there had been a shift change and the morning person didn't receive the order. I had my order within 10 minutes of my call. The Tomato Basil pizza was very good, everything else I ordered was decent, but not memorable. Housekeeping was fine, not perfect but nothing worth complaining about. They were good about minding the Do Not Disturb sign on the door (not the case in many hotels I've stayed at). Every single staff member I dealt with was professional and accommodating. My room was on the 3rd floor, which I was prepared to complain about having read reviews complaining about noise, etc. I had no such problems. There was only one night in the 2-weeks I was there where sound from the bar could be heard in my room, but it wasn't enough to keep me awake or disturb my work.

That part of the plan worked out well, and we enjoyed a good choice of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance. As for the amenities, the room and bathroom were clean, and as small as you'd expect in most NY hotels- nothing special for the price, and not as attractive as the website photos would suggest. Also as you'd expect, noise from the street, especially on Saturday night when the lobby bar is hopping, is par for the course. We kept the ac unit on to help drown it out. Upon check in, the staff greeted us warmly, and provided cool washcloths and champagne to refresh us. We were given a room on the 5th floor and were readily accommodated when we asked to be moved higher (due to the noise factor). The bellman, doormen, and bar staff were all pleasant. If this was the sum of our experience, we would probably tell people wanting to stay in SoHo that this place was fine, but that we would try one of the other main hotels in the area (Tribeca Grand or 60 Thompson) before returning. Sadly, that was not the sum total of our experience. A hotel of this class typically provides a first class concierge service. That was not the case for us, and we urge guests to double check any reservation they make directly with the venue. We spoke with one concierge on Thursday, the day before our arrival, who arranged tickets for us to see Oscar Peterson at Birdland on Sunday night. For non-jazz fans, Oscar is a huge name, sure to sell out each of his rare performances. The concierge was very helpful through a series of calls as we made the booking. He took our credit card number to finalize the reservation, then called me back to confirm it had been done. He also made a second reservation at The Blue Note for Friday evening, which he said could be cancelled. When we arrived on Friday, we spoke with a different concierge, again very helpful. We asked him to cancel the Blue Note reservation and to suggest and book a restaurant instead. When we came downstairs that evening and asked for directions to the restaurant, a third concierge told us we had reservations at the Blue Note, and none for dinner. While we waited, she cancelled the Blue Note and called the restaurant, which fortunately had room for us. Concerned about the mix up, we asked her to re-confirm our booking at Birdland. She checked and said it was all arranged. At the restaurant, we received a dessert compliments of the SoHo Grand. When we arrived at Birdland on Sunday, we found that there was no reservation under our name, the SoHo Grand, or any of the concierge's names, and no reservations were available. We called the hotel and asked to speak with the manager, who passed us on to yet another concierge who kept us on hold while trying to figure out what happened. We finally hung up after about 10 minutes. When we got back to the room, there was an apology note, strawberries and wine, but no explanation as to what happened or why, no adjustment to the bill, and no further comment when we checked out the next morning. In the end, everything worked out for us. We were not charged for the Blue Note. We had a great meal at the recommended restaurant. We got to see Oscar thanks to a compassionate Birdland hostess.

Most hotels, as you know, will take every opportunity to charge you for anything, and we've become accustomed to this, especially when we need a crib in the room (this averages about $40 per stay, in our experience). I am delighted to report that not only does the Soho Grand have a complimentary program for people with babies, which includes a crib and baby toiletries, everything else was wonderful as well. We joined the Grand Guest program, which gives you 10% off your room and a welcome ammenity. We choose the fruit and cheese basket, which was a lovely and ample treat. We also booked the Seduction in Soho package (there are many other packages available), which included 2 cocktails (at $12-18 a cocktail, this was quite a nice surprise), late checkout, early check-in, chocolates, glasses of champagne, and a full American breakfast for two. Freebies are often subpar, but not here. Our breakfast was delicious - the eggs were fluffy and the scones buttery. The staff were accomodating without being fawning, and were very helpful from the get-go. A doorman pointed out a free parking spot on the block, though he could've easily hawked the hotel's $45 parking. Our baby spit up on the sheets in the middle of the night, and someone cheerfully came and changed the sheets for us. When I didn't have change for a room service tip, the server was very gracious and said that these things happen and told me not to worry about it. Of course, that made me want to hunt him down and tip him even more once I got change, which we did! I have nothing bad to say about this hotel and wholeheartedly recommend it.

I had had a mixed experience on a previous stay but because I needed to stay in the area again, I decided to give the Soho Grand another try. Upon arrival I had prompt, friendly service at the front desk. It then took over 45 minutes of waiting and a phone call on my part to get my luggage brought up. On the positive side, my room was very clean, well soundproofed, and offered a stunning view of Manhattan. Housekeeping service was good and responsive to my needs. On a less positive note, some of the furnishings are in poor, shabby condition and there is clearly no thorough checking of rooms prior to their occupancy. On a previous stay I had a defective TV set. This time, the TV set was fine but the floor lamp did not work, as its light switch was very visibly broken. It was replaced to my satisfaction. The in-room telephone was also defective. Every single attempt to call either guest services or room service would result in interrupted connections -- that is, when I managed to get a dial tone. I requested that my in-room phone be checked and replaced if need be. I don't know whether it was. If so, the second phone also had problems. My last call, to request luggage pick-up as I was checking out, was cut off (as usual). On my second try, the staff member at the front desk told me that the line was not functioning well that morning. Since it had not functioned well for the past six days, I was sadly not surprised.By the way, that request to have my luggage picked up was not followed through. I had to call yet again twenty minutes later, at a time where the hotel did not appear to be particularly swamped with arriving or departing guests. The room service staff was prompt and courteous. However, not once in six mornings did the room service tray include a plate (never mind two) for us to eat, say, the pastries from the continental breakfast. I was disappointed by the room service menu. I found it, like the hotel itself, heavy on concept and light on satisfaction. The good-quality deli across the street from the hotel became, by default, my daily source for more appealing options. The doormen were helpful, friendly, professional. But they didn't make up for the various annoyances that popped up during the stay and that pointed to a lack of true attention to detail.

First of all it is important to take everything into perspective. We are talking about New York City. Rooms are expensive and small, and a view is usually non-existant. So, for me personally, what makes a good hotel is the rooms, comfortable beds and living space, friendly staff, great location, and good amenities. The Soho Grand has all those things. The rooms are average small but definately comfortable. The way the furnishings are placed definately makes the room appear and feel larger than it is. Beds were extremely comfortable with down pillows and fluffy duvets, plasma TV;'s are a nice touch, bathroom was also small but very well laid out. The rooms felt new and fresh to me. Good airconditioning and the window also opened if you prefered. Only had a pedestal sink but there was also a shelf and table in the bathroom to allow you to lay out your things comfortably while you get ready. Showers were marvelous - great pressure and nice and hot. Tons of towels. Yes it is true that there isn't a coffee maker in your room (although the in-room bar is very nicely stocked with a nice assortment of drinks and goodies) but there is a marvelous machine on every floor that made good coffee, hot chocolate, water for tea, etc. I was very comfortable strolling over in my PJ's or robe - never saw anyone anyways (regadless of where you room is, couldn't be more than 30 steps or less). Complimentary continental breakfast was a nice touch each morning - fantastic pastries and coissants. Hotel amenities were perfect for us. Fantastic lounge and restaurant. Very cool and chic - a bit on the expensive side, but the quality is good. Service was fantastic - from the front desk, to the conscierge, to the cleaning staff (turndown service was very nice also), to room service....everything was quick and everyone was extremely polite. The location was superb!!!! We had had enough of uptown and midtown, so this time we decided to stay in soho so we could spend our limited time in the great neighbourhoods of soho, grenwich, etc. This hotel is in the BEST location!!!! Right on West Broadway. Within 50 steps you have amazing restaurants and shops at your disposal. Oh yeah, forgot to mention - taxi fares from Laguardia airport to hotel were also a nice surprise. To the hotel was only $24.00 and from hotel back to airport was $33.00 (we got stuck in traffic) - much less than the other fares that I have been reading. Taxi fares uptown to Rockefeller Centre/Saks/Lord and Taylor/5th Avenue Shopping approximately $10.00. We definately recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a boutique style experience in a hip, cool and relaxed area of soho and greenwich area. We definately would and are going to come back again.

If you were not leaving a tip for storing your luggage, two of them would stop to reply to you!; \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The climax of this journey came when I tried to take a picture of the totally empty lobby on the ground level, as I was waiting for my friends. A woman showed up and said they had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no photo policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I saw tourists taking pictures for days, the concierge never said a word, but this arrogant woman decided I could not (was it because I was carrying an expensive camera around my neck ?!). Not only was she looking at me with superiority - although I suspect she could not really afford to spend the $1800 we left there over a few days, but she asked a security guard to repeat the message to me!!! Absolutely unheard of!!! In fact, I could only advise them to have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no photo policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the rooms but not the lobby.", "Date": "April 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cgreat stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4996725", "Content": "Had a nice stay at the Soho Grand.

And why dripping with attitude? I suspect not one of them could have afforded to shell out the $600/night the hotel was taking off of us. Also like many of the other reviewers, our bathroom was not very clean, the water pressure was feeble at best, the shower drain ineffectual, and we were chronically undersupplied with toilet paper and tissues. Believe me, there are a number of circumstances under which it is less than pleasant to have to call the front desk for toilet paper! One final note - we arrived from a long transatlantic flight and, as another reviewer complained, we spent 20mins just trying to find the check-in desk. They could have shelled out $50 of the $2400 we gave them to put up a sign directing guests upstairs. If this hotel charged $200-250/night I wouldn't be writing this negative review.

Recently relatives came to town for New Year's Eve and chose to stay at the Soho Grand. I was delighted as it was a hotel I pass often and read about but had never actually been in it for any reason. My relatives invited me and my spouse to join them for New Year's Eve celebrations at the hotel. Sounds like a fun, right? WRONG. We arrived at the hotel at the appointed time and were immediately sent to stand in a line to get wrist bands. I don't know about you, but the last time I had to wear a wrist band to get in and out of a function was in high school. Think up something a little more elegant, Grand, come on. Next, we passed through three different checks to get to the table. There were bouncers everywhere. If you can't control the crowd in your hotel, then perhaps you shouldn't offer the party. It was bizaar and again, not elegant. The cost of $200 pp included an \"open bar\" and I will say, that any drink you could order was available. The problem was finding the waiter to be able to order. Easy to offer an open bar if you don't take drink orders, huh? I will praise the chef. The food was very good. There were some problems with the buffet set-up and trying to keep warm foods warm but overall, I must say the food was well done, original and a good variety. Again, we had to stand in line. Seems the Soho Grand likes the Disney approach to dealing with guests. Next, the entertainment. The entertainment for the evening's event consisted of blaring recorded music, a TV screen mounted in the dining room (no, I'm not kidding) tuned to Times Square's festivities. I guess to allow the guests at the Soho Grand to live vicariously through the group at Times Square. In the dining room one large table consisted of a family of ten people. This family group included two children under the age of 10. It was really fun having the kids blow their horns in our ears. As the evening went on, there was less and less evidence of any wait staff tending the dining room. We had to go to physically find the waiter to get some champagne poured for the New Year's toast. That's just my personal experience with the Soho Grand. My relative, instead has told me that when the hotel was informed of the problems we encountered at the party, the hotel apolgized and offered a free upgrade to a suite on their next visit. The coulple were already staying in a suite. There seemed to be little if any concern about the dissatisfaction of these guests.

We decided Soho would be a fun spot with Greenwich Village and Tribeca being within walking distance. I did read a lot of negativity on this website about the Soho Grand, but thought if we paid for one of their upscale rooms, it would still be a pleasant experience. I requested a north-facing room so we could see the Empire State Building, as high up as possible. We got an east-facing room (nothing view-wise) on the 14th floor (16th is the penthouse suites). When I made the reservation, the person in reservations was trying very hard to sell me on their weekend package, saying, \"You might as well do it because it doesn't cost you anything extra. You get 2 free drink coupons, champagne upon arrival, 2 free breakfast coupons, early check-in and late check-out.\" I don't understand why the big sell...we had to practically beg to get these things. They have certain times they give the champagne, and we arrived too late for it. When they gave us our room keys upon check-in, there was no drink coupons or breakfast coupons in our arrival envelope. We arrived too late for the early check-in and we would be checking out late to catch our flight, so we couldn't benefit from that either. When we entered our room, it absolutely wreaked of stale cigarette smoke. It was late when we got there, so we decided to stay in the room and have them move us in the morning. I called the front desk first thing in the morning to complain, and they said they'd call me right back. It was that evening before they called back to tell us they didn't have any other non-smoking rooms at the room level we wanted, but they'd be happy to move us down a few floors to their least expensive (SMALL!) room. (After reading how ultra-small the rooms were, we reserved a larger room--which was quite suitable in size for 2 people. We kept the room because of the size, but in hindsight, should have moved. The smoke smell gave me a dull headache every morning and all my clothes wreaked of cigarette smoke.) We stayed 3 nights, and by 11pm on the 2nd night, we still had not received anything that came in the \"package\" I bought. I called the front desk to vent the fact our room stunk so badly and that we still had not received our freebies, plus we didn't get a turn-down service that night. The front desk manager said, \"Oh, we don't do turn-down service unless you request it.\" I couldn't believe my ears. For the price we paid, it didn't include turn-down service? When I complained of not receiving any of the things from our package, she said, \"Yes, I see. You have a very valid complaint. I'm sorry your room stinks, but we turned that whole floor into a non-smoking floor and didn't give it time to air out. You're not the first person to complain.\" Okay, at this point, I'm furious because she's not offering any solutions until I asked her directly, \"So what are you going to do about all these problems?\" She had everything from our \"package\" delivered to our room 15 minutes later. She offered to spray our room with something to disguise the smell, but I declined the offer fearing we'd be smelling floral mixed with stale smoke. The only thing this hotel has going for it is location. During our 3-night stay, we never saw any employees that looked like they were over 35 years old. This was odd to us. All the doormen, front desk employees, waiters, waitresses, they all were very young--early 20's to mid-30's. I felt like these employees did not have the years of experience to know how to treat their guests. They were all a little aloof. (No, I didn't chalk it up as \"NYC attitude,\" I chalked it up to poor training.) Just off the front desk is their lounge. It was a comfortable place to sit for a drink, but they kept loud synthesized music going non-stop from the afternoon through the night. I guess at 45 years old, I'm too old to appreciate canned, synthesized music. It seemed like a desperate attempt to be \"hip.\" I'm interested in knowing who their client base is, because I can't see the young \"hip\" 20-ish people who were hanging out in the bar actually spending $500/night for a room. Apparently, the hotel is trying to appeal to that age group. During our weekend, my husband and I popped into a few hotels to check them out for future reference.

I've also stayed in 60 Thompson, and I would have to say that the SoHo Grand just beats it.", "Date": "June 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbia, SC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Property and Staff\u201d", "Author": "creto", "ReviewID": "UR3504966", "Content": "I've stayed at a number of hotels in different parts of Manhattan, and I have to say that the Soho Grand is one of my favorites. First off, I need to disclose that I booked the hotel through an online service about two weeks before our visit (May 13-16), and got a Grand King room for what I considered to be a great deal. I'd never stayed at the Soho Grand, and I was a bit skeptical after reading some recent reviews, but I was intrigued and wanted to stay in SoHo. Check-in: We arrived at 10:00 a.m. and were greeted by a friendly bellman who took our luggage and directed us to the second floor lobby, where we were met by a smiling, enthusiastic front desk staff - nothing like I had expected after reading some of the previous reviews. I was ready for \"attitude.\" We even joked around a little about that! Since check-in time isn't until 3:00 p.m., they were happy to keep our luggage, and upon returning later that afternoon, the formal check-in was quick and again friendly, and we were offered a glass of champagne - a nice touch. Once we got into the room, our luggage arrived within 20 minutes. The Hotel: Very clean and modern, and as some have described it, \"industrial chic.\" It's not elegant, but really cool and, I suppose, \"trendy,\" but the people staying there looked pretty down to earth to me, although I didn't see a lot of typical tourists or families, which is a big plus in my book. This isn't a hotel for families wanting to do the typical New York thing. The Room: Many reviewers have commented on the size of the rooms, but our room was no smaller than any other room I've stayed in in New York (I've stayed in much smaller). There was plenty of room to move about comfortably for two people. True, there are no drawers to put your clothes in, but when I travel I never really unpack anyway - I just live out of my suitcase, so that wasn't a problem for me. There was a space to hang clothes, which was good. We returned from a late night in the neighborhood on Saturday night, and the bar area was cranking, but we weren't bothered by any noise (we were on the 5th floor). The Bathroom: Great water pressure. Shower drained just fine. Plenty of towels. Very clean. Restaurant/Bar: We didn't use either, so I can't comment. Location: As others have mentioned, the location is excellent. You are within easy walking distance of Chinatown, the Village, and great shops, restaurants, and bars in SoHo. Shout out to the great people at Toad Hall just around the corner on Grand St.! Check-out: The 12:00 check-out time was inconvenient for us, so we asked them if we could check out an hour later, and they said it was no problem. Check-out was easy; you just do it on the TV in your room. Overall: We loved the Soho Grand. The hotel is not without its quirks, but they are so relatively minor that I don't want to mention them here (some other reviewers have covered them). All of the staff that we came in contact with were very friendly and helpful. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dote on you, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I like. I'm not sure that I'd pay their regular rates to stay there again, but if I were given a similar deal as I got this time, I'd take it in a heartbeat.", "Date": "May 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cOnly if Location is Most Important\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3477364", "Content": "If you must, must be in SoHo, and do not require any real value for the money you spend, then SoHo Grand is the hotel for you.

The service, I can't really comment on, since I neither required nor received any services out of the ordinary. I can say, however, that this is the first hotel I've stayed in where I never once saw the hotel staff opening the lobby doors for its guests. Unless a you're a tourist who absolutely needs to be steps away from the commercial district of SoHo (which, by the way, has become really downmarket and icky in places), go elsewhere. Even if you are, you may want to venture beyond this immediate neighborhood, which on weekends becomes a mob scene, what with hordes of people from NJ flooding the sidewalks so there's barely any room to walk on.

We read the mixed reviews on this site prior to booking, but made the decision to stay there anyway - and we were not disappointed. It's one of those hotels you either love or hate: with a real industrial chic feel - it's not for eveyone. Our room (a superior queen) was nice with fab toiletries, and we had no problems with the hotel staff, who were all pretty friendly. (If you want staff who are tripping over themselves to help you, then maybe you should try the Waldorf!). This place is for the young and young at heart and the conservative traditional type who their want every whim tended to. It's full of trendy people (albeit sometimes a little pretentious and noisy), but we had a blast. You can even have a fish for company during your stay. And we saw Ben Stiller (he's tiny!\") We spent very little time there and so for that reason only (and maybe the fact that I'd have liked black out blinds in the room), should we have considered staying somewhere cheaper. Soho itself is great - downtown Manhattan at its best, with endless boutiques, coffee bars, delis, restaurants etc to choose from. You need at least a week to get through them all!

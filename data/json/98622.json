The door to the bathroom had obviously been kicked-in at some point, as the door frame was nailed back together and \"hidden\" with white caulking.

It was a great location for my client, so it was a very good fit. Pro: The staff here is OUTSTANDING. From Donna Bolts (Sales Manager) to Anna who worked the breakfast area in the morning, the service was very, very good. The property was clean, the gym was good, and the buffet in the morning and snacks and soda in the evening were great. Con: This is not a particularly nice area, but there are some convenient places nearby: food (lots of good mid-range/chain restaurants), movie theater, etc. If you go past the movie theater (on the left) you quickly start running into strip clubs, massage parlors and the like. Not good. I would recommend this hotel for anyone doing business in the medical center area (harry hines).

There are food and drinks every week day from 5-7pm. Most days the food is simple with one hot appetizer, chips, crackers, and snack mix. On Tuesdays, they have a dinner entree and salad. Drinks include beer, wine, and soda. Plus, they have the usual Otis Spunkmeyer cookies at the front desk. The staff were all friendly and helpful. I stayed there for 2 1/2 weeks and the front desk staff remembered me after the first week. I took the shuttle every day and all the shuttle drivers were friendly too. Shuttle pick-up was very prompt and I never had to wait long. I think you can take the hotel shuttle anywhere within a 2-mile radius of the hotel. The only problem is that the shuttle does not run on the weekends. Your other transportation options from DAL airport include the SuperShuttle or taxi which is around $20 with tip. The suites I stayed in had the bathroom separating the bedroom and living area making it feel like a 1-bedroom suite. I stayed in 3 different suites like that so I assume most of the suites are situated in that fashion. The rooms were neat and clean. I never had an issue with water pressure or hot water. The only thing I didn't like about the room was that there was no digital temperature setting. You have to manually adjust the air settings in your bedroom. The gym was a little bigger and had more equipment than other Springhill ones. There were 2 elevators for the 3-story hotel. One located next to the hotel entrance and one located in the middle of the hotel which I thought was pretty helpful.", "Date": "February 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "katy, tx", "Title": "\u201cOK hotel, terrible part of town\u201d", "Author": "kmkt", "ReviewID": "UR20125970", "Content": "We stayed in this SHSuites a couple of months ago and I was very disappointed.

Also, the hotel was having a meeting on Saturday morning and hundreds of people were in the breakfast area waiting to attend the meeting in the hotel. They were just hanging out as the hotel guests tried to eat their breakfast, management should have had them wait in the meeting room not hanging out in the breakfast eating area.

The best part of the stay was the kitchenette, it had a full size refrigerator, stovetop, microwave, coffee maker and toaster. It didn't have any forks and we needed to rewash everything before we used it. The freezer had a bad odor. The concept of Homestead was good, but the housekeeping was terrible. Overall the room was filthy. To make things better they need king sized beds at least for couples, a good hosekeeping staff and to pay attention to details. It would not be my choice again.

I am not the kind of person to go online and write a negative review, but I made an exception for this place. I could not believe how terrible my experience was there. Let me tell you why to STAY AWAY. I recently had to quickly relocate to Memphis for a job. I found this place online and it seemed okay... WRONG. I woke up after my first night there at 3 am and my back and neck were covered in BED BUG BITES. I know that they were bed bugs because I have been bit before and have an allergy to them (Severe itching and irritation, red rash, swelling). Not to mention that when I had woke up in the middle of the night I saw one one myself, flicked it off and then flung my sheets off... then proceeded to spend the rest of the night in the bathroom... NOT COOL. Now, being the laid back, easy going person that I am, I went to the office as soon as I could to let them know of the problem and get a different room. I told them that I wanted a new room and that my room was infested with bed bugs and it needed to be quarantined. The manager over heard me saying this and stepped out to tell me to, \"keep it down and not make accusations that aren't necessarily true\"... WTF. I showed him some of the bites and told him that I actually saw the bed bugs, but he was too worried about control damage control and preventing any other people in the lobby from hearing about the fact that they had bed bugs to give two craps about customer service. After much persuading he told me he would, \"investigate it further\". I am not one to get mad, however, when I wake up at 3 am covered in bed bug bites and then tell the management about it and basically get called a liar and then mocks me, I tend to feel more than a little bit PO'd. Moral of this story... MANAGEMENT SUUUUCKS. DO NOT STAY HERE. The only decent thing about this hotel is the location. It's in a fairly safe area and there is a good selection of places to eat and shop.

When my 7 year old daughter and myself opened the door to the room we were hit in the face with the smell of stale fried fish. The room reaked of the fish odor. I immediately went back to the front desk and asked if they had air freshener or another room. I was told that there were no other rooms and that they would bring some air freshener. They brought the air freshener and sprayed and then offered to bring a machine to pull the smell out of the room if I was going to go out for dinner. I was told the machine would pull the smell out and that it would only take 30 minutes to do this. We left and were gone over 2 hours and when we returned the smell was worse because the air had been turned off in the room. I returned to the front desk and the second manager said she would see if they could find the machine to pull the smell out. This was supposed to be done while I was gone. The second manager came to the room and smelled the fish and said that she would move us to another room. Keep in mind I was told in the beginning that they didn't have any other rooms. We were moved to a second room on the other side of the building and the very end of the hall. This room didn't smell, it did have a few gnats flying around in the room , there was hair from a previous tenant visable in the tub and the bathtub in this room as well as he first room, had some kind of rust looking stains in the tub, there was mold and mildew around the wall of the tub in both rooms and the water took about twenty minutes to drain from the tub.

If you like anything softer than hard concrete, stay away. If they offered softer beds, then I would concider a stay here again, but not until the beds are changed.

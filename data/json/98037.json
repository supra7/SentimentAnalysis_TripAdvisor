First they said they had no rooms for $29 (even through the sign said $29) so I paid $39. I went to my room it was ok till I turned on the lights\u2026well the 2 lights that worked. Bed had hair in it there were burn marks all over the carpet the bathroom light would not stay on the toilet did not flush and had a present in it from the last guest. The hall to get to the room was covered in mold and the lobby was about 20 degrees. Went to the desk to ask for another room and on the way there was told by an older blond I could have a good time for $25 at this point the room and her combined would not have been worth $25( noticed 3 other working girls). Asked the desk person for a new room was told they did not have one (keep in mind there were only 4 cars in the dark lot). So I asked for my money back and was told simply \u201cno\u201d.

I am female and I was there to visit a friend. I found out that the owners of this hotel also own a trucking company (Nationwide Carriers) and they run the trucking company out of the hotel. I saw a ton of 18-wheelers around back. That is why their parking lot is full of potholes. When I was there, I was walking out the front door and two nasty, dirty truck drivers approached me and said that they have a community room (I think it is room 146 if my memory serves me correctly) and I look like I like to have fun and asked me to come to their rooms. I was scared, and I lied and said I was waiting on my husband to come to the lobby. The truck drivers said they stay in the hotel for free because it is their home office for their company and they love to have fun. This hotel is also lurking with prostitutes, who know about the trucker room. You can see these women walking around the halls and the management is aware, but they don't care. They allow these women to come into their establishment to \"please their drivers\". I am a family oriented person, and I did realize such things existed. All the other negative comments about the rooms are correct, from holes in the ceiling to one of the hallway walls completely exposed to the outside world. It is not safe, and after one night I was out of there. I am writing this review to warn people about the dangers they are in with these horny, nasty truck driver's they have lurking around the place. One truck driver said to me they are bored cause they don't have a car and their boss won't let them drive the big truck, so all they do is walk the halls looking for a \"good time.\" Everyone - beware! Oh yeah, and the black lady at the counter is VERY RUDE, and the Indian guy that was there the next morning was acting and talking like he was a rapper, and he was rude.

The worst towel provided ever - only two medium size were provided for 2 adults. they were smelly and the color were gray and yellow, but I assumed these were originally white. The cold shower - the water coming out from the pipe felt not clean. The bed - cigarette burns and smell. We asked for non-smoking room, yet, there was an ashtray...

Every 5 minutes I woke up due to airplanes and car/trucks! The NOISE from others staying and working here - Wow, the entire night someone was walking, talking, laughing and yes fighting. Another reason I woke up every 5 minutes. The breakfast - we were told that there would be a complementary full-service breakfast incl. eggs, bacon, hasbrown, toast etc. No, no, no! The woman at the breakfast room told us that they had no gas. She did not even give us toast, but she tried to sell us banana for $1.50.

One man who wanted to use the PC (yes, there is one PC for the internet access) for more than 15 min limit. He started cursing a receptionist and others who were waiting for the PC.

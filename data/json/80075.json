The room we had was on the 4th floor and was spotlessly clean and didnt seem any more outdated than any of the other inner city hotels i have stayed in all across the world! Also for the noise people complain about, it was also just the same as any other inner city hotel as not all guests are as considerate as we would like them to be. We didnt eat at the hotel because we were too busy in other parts of the city but the japanese restaurant was busy every evening and smelt absolutely delightful.

They are a little on the small side, but for the cost I paid ($90 per night including taxes), I was more than happy. The location is fantastic - Times Square is literally right around the corner (a 1 minute walk) and the blue and red metro lines are both located less than 20 metres from the hotel door. It is a great central spot where you are equal distance from downtown and uptown Manhattan. I also found the reception desk very helpful - they offered me a map when I arrived, took my bags to and from the taxi and were generally very pleasant to deal with. Two small issues: the heating in my room was a little inconsistent and I did have to place a call to reception to investigate the problem. However this was fixed within half and hour. The rooms also do not have wifi, however there is a Starbucks 1 block away with free wifi access. When I return to Manhattan, I will definitely stay at the Amsterdam Court.

The toilet ran non stop so we finally turned the water off ourselves, the tub could not drain (making showers disgusting), the pipes rattled powerfully while the water ran, and the shower head was broken so it felt like a fire hose was pounding the shower wall while a second hose blasted the curtain. Upon complaining the next am, we were put in a different room... a significantly better & nicer room. Turns out this second room was the kind we were supposed to get the first night. I cannot understand why we were given an inferior room, especially since I called 2x that morning to confirm our arrival. Our hopes for a better night were not met when the \"superior\" rooms' toilet flooded beyond the bathroom, and we were woken numerous times from hourly banging on pipes (faulty heat system???) and horn honking from the street SIX floors below.

The deli 30 feet from the hotel sells omelets, home fries and toast for FOUR BUCKS! - Moving on: The door guys are chatting away with the front desk and on their cell phone when they could be opening the door for people coming in from the rain. The cleaning lady with the red hair was sweet but could use a refresher on work mannerisms like not having an argument in the hall way where the guests can hear her. The tallest front desk guy tries to get an attitude and doesn't go the extra mile unlike Liza Ovalle! Liza is one of the only reasons why I would come back. Liza displayed quality in her performance and gave me first class customer service. Since the moment I arrived she knew me by name and was always very sweet and welcoming (so where the other girls). There was something that came up that I won't even get into because I'm not a complete a.h. - Without hesitation Liza took care of it. She is an asset to the hotel and I really hope she is recognized for setting herself apart from the rest in a positive way.

We went down to the front desk and they said there was no manager in the hotel. What kind of hotel in a major city does not have a manager on duty on a Saturday. What the ...... They assured us that the housekeeping manager would go right up there so we went out to explore the city. When we returned 3 hours later the hair was still there. On to my room. Although there was no hair decorations the heat just about killed us and there was no way to control the 200 year old radiator. I had the run the A/C at full blast and it was still too hot. There were sharp springs sticking out of the side of my mattress which we scratched ourselves on several times. Since there was no manager in the building at any time there seemed no point in complaining. The last straw was after the incredibly lame breakfast we returned to our room on the third floor and the maid was in the hall smoking butts. It smelled so bad and looked so incredibley tacky I was appalled that my 10 year old daughter had to see this. This was obviously a scam the hotel pulled through Groupon to cash in and it makes me sick that I spent my hard earned money on a weekend away that we rarely can afford on this DUMP.

Fearful this would happen to us, it certainly did and to 5 people total that night. Our experience was shady at the least and an unsuccessful scam attempt because we watched and listened to every move. Our front desk attendant, Natalie Garcia, was the epitome of poor customer service at the mercy of her management to scam customers into paying full price for a room. We booked through booking.com. Natalie said they couldn't find the reservation in the system. About 30 minutes later, it appeared but the dates they had were incorrect ( one night off). I confirmed the correct dates shown in my Droid email confirmation. That should have stopped right here and we should have checked into our room. Then we had to wait while they called booking.com to discuss. Booking.com wanted to fax a correction but THE FAX WAS BROKEN! Booking.com then offered to email the new reservation to the hotel email. Natalie then provided her personal gmail account to receive the email. When questioned she didn't see anything wrong with this. she was aslo going to take another customers information home to fax to England bc the fax was broken! Are you kidding me! Natalie never did check her personal email and I started to smell identity theft. Natalie then offered us a \"quoted\" room for the original discounted price per her managers approval who was now taking calls at home. However we still had to deal with booking.com to cancel our original reservation. We declined thus quote and called booking.com and they told us the front desk needed to give an ok to cancel the reservation! We then dis ANOTHER go around of them now not being able to find us in the system when we were just up on the screen and they could not reference anything to give the ok to he woman on the phone. After pushing the new staff attendant, Chris, he miraculously found us in the system to cancel the reservation. What a nightmare!

The latch to lock the window was not functional because the air conditioner unit was sitting in the window, so the window could be opened freely from inside or outside. Once I opened the window, I could see it opened up into type of storage room. This room held extra materials such as carpet and tiles. It also had a steel door which appeared to exit into another part of the hotel. The hotel's solution was to give us all a free breakfast. We declined their breakfast and when we returned back from breakfast, we went to our room to make sure we hadn't forgotten anything and we looked one more time at the window.

There are plenty other hotels near or in Times Square to choose from that are much better. We checked in Wed night, went up to our room, and could only hear blaring music from the bar right below. Changed to new room there was no tv in there, so had to change a third time. This room wasn't any better, but I was so sick from moving around I thought we'll just stay. The room was really hot, no way to make it cooler. We had to open the window at night, which isn't advised in NYC. The reason the room is so hot is because hot water boiler is just below the room we were in (206). Taking a shower was a nightmare!! The hot water is scalding hot and we couldn't even touch the nobs. There was no way to get a good temperature...it was either scalding hot or freezing cold, never anything in between. We left it on for 20 min, tried adjusting the temperature using the sink taps at the same time, still no avail. The staff were accomodating enough. They weren't super nice, but would always help out when asked. Other downsides: You have to pay $10/day for wi-fi and $10/day for breakfast which consists of cereal, some pastries, coffee/tea. We just walked around the corner to the local deli instead. Bed was nice, cleaned everyday. That's about the only good thing. The bar downstairs was being renovated on during the day but open at night, and they served good drinks and service was good. We didn't try the sushi restaurant also attached.

The bed was comfortable (but I could of slept standing up I was so tired)...but the bed was CLEAN, all white sheets and comforter, bed pad on the bed. not bad!

I saw the pics of the tubs (where they looked dirty) they are cast iron, this is where the paint has worn over the years....like I said old building, old hotel.

They also ran the AC to keep from being too warm. Erin and Covina at the front desk were very helpful and delightful. They assisted with recommendations for places to eat and directions.

I'm aware that New York hotels generally aren't that spacious, but this place was tiny! An absolute disgrace!

Plus, the ironing board was the length of my partner's shirt and could only stay on the bed, as there was no other surface in the room to iron on. The next day we got the room we originally booked... which looked nothing like the photos! The air-conditioning worked like a fan, the window didn't lock, the middle of the front of the toilet was blocked off by a wall, so I found myself sitting diagonally across the seat. The power point didn't work and staff did not even attempt to get it fixed (even though the said they would). Also, the elevator was slow, unpredictable, and was sometimes out of order.

After a awful start (Delta cancelled our flight after leaving us waiting at the airport literally all day) we finally got here and were really pleased with our choice of hotel. A very kind American in the UK let us use her mobile to call the hotel to tell them that we would not make it that night and they were great and said it was no problem - we had already paid. They were great when we arrived and got us checked in quick. If you need a taxi or any help they were very obliging and helpful. When we arrived at JFK we got on the airtrain line that takes you out to the city (LIRR) which was easy to use and not expensive. Once we got to the subway station we were a wee bit unsure and had been planning to walk but we got chatting to a chap on the LIRR and he said he was going in the same direction as us and said it was a fair walk so best to take the subway. He very kindly helped us buy tickets out of a machine (we got a 10 trip ticket I think) and off we went. Once we got to our destination (he indicated which was our stop but you can see it clearly if you get a good map - we used the lonely planet guide for getting about when we were there) we just walked up the stairs and we were at the corner of the street for the hotel. We actually managed to walk past the hotel as the entrance is quite small and the signage is discrete. If you see the next subway station (next to Subway the sandwich place) you have gone too far if you have come up at the top corner - can't now recall which avenue end the subway station is that we came up. A quick walk back along and you'll find it though and you should be able to see a theatre to your right if you have your back to the buildings. The hotel is fantastically located. The subway stations (there are 2 on the street one at the corner and the other about halfway down the street) are close, there is a Subway, Starbucks not far (if you take milk in your tea/coffee ask them not to fill it too high as they seem to fill them right to the top over there). There is also a dunkin donuts, tads brolied steak (my boyfriend loved this place) and a KFC. Times Square can be seen if you come out of the hotel, walk along to your right and then turn 90 degrees to your right. The room itself was relatively small but hey it was \u00c2\u00a3100 a night and we were in central New York - you're not exactly there for the room! The bed was comfy, there was a TV and a small bathroom. The shower pressure was good and tolietries were provided. The room was cleaned each day and fresh towels provided. We were really very happy with the room. The room didn't have much of a view but we really didn't think this was important. The only gripe would be that the bathroom floor tended to flood from the water from the shower so we just put a towel down. Can walk to all the main attarctions very easily from here (which we did for the first 4 days) and then our feet were killing so we started taking the subway instead! We saw lots of people on our flight buying new shoes over there as you do alot of walking!! We went on 2 tours - the Sex and the City tour and a New York bus tour. The Sex and the City tour was ok but not really anything special but the New York bus tour was great - will get my other half to tell me who we went with for that as it was excellent and would recommend.

We got to the room, which was literally just a bed and a TV with a view of an alleyway (not recommended for the claustrophobic) After dropping off our bags, we went out. This hotel was located about 2-3 blocks from Rockefeller Center and across the street from the Gershwin Theatre and the Circle in the Square Theatre so in fact it was a really great location. After coming back a few hours later we realized our room was pretty hot even though we had turned on the AC full blast when we left. Called the front desk & they sent up a repairman who said the AC was broken and couldn't be fixed til morning, but opened the window for us. Gee thanks! So I went down to the front desk & had them change our room because I did not want to sleep in that sweat box all night. After swithicng to a new room (slightly bigger, w/ a better bathroom and nicer view- but still as small as a walk in closet) we were in bed when at about 11pm the door busts open. The hotel had booked someone else into the same room and given them a key. So after being extremely shaken up I tried to call the front desk only to discover that the phone was broken. So at around 11:30 had to get dressed and walk down to the front desk to explain the problem. They were \"very sorry\" but that was about it. So the next morning we are awaken by a repairman at 8:30 (even though there was a do not disturb sign on the door) wanting to fix our phone. We sent him away and since we were now up, went down to the front desk who said they would move our room again if we wanted. The front desk wasn't rude or anything, but wasn't really sorry that all these things kept happening. We left the next day, making our displeasure known when we checked out.

I stayed here with friends five years ago and was extremely pleased with the accommodations. At that time, our group had a room with a queen and a second room with two doubles. Both rooms were adequate for our needs. This time, I booked a room that was listed as a \"standard\" with either a full or a queen. We were given a full, but we wondered if it was a \"modified\" full! The room we were in (601) was probably less than three feet wide on one side of the bed and about six inches on the other side. It was too small for any furniture, which other reviewers mentioned--no chair, desk, table, night stand. There was a clock radio and phone propped on a three inch wide \"shelf\" attached to the side wall on the window side of the bed. The \"closet\" was on the other side of the bed, which was just a rod with a curtain hanging in front of it. The radiator (2 inches from the bed) was not adjustable and made noise all night. The air conditioner in the window had silver tape on it in an unsuccessful attempt to keep cold air from coming in. The very small bed was hard as a rock (you could feel the springs) and the carpet was dirty and run down. It is true that you spend so little time in the room that the size is not the most important thing and the location and price couldn't be beat. However, the cramped nature of the room and the tiny hard bed made the one night very uncomfortable.

We searched for a month online for a reasonable hotel rate--even debated staying at a few of the skyscraper hotels in Times Square for $700 / night.

Truly centrally located, with a view of Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center when you leave the hotel and turn right down the street, \"Wicked\" playing directly opposite the hotel...Broadway and top of Times Square literally feet away. As all the reviews have said, it is very small. The lobby itself is small and dark, with a small,. slow elevator. Our room was teeny tiny (probably as small as what we had last time in Paris), with just enough room for a bed and us to scoot around it! The bathroom was also teeny tiny, with the toilet jammed into an alcove that your legs touched when sitting on it! No room for moving. The entire hotel, or what I saw of it, was incredibly dimly lit and the color scheme of dingy brown didn't really help the place to feel light and clean, but the linens seemed fresh and clean and the bed itself was really comfortable. We did have two windows in our room...one overlooked a huge heating unit ont he adjoined roof and the other was tiny and faced a brick wall. We never opened the blinds. The room was plenty warm, in fact we cracked the window at night to prevent being too hot. The complimentary coffee maker was very welcomed as the weather was freezing when we were there. The desk staff were ok, although I did witness the desk clerk and the doorman involved in a loud, heated argument (including shouting and name calling) that went on for at least 15 minutes. I am surprised at such unprofessional behaviour when it was clear that there were many guests around. Overall, this place is entirely adequate for a short stay in NYC. Most people want location (this is it!) and cleanliness (pretty good) when In New York as you won't be in your room very much. It is definitely NOT the Ritz nor does it have the huge corporate glam of those skyscrapers down the street, but for the terrific deal I got on this place, I'd stay there every time.

With that being said, there are many, MANY better hotels in New York than this one. Rooms are very very small. I've stayed in over 10 hotels in NYC, and these are way smaller than average. We had 2 beds, and not much else in our room. It's hard to put into words how small the rooms actually are - especially for 2 people. Comfortable beds though. The staff was ok. Much nicer than most people have been writing about, but they seemed very uncaring for the most part. The window in our room wouldn't lock, so people from other rooms could gain access unattested via the fire escape. However, the front desk staff couldn't care less. The location is amazing, obviously - half a block in from Times Square. To sum up, there are much better hotels out there. Paying anything more than $175/day for this hotel is way too much.

This hotel was great. They let us check in early with no extra fee. The rooms were clean and the front desk service was spectacular. They went above and beyond to keep us happy. We asked for no maid service and they left us clean towels in a laundry bag hanging from our door anyway, so we didn't have to make a request. While I travel to Manhattan about once a month and know my way around very well, the bell hop was very helpful and always offered to give us directions or get us transportation. On our last day, they locked up our luggage after check out without charging us an additional fee (as many Manhattan hotels will), as we weren't leaving until the evening and check out was at noon. The room was a bit stuffy, but nothing that wasn't fixed by running the fan in the air conditioner for a bit. Water pressure (one of my big \"things\") was excellent. The elevators ran fine for us, but I also take the stairs instead when I can. The hotel is located near lots of good touristy things - Times Square, Radio City Music Hall, Rockefeller Center, theatres, Port Authority, Penn Station, Macy's (though some would argue with me that the walk to Penn Station or Macy's is lengthy), and Central Park are all within walking distance. Plus, the hotel is just off some great subway lines, and situated between 8th Avenue, Broadway, and 7th Avenue, so catching a bus or cab is relatively easy.

No closet or furniture other than a small armoir and one window blocked by a loud AC. I found trash on the armoir left from the previous occupant's dinner and my proximity to the hotel bar made it unbearably loud. Did I mention it also smelled like paint? After complaining about the trash, the smell and the noise I upgraded to a queen room which was slightly bigger but I wouldn't call it comfortable. No real desk or furniture and a really tiny window in the corner. Only outlet I could find for my laptop was in the bathroom. But what really topped off my stay was the shower which came in two temperatures, scalding hot and freezing cold. I opted for the scalding hot which not only left me with one less layer of skin but also set off the smoke detector as there was no vent in the bathroom. All this for a mere $450.

You may want to ask for room 210, it has a closet that will fit (tightly ) two large suitcases, a writing desk with four large drawers that will hold clothing, and a bathroom with a tub.

We had paid to upgrade to a King size bed but the room itself was very small and dark looking on to a concrete wall. On our second night we had a nightmare....I was woken up at 3am by the sound of mice under our bed. I was hysterical! We walked the streets of NY from 3-5am trying to get somewhere to sleep. Alarm bells should have rang when I saw the mouse traps. We could not get a room anywhere else that night so had to go back to the hotel and swap rooms in order to get a couple of hours sleep. The room we were given to sleep in looked like a prison cell with a tiny double bed (looked more like a single) and I was relieved we had paid for the upgrade! This room also had mouse traps so the problem must be hotel wide rather than an isolated incident. Luckily Expedia moved us the next day and we went to Park Central Hotel which I would thoroughly recommend. Much more like a proper hotel. We lost a whole nights sleep and pretty much the next day of our holiday sorting this out, packing, moving and unpacking and were knackered! During such a short trip to loose this much time means a great deal. I work in the hotel industry and cannot believe that a hotel that knows it has a mouse problem will continue to take money and bookings for people to stay in rooms which are rodent infested. I am only glad that I woke up and heard the mice, otherwise we would have spent our whole stay with them running around our room at night.

The first night my boyfriend and I arrived (approx. 1AM), the front desk male said there was a problem with our room. Basically, they gave it away because they were overbooked. I was very annoyed at this point since I had called the night before to confirm that it would be a very late check-in and to ensure that our room would be ready. The front desk person then said they would pay for our cab fare and settle us into their sister hotel 4 blocks away on 54th St. (Ameritania Hotel), and that we'd be able to check back into the Amsterdam the next afternoon. When we checked into the other hotel, boy, were we in for a big surprise. I realize space is at a premium in NY, and rooms are tiny, but we opened the door, and the door hit the bed. The washroom had no tub, just a tiny shower that was a nasty grey colour, and we basically had to sit sideways to use the toilet to prevent our knees from touching the wall (I'm only 5'2\"!!). We sucked it up since it was for only one night, and the next day, we went back to the Amsterdam. The lady at the front desk was very nice and said that since we were put through some trouble the night before, the hotel would upgrade us to a king-sized bed. We were ecstatic and very appreciative that they were trying to redeem themselves. When we got to the room, it was still tiny, like most hotel rooms in NY, but it had a very comfortable bed and pillows, was clean for a hotel room, and the washroom was spacious with a tub/shower combo. The water pressure was decent, and the air con worked. It can be a little noisy at night or in the morning because the walls are pretty thin, and the hallway is very narrow, so you are in close proximity to your neighbours. There are very few channels on the small TV, but you're not in NY to watch TV anyways. All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel if you can get a cheap rate. It's a 3-star hotel supposedly, but maybe the standards are different in NY since most hotels there are pretty old. If you want a bigger room with more frills, you would have to pay way more and find at least a 4-5 star. Would suggest the SuperShuttle to/from the airport because it's only $17/person as opposed to $45+tolls+tips for cabfare. But only use the shuttle if you are not in a rush to get to/from the airport because it makes several stops at different hotels to pick other passengers up. It's a van, not a bus, so not too many passengers (up to 9, I believe). For Broadway show tickets, go to a TKTS booth and purchase them there. You can get tickets for 50% off for most shows. Recommend the play \"Avenue Q\" if you like fun, humour, and good music. For good, cheap bbq food, go to Dallas BBQ. Huge portions for what you pay for!!

If you would rather spend your money on theater, great restaurants and all the wonderful things to do in NYC, then this is the place for you. I am a smoker and used the courtyard in the back of the hotel. This provided a great opportunity to visit with tourists from other countries and enjoyed some wonderful conversations about politics and other interesting topics. NYC Tips - If it is your first visit, the Gray Line tours are a great way to figure out what neighborhoods you want to spend more time in. Use the hop on hop off feature - buses really do come by every 15 minutes. Empire State Building - Know that it may take 2 hours to get through the lines to finally get to the top, especially on the weekend TKTS Booth - Great way to get 1/2 price theater tickets, now at the Marriot Marquis Playbill website - great info on shows and ticket discount offers Don't try to do everything - Target the \"must sees\" that are on your list Good shoes - forget fashion, if your feet hurt it is hard to enjoy anything", "Date": "June 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "united kingdon", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value for money\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5343550", "Content": "Just returned from 4 night stay.

Only 2 small drawers to put clothing into, so we just left everything in our luggage. I checked several websites for pictures prior to booking this hotel. The ones offering a virtual tour made the rooms seem larger and much brighter. The lighting was dim in this hotel, both in the lobby and in the rooms.

The housekeeping staff would leave plenty of clean towels and soaps every day. Having a window that would open was nice, but the fire escape outside needed cleaning very badly.

All in all, not a bad experience, but I would probably choose another hotel on my next stay, just to have more room. The location of this hotel can't be beat. Just minutes from Times Square, with a subway station just a couple of doors down. The only noise we heard was from the water pipes when someone would take a shower, but it wasn't too bad. Some sites mentioned a free continental breakfast and safes in the room. We had neither. We locked valuables in our suitcases while gone during the day. There was a nice deli around the corner, the Belly Deli, and a drug store that we stopped into several times. Just want to give anyone thinking of this hotel an honest report.

Yes, the rooms are very small like in most New York hotels. The renovations a few years ago were kind of slapdash in some ways with too much caulking around the sinks, etc. But to be fair, this is not a \"boutique\" hotel costing $350/night. It's a budget hotel in an old building. The lobby area has a lively bar and a nice little lounge with free coffee and tea and an internet terminal (charge applies). During my two visits (Sept. 2005 and March 2006) I have found the front desk staff to be professional and polite. Speaking of which, I traveled this time with a colleague who was given a ground-floor room. She heard a lot of noise from the lobby and from the smoking terrace behind the hotel, so I would avoid a ground-floor room. The furniture and bed linens look just like the photos on the hotel's website. The beds are very comfy and clean. I stayed once in a room facing 50th St. and once in the back of the hotel. I slept like a baby in the back room, though I got a lot of street noise in the front room (mostly drowned out by running the window a/c unit). The neighborhood is safe. There are delis and a subway stop just footsteps away, and you can walk to the heart of Times Square in about 2 minutes. I had a rental car for my business trip and paid $35/night to park across the street at a theatre's underground garage. Shocking? Yes, but that's the going rate for garage parking in midtown Manhattan. If you're traveling with kids, just be aware that there is an \"adult novelty\" shop on the same block. Frankly that is part of the history of the Times Square area, a holdover from the old seedy days before Disney came to the neighborhood. But the store is fairly low-key and you can't see much from the sidewalk. Overall this is a pleasant place to stay. I not only recommend it -- I was happy to return six months after my first stay.

The best thing about the hotel (other than its location) was its cleanliness - a major plus point. The room was a decent size, it did have a view of a brick wall, but we didn't care as we were out all day and being away from the street it also meant the room was quiet. The only notable negative was having to sit side saddle on the toilet due to its proximity to a wall, but I don't remember this spoiling my holiday! Didn't have much interaction with the staff, but they seemed alright. The lifts were incredibly slow and like another reviewer you call both lifts and see which one arrives first!

Personally, I think it was stolen as I found our bag of trash from our room for that day and it wasn't in there. Anyway, after a very traumatic time sorting this out, and a whole day wasted, I was given a voucher to stay at the hell hole again. I stayed for 4 nights this September, and this time was greeted by the 'Manager' refusing to accept my voucher!! After calling me a liar and having anargument with him on the phone, he begrudgingly accepted the voucher and then I spent the next 4 days having to put up with the stupid and rude staff. If you want a laugh, ask for help from Elias who is the so-called manager on duty for the night shift.

My best advice to budget-minded travellers is lower your expectations, unless you're willing to spend lots of money.

As a New Yorker who was a bellman in the hotel industry when I was growing up, I can't believe some of the reviews I read on here. First of all, this is a two star budget hotel. If you want a great hotel experience in New York City, you have to pay top dollar. And when I say top dollar I mean at least $300 or $400 a night. And yes, the rooms are small. Do you realize you're in New York City where 22 million people live in the metro area? We don't have a lot of space here, so if you expect a big room with a lot of space, stay in New Jersey. And another thing, if you're going to buy from hotel scalpers (a.k.a. websites) understand that those cheap rates are cheap because there are risks involved. This particular hotel only has 16 rooms that have two beds in the room, so if you book through a website please understand that the bedding type is a request only, not a confirmed guarantee. That's one of the many reasons why its so cheap to book online, the risks. And those who complain about noise is just plain rediculous. You're in Times Square, NYC not at some far away in the country bed and breakfast. 22 million people kind of produce a lot of noise. Use common sense please. There is no greater insult than not tipping cabbies, bartenders, or bellmen. I tip bellmen the standard $1 per bag. So if you have like 8 suitcases and you give the bellman a $1 bill, that is a massive insult. When you tip the bellman at a hotel, he will be more inclined to point out secrets about NYC, discount cards to great restaraunts, and cheap transport back to the airport. These guys have connections, so if you don't tip them you could wind up missing out on some great experiences. I hope this has helped some of you who plan to stay at this hotel. I've stayed here 3 times now and I've had no major complaints. It's a great hotel for the price and location, and most of these bad reviews are for people that pay 2-star rates and expect a 5-star hotel.", "Date": "July 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cAwful service, but good location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3490880", "Content": "The location of this hotel is great.

Upon arrival we were shown to our rooms (723 and 725) by the polite concierge. There was only a queen bed in each of the 2 rooms booked. We immediately returned to the reception desk to query this (as we had booked 2 rooms with single beds). The reception guy was extremely arrogant and unhelpful and said it was basically what you get when booking through a third party (last minute). I informed him that we had confirmed the rooms with the hotel direct before travelling, and he basically filled us with more bull. When I asked to use the phone to clarify this with the booking company, he would not allow me. We just could not win, and in the end fatigue won the day and so accepted the rooms with the promice that single bedded rooms would come free the following day (totally not true). The room was clean, and yes fresh towels were put in daily, but that was the only advantage. Our window looked directly onto a brick wall, (so much for the city views), only one bedside lamp worked, and the t.v had no suitable free view channels, and you have to pay approx $11.99 to view a movie. The walls are extremely thin and you can hear everything the people in the opposite rooms are saying. The bed was comfy but the quilt was as thin as ever (does 2 tog exist) considering it was -2 degrees outside. Fortunately our room was warm, unlike our friends. However the radiator was so close to the side of the bed you burnt your legs every time you got in and out. The bathroom was'nt much better. The shower thermostat was uncontrollable, either too cold or scalding hot, and most of the water ended up out of the tub. There was no coffee maker, and no room safe in either of the rooms as stated on their internet site. The coffee maker in the lobby was out of use and had been presumably since last year, and there was no complimentary breakfast as suggested. Flasks of hot water were provided but there was no fresh supply of milk. I suppose what made us feel a bit better was we weren't the only ones affected. In the 3 days spent at the hotel we witnessed the same complaints from 7 other holiday goers. My advise to anybody looking for a long weekend break is to look for a better hotel, this is the pits.

The room was small, dingy, and had a lot of street noise. When we sat down on and then tried to lie on the bed, we were were appalled. The mattress was lumpy and very, very caved in to the point where I truly didn't think we would be able to sleep on it without hurting our backs. I phoned the front desk to complain that the bed wasn't at all flat and the receptionist replied, \"Oh, they're all that way.\" After sputtering for a moment, I told her I doubted that they were all this bad and I stressed the point that the mattress was really caved and she then relented and said that she'd send someone up to show us other rooms. A very polite fellow arrived ten minutes later. He showed us a second room that was even dingier and tinier than the first. It was closet-like even by NYC standards. I supposed it was quieter, but that was the only thing going for it. By now, my normally easy-going husband was beside himself and said that the room was no good. The hotel employee then asked what we wanted and we told him that the bed in the first room was no good. He said, \"Oh, the bed!\" He then led us to a third room that had a nice big, flat, king bed. The room was also clean, and nicely (if cheaply) decorated, and quiet. It was the boutique-like setting we had been expecting! We stayed for three days and enjoyed our room and the fact that we were not paying a whole lot. We had no more problems for the rest of our stay. If I had only seen the last, good room I might have given the hotel a four stars, but since I saw the other two rooms I'm giving it two stars. Actually, it should be more like 1.5 stars because of the receptionist's initial response to my complaint.

In New York in general, the hotel prices are based on availability - we inadvertently chose marathon weekend, and struggled to find a room anywhere. Worth noting (having read a previous review) that the Waldorf-Astoria was $450 a night, so way more expensive. So, I would class the hotel as expensive, although no more than a similar hotel elsewhere in NYC would have cost that weekend. Wildlife: We awoke on our first night to hear a rustling noise in the corner of the room. Turning the light on, we discovered a small mouse running across our luggage. Not what one expects in a \u00c2\u00a3165 a night hotel! We went straight to reception (at 3am) and were told there were no other rooms that night, but that we could switch in the morning. So, we were given a mouse trap and went back to bed. Closer inspection showed that the skirting board around the room had been plugged in several places with 'expanding foam filler' - so it was clear that they have tried in vain to cure an obvious mice problem. Comfort: The original room was quite small. It was clean etc, but the temperature was very high and the air conditioner broken. Room number two: The second room was great. Much larger, nice and cool, and no sign of mice. Much more like the room we would expect for the price. Had this been the first room we got, I'd have given a 4/5 rating. Breakfast: Breakfast was bagels and coffee (as much as you want). The bagels were nice, coffee was very nice and it was just right to set us up for the day - NYC has so many food experiences that we didn't want to fill up on breakfast in the hotel anyway. Staff: Without exception the staff were all friendly and helpful. The response to our issue with the mouse was exactly what you would want. Location: Just up from Radio City on West 50th between 7th and 8th Avenue. 20 seconds walk from 50th Street Metro station, which links you with all the major sights with ease. 5 mins walk to Time Square. 15 mins walk from Port Authority Bus Terminal. Excellent location all in all. Overall: A good hotel let down by the excessive price. That said, I am sure that other similar hotels in the area would be just as pricey.", "Date": "November 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Panama, Rep. of Panama", "Title": "\u201cA rip-off.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2809755", "Content": "I just stayed at the Amsterdam Court for three nights. I made a point of not showing up at the hotel until I was ready to go to sleep, so that depression wouldn't set in. 3-star rating at best. It's a dreary, dark, run-down and tired place. Friends were staying at the Waldorf-Astoria at the same time, at $210, they got a a better rate than I did, at $230 a night. That ought to tell you something about the way to go. Staff was unhelpful and rude, except for a lady receptionist named Jackie, who really tried to help locate my lost credit card.

Perfectly placed on broadway / times square. The staff were so helpful during our stay prior to our cruise. They even let us use their baggage room after our cruise as the plane was delayed some 12 hours! They are at present redecorating / refurbishing so it will be alot brighter when finished. Yes the rooms are smallish, and perhaps a little tired looking at the moment, but this is far outweighed by the fact that this is a supoer base to visit New York, coupled with the friendly and most helpful staff and the low prices.

The service was perfectly fine...the decor was charming. The rooms were very clean, and housekeeping service good. There was some inconsistency in the number of wash cloths provided, but in the grand scheme of things, not a big deal to me. The rooms were not huge, but neither are most hotel rooms in NYC...besides, that's not what I necessarily go there to enjoy. The lobby was in the process of renovation...and every day I noted marked improvement and progress. There was a neat little bar on the lower level, with great music and a cool atmosphere. A new restaurant is slated to open soon (if it isn't already).

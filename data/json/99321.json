We were not too far from the elevator and were concerned that a constant bell ringing would keep us awake, but the bells were either disconnected or very quiet so it wasn't a sleeping problem at all.

Having been to NY 2 times before we felt we had a feel for the area and where we wanted to stay. I reviewed The Manhattan Club here on TA and had some concerns but felt it was worth a try. I have a time share in Las Vegas with HGV and used some points with RCI to stay at TMC for 7 nights 2/24-3/02. It was a very good trade. We arrived on a wet and rainy Friday evening. From the moment we steped out of the taxi to the second we left we had no regrets other then we had to return to our home in California All of the staff at TMC made us feel welcome and were very helpful. I would like to give a tumbs up to Jerry at the front desk who greeted us when we checked in and was very helpful and answered all of my questions. Great going Jerry :-) I also would like to thank all of the staff from the Door Man who help us arrange a return ride to JFK that was better then a taxi, the house staff who made sure our room was cleaned and in order every day and did some extra things we did not expect, the fast security man who fixed a faulty room safe in a timely manner, and the Bell Hops who made sure our luggage was brought up to our room and put away, to holding it in storage before we left so we could spend our last few hours taking in the scenes of New York. Now for the facts. 1. Check in was fast and without issues. Same with check out. 2. We never had a issue with the elevators. I can see were they do become busy at check out 3. We did have a slight sewer smell in the hallway but it was not something I would not expect in a older building. Never in the room!!!!! 4. We had a One Bedroom Suite on the 22nd floor (2219) that gave us a small view up 7th Ave. and Central Park. 5. The room had a private bedroom with a king bed and a tub/shower bathroom. The bed was comfortable and the room had plenty of space. The closet has a ironing board and iron. The bathroom has a hair dryer and a adjustable vanity mirror. The window can be opened to let in some freah air. Also a flat screen tv. The bathroom was large and layout worked for me. 6. We had a small living room with a hideabed that my college age daughter found to be a pain. Putting some extra blankets that where in the room made it worth while. I would not expect a older and heavy adult to find sleeping on this bed a good thing but what do you want for a hideabed. I have one at home that I would not sleep on. This room also also has a flat screen tv and a view out the window. 7. The kitchenette has a dishwasher, frig, microwave, coffee maker, toaster, all of the dishes you would need. THC provides diswasher soap, coffee, tea, popcorn, suger and creamer that was replaced as it was used. 8. A small dinining table is near the front door. 9.A smaller bathroom also comes with this room, It has a shower and also comes with a hair dryer and a adjustable vanity mirror. The toiletries are Bath and Body Works and are replaced as they are used. 10. TMC does charge $30.00 a night fee. Not sure what you get for the money? We did not use the gym being we walked our feet off or eat upstairs. The business center came in handy for printing our boarding passes. We did get the phone calls to do a timeshare preview but I just did not answer the phone. The location of TMC was everything you would want. Everything was in walking distance. Subway stations are just around the corner or if needed a taxi is just ouside the door. Plenty of places to eat and you have a Whole Foods on Columbus Circle that great for stocking your kitchenette. They also have some great ready made meals that can help keep cost down. As for the size of the rooms I would say it was large by NY standards. When we return to New York this will be Hotel we will be staying at.

I'm not familiar with the rest of the hotel/time share accomodations, but my guess is the penthouse suites are somewhat more snazzy. Our suite was not huge but plenty spacious; galley-efficiency kitchen (coffee provided), sitting area with pull-out queen sofa, bedroom, and two very large bathrooms. The bathrooms are fabulous. The glass/tile walk-in shower in the master bath was, on its own, almost as big as a whole bathroom! Plenty of upscale toiletries are provided; the linens are very good quality and the bed comfy. The suite was clean and quiet. The quality/character of the lobby was not what I expected -- small, and always seemed rather noisy and crowded. We arrived at 4 o'clock check-in time, and the line at the front desk was quite daunting; basically almost backed up to the front door. Luckily, as we were going up to the penthouse suites which have their own check-in procedure, we avoided the line, but I felt sorry for those who could not. And, as everyone says, the elevator situation is totally inadequate to handle the volume of guests. We enjoyed our stay and would return to the penthouse suites.

I should have done the research first. This is a time share hotel. I was not a time share guest but instead I paid about $400 per night and I expected it to be a great experience but it was not. It all started about a week before my arrival. I kept on getting 877 number calls on my cell phone. I finally called back only to find out that it was the Manhattan Club calling. They wanted to schedule a tour of the facilities. I told them that I was a hotel guest and why would I want to tour the facilities and asked them not to call me anymore? It gets worse. Upon check in my hotel package included free parking. The woman at the front desk could not seem to understand this very simple concept. She kept on saying that there was an envelope for me from the manager and she did not know what was in it(almost like I was entitled to some sort of prize). At this point it felt very cheesy and like a time share tour. It turns out my envelope contained my parking vouchers. They asked for my driver's license and took it in the back to make a copy of it. I travel often and I NEVER have anyone make a copy of my license. They also took an imprint of my credit card which is common. Go to their website and look at their choice of words to describe the room like sumptuous. I can tell you the rooms are old and outdated. They also are very small even though I was booked into a jr suite. The bathroom is brass and dated like the 1980's. My carpet and furniture were dirty. My phone rang and it was a gentleman asking what I thought of the room. I told him I was not happy and he said he would get back to me with a solution. I unfortunately did not get his name and no one called back to follow up. I proceeded to leave but had to wait 15 minutes for an elevator. I am not kidding as you look at other reviews you will see this come up over and over as they do not have enough elevators for the demand. I think what made my stay awful was on my last day I was under the weather. My phone kept on ringing and I finally picked it up only to be asked when I wanted to tour the ambassador club. Even though I was paying full rate and not on a reduced rate or being giving some sort of incentive they continued to harass me about a tour of this property. This is unacceptable. If you are visiting as a time share guest you might be ok with all of this. I was not. The parking is unusual. Even if your room comes with free parking you need to pay each day at the front desk with a voucher. I found out the hard way on my way to a meeting. They brought my car around and I gave them the green claim check and a tip. Instead of giving me my keys they said I need to give them a receipt that I paid for parking. I told them I left a credit card imprint at the front desk and that I still had three more nights so why would I pay every time I leave. They said that you need to pay each time you leave and present a receipt. They acted like I would leave and not pay for parking. I had to go back to the front desk and wait in line.

It really depends on what you focus on. The good: The location was fabulous. The lobby was clean and bright.

The kitchenette had a coffeemaker that they provided daily coffee for, a dishwasher, fridge, microwave, and plates/utensils. We could not have asked for more and there was a nice grocery store within a half block. We were able to have nice breakfasts in our room and save time and money. The Bad: the elevators (as mentioned by other people) were ridiculous- you can't run a hotel with elevators that take 15 minutes! One of the showers in our full bath didn't work. This didn't bother us, because we just used the other shower but if you were sharing a room between 2 families or couples that each wanted their privacy, it would have been a big deal. The noise was pretty bad from the service elevators in our room, but we used noise machines and ear plugs so we were able to get by.

Please note that reviews on this site are from both those who have stayed at the club as time share holders and those who have rented a hotel room. The hotel room does not incur additional charges for housekeeping, which is mentioned in some reviews, or at least our hotel room did not incur a charge. We secured our room for an excellent rate on Hotwire and thus did not know this was a time share until after we paid Hotwire. I am uninterested in the time share concept and was less than enthusiastic to receive a \"welcome\" letter when we checked in, inviting us to learn more about the time share possibilities. I felt the same way when a phone call came to our room, inviting us again to a presentation. (I have suggested to Hotwire that they indicate on their site that time shares are included in their hotel offerings so that the buyer is aware.) That said, we found our second floor room to be clean and a good size for Manhattan. The bed was extremely comfortable and there was plenty of storage space ... except in the bathroom, which had minimal space for toiletries. The main drawback was the room's location. It faced a brick wall, so no natural light came in. We felt as if we had entered a bear's den. Carpeting in the second floor corridor resembled a leopard print and seemed a strange interior design choice. To access the nearby guest elevators required using our key card to enter the business office area where the elevators stopped. Elevators are quite slow, so we often had to leave this area and take a walk to the service elevators, located in a dreary back hall that had no air conditioning -- a major drawback because of the high temperatures that weekend in New York. The hotel's location is great -- near Central Park, 5th Avenue, Times Square, etc. -- with plenty of good restaurants and cafes in the vicinity. That is truly a major plus.

This was our fourth visit to New York City, and we chose this accommodation for its great location; we were 4 adults in an executive studio unit. The Manhattan Club is a great place to stay as it is right in the middle of it all: 2 blocks from Central Park, a 10-minute walk to Times Square, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right in the center of the Theater district and several subway lines minutes away (N, Q, R right around the corner and 1, 2, 3 at Colombus Circle, a couple blocks away). The check-in went very smoothly and we got the unit we had specifically requested a week prior to our arrival. We were on the 20th floor, which was great. Our unit was just as expected: very spacious. We had no view whatsoever (a huge brick wall), but the good thing about it is that it was extremely quiet. We were never woken up by those city sounds and we really appreciated that. The bed and pillows are very comfortable and so was the sofa bed. We tried both because we were 4 adults and thought it was only fair to switch every now and then. The kitchenette is practical for drinks and snacks but there is no cooktop or regular oven. I guess you can heat up some soup in the micro-wave but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Housekeeping gives you popcorn and ground coffee every day, so you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to buy coffee. If you are a Starbucks addict, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one just around the corner. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was fine, nothing really special. The bathroom was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new york small\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and lacked storage space. We had to have all our beauty products on the floor and the hallway console became our make- up/hair drying area. Housekeeping did a great job; unlike other timeshare properties, they refresh your unit every day. The hotel is well kept: after a day in the filthy new york subway, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very pleasant to come \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to a very clean and neat hotel. Apparently there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gym but we never used it. On the 26th floor, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a guest lounge with very comfy sofas and chairs. From 2 to 4pm (or maybe 12 to 4) they provide complimentary Starbucks coffee and cookies. I had read many complaints about the elevators. Most of the time we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait that long. The only time we did was check-out mornings because if the elevator has reached a certain weight before getting to your floor, it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop at your floor. So we decided to call the elevator going up, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d go up to the 26th and back down to the lobby and it was way quicker this way. Keep that in mind on Friday and Saturday mornings! We liked the Manhattan Club very much for its location and its cleanliness, so we will definitely stay there again when we go back to NY. Some extra practical info: - Groceries: there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Morton Williams a block away (225 West 57th Street). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small but has everything you need: we stocked up on watered bottles, juice, milk, fruit and veggies for salads. - Wi-fi: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free at the Manhattan Club, so bring your laptop it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great to help plan your day. - Laundry: if you stay a while (we stayed 2 weeks) you may need to do some laundry at some point. We went to a Laundromat on W. 50th between 9th and 10th avenue. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very clean and the lady running the place is very helpful. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $4.50 for a large washer and $0.25 per 7 minutes of drying. You have plenty of eateries in the area to have dinner while your laundry is being done. - Concierge: the person at the concierge desk is very helpful.

Using out Hilton points (affiliated with RCI) we felt lucky to get the place for two weeks as there are limited places to stay in Manhattan. Overall, our experience was a very good one. As many other reviewers have mentioned the location is fantastic. We were minutes, by foot, away from Columbus Circle, Central Park, and Broadway. A five minute walk would get you to Times Square and there is a Subway station less than a minute walk away. For you coffee drinkers just remember right, and right again and you will be at a Starbucks in seconds when you exit the MC's main doors. We found the housecleaning staff to be friendly and non-obtrusive. Our rooms were always clean and replenished. We found the housecleaning staff to be extremely pleasant and welcoming, they were also willing to help us if we were waiting for the elevator by offering the service elevator (we did not find the elevators to be particularly slow or inefficient other than the check out/in days). Let me preface the next part of the review by saying we stayed in two different types of rooms which offered two different experiences. The first week we stayed on the 16th floor overlooking the Wellington Hotel. The room was excellent, it was spacious, well planned and came with the usual amenities plus a dishwasher. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I believe most RCI/experinced travelers would be satisfied with this type of room. Our second week we stayed on the second floor. More about that in a minute but first a little about our experience with the front desk staff. When we arrived we were told we would have the same room for both weeks. I recall thinking that we really had lucked out. There is no question in mine or my wife's mind that this information was communicated to us so on the following Saturday when we got our check-out notice, I at first ignored it thinking 'it's Saturday, they just throw them under every door'. Nevertheless, I had a niggling feeling that this was not the case. We had an appointment scheduled for nine that morning. At 8:30 am I called down to the desk to make certain we were to stay in the same room and was told that we were to vacate by 11:00 am and relocate to a room on the second floor. It was very frustrating, especially since we had to cancel our 9am appointment and get packing. This inconvenience in itself was not the end of the world however the non-caring, non-helpful attitude of the front desk staff did not help. We had little to do with the front desk during our stay but if this scenario was an indication of how they deal with clients I would suggest they take some lessons from the cleaning staff who seem to have grasped the culture of hospitality. Now to the rooms on the second floor. They are clean and but poorly designed. There is only one bed side table even though there is room for two. The view is of a brick wall and in our case at least, a massive air-conditioning unit. For the life of us, we could not figure out the rationale behind the cups, plates and cutlery -- they were disposable plastic (the type you would get at KFC). The cups were pathetic- they reminded me of a child's play set (we re-used our paper Starbuck cups). Having said that, the room was okay and if we had not been on the 16th floor we would have perhaps been more satisfied with out room on the second (my wife disagrees with this point). We both agree though, that one should not be spending lots of time in the room other than to sleep and get ready for the day if you are staying in NYC, This was definitely the case with us and when we were in the suites we felt like we were in a safe, clean place that drowned out the hustle and bustle of the city regardless of the second floor room's shortcomings. Our stay in NYC was fantastic. Our stay at the Manhattan Club certainly complimented our incredible experience. I would recommend a stay at the MC but be aware the second floor suites are not ideal and don't expect an empathetic front desk staff versed in hospitality fundamentals to look after your concerns.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cJunior Executive Suite is the way to go!\u201d", "Author": "antgina", "ReviewID": "UR115939192", "Content": "Stayed in the city overnight for dinner & a show.

Once I told them I was not interested in taking their 'tour' (i.e. sales pitch) they did not bother me again CONS: Bathrooms: The bathrooms themselves were fine, but there was not enough room to put our things (toothpaste, contact lense cases, toothbrushes) by the sink.

We also had access to gym, large louge with bar which operated form 4.30pm and business centre where printing of documents was free. Also free interent wifi throughout the building.

The bed and pillows are very soft and comfortable. Love having the two bathrooms. Our view from 1402 was of a brick wall but I wasn't there to look out my window. I found that the continential breakfast, although very good, was over priced for the limited selection. $14.99/person. I recommend the Downtown bus tour at $44/person but if you get the Chinese lady, you may not understand her very well and may not get the full benefit of the tour.

The reviews varied widely between \"wonderful\" and \"horrible\" with very few in between, so I thought I'd take the time to submit my own review. We booked 2 rooms over the President's Day weekend for all 5 of us (3 adults, 2 small children). Initially there was a SNAFU over the rooms, but after a while, things got worked out and they gave us adjoining rooms (we did have to pay $75 extra). Contrary to what some people have said, we thought the rooms were rather spacious as far as NYC rooms are concerned. We even had a king sized bed, which I wasn't expecting but was very glad to have. The kitchenette was very convenient as well as the 2 full bathrooms. There was plenty of room to spread out. The elevators: yes, they were slow at times, but not so much that had us waiting forever. In fact, they run a separate set of elevators around the corner, so if the main ones were busy we could always catch those. Like all the other reviewers, I agree that you just can't beat the location. You're close to Central Park south and just blocks away from Times Square. Everything was so convenient. They also have a mini grocery store nearby as well. The staff were very nice, the lady at the concierge desk was helpful and answered all our questions. The doormen always had a smile. Never encountered anyone who was rude. It isn't the Ritz Carlton, so as long as you know that going in, you'll be happy. It isn't a rundown hotel either.

The mini kitchen was well equipped with microwave, coffee maker - plates, mugs, cuttlery, glasses, bottle opener - even a dishwasher.

From one to five stars, I have to rate this hotel 4 1/2 stars. The personnel were very accomodating and a pleasure to speak to. From check-in to the concierage to check out I couldn't stress more how helpful and pleasant everyone was. The room was roomy and well furnished for a NYC hotel. The maid came in daily and made sure the room was clean. She furnished us with our decaf coffee packets daily which was great for the morning. The furnishings were not elegant, but they served their purpose for storing our clothing and accessories. We had a flat screen TV in the living room area which was great, but was not viewable from the bedroom area. It would have been nice to be able to watch television in bed before going to sleep. I found the kitchenette to be sufficient for snacking as there was a small refrigerator, microwave, sink and dishwasher. The bathroom had a stall shower, but no tub which I found odd as the room is very large. We were situated on the 22nd floor facing seventh ave. and there was very little noise unless a siren was passing by the building. But, that is the music of NYC, so it did not affect us at all. I utlized the exercise room a few times and found it sufficient for a decent workout as it contained treadmills, bikes, a universal, a benchpress machine and free weights in the form of dumbells. I was able to get a good sweat before I visited the fantastic nearby restaurants. The only complaint I have which caused me to knock a half star rating from perfect is the room temperature. You cannot control the room temperature, only the speed of the fan. If the temperature outside is cool the heat is on and the only thing you can do is open the windows about two inches to let in cool air. It got so warm that we had to request a fan which was promptly brought to our room. We complained about the temperature and it was explained that some guests were cold and they had to put the heat on. We heard the heat complaint from other people on the elevators. I'veheard complaints from others critiqueing this hotel about the elevators being slow. We did not experience that, however the hotel was not full. There were times we had to wait nearly five minutes for an elevator, but that did not affect us. Overall, I rate this hotel very high and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a very clean, comfortable hotel located in an outstanding location.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Foster City, California (San Francisco Area)", "Title": "\u201cCentrally located\u201d", "Author": "hpisles", "ReviewID": "UR82976232", "Content": "We stayed at the Manhattan Club Hotel for 5 days in September 2010. We found this hotel through our friend's timeshare but did not use the time share option since our friend wanted to use her timeshare week for something else. So we stayed at the Manhattan Club for $350-$375 per night which was comparable with the surrounding hotels in the area. Manhattan is not a cheap place to go so expect high hotel rates! Prior to going I received frequent emails and calls offering free dinners, free shows, reduce rates, etc if we would attend their 90 min timeshare presentation (this is a bit annoying). After finally figuaring our schedule we decided not to attend since there was so much to do in New York and our time was limited so we opt out of the presentation. Also their web site is a bit strange and ended up having to call customer service to reduce our stay by one night. I requested early check-in but it turned out none of the rooms were ready until 4:00 p.m. (wished they had told us that prior to going back/forth to the hotel trying to check in). All the staff was very helpful and friendly (expect for the intial staff we meet - we showed up at 9:00 a.m. after taken a red eye flight) and I guess they got tired of me asking if our room was ready. The rest of the staff was quite friendly and helpful. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite with 2 bathrooms and flat screen tv in each room and sofabed in sitting room. This worked out exceedingly well since we had 4 adults and also had a rollaway (additional $25 per night) it worked out perfectly for our needs. Having a small kitchen with refigerator, microwave and coffemaker (with coffee) worked out perfectly. King-size bed was very comfortable and the rooms were large compared to what we previously gotten in New York. The only problem with the room was the air conditioner didn't work very well but we discovered if we pulled down all the curtians and turning on the air con full blast that the room would be a comfortable tempature when we returned in the evenings. In the mornings when it was cool and there was a breeze we opened the windows. We skipped the $14 all you can eat buffet breakfast and opted to get pastries at a corner street cart right outside ($2). Also plenty of coffee shops and delis nearby as well as resturants. Hotel was very clean and the bell staff was VERY friendly and helpful. Hotel was clean and nicely done. VERY Centrally located and bus and subway stations were close by.

The bellman brought our bags inside and we were greeted by James at the front desk. There was no line at all and he checked us in quickly, could not have been more friendly or helpful, and made us feel very welcome. It was 3:00 and our room would not be ready until 4.

The weather was cool and rainy, so even with the fan turned off on the a/c the room was a little chilly. As I said, good for us but maybe not for some. I would always prefer too cold over too hot.

The lobby staff, housekeeping, and concierge were all very courteous and helpful. The biggest negative for us were the repeated phone call requests to attend a \"property tour\" and get free show tickets. We had already purchased show tickets and didn't care to sit through a sales presentation for Manhattan Club ownership, so we politely told them \"no\" - four times.

It seemed to me the issue was that two out of the four lifts were reserved for the penthouse units/floors. Several times, we used the two freight elevators behind the lobby. The suite was kept nice and cool and noise wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an issue. The 1 bedroom consists of a bedroom separated from the living area via a door. In addition to the one bath in the bedroom, there was a \u00c2\u00be bath in the living room area. This was nice as there were 3 of us. There was a microwave, however no cooking stove top. There was a mini fridge in the room. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NYC anyways\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Who cooks? Daily cleaning was provided and the housekeeping staff did an excellent job everyday. All the staff appeared cheerful and we experienced no problems. The were no spas or pools, however there was a good gym on the top floor. There were 3 flat panel TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s along with all the necessary machines, including free weights to work off all the great meals to be had nearby. I slept on the sofa bed one night and that was enough for me. Did not feel comfortable, but was okay with my little one. Overall, liked it a lot. It was in a great location with the subway a block away. You couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask for a better location. Tip: at 55th Street and 9th Avenue, there is a laundromat where you can do some laundry if you have to. Also next door on 9th Avenue, there is a bike shop, Liberty Bicycles that rents bicycles for $6 an hour.

I was a little skeptical and had to call the hotel to make sure that it was enough for my family of four. The front desk assured me that a STUDIO (in NY?! ridiculous) was enough to fit my family, so I went with it. The price was fairly reasonable for New York ($300 for the night, which at NY is reasonable) and I love New York to bits. I was so excited as I arrived in Manhattan and began looking for the hotel out of the car. The lobby was mediocre at best and having lived in the Waldorf and the Hilton, the lobby did not even compare with those fine hotels. The first red flag was that the room was not ready at 2pm and later at 3pm. A lady in front of us in the line complained that she had been waiting for her room since 7am in the morning. The bellhops were no better. There was one tiny skinny man and a bigger one. The bigger one left the skinny little one to do most of the work (mind you, we had seven pieces of luggage) and gave us attitude when it came time for the tipping. Obviously we gave the smaller one a substantially larger tip, at the expense of us having to quarrel with an obnoxious bellhop that felt his tip was too little. The room was a lot smaller than what I had imagined and smelled strongly of cigarette smoke, even though it claimed to be a no smoking room. I was furious that the front desk felt that the size of the room would be suitable for a family of four with two teenage boys. After some reasoning with the front desk, they gave us a slightly larger room but was still way to small for my family. Now it wasn't all bad, even though it seems like it is. I found the bathroom to be of a generous size, especially for New York. There was also free wifi which surprised me a lot! The location is also impeccable. Overall, I would not book this hotel ever again, especially for its selling price of around USD $500.

They range from 500-700 sq. ft. Ours was 622 sq.ft. at the end of a hallway next to a storage room so it was quiet. The windows looked out to the so called courtyard which was a brick building well. Not a problem for me because I didn't come to NYC to sit in the room and look out the window. I was glad I didn't get the 56th street side as it might not have been so quiet. When you take the elevators (2 of them on the smaller size) watch to see if it skips your floor. Housekeeping told us they sometime get \"keyed\" to skip floors. If so- head around the corner to the service elevator which is never busy. Can't complain about the elevators as other have done. Both elevators are clearly marked- just look for the signs. We arrived on a Friday night from JFK. Before we could get out of the town car ( use Carmel car service- fabulous and $5 less than the taxis) the bellman had removed all of our luggage from the trunk and taken it inside. There was another bellman to great you. We arrived at 6pm- no line-very very nice polite check in. Our bags were promptly delivered to our room. The suite has a bathroom with tub/shower which is quite large and shower only bathroom that is small/medium size. Nice linens on a king bed in master. They will give you a rollaway bed if you don't like the pull out couch bed. My friend didn't mind it. We anticipated the dreaded bar found on most pull out couches, but it wasn't there. Maid service was wonderful. On the first night when we returned to the room at midnight we couldn't figure out how to shut the windows we had opened and initially thought there was no air conditioning. We called for assistance. With 2 minutes a maintenance man was there to show 2 women how to close the windows and an engineer to show us how to turn on the air conditioner. (Can't ask for better service than that) They have express check out and handled our bags beautifully. We had a Manhattan cocktail (thought it appropriate on our first night) at the bar on the 26th floor. It was $14 but it was perfectly made. There was a bowl of nibble snacks with the drink. Owner services (the Ambassador Club/sales office) called me a few weeks before my arrival and told me to call the front desk 2 weeks in advance if I wanted to make any special requests. The 1 bedroom suite is good for 2-4 people. More would be too cozy. We went to the business center on the 26th floor to quickly send postcards(check out the Manhattan Club website- they have really cool on line postcards to send) and to run boarding passes. A lot of people hogged the 6 computers and looked like they were working, rather than doing quick checks. It was ridiculous because they have free internet access in the room- just bring your laptop with you if you need to spend that much time on a computer.

The concierge was rude, as was the bellman named Jason who actually questioned the amount of the tip I gave him. I should have taken it back, but I didn't. I did speak with the office in Pennsylvania prior to going to NYC. I will say that the people on the phone from the main office were among the rudest people I have ever dealt with at any hotel.

When we tried back again a few days later, a gentleman said \" We have anything you want available, just give me the date you want to come and well make your reservation.\" and with no problem, we were booked. Strange. We get here and TRY to check in at 4 p.m, which is the check in time. We proceeded to wait 45 minutes because our room was \"not ready.\" The lobby filled in no time with people who's rooms were \"not ready.\" The front desk clerk gave us attitude for asking her how much longer it would be. If check out is at 11 and check in is at 4, does it really take 5 hours to clean the room? (word round the building:if you stay past 11 they charge you $50. But no compensation for making us wait in the lobby?) We get to the room and there are paint chips in random places throughout it. Wall paper falling off, numbers on the granite tiles (where the builders were counting pieces or something), there is a huge scaffolding outside our window, the toilet paper roll fell apart because there was no spring in it (tp now sits on the floor), the toilet seat in the other bathroom fell off upon sitting on it,all of the brass fixtures are corroding, the blow dryer burnt out, and the elevators are extremely slow. Ok, not a huge deal. The thing that did it for me was moving from the bedroom to the living/sitting room with the pullout sofa bed. The bed was broken. The entire couch came along with the bed while pulling it out. One side would come out, the other would go in. I finally wrestle it out....3:30 in the morning...to find that when I sit on it, it collapses in on me like a sandwich. I am now forced to sleep horizontally, in the crack/fold of the mattress with my feet on a chair.

But the experience at this place was, in a word, awful. The first night (which was a warm, humid evening in early November), the room felt quite warm as we went to bed. We adjusted the thermostat as low as it would go and turned in. By three a.m., we were all awake - the room was an oven. A call to the front desk informed us that this place had a \"single pipe\" system - hot or cold only. Due to it being early Nov, it was now heat only. We opened the door into the hallway - no relief. They told us to open the windows (16th floor, small kids in room...), which we did as much as safely possible. A fan was eventually delivered. When we asked for a second fan, we were told they were now out of them - others were presumably suffering this pressure cooker experience also. The second night things got far worse. We awoke to the sound of water dripping, fast and strong - the ceiling was leaking, dripping onto our sleeping children. The ceiling felt soggy, a weird rectangle appeared, like the panel might collapse down. A hotel \"engineer\" arrived. He agreed with my recommendation - we move rooms. At 3am, we carried our half-awake children and belongings to another room (no, it wasn't next door.) After two hours of lost sleep, we collapsed. The next morning, exhausted and red eyed, we discovered that this new room also had a leak - a badly leaking window (the saturated towel sitting on the sill when we arrived was the giveaway), and also, the shower leaked water to the point that literally 1/8\" to 1/4\" of water remained on the floor after use, noticeably rotting out the bottom of all furniture in the bathroom (obviously a long-term, unfixed problem). After we finally checked out, we were given the number of the Manhattan Club's Exec Director to ask for an adjustment to our bill. This man was something to behold. I mean, amazing, right out of a bad movie... not only unsympathetic (offering an apology only after being told we hadn't gotten one), but rude, arrogant and... he actually seemed to be enjoying himself being that way. Dripping with sarcasm over a speakerphone, shuffling papers loudly, he said it wasn't their policy to issue any credits, no matter what the circumstances, and that was \"what made this country great - that we can disagree about this. You think you deserve some kind of credit, and I can say no.\" Yes, that's a direct quote. He confirmed that we had received the coupon for a free continental breakfast (Perhaps a $10 value, even in NYC - Bagels, carton juice etc.) And that was the end of that. And the end of any stays for us this \"timeshare.\" In thinking back over this place, even setting aside our individual awful experience, it was a rotten core. Every time I rode the elevator in that 2 1/2 days, people commented on how long the line was to use the elevator in the lobby (there were never less than a dozen people in line - yes, actually in line, day and night) or how long they had waited on their floor for it (think ten minutes, not 2-3.)

We chose the hotel because of price and location and it worked out well on both counts. In detail - when I first opened the door of our room I was taken back by how small it was. Then I remembered I was in New York! It had been 9 years since my last visit and I had forgotten how small the rooms in New York can be. The room was about standard for a New York hotel. We had what was called a \"Quad\" room. It consisted of a Queen size bed and a sofa bed. The sofa bed was just acceptable for our boys to sleep on. The mattress was so thin that an adult would have not slept due to the supporting frame of the mattress pushing into the middle of their back. Also, with the bed folded out the foot of the bed was too close too a glass topped coffee table for our liking - we felt it was awkward and dangerous. To solve this we took the glass top off and stored it under our bed and stood the coffee table on its end in a corner. In hindsight we should have asked the staff to remove the table. But the work around was fine. Other than the issues with the bed the room was completely fine. Our queen bed was quite comfortable and we slept well in it. Other guests have commented previously on the slowness of the lifts (elevators). We didn't have a problem with them, never more than a minute wait. I understand from one of the regular guests that the maintenance work on the lifts that had been going on for some time had been completed and that the accessibility of the lifts had improved significantly ever since. We did receive one call from hotel staff selling time share. They offered tickets to a show or a $150 Visa Cash card for attending one of their \"60 to 90 minute presentations\". But they weren't too pushy about it and when I explained that we didn't visit often and hadn't been to New York for 9 years they backed right off and we did not hear from them again during our stay. We also found a couple of great, reasonably priced restaurants near our hotel. We had great pizza on 57th street and also went to a lovely asian restaurant on 7th avenue called Lili's that did Chinese food and Sushi. The real winner for us was the location. Being close to the subway and Central Park and a few minutes stroll to 5th Avenue and Times Square made this a great place to be based.

I was also asked for the credit card no. only for \"GUARANTEE\" the book. I did specifically mentioned that I will pay by cash - so the please do not charge on my card. This is due to the exchange rate matter. After I agreed on the booking, then the problems started. 1. Changing of the contact person I once tried to contact the same representative for the booking as to change my staying date. I waited for a week before he contacted me back with the message that he only in charge of the booking. I do need to contact another department. 2. My card was charged in full. I specifically mentioned that it was for \"Guarantee\" of the booking only, not to be charge. So I have to pay about USD 100 more due to the exchange rate and the bank charge. 3. No room when arrived When I and the family arrived at the property at 1 am (after a 27 hour-flight), the staff told us that there was no room for us for tonight. He didn't know the cause but he was asked to put us on another hotel nearby for a night. The room should be ready first thing in the morning. I was also suggested to file a complaint with the director who would be in the office tomorow in the morning. I asked the staff if the hotel he put us in was in the equivalent rate we paid. He said \"Yes\". When we arrived at the hotel, we asked for the rate. It was USD 199, but we paid for USD 285. - How equivalent is that? 3.1 When I came back in the in the morning (9.00 am), the director was not in yet. So, I decided to attend the presentation firstly by asking the front desk staff to inform me once the director is in. But until we finished with the presentation (11.00 am), there was no one informing us at all. 3.2 When I contacted the front desk again, I was treated with neglecting behavior. There were 3 staffs behind the counter and they were snobbish and hostile. a) I asked for the director and the answer I got was that the director was in the meeting. b) I asked what time the meeting will end. The reply was in the afternoon. c) I asked if they could inform the director that there was a client waiting to see him because I had appointments in the afternoon. They refused to do so. d) I asked for my room. They said the check-in time is 4.00 pm. I was so upset because this vacation was for my mom's birthday. I had plans in the afternoon and couldn't wait the whole day for this mess. I started to piss off. The staff traited me to lower my voice or they would call the police. I, then, asked them to call the police. I called my lawyer. The police didn't come but the Chief of the Security came to talk with me. She informed me that the director was not working today. (I was surprise with the 3rd different messege I received about the director - so who's the [--].) And the room wouldn't be ready until 4. I said nevermind I already called lawyer. He would be here in a minute. After my lawyer arrived at 12.00 pm, he had a conversation with the same staffs.

I responded that I did not intend to make that type of committment without \"driving the car first\". They responded that this should be a no brainer, and it was we declinded their offer. At that time they became as cold as you could imagine. I was also told originally that I was paying for a 1 bedroom suite however on the initial check in they said they only had a studio and would see what they could do.

I stayed from May 3 to May 10, 2008. I think the rooms are great. I would rate this resort 3.5 stars. It could easily be 4 or 5 if they refurbished the rooms. Since TripAdvisor only has whole stars and I really enjoyed my stay, I gave it a 4. I got the room through RCI. The park is only 3 blocks away and Carnagie Hall is across the street. GREAT LOCATION! At W 57th and 7th Ave, you are in the middle of the hustle and bustle of New York. I had room 2219. It is a corner \"Executive Studio\" unit so I had 2 windows with a view of Central Park. Nice! My room was very funtional and a great place to relax after walking all day in the city. I don't understand folks that complain about noise in New York. That is part of the experience! If the windows are open, it is noisy. Cole Porter says it best: \"I happen to like New York, I happen to like this town. I like the city air, I like to drink of it, The more I know New York the more I think of it. I like the sight and the sound and even the stink of it. I happen to like New York.\" The rooms do need to be updated. While my room was very clean, the soft goods are showing wear and tear. Faded bed spread, spots on fabric chair/couch, wear and tear, etc. Just needs to be updated. The carpet looked new and the flat screen TV was nice. Air conditioning worked great. The small refirgerator worked but it was too cold. On the lowest setting, it would freeze my soft drinks. Had great cola slurpies. I let them know when I checked out. Elevator Issue RESOLVED: They completely replaced an entire elevator car. For half of my stay there was only one lobby elevator. They did allow you to use the freight elevator but I didn't like it. They opened up the new elevator so both elevators are in service. The new one is very nice. Yea! All of the major subway lines are very close. Very convenient for getting around the city. I recoomend buying a multi day subway pass. I bought a $25 7 days pass which was a really good value as I traveled all over the city. Tip: Get a \"City Pass\" if you plan to visit the museums and tourist attractions. It was great because you bypass many of the ticket purchase lines at the attractions. It also will save you a ton of money. I bought mine at the 3 hour around Manhattan Island Cirlcle Line cruise. Very interesting. Check it out at www.citypass.com. We saw Wicked and The Lion King. Great shows. These are still not available at TKTS (half price tickets) due to still being so popular. The hotel staff were helpful and courteous. They are New Yorkers however. I think some folks that review here don't understand New York culture. It is fast and succinct. This is not a slow paced Carribean resort. I would definately return to The Manhattan Club. If they refurbish the rooms I would even consider becoming an owner. Good times to be had at the Manhattan Club.

RCI is the timeshare company for all suites except the penthouse suites, which is affiliated with Interval International timeshare management. This is a great property on West 56th and 7th Ave.-near Carnegie Hall, across from Redeye Grill. Easy walk to small grocery and Duane Reed pharmacy/sundry stores. I stayed here before in a studio suite, which is okay for a couple but crowded if you bring a grandchild. The one bedroom suite with 2 baths is large for NYC with nice kitchenette, dining table with 4 chairs. Plenty of dresser drawers and two closets. Best king sized bed I have ever had in a hotel,too. The sheets had several large tears in them but were soft. Only problems were: 1. The elevators are very slow and crowded. Take your chance at the lobby elevator or the service elevator and hope for the best.When we were there, one of the lobby elevators was out of service for \"improvements\". A staff member told us the improvements would make the elevator nicer but would have no affect on speed - too bad! 2. Climate control can be a problem depending on time of year. We stayed in April and the rooms were VERY hot. You can open the windows but we had a room facing another building and ventilation was not great even when we had all four windows open. The temperature outside was between 48 and 62 F. We requested a fan but were told all of the fans were loaned out already for each day of our 3 night stay. We requested a fan twice a day for 3 days with no luck, although everyone was very polite. Why not put two fans in each room? It would have made our stay so much more comfortable. Management and the bell man told us they were not required to turn the air condioner on until late May. They said since this is a very old building there are only two pipes instead of four, which means they could turn on heat for the cooler months and A/C for the warmer months but never a choice of heat or A/C at all times. Everyone in the building was complaining of being too hot. We were considering purchasing a timeshare here, but the lack of individual climate control changed our minds. I would stay here only in December through March (good bet for the heater to be on) or June-August (good bet for the a/c to be on). The housekeeping was excellent, bathrooms were clean and of adequate size. Only complaint in bathroom is that there is a pedestal sink and absolutely no cabinet or stand to put toiletries. No hook on back of bathroom door to hold a hanging toiletry case either. Two nice terry robes were provided but only one hook in the small bath on the wall to hang one robe. The kitchenette had microwave,coffeemaker,small refrigerator, dishwasher, sink and small supply of dishes,bowls,plates and utencils.Maid service was provided daily (unusual for a timeshare) and soundproofing is good between rooms. If you close the windows, you hear minimal Manhattan street noise like horns and sirens. We ended up leaving all windows open to keep the room cooler. We were awakened by construction noise which we assumed were related to sandblasting since sand started coming through the opened windows on two mornings of our 3 night stay. We had to close the windows and leave until later in the day. There is a nice exercise room and business center, along with an owner's lounge on the 26th floor. Wireless internet was free and worked well in our suite. The \"Penthouse suites\" have access to owners or their guests by a key in the elevator on the 26th floor. I don't know if there are similar climate control problems but there are two terraces (north and south) with lovely views. Only problem is the very loud air handlers on the roof near both terraces that make conversation difficult due to noise.

There were no smiles and even a little small talk can go along way to someone when they first arrive in a new place, I just couldn't believe how unfriendly they all seemed to be. Thankfully the rest of the staff made up for it. The BELLBOYS are very nice, I'm sorry now i didn't write down there names, but they're great. Tthe CHAMBERMAID was the CLUBS BIGGEST ASSET very nice and very friendly. I was always brought up to believe that a smile doesn't cost you a thing but a frown can cost you the earth. I'm afraid the reception staff in the place are costing it the world and if i were the boss here it would be the one thing i would SORT OUT, BIG TIME!!!! All that aside it is a great location, close to all the usual things to ee and do and we will go back. NEW YORK is a geat city and i'm glad to say I found it to be a very safe place to be.. Don't be afraid to do your own thing and if in any difficulty just ask one of the street vendors, They are very good and seem to know the city better than most.

The greatest thing about this hotel is the location. You virtually are in the heart of everything, and if you want to go out further, just roll out of bed right into the subway. Thats how close you are. There is a ton of dining options around you. If you need help finding out a type of food, just check with the concierge, Furthermore, if you want to save a little on food, there is quite a few grocery stores in the area which would be perfect for your mini fridge in your room. Just a heads up, coffee in your rrom costs $2 per pack.. Just go to the grocery store, and buy your coffee, filters, etc. There is a coffee machine there for you use. Maid service is there daily for the mandatory $25 fee you pay per day, and it is worth it coming back to our freshly clean room. There is a business room on the 26th floor with over 6 computer terminals one of them being a a mac. There is also a nice size weight room with pretty modern machinery.

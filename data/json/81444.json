Staying here for the ease of getting to us without the climb. Always loyal to a Marriott when visiting San Francisco, but first time at JW. The location as others have commented is central; rooms are 'standard' but with many amentities such as upscale bath products, two full length bathrobes and as others have also commented....try to get a corner room for the extra size. This one that we are in is on what they call the club level since husband is a Platinum but they use for gold members as well if there is room. It is the service that is outstanding here, twice a day maid, refrigerator installed when requested, offer to change rooms if we did not like the one assigned...that kind of thing. Wonderful concierge (and in this regard we are very partial to Ric at the Stanford Court, our usual mainstay...but it is equally excellent here). The club lounge is wonderful. They supply little bags that if you prefer to take your food upstairs or wherever, you may do so. Also, lounge is open for breakfast SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. This is very unusual in United States. Selection is very good as is food preparation for the breakfast, stopped in to look at the dinner offerings when we arrived and also looked very nice. Desserts are extensive and this we did try last evening about 9 ....literally 6 or 7 choices and room for you to sit and chat comfortably and look out at a very lovely view. We are without a car but took the Super Shuttle here in 20 minutes time for 40.00 including gratituty for two persons. There are very good restaurants and obviously great shopping or browsing in this area that can be done without having to take a taxi. We are here a few times a year and in season you simply cannot depend on that cable car to get up the hills, the lines are l hour long at times and taxis are not all over. So, if you are here and want a good solid choice to a dependable Marriott product with ease this is the place. The layout of the hotel is with the space capsule type elevators which makes us think it was once a Hyatt or something else, but the public areas and gym/club level lounge are all newly remodeled.

The first room we checked into was a weirdly laid out room in the corner of the building that faced Mason St. There was no tub, just a shower, but acres of floor space. Everything was hunky-dorey until 5 am when the trash trucks started picking up outside our window and we never got a wink of sleep after that. The windows are all single pane and so not terribly noise-reducing. Or energy efficient. We asked the front desk to move us and they couldn't have been more helpful or understanding. We moved to the \"spa\" side of the building (we overlooked the neighboring health club) and were able to sleep. We even got a tub! We never ate at the hotel becuase within a one block area there were lots of diners/restaurants/shops to grab a bite. We did enjoy some drinks at the bar where John took great care of us in the evenings. While my husband slaved away in his business meetings, I went all over town and explored. The hotel is nicely located for shopping at Union Square, Chinatown, or the financial district. You could also hop on a bus tour (discounted tickets are available from the concierge) and see more of the city. I felt safe walking in those areas, but DO NOT GO to the Tenderloin District. The homeless are brazen enough in the Union Square, Chinatown, Financial District, and Fisherman's Wharf, but even the tour busses announce that tourists should not go to the Tenderloin. All in all I would recommend this hotel because it was clean, roomy, moderately priced, and ideally located.

Centrally located to the shopping in Union Square, walking distance to Chinatown, Ferry Market building and cable car lines. For car rentals, the Hertz rep was conveniently located right at the hotel concierge and was very helpful. We were pleased that they provided us with a brand new car, and included a GPS free, which we were able to pick up right at the hotel. The car drop off was conveniently located 1/2 a block away. After a long day of sightseeing, we looked forward to enjoying the free water infused with different variety of fruits daily. The lobby was very spacious with lots of comfortable seating. Room was bright, nicely decorated with a large bathroom. All of the staff was very friendly and helpful, including the reception, housekeeping, concierge and doormen. Some small inconveniences, we were not allowed to store our babies food in the fridge without being charged. They do provide the option of bringing up a fridge for us, but we didn't bother.

The lobby on the third floor and the property has gone through renovation and it is well done. Reviews on Tripadvisor complained about small bathrooms, but all marble bathroom was sufficient in all respect, bed was comfortable and noise problem was not an issue. I think I heard a siren once during my stay and as far as hearing people on the street below, never had any problem. They do charge $49 plus tax for parking, but unfortunately that is the going rate parking in San Francisco with in and out privilege. You can park in Union Square parking for $34 per night, but no in and out, so if you want to stay in the city, you will have to endure the cost. San Francisco has a wonderful transportation system, so if you are staying in city center, take the Bart to Powell Street station and use public transportation to avoid expensive parking fee. I did not dine at the hotel, but with so many places near by, no need to pay expensive hotel prices for mediocre food. I stopped at St Francis Hotel Lobby for 2 glasses of wine and one plate of appetizer and the tab plus tip was $54!!!

They have wifi set up, they should be offering it free in the room. C'mon! And it runs noon to noon, so if you sign up in the early morning you don't even get a full 24 hours for your $14! Same with parking. It isn't 24hrs from when you park, but from 5:00. I expect a bit more from Marriott, especially a J.W. Marriott. The rooms aren't spectacular and even up on the 14th floor I could hear street noise. Even in the business center they charge you by the minute.

Coffee was missing, no hot milk, no silverware, no juice but juice turned up when I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ordered it! Oh and newspaper two days out of four!

Elevators; there was one particular \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rogue elevator\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd whose work ethic appeared questionable. It was in and out of service or would just sit on the ground floor and hum gently to itself as its passengers stood inside waiting for it to get off the ground. Add to that the fact that the wait time for an elevator was about the same as a London bus on a wet Friday afternoon! Internet; sometimes fast and instant connection. Two days unable to connect! The explanation (I think) for the variability was due to the fact that there was a major conference taking place at the St. Regis and the JW Marriott just seemed to get overwhelmed.

There was a nice cheese plate though. $7 for wine and around $9 for cocktails. Lots of water and granola bars. Parking is $50 per night so we took a cab from the airport as I mentioned and then rented from the Avis down the street (675 Post St) at the end of our stay. There is a Hertz in the hotel but it was significantly more expensive. The concierge gave us great recommendations for dining and directions to various attractions.

This JW Marriott property is housed in a classic building with internal bubble lifts and the lightwell design where the corridors open up inside makes the property look very big and roomy.

There was a restaurant area but it looked little-used and was not even mentioned in the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hotel guide, so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say much about it. The staff were universally friendly and helpful. Always ready with a smile and friendly word. Check-in was quick and efficient. Of course, there were a few niggles. Things that might or might not bother you but as private (rather than corporate) travellers they did take the edge off the stay for us: First off, there were the seemingly unnecessary extra charges. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face it, this place is expensive; you are paying a location premium and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good hotel, so why charge $13 a day for internet access or $55 a day for parking? Both of these can be had for half the price locally so the hotel really doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to rip off their guests for these services. If your company is paying then this might not bother you but for us it just meant we had to spend a little time finding cheaper wireless internet and parking, time that the hotel could have saved us by not being so mean. That price premium is reflected elsewhere in the hotel - $5 for a couple of strips of bacon, $13 for a glass of chardonnay, $18 for a movie. At a room rate of $269 a night, they really shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be hiking up the prices like this. Only other niggle, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not so big, is the lobby/reception area. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one really or at least not on the street front. When you arrive it looks like the entrance to an underground parking lot, with a few chairs for smokers; when we arrived I first thought we were at a service entrance. Once inside it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a smallish elevator waiting area up to III, where the lobby proper is. Then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very nice. One more small thing: The room was a double, yet had only one chair to sit on to eat our room-service meals. This meant one of us had to perch on the edge of the high bed to eat. This might be a reflection of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more usual single business traveller clientele. So, in summary, it was a lovely stay, the room and service were excellent. If you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on any kind of budget and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind the slightly impersonal feel of the building and bar then you should have a good stay too. Oh, almost forgot to say...Make sure you get dropped off at the right hotel! There are at least three Marriotts close by and its all too easy for a taxi driver to take you to the wrong one when you first arrive - as happened to us.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Troutman, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "MSportsAuto", "ReviewID": "UR116345301", "Content": "Great hotel, friendly staff.

Our first impression upon entering the hotel was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and we seemed to repeat it quite often during out week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay. Check-in was a breeze and the ladies on the front desk were very friendly and efficient. There was a slight problem with the room type allocated but the ladies changed it without hesitation to the one we were after. Indeed, I was really impressed with one of the ladies who actually remembered my name when we stopped by to check something out later on in the week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that has never happened to me before! The lifts in the hotel are very different from any others in that you can watch the floors rise/fall as you go up/down because they are glass lifts. It did take a bit of getting used to! Our room was on the 11th floor overlooking Mason Street. The room was massive! A large bed with a sitting area to the side, a large desk with a comfy chair and the large flat screen TV. And a big plus from other Marriott hotels we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at \u00e2\u20ac\u201c firm pillows!!! The air con worked very well and you barely heard it working. The bathroom was massive too with a separate shower although it would have been better if the shower head hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been fixed to the wall. I liked the toiletries that were in the bathroom, the moisturiser especially since I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take any with me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and no, you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to pay for them! As for those who have mentioned noise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yes you heard the odd fire engine pass but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t loud enough to really cause any major hassles. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say we heard any other noises from either the street or the atrium given the way the hotel is laid out. The concierge lounge was a great place to go for breakfast or somewhere to go in the evening either pre/post evening meal. The ladies were very friendly and helpful especially the one on in the morning. And the view from the lounge earned another \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from us too! We ate at the bar a couple of nights - that mac & cheese was absolutely delicious! The bar staff were very friendly to you as were the restaurant staff the night we ate there, so much so they used to come up and chat to us when we were sitting in the bar having a drink. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that either the bar or the restaurant was over-priced. The location of the hotel was great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just minutes away from Union Square and the main shopping zone of the city. We took the recommendation of the concierge for a meal in Chinatown and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappointed.

There was something about plug sockets built into the headboard that was disturbing. The colors were bland and it was basically a bed, desk and TV. In fact, the room seemed to be built around this big flat screen TV, as if that was the only important detail to them. It was a standard room and probably meant for the business traveler. I did not sleep well, probably because my pillows were very lumpy. The hairdryer was awful and started to burn my fiancee's hair. We paid to store the car for a day, which was $50. Since we were only staying for one night, we asked the front desk if it would be alright to leave the car while we shopped. She said we had already paid for a full day's rate and would be fine. When we went to pick up the car, they asked for an additional $15, since we arrived at 5:30pm, even though we arrived around 7pm the night before.

I stayed at this location from 23 to 25 April 2011. I arrived on a Saturday morning in hopes of getting an early check in prior to heading off to a Giants game with a friend. I had requested two beds in the room and confirmed this with the agent at the counter when I tried to check in. She told me these rooms were in high demand and none were yet available for check-in. No real problems there. I am not quite bold enough to expect a guaranteed early check-in. However, as I am a Platinum member, I asked if I could wait in the Club Lounge until either my room was ready or I went to the game. I was a little shocked to hear the lounge was closed on the weekends. I think this is a first for me - every other Renaissance or JW I go to overseas (and often domestic) has this facility open on the weekend for the enjoyment of guests. I resigned myself to waiting in the admittedly expansive lounge area near the Front Desk. On the Sunday night of our visit, my friend and I visited the Club Lounge for some snacks and drinks. This Lounge features an Honor Bar, even for Platinum guests (at least if that is not the case, I was not informed). For those not familiar, this is a bar on a counter with little sheets of paper. They expect you to mark your drinks as you go and then give it to the attendee so they can charge your room. I refuse to pay for drinks at a Club Lounge, as they are often free at every overseas location (and again, some domestic). I did not see anyone else in the lounge drinking. There were maybe six other people. Once I went over to examine the Honor Bar set up, and I thought I felt the collective eyes of the lounge visitors on me to see if I would be the first to grab a drink and not fill out a sheet. I did not. The attendee did not say one word of greeting to me or my friend upon arrival at the lounge. Needless to say, we did not feel overly welcomed, and left shortly after arriving. It was a disappointing experience. People staying at this property should be advised there are a multitude of vagrants in vicinity of the property, especially at night. You will be harassed once you cross the street in any direction, guaranteed. Consider yourself warned. I secured a late checkout of 3PM on the Monday I was due to leave. Despite this assurance from the front desk, there were three different visitors to the room knocking. Between the cleaning crew and the guy trying to check the mini bar, I felt they were trying to get us out of the room. Also, my Guest Folio provided for the agreed upon charge, but the hotel overcharged me (as seen upon my credit card bill), and I am currently having to take my time to discover what the additional charges were so I can dispute them.

Because of the East coast snow storm our first flight was canceled and our second flight left Philadelphia 3 hours late. We arrived at the hotel at 9pm. Check in was very quick and we were told that the Concierge Lounge was open for another hour. That was great news as our son and daughter in law were on their way over to greet us. The lounge was empty except for the 4 of us and were able to enjoy drinks and dessert. It was crowded in the mornings, but evenings were very relaxing there. Our room was great.

I was disappointed at every turn. Our room (so so), our view (eh), housekeeping (minimal), the location (sketchy and blah), the bed (hard as a rock), the service (non existent, in our case - not even a \"Happy Birthday\" at check in our cheesy card like most hotels do), the restaurant/bar (FIFTY dollars for an average tasting, tiny flatbread pizza and two disgusting drinks from the bar). I'd built up so much excitement throughout a month of planning that while we sipped disgusting drinks on the night of birthday in the lackluster hotel lobby, I cried. And I am not a crier.

This time we are not so sure. Kudos though to the woman who called us (Sylvia, Stella...sorry I didn't write the name down) ahead of time to welcome us. That was superb customer service, and she is a great asset to this hotel. However, even her excellent customer service doesn't make up for other failings. 1. Valet parking was +50$ (with taxes) which, even for the city, seems ludicrous. We never even took our car out. 2. There is only one comfortable chair to sit on. The desk chair is excellent for computer work, but for cocktails and visiting doesn't do the job. 3. Charging for the Internet is ludicrous. If we had stayed a few blocks away at the Courtyard by Marriott it would have been free. In this era, charging for the Internet is like having to put quarters in the box to make the TV play or the bed shake. 4. Thank God that the windows open, because this hotel is like an oven inside. Even in the dead of winter (and yes, SF does get cold in winter) we could not have survived without having the windows open full tilt. Open windows also helped with the pervasive smell of mold (which is still better than cigarette smoke of course, so Thank You Marriott for blazing that trail.) 5. No ice machines. In the US. Really? When we travel abroad we expect that, but not here in the US. The \"butler\" service does gladly bring you your allocation of 12 ice cubes of course. Fortunately, there are several Walgreens nearby, and you can buy a 3-pack of ice for less than 3$. And there is no tip required. 5. The bathroom has nice stone work which is going to deteriorate quickly because they don't clean the mold out of the grout. I mentioned this last year when we stayed, we had a different room this year, and the problem was the same. A little Tilex would go a long way. 6. The towels and bath rugs were frayed. Like mine at home actually. But I wouldn't charge someone $200 a night to use mine.:) 7. Check in was S-L-O-W and we arrived about 7:00 pm,, well after the onslaught.

Weekends in downtown San Francisco are curious - hordes of tourists from all over the world give downtown give a somewhat theme park feel to the city. The absence of locals detracts from the experience, but that being said, the JW Marriott is exceptionally well located right near Union Square, and not too far from the BART/MUNI on Market. I arrived to SFO, and walked to the JW from Powell Station. Don't let anyone tell you that you have to take a cab to/from SFO or Oakland airport. Unless you have industrial sized luggage, take BART from the airport. Arriving early in the morning, I tried for an early check-in, but the room wasn't ready. This isn't a huge gripe except Marriott has an option for early check in - subject to availability. I wish they would simply remove this option since there's really only downside for the hotel. It creates an expectation for the traveller and makes the hotel say 'no' to something on first impression. Notwithstanding, they were very gracious to take our bags and we went sightseeing in the meantime. The room was exceptional. Sometimes the Marriott interiors are so generic it's impossible to tell whether you are in Bangkok, Boston, or Bangalore. This is different - great pictures with SF themes and a true luxury edge to the room made this very special. Service was very good - I ordered a wine and cheese platter which came promptly as promised. The cheeses were excellent quality, Stilton, Camembert and Jarlsberg and beautifully presented. I travel a lot and it's clear they pride themselves on going the extra mile here. Downsides: I don't blame the specific hotel for the early check-in disappointment, but Marriott really does need to give better guidance as to how likely it is. The only other problem was all elevators were not fully functional which led to some delays lining up for the elevator, but this was minor. Upshot is: An excellent quality five star hotel which meets all expectations. I do recommend travelers to SF venture farther afield than downtown and explore places like the Mission, Haight, and Castro to get more of a real SF flavor.", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat city, great hotel\u201d", "Author": "flyingquant", "ReviewID": "UR49393122", "Content": "I've stayed at many Marriott locations around the world and this was my first time staying at a JW Marriott.

That was the high point - and our first impressions were quickly extinguished by several cleanliness and service issues throughout our stay. Even more importantly, the high-rise hotel abounds with hazards to young children with some windows that are too easily opened by curious toddlers. In my in-laws' room, the casement windows could be opened entirely - without any stops or locks of any kind. It was frightening and shocking that a hotel of this stature would allow such a hazard to go unmitigated (Room 1109). Our room, 1111, had windows that were easily opened by youngsters - but had stops on them. Still, the window opened widely enough so that a small child might be able to slip their legs through - so we were still quite jittery about ever allowing our daughter to get too near them. The cleanliness of the hotel was also a big problem. On arriving to our room, and using the toilet for the first time, I noticed some \"resi-doo\" under the seat that I had just lifted. Disgusting. Also, the glass shelves adjacent to the sink looked like they had not been cleaned in weeks. The brown-colored granite may have been nice when the hotel was new - but coupled with my toilet discovery, dirty shelves and dim lighting - I got the creeps. Once in the shower, the water pressure was SEVERELY lacking. And I know everyone is trying to save water, but why do we need to be subjected to water flow that more closely resembles an eye-dropper? The gym contains some unusual and awkward equipment is kind of dirty. Definitely not a fitness \"club\" - but a smallish room packed with mostly treadmills, elliptical machines, etc. Go someplace else - this hotel looks like a Marriott on the surface, but operates more like a Holiday Inn.

The person who brought our luggage up was very helpful and even made a little map for us to get to the apple store with because I had forgot my laptop charger. The rooms were very nice. Equipped with a king bed and flat panel t.v., I really enjoyed the room, with the exception of the size. We ate room service which was great, though expensive at $145 for both of us. The room itself wasn't that bad for $255 which included parking. If you stay here I would highly recommend booking a rate that includes parking as I believe it's $35 or so per night. The location is very handy to all downtown has to offer and you are about 1 block from the trolley's. One other thing I need to mention is the JW's lack of wireless internet.

My trip started off badly and I had to wait nearly a half hour at reception while my reservation was \"found\" - - this was despite the copy of my travel itinerary and confirmation number that I provided. Not exactly the way you want to be greeted after a cross country flight, but could deal with that. Overall, I found the room to be very similar to other Marriotts across the country although the bathroom was a little nicer - surprising given the premium marque. However, my biggest complaint was due to the room that was ultimately found for me and which was adjacent to the fitness center. Several times during the early mornings that I stayed there (think 4am), I was awakened by several tremendous \"crashes\" that shook the wall (and consequently the bed frame) as if the 'Big One\" had come.

We had a rental car for one of the days in the hotel, but not the other two. First, if you have a car, parking is expensive - upwards of $50/night. There's no self park unless you want to drive around looking for a public garage, which I would not recommend. As with any JW, service is fantastic. People call you by name, the front desk answers on the first ring, etc. The lobby is beautiful and you may get lucky and get a high room overlooking the city. Our room was lower and was next to a business office. We could see people in each window working at their desks - and I'm sure they could see us. Room is quiet at night except for the occasional siren from the street (police, fire). The room is on the smallish side, but not terribly small. Bathroom is updated and new (clean!). There's a tub with jets in it along with a small shower stall. The showerhead was low enough so it was below my nose and the stall was small enough so my elbows hit the wall when I turned (I'm 6'1). The other odd thing is that the bathroom has no locking door - just a sliding door. So if you're with a family, people are apt to walk into the bathroom when it's being used. Beds are comfortable. There's a mini bar that senses when you take something out and charges you. You have like 10 seconds to look at something before it charges you. We asked for a fridge and promptly brought it up and set it up. That worked well as we were able to buy some drinks and keep them in the room. As with a JW, everything is expensive, including room service, mini bar, etc. Be prepared to tip people. The location is fantastic. A short walk from the hotel is Union Square with a mall, including Macy's. It's also the terminus of a cable car route. There's quite a line at times,but you can ride it all the way down to the wharf in about 15 minutes. It's also walking distance from China Town and North Beach. There's a number of restaurants nearby. We were going to take a cab to the airport at the end of our stay, but it turned out that they have a limo that costs the same as the cab (about $45 + tip).

If you have a problem with that you need to take it up with your \"booking company\". \" Although we had used a \"booking company\", with parking, our room was $355.00 per night. Not exactly a paltry sum in my book. I didn't really feel like we were being cheap in any way, but that is exactly how they made us feel. I definately had the distinct feeling that booking indirectly is looked down upon. We headed to the 8th floor, walked into our room and thought things might be looking up a bit. The room seemed spacious, and it appeared the bed was an Eastern King, so sleeping with my girlfried in the same bed 2 nights might not be as awkward as I thought. I proceeded over to the window to check out the view and was greeted by a solid wall of the adjacent building. I guess we would have to take that up with the \"booking company\" too. The last straw for me was breakfast on Sunday (our only meal with the hotel thankfully). We shared oatmeal, a fruit plate, muffin, and both had a latte. Our bill with tip, was $31.00. The oatmeal was beyond bad, we could barely choke it down. The fruit plate (one banana and a handful of berries) was $15. The bran muffin???????? I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.

San Francisco is a great trip if you're looking for a long weekend vacation. A few notes: - Cab from SFO to hotel which was located in Union Sq was about $35 dollars. As always, knowing approximate cab rates is always important so you don't get ripped off. - The JW Marriott for a luxury hotel is what you expect in a city like San Fran. Space is pricey, so the rooms were nice, but small. Large flat screen tv was a plus, but for a JW, the luxury was minimized a bit by the space. Also, the bathroom was fairly large, but felt very dated. Service is great though, with an in room butler button for your use. A few times I requested towels and other items, and a person came to our door in less than 5 minutes. As for the hotel itself, the restaurant and bar was undergoing construction which is scheduled to be done later this summer. Should be pretty nice as it'll be brand new. Hotel location was ok, union square doesnt have much 'sites' but a good shopping and walking area. Trolley cars and bus lines are just 2 blocks over, and the neighborhood is also walking distance to Chinatown, Nob Hill, the Financial area and a large mall as well. - As for attractions, make sure you hit the regular spots, nothing wrong with being touristy. I recommend: Chinatown is great for dinner (better dinner than breakfast to be found there) and the old fashioned bakeries are great. The Golden Gate Bakery has the best fresh egg custards. Alcatraz tour is pretty interesting, and you can purchase tickets in advance on the internet which gets you on the shorter \"will call\" line. For baseball fans, catch a Giants game.

I have seen Renaissance hotels (another Marriott line) and other JW's with nicer rooms; the look was fresh and modern but some of the furnishings looked a little too well used. Checkout was slow because the checkout through the in-room TV did not work and there was a lengthy line at the front desk downstairs.

There are no ice machines on the floor so you press a conciere button for them to bring up the ice. There were two complimentary bottles of water which were replenished each day. Their a good size closet on the on other side of the wall from the sleeping area with safe in the closelet. I really like properties that offer safes in their rooms. Also a bathroom that features marble and granite and also features both a separate shower and tub. The room was cleaned well each day. the water pressure and temprature were fine. The king size bed was comfortable. I was attending the Human Resources Planning Society workshop on Succession Management and Leadership Development at this property. Continental breakfasts and lunches served during the workshop were good. The conference room was long and narrow a bit of odd shape for a workshop. The HRPS workshop had both hits and misses.

The bathrooms are fantastic and the beds are extremely comfortable (even my \"mattress critic\" husband thought they were great). The only renovations still happening at the hotel is the restaurant and that was no big deal since we rarely eat at hotel restaurants anyways. We did try the hotel food once and it was very good. The hotel seemed very busy with room service orders. The customer service was not notch, probably second only to the Four Seasons hotels. They have a butler button you can press in the room and they send someone up to your room. I don't think we waited more than 3 minutes each time we used it and we used it at least once a day. Every evening we ordered up some ice. We found that by the third night or so that they started to bring up the ice automatically when they did our evening turn down service. Great service! The had refreshments in the lobby, which varied depending on the the time of day. I tried out the pink lemonade and it was great. Very refreshing on a hot day. The location is awesome.

This hotel was especially not worth the price when they are thieves! They wouldn't even reimburse us or anything, they just kept saying it wasn't them when CLEARLY it was. This car was not touched nor used at all the entire trip EXCEPT by their valet service who JUST was supposed to hold the keys in case they needed to move the car. They also switched their story on us like 5 times which was PROOF they took it. It took 4 months of them to supposedly try to figure out what happened, probably so that we wouldn't write a review on them. They did nothing to help or solve the matter but waste time.

For the first time we stayed at this hotel. We had been staying at the Donatello, across the street, but a price comparison indicated that the Marriott rooms were less than the Donatello's patio rooms. Thus we elected this J.W. Marriott. We admired the hotel when it was the Pan Pacific. It's windows and architecture are unique. The open atrium remains stunning. The street entry is nicely protected from weather. We found the personnel at the entry very helpful and accommodating and they stored my golf clubs without hesitation, retrieving them at my request and without delay. They made arrangements for a limo to SFO upon our departure and it was ready and waiting right on time. We asked for a high room and received one. We looked at one of the redecorated rooms on the west perimeter of the structure and found it extraordinary, though it was not then available to us. Renovation continued on the top floors. Our room view was onto Mason. It was very nice and quite clean. We guessed, but do not know, that many of the oriental housekeeping staff were retained when the hotel changed hands. They are top notch! The furnishings, though certainly not new, were in good condition and clean. All furnishings worked well. We requested an additional luggage rack and it arrived almost immediately. As we do not dine in our rooms, we cannot otherwise comment on room service, but when we left the hotel in the mornings, generally early, we simply spotted one of the housekeeping ladies nearby and asked for a cleaning. We never failed to find a cleaned room upon our return. We also found the front desk personnel to be very friendly and helpful. We tend to make our reservation many months in advance, with any requests for special services, so we weren't surprising anyone on the spur of the moment. We were treated well. We ate one supper in the hotel restaurant. It was not particularly remarkable, but, considering the available restaurants within walking distance of the front doors of the hotel, that is not surprising. The lobby bar stays open late and many visitors used it. We enjoyed the ambiance of the hotel and have read reviews here which lament the loss of the ambiance when it was the Pan Pacific. We can appreciate that view, but what remains is still an extraordinary hotel in a wonderful location. At these prices for rooms, one has many selections throughout the city, but very few that combine the J.W.Marriott's location, ambiance, cleanliness, service and amenities.

Before it was a oasis of class. Now with the changes it has all the charm of a hotel located near a airport. The carpet outside the guest rooms is hideous and loud. Looking down the atrium all you see is this ugly carpet totally distracting from the beautiful design of the building. The only improvement in the rooms is new, larger t.v.s. The new furnishings are bland and basic. Marriott did a excellent job in removing all of the charm and elegance from this hotel. People who have never stayed at this property will most likely love it because it is still a great hotel in a unbeatable location. But for those of us who knew it before the change it is very sad.

Four of us flew out of Honolulu on a red-eye and arrived at the hotel at about 7:30 am, bleary-eyed and exhausted. I had called the hotel and requested renovated rooms on a higher floor in the back (after having read various reviews of it being noisy with sirens, etc.), but I never asked for early check-in, but I did mentioned we were flying in on a red-eye. I never expected that either room would be available at that time, but our friends room was, so we could freshen up and leave our luggage there with our connecting room ready by 11 am. The rooms are elegant and beautifully decorated with the classic \"wish I had it at home\" Marriott bed and bedding. Large flat screen TV, many amenities and one of the most beautiful bathrooms I've ever seen in any hotel. We were on the 14th floor and we never heard any sounds of sirens, etc. and the rooms were extremely quiet and immaculate. But even with all this elegance we agreed the best part of the JW Marriott was the staff, from the bellmen to the front desk, concierge, restaurant, bar, housekeeping and valets and every person we met. They smiled, were genuinely friendly and always greeted us, gave some excellent advice on where to eat, made reservations, etc., etc. In Hawaii we speak often of Aloha spirit and it actually is a lovely thing, but we all agreed that we had found real Aloha spirit at the JW Marriott on this trip. Interestingly, many people here told me I would be disappointed in San Francisco as it was dirty, lots of druggies and homeless (I had lived in Palo Alto for 5 years and spent a great deal of time up in the city). I am not sure where these people were, because we all found it super clean, with friendly people, streets very clean and even the homeless we did see were neatly dressed and did not hassle us and we walked everywhere with no problems. Would we go back again - in a millisecond! It's a wonderful hotel with a great staff in an ideal location in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.

I was impressed with how quiet the workers were. They hardly made any noise and certainly had no effect on my enjoyable stay. They are closing one floor at a time for renovations starting at the top and working down. I think the top 5 or 6 floors are done. The lobby is scheduled for renovation beginning in November.

During our stay, our very nice hire car was treated with the utmost respect by the valet, the hotel doors were always opened for you (and the one time it wasn't the doorman apologised!), the check-in and check-out was seamless, room service was prompt with very good food and the concierge was particularly knowledgeable and loaded us up with informative maps of the city and Napa valley. The hotel is in a fairly central location; not far from the crowds of Union Square, but far enough not to hear the bells of the cable cars which begin in nearby Powell Street. The hotel rooms are well appointed with plenty of space, and are light and airy. There is no double-glazing on the street-facing windows, so unfortunately there is quite a lot of noise. For some reason San Francisco is beseeched by constant fire trucks and although we never saw any smoke, you'd think the city was burning down some nights! As mentioned in other people's reviews of this hotel, the bathroom is a little dated and a bit too gaudy for early in the morning, but everything worked and supplies were stocked daily. It was nice to have a cup of freshly brewed coffee from the machine supplied. It's little things like this (and having an ironing board and iron in every room) that help when you're away from home for a while! We managed to get a good rate ($239) but still thought that internet access should be included.

The gentleman that served us went above and beyond to meet every request including helping us negotiate the menu for our son who is allergic to egg. He had the kitchen prepare special chicken nuggets for him. (We have NEVER had any hotel or dining place go to the effort of creativity.) Our son was captivated by the inside elevator and beautiful fountain in the lobby. My husband and my meals rivaled those of our favorite places to eat.

My vacation is scheduled to end Sunday, but I wanted to get this down while it was fresh in my mind. The hotel is a nice hotel. However, I must agree with a previous poster and say it is a little dark and drab. I think because of the Asian theme. It is not as beautifully decorated as other JWs such as the one in Atlanta or the one in Cancun Mexico. Even though this is the case, it is still decorated nicely. This is what I liked about the hotel Staff: Upon arrival we were upgraded to an executive level corner room. Everyone from the housekeeping staff to the concierge is very helpful. The staff is always offering to help. Rooms: Again, I don't particularly care for the whole cream, brown, black decor, but the rooms are large with very comfortable beds. I will say it appears the furniture could use some changing out as the tables in our room had a multitude of scraches as did the chest outside of the bathroom. Room Service: The food was exactly as ordered and was good. Of course room service is expensive, ( Breakfast for 2 was over $40!) but it was really good. Location: Hotel is close to everything. We went to see a play at the Lorraine Hansbury Theatre and all we had to do was walk 1 block up from the hotel.....SWEET! Union Square is only 2 blocks away and Chinatown is only about 5 blocks away. You are also 1 block from the street car line that will take you down close to the Fisherman's Warf. The Bathroom: Great!!!! Towels are so nice and he products on hand are good too. Cleanliness: The entire hotel was spotless. WHAT I DISLIKED.... Small LCD TVs - These TVs are too small to be in these large rooms. Although they are clear, it is still very hard to see. Doesn't matter to me if there is a TV in the bathroom or not, but the main TV should be large enough to see. Decor: Like I said earlier. I did not like the color scheme. Made the hotel too dark. Needs color. I know it's the Asian theme, but if this hotel wants to be known as the JW Marriott and not the Pan Pacific, the decor has to change. The robes: C'mon.

Overall, my stay was mediocre and below expectations. WHAT I LIKED.... * Very comfortable bed -- comparable to the quality and comfort of a Westin or Four Seasons bed. Blows away Marriott's standard fare, and even their new Revive bed * Excellent bathrooms -- with separate showers/baths, good lighting, and lots of amenities * Hotel car -- which was available almost every time I needed a taxi.

Avoid rooms facing Post or Mason Street if you enjoy sleeping. Stay instead in the back corner of the hotel, though even there you'll hear a bit of noise due to the JW's horrible windows. Annoying! * Small LCD TVs - standard rooms come a 23\" Gateway LCD TV, which is ridiculously small given the size of the room and table it sits on. Can't a so-called \"luxury\" hotel afford 26\" or 32\" units? * Mediocre service - was checked into a smoking room after requesting nonsmoking. The next day while I was at work, the hotel moved me to a nonsmoking room without warning and neglected to move half of my luggage. Was locked out of my old room and had to visit front desk to figure out what happened. Good intent, but horrible execution * Dull decor -- interior atrium is a bit dark and drab. Marriott really needs to freshen up the design Overall, the JW Marriott has a ways to go before it can compete with the top hotels of San Francisco.

We stayed in the Pan Pacific hotel located near Union Square. It is absolutely perfect and we will never stay anywhere else when we visit San Francisco again. It is a bit pricey, but it is totally worth it. The concierge and valet are very friendly and will do anything for you. We lost our cell phone the first day there and they called all the airport shuttles and the airport to track the phone. Eventually our phone was returned from a cab driver and delivered to a valet at the hotel, who held on to it until we returned from dinner. Out of 21 floors, we stayed on the 20th floor. The room was large, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the bathroom was amazing! In the beautiful bathroom were robes, a small television, big mirrors, a telephone, a large tub and a separate shower. We also had our own personal butler simply by pressing a button. Our butler brought us sugar and salt for our food, 10 extra hangers, extra towels, and even gave us bath beads/salts for our bath. The hotel staff members are experts on San Francisco. For every question we had, and we had a lot of them, the staff had a prompt reply. They supplied us with maps, directions, and recommendations. Even after they stopped a taxi for us, they wiped down the seats to make sure they were not wet since it had been raining a lot. Every time that we wanted to go eat the concierge recommended great places. The hotel's restaurant was great for breakfast also--even though it was a bit pricey, it was the BEST we had in San Francisco. One day we rented a car, which our hotel set up for us. The car was from Hertz, which is literally right across the street and was luxurious -a 2006 Toyota Avalon with everything. If I HAD to name two cons: flat screen tv could have had a better picture and we would have liked the hotel to have a pool (even though we had access to one with a fee).

The lobby was very attractive, with a large, interesting sculpture, a seating area next to a modern fireplace, and a bar that looked like a good place to have a quiet drink. The restaurant looked a bit sterile. I did not eat there, so I can't comment on the food. The rooms in this modern hotel are all arranged around a central empty space so you can look down from a balcony to the lobby and watch the glass, pod-like elevators go up and down. My room looked very much like the room pictured in another traveler's candid photos and the ones on the hotel's website. The bathroom was very luxurious and attractive, with separate tub and marble shower stall. The hairdryer was not the usual one that makes some people want to bring their own anyway. It was the turbo type. There was no jacuzzi or shower massage, as some luxury hotels may have. The complimentary toiletries were very nice and included a shampoo/conditioner, shower gel, and lotion. My room was not on the street, had a view of the rooms of another hotel (not close though), and was very quiet. The room was an off-white color with attractive art. The turn-down service included chocolates, an ice-filled ice bucket, the laying out of the robe(s)on the bed, and the turning on of soft jazz on the radio -- very nice to come home to. A complimentary \"USA Today\" was delivered in the morning. The mattress was an inner-spring type covered with a filled-type mattress topper. The sheets smelled really fresh, and there were lots of comfy, large pillows. The furniture was nice, but the pieces had sustained some nicking -- perhaps from luggage or vacuuming. The carpet was very handsome. The desk chair was an ergonomic type. The room was separated from the bathroom by the closet and a small hallway. I agree with the other traveler about the in-room coffee. In-room coffee is always bad, but I thought that maybe in such a nice hotel they would have figured out a way to make it drinkable.

From the men who valet park ($40/d for in and out privilege, which is competetive if not reasonable for the area), to the concierge, to the room service, everyone is there to please.

The person on the front desk was friendly and professional and swiftly checked us in. Our room was beautiful (superior king). It was a large room with a fresh contemporary design. The bathroom was luxurious - a sunken bath, a shower with good pressure (a must!), large sink with a large well lit mirror; and the toilet was discretely tucked behind a dividing wall. Other reviewers have expressed concern about the noise so I felt I should comment on this. Our room looked onto a side street and although there was some noise, I only noticed this on the first night - for me it was just a case of adjusting to the city. Daytime concierge was very friendly and helpful - although we were given misinformation in terms of the nearest MUNI stop. A word on room service - in the morning the service was excellent - be aware that there is a wider room service menu than the room card would suggest - I made the mistake of thinking the breakfast choices were very limited and later discovered that there were more choices in the hotel welcome book! Regardless, the service was efficient and friendly. However, the same cannot be said for evening room service. We called down for room service at about 10:30pm and received no response; concierge picked up the phone and he said he would call us back, but no return call was made! This was a real disappointment as this did not reflect the usual efficient service. Breakfast was a bit pricey (normal 4* prices really) but delicious. I had brioche french toast with maple syrup and pear and my partner had a cooked breakfast. I don't go for cooked breakfasts because I find them too greasy/heavy, but his looked really good.

He seemed clueless when we informed him that we were expecting a bag from the airline who had lost our luggage. Then, he disputed our room rate. Basically, it was $170 for the first two nights and $150 for the third - booked through the hotel's web site. I asked for the manager who appeared - and was a bit nicer - but required that I pull up the reservation from my email and print out the confirmation. This, to me, is a bit much, particularly since I provided to them my confirmation number for the reservation. All in all, I find this extremely time consuming after a long trip. The manager did provide fruit and an apologetic note in our room for the next two nights. Further, the room was a bit loud from outside noise throughout the night. It did not bother me because I live in the city, but I could see it bothering others. My husband also complained that he could hear noice from other rooms. What's more, my husband said that the alarm clock in our room went off the first morning at 4:30 am (which we did not set.). Fortunately, I did not wake up!!

According to the Pan Pacific's rates, the cheapest room in the place is $340 per night, but we found a great all-inclusive deal that averaged out to about $100 per night. The service was above average, but not as excellent as all of the reviews that I had read. The staff was friendly and helpful, especially at the concierge desk. After a long travel day, our room wasn't ready when we arrived, and it took a little prompting on my part to speed up the process - which I shouldn't have to do. Everything else was extremely positive after that, though. The concierge was very helpful in booking us a rental car. The room was very clean and nicely decorated. It's not a huge room, but we weren't in our room very often anyways. Another note about the room - the street noise is pretty loud at times; I woke to the sounds of bottles being dumped into a bin from the lounge across the street and the ambulance/police sirens a few times as the windows are single-paned and don't keep out sound very well. The workout room on the 5th floor was nice, and it seemed to be getting regular use from the hotel guests. It was maintained very well. We didn't eat at the restaurant, and it didn't look as though it received a lot of business. The menu looked great, but was pricey. Housecleaning was fantastic! They really did a nice job each day on our room. The Pan Pacific is convenient for getting on the bus line and trolley lines. Most lines were 1-3 blocks away. Finally, I liked the 3rd floor lobby. It was a good choice for placing the lobby, as we didn't have to walk through crowds to get to our room. We could just bypass all of that with the elevator. By the way - the glass elevators are a nice touch! We will definitely stay at the Pan Pacific again. We encountered many other tourists at different SF sights asking us where we were staying, and they said that we were lucky to be there because of the reputation of the place.

Within 15 minutes of our arrival, we were in the room (our bags having been delivered without having to do anything), resting and so relieved to have a place to stay before exploring SF. What really impressed me was that I never heard \"well, it IS hours before normal checkout\" or \"Not sure we can find something\". In fact, they didn't even treat it as a problem as has been my experience at other hotels. They were just delighted to help us and did so in a very pleasant and efficient manner.

We run a B&B, so the idea of having someone else do the concierge, cleaning, and hosting was great. We were also looking forward to sleeping in as we are always up early to prepare breakfast for our guests. Check-in was uneventful and we got the type of room we booked (booked through Expedia even though a direct inquiry to the hotel showed no availability). The room itself was very large (it was a Deluxe King) and the bathroom was really nice. The tub with seperate shower was a plus as my wife could take a relaxing bath while I showered. It seems that the trend in hotels is to provide very large rooms. I don't understand why someone needs such a large room, particularly when they are very sparcely decorated, as was this room. It just made the room feel a bit cold and empty. There was a nice LCD TV, but again, when placed in a room that was so large, it looked really small. Believe it or not, I think a smaller room would've felt much more comfortable and luxurious. The problems began as we got ready for bed. Just as we were about to turn off the lights, my wife noticed a stain on the duvet cover. Upon closer inspection, there several stains (coffee, make-up, etc) and it became obvious that the duvet cover was just plain DIRTY. I called reception and the person who answered said he would send up a replacement. There was no apology and I could not detect the slightest feeling of concern from the person who answered the phone. Housekeeping arrived about 15 minutes later. Unfortunately, the person at reception did not tell housekeeping that it was the duvet cover that needed replacing, not the sheets. Housekeeping (who was very friendly and helpful) brought up new sheets. He looked at the duvet cover and said that they did not have extras. So we asked if he could bring us some extra blankets, which he did. While the blankets themselves were a bit ratty (one had a cigarette burn), they kept us warm. The bed was adequate, but it was NOT the Sealy they boast about in the book they have in the room that boasts about the high level of attention they pay to each guests individual needs. Rather, the mattress was a basic flat mattress with an old featherbed placed on top. We had asked for an 8am wake-up call but didn't need it. At 7:15am, we were awakened by the sound of construction work going on at the adjacent property. We could not go back to sleep. So much for sleeping in. Upon check-out, the person at reception asked how our stay was. When I told her that aside from the dirty duvet cover and being awakened by the construction, it was OK. She gave a nervous laugh and said \"Wow, that sounds adventurous. I'm sorry.\" I guess she did say sorry, but it was obvious she didn't want to ask any questions and did not want to know any more about it. So much for close attention to their guests individual needs. If this is what you get with a 4-star property and for $269 per night, they can have it.

I have found that you are the best source to find a hotel. My family and I were traveling to Yosemite and decided to stay three days in San Francisco. It was a hard decision to make but after reading your reviews decided on the Pan Pacific in San Francisco. What a wonderful decision. The hotel' s location is great -- it is within walking distance of many many stores/shopping. It is a short distance (5 minute walk) to the cable cars, Chinatown (walking distance a little longer), if you are renting from Hertz I believe they will do that for you (at least I know they will return the car for a $5 fee), and many other restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner. They are also close to several drug stores and mini markets. The hotel is beautiful inside and the rooms were roomy for 2 adults and 2 children with 5 pieces of luggage. The service and concierge were exceptional and went out of their way to do extra things for us. I cannot say enough about this place and the people who are working there. After going to Yosemite and several others places we needed to return to San Francisco for our return flight home and wanted to stayed again at the Pan Pacific which we did. The concierge printed our boarding passes for our airline and even arranged for a cab to be downstairs at a certain time to take us to the airport. This hotel even offers free car service during certain times of the day and several times instead of a cab they offered us the car for our own use. We loved this hotel and its location and would definitely stay here again.

The Pan Pacific is one of the BEST hotels I've stayed at in San Francisco. Booked through Expedia for (I think) $140 a night for a Superior Room. Got at the hotel at about 2pm, and they checked me in early, which is great. Check-in was extremely quick. I also took an upgrade to a Pacific Suite for only $300 for my 4-night stay. I LOVED the suite I was upgraded to. Now about the suite: Opened the door and heard lovely jazz music. Walked in and saw the living room. Very nice TVs and Bose Clock Radios. Also a very nice first bathroom. I then opened up the sliding french doors to the bedroom. Great beds, not too soft and not too hard. Just right! Great desk with egronomic chair. The view was great but I could see some buildings. I woke up one morning to a guy staring straight into my room from across the street. He was pretty far away, so it's okay. Very nice master bathroom with a small but good television in it. Very nice overall! Now about the service: Service was very prompt. Didn't order any room service so I cannot comment on that. Conceriege was great. Asked for recommedations on good steakhouses and recommended the Morton's right down the street. Housekeeping was great too, as well as turndown service. Great doormen, all greeted me by name by the third night. Opened the door for me every time I stepped up to the hotel even if they were talking to someone else. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION: Those three words came to mind when I first came to the hotel. One block from Union Square, 6 blocks from Moscone Center (where my conference was being held), and restaurants right when you step out the door. 10% off Macy's Coupon when you check-in which is great. Starbuck's is only a block away which is EXCELLENT since I practically went there like every two hours. Walgreen's was about two blocks away, which is also EXCELLENT for getting soda, snacks, and other stuff. RESTAURANT: Went to the hotel's restaurant for three mornings in a row for their breakfast buffet. No omelet bar, but hey who needs that? Pretty good for the price.

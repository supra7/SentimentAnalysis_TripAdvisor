And the Tuesday before we were supposed to leave for vacation, my boyfriend called to confirm the reservation. He had booked it online through Super 8's website, but didn't print out the confirmation. When he called the hotel they said that no one with that name was staying at the hotel at all; there was no reservation under his name. He even called corporate and they had no reservation for him in the system at all. He couldn't find the confirmation email and never printed out the confirmation on the website. So we ended up having to rebook the room for 20 dollars more a night; that's why we booked the Super 8 in the first place, because we were getting it for 50 dollars a night. So when we booked again, they magically raised the price of the same room 20 dollars. We told the clerk when we got there, but all she could say was \"eh computers, what can you do?\" She didn't even offer us a discount or anything. Now I'm beginning to wonder if it's not some sort of scam with the website. Quote you a low price, then \"lose\" your reservation only to have to book it again at a higher rate. The room itself was fine, it was pretty small and there was just the two of us. It did have a mini fridge in the room, but no microwave. The beds were firm but soft, very comfortable. The toilet had a hard time flushing, you had to hold the handle down forever before it flushed. And the water was so soft, it felt like you never got the soap off your hands. The hotel had an outdoor pool that was open till 10, it was very nice and clean, but it was a bit too cool out to swim. They also offered a continental breakfast, which was very basic, two kinds of cold cereal, oatmeal, bagels, bread, and mini donuts. They also served biscuits and gravy which were pretty good. The hotel also served warm chocolate chip cookies after 8 in the lobby. The other drawback besides getting ripped off, was there was no elevator in the hotel. We were on the third floor and used the stairs all the time. It wouldn't be a good hotel for someone who can't do stairs.", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Steinbach, Canada", "Title": "\u201cTerrific!\u201d", "Author": "John W", "ReviewID": "UR130522958", "Content": "My wife and I stayed 7 nights in May/12.

This is the perfect place to stay if you like clean, quiet, comfortable rooms, friendly on-site owners, excellent, helpful staff and interacting with other friendly guests. Free breakfast included (cereal, yogurt, muffins, fruit and biscuits & gravy). Best part - hot cookies and coffee every night! Location is just one street off the main drag in a quiet, scenic area right across from the Andy Williams Theater The site is central to everything you would want to do. Parking lot is level and very easy to access and desk clerks provided excellent, easy directions to all the shows, outlet malls, and other areas of Branson. Andy Williams Moon River Grill, Panera Bread and a nice Italian restaurant are within 2-3 blocks. Weather was chilly so didn't use outdoor pool but it was clean and in a pretty area. Owners were in the process of putting up fall decorations which added charm to the location.", "Date": "October 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lawrence, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cWe were very pleased.

It was extremely clean, the pool was clean, and the staff was friendly. The location is wonderful if you have needs such as the only Mcdonalds or walmart in town, since it is located less than one block from both. Very handy to the dam, silver dollar city, and off the beat food and restaurants. I would rate this hotel as a 9.5 out of 10 and I would stay again without hesitation. It isn't fancy but it is one of the cleanest hotels I have stayed in. The cookies are a nice touch to if you have kids that they provide in the evenings. :)", "Date": "July 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nb, tx", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "sightseerNb_Tx", "ReviewID": "UR69011350", "Content": "Stayed 4 nites and everything was great. clean rooms with donuts, bagels, cereal, fruit and biscuits and gravy for breakfast. the staff was friendly, especially Eric at the front desk, very polite, knowledgeable and courteous.", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat place, friendly, clean and great location\u201d", "Author": "timelessclassic", "ReviewID": "UR66364259", "Content": "My wife, son and I stayed at the super 8 over Memorial weekend. Have stayed at a lot of places in Branson and this is now our fav. Nice rooms, extra clean with all the standard amenities. My son loved the in room wifi (ugh) luckily free and the pool. Nice breakfast with a couple of different cereals, biscuits and gravy, juices etc..FREE fresh cookies every evening (also loved by hungry teen). Great location just off the 76 strip. branson was busy during the long weekend and the location was walking distance to mini golf, a couple of good restaurants, craft mall, outlets (hide the credit card) walmart and the ducks. the husband/wife owners were onsite the entire weekend (how often do you see that?) and they (mostly Elizabeth?) even served breakfast and made sure everyone had whatever they needed. My wife appreciated their guest laundry and so I got to spend some quality time with our dirty laundry...I thought I was on vacation...The owner even offered to take us flying in his plane when my son looked bored (which is always) but we had to leave monday morning, sounded like fun but not advertised just ask. Staff is really great they all seemed to love working there. Nice to see people take pride in their jobs! loved Silver dollar city too and the ducks were fun. Front desk guy showed us a couple swimming areas on the lake to cool off. We will definitely be back!", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Braunfels, Texas", "Title": "\u201cClean, comfortable, convenient , quiet and reasonably priced...\u201d", "Author": "CKH7", "ReviewID": "UR51368804", "Content": "Great centrally located motel that is off the Strip on Green Mountain behind the Andy Williams Theatre. I spent 9 days during Thanksgiving and really enjoyed my stay. Very reasonably priced, spotlessly clean, comfortable beds, nice towels, concrete walls that made it extremely quiet, convenient parking, yellow route for travel and delicious cookies in the evenings after the shows. I needed something inexpensive ($62 a night), clean and comfortable so I could afford tickets for 25 shows during my stay. The owners, Pete and Elizabeth Capko were visible every morning and Eric, the manager, was most helpful with directions and restaurant suggestions. Previously have stayed at the Hilton Convention Center Hotel and Holiday Inn, but liked the location and accessibility of this motel.

Our room was very clean and comfortable - no frills. Everything was in working order, and the beds were surprisingly comfortable. The young couple who owns this establishment are nice Christian people - Eric was just wonderful! He made the best cookies each night! My step mom needed help getting all of her stuff into her room, and he so graciously helped. The breakfast consisted of hot/cold cereals, pastries, fruit, biscuits/gravy, milk, juices and coffee. Not fancy but filling. The breakfast area was small, so you need to either go early or late. The staff makes sure everything is kept clean during breakfast time. There is no elevator, but both floors 1 and 2 can be entered from ground level if you park on the corresponding side. The third floor is the only one where stairs are required. We stayed 3 nights and it was always VERY quiet. I normally have to use ear plugs when I travel, but not here. And that was with a \"full house\" each night. The location is convenient to the shows, restaurants and malls as well. For a clean and comfortable place to stay at a great price (probably one of the lowest in Branson) this is a great choice.

It was very clean, when they cleaned your room. Our last night there was horrible. When we left in the morning, we told the maid she coul clean our room, because we were leaving. We were gone all day for a trip to Eureka Srings. When we returned at about nine o'clock our room had not been cleaned. The kicker was that we tipped the maid everyday. When my husband reported this to the clerk, he said they would credit us ten dollars. We were insulted! We had to deal with a pile of dirty towels, a dirty tub, and an unmade bed. The breakfast was sparse. When we went to breakfast there were two donuts available, and weren't restocked by the owner who was in the breakfast room. When a guest questioned the breakfast the owner said that's what you get for getting up late- so rude. Good luck in getting cookies, even with the sign that stated only two per person sometimes there weren't any left. You could get some if Eric was working, because he was the hardest worker there. We wouldn't recommend this motel to anyone!!!!", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belleville, IL", "Title": "\u201cVery nice\u201d", "Author": "pg211purple", "ReviewID": "UR37407574", "Content": "This is a very clean place to stay.

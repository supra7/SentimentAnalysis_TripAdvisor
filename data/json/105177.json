A group of work buddies stayed there this week and found the bugs all over the room and themselves. They had to throw away everything - clothes, luggage, make up - all of it. They even took pictures of the bugs, they were huge! Management at the Hampton Inn did not seem surprised when informed of the bugs - they did comp the room but no way that will cover the cost of the infested items or the terrible experience.

However, had to change rooms 3 times for various reasons before settling into room 300. Last room, end of hall. The major problem we had was housekeeping, which was very very lacking. Management always responded quickly and apologized, but day after day of nothing but clean towels became a common event. The next problem we had was that almost every weekend the hotel is fully booked with kids soccer teams. The lack of control of these hundreds of kids running and screaming thru the halls and stair wells aggravated us for 3 days each week. Plus the location of our room, we had the ice machine directly outside our door. 6 A.M. Saturday and Sunday mornings, parents and coaches began filling their Ice chests for the day. It was very irritating to be woken up that early 2 days a week. Joey, the general manager, and all the front staff are amazing and willing to help in any way. However, if I was planning on stating thru a weekend and was not playing soccer.... I would ask if there was a tournament that weekend. It's mayhem...

I think the lady that stocked it was Dorothy...she was very nice! All of the breakfast items were laid out and there were a ton of choices. The Bagels with Eggs/Cheese/Bacon were amazing!

In an effort to save money we stayed at another hotel chain up the street for half of our weeklong visit and used our \"reward points\" at both locations. This hotel was great. I think since it is directly across the street from the main entrance for Fedex World Headquarters provides an incentive to stay at the top of their game. The decor was very nice in color and quality. Dark woods with a soft lime green. The sofa and chairs looked brand new and good quality for a hotel. It has a rather large lobby/breakfast area and good spacing of tables/sofa/chairs with a large plasma tv. We were a party of four and and were dying for some add'l space after being cramped with the kids in a standarded double room with one tv and no fridge at the previous hotel. We were allowed us to use our points, however they charged us $15 extra a night to get the suite with the pull out sofabed, fridge, microwave, ceiling fan and two tv's....perfect. It was worth it. We looked at a total of three rooms. First floor was right by the pool, uh, no. The second room had two chairs in the front room instead of the sofabed, again we passed on that. The third room was just right. Breakfast consisted of the 5 types of boxed cereals, various juices/coffee/tea, breads for toasting, 4 types of muffins, fresh fruit, grits/oatmeal, cut up fruit medley, hot biscuits, and hot food that changed daily like Belgian waffles & beef sauage one day, eggs w/ patty or linked sausage another. The staff was wonderful. Always a good morning and smiles. They allowed us to use the meeting room for a team meeting at no add'l cost. None of our other players even stayed at the hotel. They opened the room and asked if we wanted it rearranged and even got me a blanket since it was freezing in there. Internet connection is free in the room and their Business Center, which was great since my son was taking an online summer school class. We did see security in the evening in the parking lot. Right behind our hotel was their other property Homewood Suites. You can use their grill and basketball hoop. There are alot of resturants in the area...Outback, Logan's Roadhouse, TGI Friday's. Beware going too far south of Hwy 385 on Winchester, it is seedy down there.

I am a hilton baby so to speak, i always try and stay at hilton properties whenever possible. I am not too picky when it comes to room, so as long as it is clean, quiet and convenient. I was given room 114 (apparently, my profile at hilton.com which states my preferences and my diamond level did not play into their room selection this time around)... i was on the ground floor, by the back entrance, right by the outdoor pool - people walking by would see inside my room if i left my blinds open, hence they were closed the entire time, the heat in memphis (86 degrees farenheit) kept the a/c on and the compressor sounded like thunder whenever it kicked on. Needless to say, i did not get much sleep all four nights... between the poolside guest who never seem to sleep and the back door in constant use, not to mention the a/c noise, it was not a good experience rest-wise! Other than those inconveniences it seemed like a decent hotel, the lobby was clean, free breakfasts every morning, free internet service in my room, the grounds were kept clean, the room was clean and spacious (see pictures). When i went to checkout and was asked about my stay, i reluctantly told the hostess that it wasn't really a pleasant one, but i was there on business so whatever... but she apologized and proceeded to take a night off the bill ($150 in all). If i stay there again, which i doubt, i will not be staying in room 114 or on the ground floor for that matter!!!", "Date": "June 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntsville, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay - Great Deal\u201d", "Author": "ragwag", "ReviewID": "UR4412492", "Content": "We stayed for 2 nights (Fri & Sat) at this very nice Hampton Inn. I'm the first to admit that I'm a hotel snob, and I sometimes avoid staying at Hampton Inns because of some past negative experiences. However, After hearing that this was a nice property, I booked five rooms, one for my family plus 4 other families (soccer friends). I found a great $79 per night deal on www.hilton.com (the 'hit the road' special). Each room had 2 queen beds plus a small table with 2 chairs. High speed internet was available in each room also. The rooms were tastefully decorated, and it appeared that everything was very clean! The tub area had white tile on the walls, and I did not see any mildew (a real turn-off for me). The breakfast is free with the room. Each day there was a good choice of breakfast food: sausage, eggs, biscuits, yogurt, cereals, bagels, pastries, and a variety of beverages. The property appears to be fairly new, and it is close to shopping and restaurants. All of the families for which I booked rooms were very pleased with the accomodations.

When I arrived in front desk called Theresa said I just have a 1 king bed in my reservation and for a 2 double beds she would charge me U$20,00 extrta per night. I took my reservation and showed her I booked 2 double beds but she said she would need to charge me for 4 nights if I wanted a 2 double beds room. I said ok but I would want her a letter saying that my reserve was 1 king bed and not a 2 double beds room. When I said that, she said..hold on..I will check inside and after a couple minutes she came back saying my reservation was ok with 2 double beds. Well, I knew my reservation was for 2 double bed room. I showed her my receipt saying it was a 2 double beds and she just kept on saying she would need to charge me. After my request of the receipt she decided to check inside. I was double chocked because I dont know if the hotel always says to people they dont have what they booked just to charge an upgrade and because just after asking for a receipt that I would talk to the company who selled me me to check my reservation that than she decided to check inside if I was right. The 2nd thing is, after all this problem she said she could charge me for gym and swimming pool because it was not included on my reservation too. It my first experience at a hotel that I need to pay an extra rate for using a swimming pool and a gym. I use to travel a lot, I am Gold Member at Star Alliance and I use to stay at so many hotel around the world and this was the 1st time I see a hotel charging for gym and swimming pool at their own property.

I skip my shower, and immediately check out the next day along with my other 2 co-workers. I called customer service 2 days later, discuss with my issue, and they only offer to refund my internet service?! I ask to speak to a manager and the employee told me I would get an email or a phone call to follow. Of course I don't hear back and I had to email them several days later instead (anybody see their consistency with customer service yet?). I get a call finally and an email back saying they would refund only my gym pass/internet? I paid for a hotel room to sleep and use it's bathroom, it's not too hard to screw that up. I'm not asking for 5 star service, but at least a clean bathroom and some decent customer service.

It was going off on its own, sometimes just once, other times a dozen times in a row. It was 4::15 am and I called the front desk. A security guard and engineer eventually showed up, but doubted my explanation. Fortunately the door bell went on a ringing binge while they were still there. 45 minutes later they had silenced it and repaired the HVAC system. By at 5:30 am, getting back to sleep was not going to happen. Later that day the front desk manager promised to have the engineer recheck the system, but refused any billing adjustment. Moving to a different hotel was not a reasonable option, and our second night was clicking and dinging free.

The affluence of asian visitors to the hotel is notable and so is the hotel's Japanese heritage. In everything from the hotel's restaurant (ANZU) and the room furnishings, you can sense the Japanese quality flair. The hotel, however, has not greatly evolved and under new management changes recently, probably should refresh very soon. Some details tell the age and lack of attention to detail quite dramatically, such as the torn (and sewn) drapers, the 1980's sound system and closet doors, for example. The experience sums up as positive in great part due to the prime location, a few steps away from Union Square, Market St and many other relevant places in town. This is the kind of hotel where service goes unnoticed and happens behind the scenes. You almost never bump into service people, however, service is conducted impeccably. The quality of the food is very good, but probably not the best Japanese/Asian that one can find in San Francisco, and of course that will always be a challenge in a city with so much Asian influence and so many gourmet alternatives. The hotel's fitness center and pool are a highlight and very good to excellent. The lobby lacks charisma and sense of belonging.

I booked an Imperial Club Queen-Queen room via AAA, which is the best deal you'll get at this hotel. We had free daily breakfast and afternoon wine/snacks in the Club lounge, free Wi-Fi, free rollaway bed, and free access to the health club/pool for about $310/night (plus tax). The room was wonderful -- on the 23rd floor, in the corner, and very quiet. Roomy enough for a twin-bed rollaway to fit. The Club level rooms are bigger, which is one of the reasons we upgraded. The furnishings are contemporary and the colors are soothing; slate blue/white/dark wood/neutrals. All the usual stuff for a pretty nice hotel room: iHome alarm clock, flat-screen tv, double-layered light-blocking drapes, large bathroom with separate toilet room and shower/tub room. You can even watch tv on the bathroom mirror :) There was a complimentary fruit platter and large water bottle upon our arrival, and nightly turndown service includes little chocolates. Breakfast: You actually get a couple of breakfast choices; either the free Continental one in the Club lounge, or use the two daily passes for brunch at Anza, the restaurant downstairs. The first morning we all ate at Anza because we got to the Club lounge within 5 minutes of closing, and the guy was already putting everything away. Anza has an expansive, varied brunch buffet, which included Japanese-style breakfast items (e.g., miso soup, rice, etc.), as well as the usual American-style items. The brunch is normally $25pp, but my husband and I ate for free with our passes, and the kids' buffet was $10pp. Not too bad. The next few days my husband took the kids to the Club lounge for breakfast (they eat fast!), then brought them back to the room, where they watched a couple of cartoons while my husband and I went downstairs to Anza for the full brunch. Nice for us to get a little quiet time before a long busy day gets going, now that our 13 yr old can watch the younger ones for a bit! And you get two brunch buffet passes per night, per room, so you may as well use them. Pool: Very nice heated pool in a large, heated atrium. Kids loved it. The only problem is the VERY slippery tiles all around the pool area. Holy cow, I almost busted my head open! The kids were sliding around, too, whether barefoot or in flip-flops. Hotel Nikko, please upgrade/change those tiles soon, before someone really gets hurt! There is also a small Jacuzzi there, which I enjoyed. Lobby/atmosphere: The lobby is nice, the staff friendly, the place is high-end all around but not fussy; more modern. There is a Starbucks in the lobby; always a bonus! Location: We did not rent a car, so location was crucial, and this place was awesome. 1.5 blocks to the Powell St BART and cable car stop. MUNI stops everywhere. We only took a taxi once (other than the ride from/to OAK airport). Recommend: If you are going with kids, I highly recommend the CityPASS. What a deal! It just turned out that everything we wanted to do was part of the pass -- for some cities it is not that way at all. We made huge use of the unlimited MUNI (bus) rides and cable car rides.

I recommend checking out the Irish House Pub/Restaurant across the street. It has great food/drinks and a great ambiance. Not hotel related but the taxi situation in San Francisco is terrible. If possible, rent a car or use a service such as Uber. It might be more expensive but you'll save a lot of time and headache.

My room looked toward the bay/ financial district. There are many great things about the Nikko, and a few things preventing it from getting all 5's from me. Firstly the pluses. Wifi and breakfast is included with the club room; the wifi speed is good and the breakfast was excellent - some of the best scrambled eggs I've ever had. Service was efficient. One morning, one of the light bulbs failed when I turned the light on, and without me having to report it, it was fixed by the time I came back to my room later. The gym is well-equipped, though you pay a one-off $20 fee, and there's even a Starbucks on the ground floor. The bed is also very comfortable with a selection of pillows. The only downsides for me? Well, Although the room had a decent TV, there was an old stereo system with no iPod doc. There was a bedside clock radio, again very old, cheap and nasty with no iPod dock. They need to ditch these as it dates the room. Better to just get an ihome-type bedside unit and do away with the wall-mounted modular system. Also, the great view out of the window was somewhat spoiled by the window needing cleaning (outside). And the window blind had seen much better days. Finally and most annoying for me; the cups at breakfast have a swirly handle that sprout on one side and can only be used in your right hand. As a left hander, I found this very annoying. Every morning I had to request a \"normal\" cup with varying success. The staff just didn't understand why it was an issue. For a city which has come to stand for the rights of minority groups, I found it uncomfortable to be made to feel so abnormal by my simple request! Rant over.

We spent new years eve and new years day at this hotel and stress levels would've been high but the staff certainly did not show it. We had a very nice lady at check in who offered us a deal. We were offered internet and one buffet breakfast for each of us (wife and I) for an extra charge of $30 p day which was decent since the internet charge on its own was $15 p day. What it did do however was bump us down from a deluxe king bed to a Queen which we weren't too thrilled about and although we did get a room on a reasonably high floor with a view, the bed was quite tiny. We were told that our deluxe King bed room would not include the internet and breakfast deal and we weren't promised a room with a view either so didn't really have a choice as such and we went ahead with the $30 p day deal. I think we might have paid a bit more initially to secure a deluxe king bed room so in hindsight from a purely economic/financial perspective, I don't think we really got an upgrade as such. However, besides that, our stay was wonderful. The mini bar is affordable. I found mini bars at some of our other hotels to be a bit more expensive than this one. The concierge was very helpful with restaurants. We wanted to see a bit of san francisco on New years day and they recommended two tour shuttle companies to us (I personally think the hotel might be earning a bit of commission on the sale of these tours) but I think the hop on hop off buses are good too if you want a bit more independence to decide what to do when. We used the hop on hop off buses in Chicago, and New York as well.

Valet parking is expensive, but we parked at a parking garage over the road which was quite a bit cheaper than parking at the hotel. Seemed to be safe and well run - we were happy taking the kids in there. cafe over the road does good muffins / breakfast very centrally located. easy to walk to union square and the trolley stop. However, there were a lot of homeless people about (some of them quite aggressively begging) so we didn't feel that comfortable walking around the area with the kids and took day trips away quite a bit after doing the \"must see\" san francisco sights. Burger king around the corner also looks like a homeless hangout. Shop over the road is quite expensive - we went further afield and found a Target to stock up.

That was kind of annoying. --The switches on a few of the lights didn't work, you'd have to twist them and twist them to get them to work--maybe.

We call back and ask them to at least clean the toilet and again 20 minutes later they send someone up and that person switch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s us to an even smaller room.

Yes it was my fault that I didn't get my paperwork out then, but once I had unpacked and settled in my queen bed handicap accessible room, I realized I was booked in a king room. I tried calling the front desk to get the rate adjusted as I didn't feel like packing back up and moving after a long day of site seeing, but they said the queen and king rooms were the same rate. noted. I just really feel that if you were booked into something they shouldn't have tried to put me in a different room. The other issue was that I had used the coffee machine to make hot tea. I use loose tea and cloth bags for tea. One morning I left the loose tea in a bag (they are larger than a normal teabag and are made of fabric) and the maid threw it out. I complained and was offered a free breakfast coupon. Great but that doesnt replace the cloth bag. Heck I'm several blocks from Chinatown and Id thought they'd know what loose tea looked like but I guess not. I did have an issue with the internet too. I called the front desk about the connection and they transferred me to another person. What they didn't tell me was that they were transferring me to an outside line and charging me for the phone call. FAIL. Overall not a horrible stay but not the best. Bed was comfy and clean.

Union square is very close, as are the cable cars, and the mall. A little bit more about the room. I'm only including this so that I can create a more thorough review, because I know that this matters to some people: The carpet and some of the furniture was a little bit worn. It didn't bother my wife and I at all. Location:The location is the only reason I did not give this hotel 5 stars, but allow me to explain; if you are familiar with the streets in this area (as my wife and I were), and traveling the wrong way on foot is not a concern, then I give this place 5 stars. However, if you are not familiar with the streets, you could possibly go out walking into a bad area. You don't walk outside directly into a bad area, but if you walk a few blocks in the wrong direction, you can end up somewhere you really shouldn't be, and for this reason only, I give 4 instead of 5 stars. The solution is easy though: Simply make sure you understand where you're walking before you head out, and you'll be fine.

The accommodations are great -plush, comfortable. I was lucky to be on one of the top three special floors with access to gym and free wireless, but even my colleagues' rooms on other floors were great. The hotel is centrally located to everything (2 blocks from BART/train, near Chinatown, short walk to Union Square, trolley lines, shopping, drug stores, even on Sunday this downtown neighborhood had a lot of activity going on and shops and restaurants open late). It was really great stay and great location. Service for rooms is great - desk service was a little slow at all times no matter how many people are standing in line. But they make up for it in the extent/quality of service they give you once you get their attention. There is also a great nightclub called the Razz Room in the lobby - they have these great unexpected jazz performers and singers almost every night. Meeting rooms were nice - the set-up of space was great (vicinity of ballroom to meeting rooms, locations of bathrooms, windows in most meeting rooms). The only downside I saw (from a business meeting perspective) is the limited food options in the hotel - Starbucks in the lobby closed for renovations when we were there, and there is no deli/coffee bar sort of set up in the hotel (except for full service restaurant); and the catering and restaurant are insanely expensive (a bottle of water catering price was $5.00 each, and Sunday brunch buffet- the only food option available in the hotel on Sundays is $48.00 per person). Access to outside restaurants outside the hotel is great (but if you have a packed meeting schedule and no time to get out of the hotel - you are stuck with the coffee pot provided in your room, and higher end full service restaurant).Other services are equally high priced ($19.95 for one day internet access in your hotel room, $1.00 per printed page in the business center). There is also this quirky \"automated mini bar\" in guest rooms that charges you automatically if you touch or move any item in your refrigerator (so no moving stuff out to keep your beverages or leftovers cold). However, the hotel was kind enough to bring a separate mini-fridge to my room for my personal items :) Overall, it was a great stay.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel downtown, beware of Tenderloin\u201d", "Author": "Tampapair", "ReviewID": "UR118483679", "Content": "The Nikko hotel was a nice hotel but not what we would call fabulous.

Normally I would not dwell on a neighborhood but another review suggested it is somehow adventurous or romantic to stroll through this neighborhood. It is neither, don't waste your time or put yourself at risk.

Hotel didnt have free WiFi, although the star bucks in the lobby does, and its quick even from outside, so no stress on that front. Didn't eat in the hotel, purely as there is so much locally. I would recommend the dim sum at the Chinese just over the road from the sbucks down the hill to gte right also the Indian buffet which looks horrific from outside about 100m up the road left from the hotel door was very good.....I live in bradford so believe me when I say its good! Also Lois diner is brilliant round the corner next to wallgreens. The room was a good size with modern fit and finish, also the gym is excellent and well worth the 10 bucks per room per start usage, for the sauna and steam room alone. Special thanks to Rick on the concierge desk, very useful guy who never got stumped by a question and was always keen to help. Highly recommended if you are heading to san fran, I went to the raddison @ fwarf to meet a mate and frankly it was crap compared to the nikko and cost nearly 3 times as much. Also the warf is very tacky and full of tourists.....which generally I can not abide! As an aside, I would recommend the alcatraz tour it was great (book online in advance though nearly half price!) Also get the cable car back from the warf not to it, the views are better in that direction and the Q was much shorter! Finally on the subject of parking, yes its a lot but not much more than the other secure options, and u can call from your room for your motor, so for me the extra few quid was worth the convenience, choice is yours!

The front desk staff seemed to have a distinct lack of interest in their guests which bordered on rudeness (apart from one older gentleman who was very pleasant). However, I have to say that the concierge was BRILLIANT and really made up for the bad attitude present at the front desk. He was friendly and really very helpful.

You will notice we rated this location 5 stars\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.which we do not give lightly\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but they earned the positive review for sure with such a polished product. As we spent a few days in Napa/Sonoma prior to arriving at the Nikko so we arrived by rental car. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit confusing to find the driveway entry but not bad. The hotel bellman took our bags, allowed us to park for 15 minutes to check in, and then we returned our car and walked back to the hotel. Super easy. Check in was quick and efficient. Valet and Bell services are on the lowest level, lobby is on the second level. Our room was ready when we checked in just before 4pm. Our return back to Oakland airport was a short 5 minute walk to the BART station, then a train to the Oakland station, followed by a short bus ride to the terminal. Very easy and not susceptible to traffic conditions like a cab. (Plus MUCH cheaper!) The location was about 2 easy blocks off the center of Union Square. We felt safe walking in the area, but of course keep your eyes open and be aware of your surroundings. Yes, the Tenderloin district is nearby (opposite direction from Union Square), but if you are aware of that, you can avoid the area. Yes, there are homeless people around occasionally asking for money, but that is the case with all the metro area\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6not just where this hotel is located. Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf area is a short taxi ride (about $8 + tip) or you can take the cable car. The cable car is $6 per person, but takes about an hour + the time for the line. If you have never ridden the cable car\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.of by all means, take the time to ride it! If the cable car is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153been there done that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for you, (like it was for us) than I would say save your money, take a taxi, and get there quicker! There were either 2 or 4 of us depending on the trip, so it was always less expensive to take a cab. Hailing a cab down on Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf can be challenging but we had success within 5 minutes walking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inland\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a block or two and being observant and quick on our feet. (Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look for a cab near a cable car or street car stop!) The hotel has wonderful gym with quite a tons of cardio equipment, (including TV's), a weight system, yoga mats, and other equipment all overlooking the city. There is a very nice indoor pool and hot tub. We used the hot tub each night. Both the pool and workout room were a comfortable temperature (which sometimes is not the case with an indoor pool) The locker rooms also have showers and steam room. One thing to note, there is a $10 per day charge, per room for access to the health club an pool. It was included in my corporate rate so it was not an issue, but something I wanted to point out. That being said, around 8:30 or 9pm when we went, there was nobody there to collect the fee. The lobby is welcoming and quiet with soft music playing. They have a nicely appointed business center but we never used it. Newspapers of several types were available for free in the lobby each morning. There is also a small convenience pantry next to the front desk. We never went in so cannot comment, but it is nice to have if you want something quick. The concierge of course printed our boarding passes for us, so we never had the occasion to use the business center. The hotel has internet access for a fee, though I am not exactly sure how much it costs, as it was also included in my corporate rate. The internet access was acceptable from a speed standpoint. We were on a discounted corporate rate, but still received a very nice room on the 19th floor. The view was nothing spectacular, but nice none the less. The room was quiet and we did not experience any excessive city noises. About all we ever heard was the occasional emergency vehicle. The rooms were nicely decorated, with full windows and very comfortable with nice modern decoration. The windows could use washing outside though. The king sized bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows. We called down to get some foam pillows and extra towels and were quickly accommodated. The curtains did an excellent job of blocking out the light. They have nice flat screen TV's with sufficient channels, and the room included a large work desk, plenty of plugs, a dresser, nice closet, and a lounge chair / ottoman. Our room had a separate room for the toilet, a vanity outside the bathroom, and a bar / minibar (for a fee). The sink, shower, and separate bath tub were in the main bathroom. The bathrooms were well stocked with nice toiletries and were replenished daily. Our friends said that their room had a standard bathroom layout. There is a coffee/tea maker, ice bucket, and mini bar. (No room in minibar for personal items) Everything was spotlessly clean. The climate control works well with the only negative being we never seemed to be able to leave the blower motor on for white noise. The towels were nice and fluffy and the sheets were comfortable. Across the board, the staff at this hotel was excellent and always friendly, including the valet, bell staff, front desk, concierge, restaurant, and housekeeping. Housekeeping always took care of any special requests and did an excellent job servicing the room. One really cool thing, the morning I was running the half marathon, my wife awoke a bit before her wakeup call and was in the shower at the time of the call. The hotel went above and beyond in my opinion, which was so neat. About 15 minutes after the designated wakeup call\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6a staff member knocked on the door to make sure that she did not oversleep. How cool! There are tons of dining options near hotel. On our first night we dined in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Asian restaurant. We all agreed the food, service, and bar service was very good, all in a relaxing environment. Though the restaurant was not inexpensive by any means, the food quality associated with the price is appropriate, and on par with restaurants outside the hotel. Room service is available 24/7 and seemed relatively reasonable. (Given it was room service that is.) There is no shortage of dining options in easy 5 minute walking distance and the concierge was always happy to make recommendations. There is also a Starbucks at the end of the hotel lobby. The only oddity I can really think of is that when we checked out, we had some $100 Visa Debit cards we wanted to apply to their room (employer incentives) and for some reason their system must preauthorize tips or something, so all the front desk could apply is 85% of the cards value. We have used these at other hotels without a problem. Worth noting for sure, but not a big deal\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..and given this was the only thing that was not absolutely perfect, I have no complaints. We would highly recommend this hotel. We are very happy having stayed here. Convenient to all the tourist attractions as well as our race expo and start.

Fridge was in room as requested which was fabulous since we were there to run a marathon and needed liquids! The only complaint that I have of room is would have been nice to have a large mirror in the actual room area to utilize as vanity. Hotel is located directly across the street from Hilton which was being picketed, loud blaring megaphones starting at the crack of dawn which is no fault of Nikko. Unpacked and headed to Nike tent for registration. Perfect location to Marathon starting line, not soooo close to be crazy loud but close enough to not exhaust our legs before a marathon. Loved the beds, super comfortable. Starbucks is located in lower level but the line was always so long didn't have patience to deal with it. Nikko also has a restaurant and a lounge/bar, didn't patron them but they looked nice. Nikko boasts an indoor pool/hottub/spa. After 26.2 miles of running we wanted nothing more then to soak in the hottub. Walked through the spa which was beautiful and hit the hottub which was lukewarm at best. We did call maintenance and within 10 minutes the water temperature was fixed and we were soaking our exhausted muscles. The hottub is a little dated but still did the trick.

I obviously will see much more value in the cost of my four nights compares to someone who will pay more than double my cost. Anyway, the hotel is in a great location (in Union Square) and near many shops/restaurants and in walking distance to many different places if you don't mind sweating a little bit. We actually walked to Lombard Street (Crookedest Street in the World) room the hotel and then down to Fisherman's wharf since the cable car line was insanely crowded with tourists and on the expensive end. This enabled us to walk through China town and North Beach and take in the city. It was quite enjoyable. The hotel is also a couple of blocks away from Blazing Saddles, a bicycle shop, which is very convenient. We rented bikes @ 9 am and biked through the Golden Gate Park, the Presidio, and then over the Golden Gate Bridge into Sausilito. We then took a ferry back to Fisherman's Wharf and then biked the rest of the way back to the hotel. As far as the hotel is concerned, the room was on the smaller end as expected, but clean and comfortable. We were able to get a mini fridge at no additional cost. The hotel had a pool and fitness area available for $10, which included a nice steam room. As fat as negatives are concerned, showering left a bit desired as the water pressure wasn't great and the televisions are not HD - these things could definitely be updated. Also, we arrived Friday night, gave our baggage to the guy in the check-in parking area and then proceeded upstairs to the check-in desk with our baggage claim ticket. We gave the baggage ticket to the lady once we checked in and also asked for her to charge us for the fitness center and pool area. We realized after an hour (after not receiving our luggage) that the lady never told anyone to get our luggage. This was quite an annoyance as it took a little bit for them to track down he location of our luggage. Additionally, that same night, when we went to use our card to go to the pool area, we were declined access. The same lady didn't add this access to our card as we instructed. The hotel could have comped us for the inconvenience at the very least. The conceriege desk is excellent and they are very helpful and accommodating. WiFi is available at a cost of about $10/night. Parking is extremely expensive if you have a rental car; we found a local lot for about half the price.

Upon arrival, we used \"Super Shuttle\" from SFO which was about a 30 minute ride, efficient and convenient. The Hotel Nikko is located in the Union Square area but very close to the Tenderloin Area (Be very leery of this). Don't be surprised to see the homeless going thru the garbage cans and ash trays in front of the hotel, it's not only prevalent near the hotel but this seems to be the norm instead of the exception in San Francisco. The hotel is very convenient to public transportation, The Westfield Shopping Center, shopping, food and Walgreens. Again, the homeless are all around the city, sleeping in public areas, camped out in front of Walgreens and other stores with signs asking for money, or walking in the shopping area asking for money as you pass, this was a complete turn off for our view of San Francisco and would not recommend it for a family vacation. Not sure why this is accepted, however, it with the very low police presence observed, it gave us a very unsafe, unsettling feeling. As we were walking to the Cable Cars one afternoon, we observed a very dirt homeless woman walking thru the crowd removing her clothes, when she removed her shirt and was topless, another homeless male yelled at her to put her clothes but she continued walking. We did not stick around to see what happened. It was unsightly especially for children present. The city in our view was dirty; areas had strong smells of urine as we walked down Market St to the Pier area. The people of San Francisco are very friendly for the most part, but we encountered several young people (both male and female) on the \"F Line\" (Transportation to/from Pier areas) on two different trips using strong profanity and vulgarity along with littering and spitting on the Tram Car, we were appalled to see such disregard to their surroundings and the city. Back to the Hotel Nikko, this was a saving grace, the hotel is beautiful, the staff was awesome (friendly and very helpful). We stayed on in an Imperial Club Room (24th floor) which allowed us to take advantage of the evening reception of wine, beer, finger food, cheese and crackers nightly which was a great way to begin your night time activities. The room had a king size bed/pillows that was so comfortable and inviting, the room had all the amenities to make our stay relaxing and cozy. The bathroom was posh and large, we wanted to take the shower home with us, and water pressure was excellent which lacked nothing. The Imperial Club Room came with a continental breakfast (Bagels, pastries, fruit, and cereal along with coffee, tea or juice) which was sufficient to get started in San Fran. We took advantage of the breakfast buffet in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant, Anzu, which was superb. They offered a full Japanese Breakfast along with a full American Breakfast with Grilled Salmon, Eggs, Sausage, Bacon, Miso Soup, Lox, Meats etc. (this was a gourmet breakfast). We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say enough of the quality of our stay at the Hotel Nikko. Thank you staff and management! Back to the surrounding area, we stayed over 4th of July Weekend. During our stay, there was a shooting two blocks from the hotel (Tenderloin Area) and a Police \u00e2\u20ac\u0153BART\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Officer shot and killed an armed drunk a few transit stops from the hotel. Union Square is two blocks away (make sure you go in the right direction) where you can catch the open top sightseeing buses, we took the blue bus but I would recommend the red ones as we saw a lot more of them and more frequent pickups. You catch the Cable Cars at Powell and Market along with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153F\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Line (Tram Car to Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf), the Cable Cars are $6 per ride each way and the F and buses are $2 each way. You can buy a weekly transport card (Good discount is you plan on using public transportation) in the visitor center at Powell and Market. The visitor center is down stairs on Powell at Market St. Shopping in the area is no way up to par what you find in New York City. We found some good lunch options on the lower level of the Westfield Shopping Center and they have a Bristol Farms (Market) as well. We will not go in depth here for the sightseeing we did, but highly recommend: Alcatraz (a must, but get tickets on line before you go), Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf (Touristy, expensive but fun), Muir Woods (Giant Redwoods) make sure you have enough time to spend there, AT&T Park (saw a Giants Game) and of course the Golden Gate. We saw what we wanted to see in San Francisco and more than we wanted to however, in our future we will go to cities that provide a feeling of a safer, secure environment.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guelph, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Mindful_Travels", "ReviewID": "UR115070851", "Content": "This hotel is right downtown a block or two from the main shopping.

It was our first time together in San Francisco, and the first thing that struck me about the hotel was the location - very close to Union Square and the city centre. We couldn't have asked for a better location to be honest, each day it was only a few minutes walk to the square or down the street to get the cable car. To our surprise, we also found when we were leaving that our car hire collection was directly across the street - very handy if you're thinking of staying in SF and then picking up a car to travel on. There is a large shopping plaza less than 5 mins from the hotel, with a cinema, huge eating area and an abundance of assorted shops. We spent a few afternoons here and with the hotel being so close, it was nice not to have to walk a long distance with bags. The Hotel itself is large and very spacious. Our room was clean, well presented, and again spacious. All the usual amenities were present and everything ran smoothly; our room was freshened very day and we had no problems whatsoever. The staff were friendly and courteous, and check-in was quick. The hotel has a restaurant onsite - we didn't actually try this due to the abundance of other local resturants in the vicinity which we wished to try out, but their menu did look enticing! There is a Starbucks downstairs which is part of the hotel lobby, but with an external entrance .... handy for your morning coffee fix before hitting the streets. There is also an Irish bar (Foleys) just a few yards down the street, we ended up in here 2 or 3 times and found it a very busy place with great atmosphere - would recommend it for a few casual drinks. My only gripe with the hotel was lack of free wireless in the rooms - you had to go to the lobby area to pick it up. It seems strange that it wasn't also offered in the rooms, but perhaps this is typical of the hotels in SF city? In other areas we stayed in throughout California, free wi-fi seemed to be the norm. In any event, this was only a minor quibble. All in all, I would highly recommend the hotel and if you're a first time visitor to SF, it really is a fantastic location to use as a base for exploring the city centre area.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cClassy for a business hotel\u201d", "Author": "thrall", "ReviewID": "UR114693280", "Content": "The white marble, multi-level lobby gives the hotel a cool, serene feel (disturbed a bit by in-house radio advertising their restaurant) as conference attendees and businessmen circulate up and down.

Ours had a walk-in shower in addition to the tub, and the bed was extremely comfortable. We heard no noise from the neighbors, though a smidgen of street noise seeps into rooms on the lower floors (you cannot set the fan to blow constantly to mask the street sounds). Room rates vary extensively by demand around conferences. On the website, they sometimes run specials for little perks like free internet. Parking fees are high everywhere in the city, and the Nikko is no exception, but they'll hold your bags after you check out, allowing you to explore unencumbered on your last day.

Other interactions with the staff were fine. Location is fine though there are a lot of tourists here and the Tenderloin, with drunks and street people, starts a block or two from the hotel - doesn't bother me much but does not add to the atmosphere. Powell St. BART is very close by. Lots of small restaurants and fast food places as well. Not too far from Chinatown and I enjoyed walking down Market to the Embarcadero. What didn't I like? Mostly the internet connection. It was usually slow, often dismal, and from time to time (like 6AM) quite speedy. Just not a big enough pipe out of the hotel. I'd have been annoyed if I had paid for such (was included in my conference room rate). The room ventilation was sub par. Most hotels have a setting where you can just run the fan all the time and mask noise with the fan sounds. In this hotel, if you set the fan to \"ON\" setting it runs for a while, and then shuts off. Then it will go off and on, apparently with the cooling only - that is what the \"AUTO\" setting should do. And the maid always turned the AC off - meant I'd come back to a boiling sunny room. The hotel sent a \"hope everything is OK\" emali after the first night. Cute, but they never replied when I asked about the fan. I was glad I have my own micro white noise source. The bathroom was fine and I sort of liked the \"glass box\" shower. But, despite the standard exhortation to hang your towels if you did not want them replaced, almost no towel rack space.

First, mini-bar has sensors, which means that even if you shuffle things around and move something to make room for your own items, they will charge you. Of course, that is written on some card that you should notice, but most of the time you don't, so you are \"surprised\" with \"refreshment charges\" when you take care of the bill. I have to say that they \"wave\" those charges that you actually didn't make, but why do you have to be stressed about it, what is the purpose of sensors anyway if they trust you that you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use anything? Then, you have to pay extra for the use of gym and pool. It is only 10$, but it is annoying. If they charge $250-350/night, and you choose this hotel because of it's amenities, how much money do they make by charging extra 10$/stay for the gym?

On arrival, I half expected the room to have been released. I was greeted by the night receptionist with extreme politeness and even got the chance to practice a little Japanese with her. I was given a complimentary upgrade to a Japanese Suite on the 24th floor. On opening the door, I thought I was in the wrong room. To call it a suite is an understatement. All it was missing was a kitchen and it would be a comfortable apartment. A massive bedroom with 2 kings and about 50 pillows... Add a lounge area with sofa and chaise lounge for the huge window. My view was looking along O'Farrell to Market St. The bedroom had the same view and instead of curtains, was graced by Shoji screen doors. The real star though, was the bathroom. set out in all black marble, it's a full wet room for the shower and massive soak tub. The floor has wooden Sunoko to keep you above the wet floor.

First- very convinent location, we got the map from SFO and took the Bart to DT Powell. The hotel was just couple blocks away and the prime location just made us love the hotel right away. They have assigned us the room early, staffs were friendly, but be aware that they will try upselling you with various upgrades, or accesses to the hotel amenities.We were assigned to a one king bedroom, and the size is okay, providing the location of hotel and the price, we definitely are satisfied with whats provided. Staffs are extremely friendly and helpful in providing directions, deals, etc. Bathroom are big and clean, except we were little disappointed that over the course of 4 nts, the housekeeper has not changed our toileretes and at the end of our fourth night, we were kinda running out of shampoo and conditioner. The concieges is extremely friendly, without realizing the BART doesnt operate till 8am on Sunday, they managed to help us arrange a last-minute shuttle that came ontime on Sunday at 5 am.

He eventually recommend and made reservations for us at this amazing small, intimate Italian restaurant in Nob Hill. It was perfect! He also had mentioned that Alcatraz was sold out for almost the rest of our stay. I believe there were two time slots left that we could make during our stay.

The staff was friendly, courteous, and thoughtful throughout our stay. Often times it's the little things that count the most, and Hotel Nikko pays attention to them. A bit weary from several hours worth of flight delays, being greeted with \"happy anniversary!\" by the front desk upon arrival really served to boost our spirits. Finding a complimentary bottle of champagne and a card in our room to mark the special occasion was merely a beginning to the personalized care we received all weekend. On two occasions, we opted to eat in our room. Both experiences with room service - breakfast and dinner - were virtually flawless. The food arrived on time, was precisely what we had ordered, and was an appropriate temperature (not to mention delicious!). I was still asleep when our morning meal arrived and my partner later told me that the gentleman who came to deliver it caught on to that fact quickly and went to great pains not to wake me from my peaceful slumber. Our other dinner with the hotel was at their restaurant, Anzu, where we had an equally exceptional experience: fantastic food and exemplary service. After leaving the Do Not Disturb sign on our door for a couple of days, housekeeping called to ask if we needed anything. They did an excellent job making sure that our needs were met while respecting our privacy. And when I developed an allergic reaction to a piece of new piece of clothing I didn't wash before wearing it, the front desk staff worked efficiently to help me get some Benadryl in my system quickly. In addition to the wonderful staff and food, we enjoyed several amenities offered by Hotel Nikko. We stayed in a King Room on the Nikko Floor and our bathroom was impressive, with a separate shower and tub. As two women who tend toward the femme side, an additional vanity outside of the bathroom was quite welcome! Our bed was very comfortable and there were no disturbing noises at night or during the day. Since water is one of our favorite places to be, it was a given that we would try out the pool. Although it was a bit small and somewhat shallow - 4.5 feet on the deep end - we had fun and were even able to swim a few laps. There is an Enterprise on-site and they were able to quickly pull up our reservation for a car. The Enterprise staff also deserves a huge shout out here. Not only were they incredibly friendly and helpful at the start of our rental, they generously stayed an extra few minutes past their closing time as we desperately weaved through San Francisco traffic on our way back to the hotel. A couple of important notes: 1) It turns out that our visit was just prior to a 6-week renovation of the pool area - it's now closed and scheduled to reopen on April 4, 2011. According to a notice posted on the wall in the locker rooms, Hotel Nikko arranged for its guests to have the use of both an indoor and an outdoor pool at neighboring hotels during this time. 2) While the in-room stereo system was a delight, it didn't have any built-in support for playing music off of an iPod or other MP3 player. We came prepared with both a \"mini stereo to dual RCA\" adapter cable and - equally importantly - knowledge of how to connect it to the stereo. The hotel staff might have both the equipment and the know-how if you don't, but better safe than sorry. (The stereo did have a CD player, if you'd rather go that route.)

The perks of the imperial club room are worth it -especially if you plan on eating the breakfast buffet using the internet, or having some wine/snacks in the evenings. For the few extra dollars each night, its not a bad deal at all considering the cost of meals in the area. Pros: *The location is near numerous transportation options such as the subway, cable car, bus stops, and trolley. Stops for either the cable car or trolley can take you to the ferry station or the Fisherman's Warf. Very close to financial district and plenty of brand name shopping is in the area. * In general the rooms were quite spacious. Bathrooms didn't feel cramped at all and were well lit. Bed felt just right. The CD player in the room was also a nice touch. Internet speeds were decent and did not experience any timeouts on my connection. Flat screen TV was more then adequate. *Hot water and plumbing in general worked fine. HVAC unit was quiet. We used the heater most of the time and it worked great. * Maids kept the rooms clean. No shortage of clean towels. * There is a plethora of car rental places around this hotel. There's an Enterprise in the hotel building. If that doesn't meet your needs, there's a Hertz and Dollar across the street from the hotel. * Service was good. A fridge was wheeled out to us free of charge for storing water and other drinks we purchased. * Our floor was very quiet. Did not hear any neighbors during our stay. * Checking in and out of the hotel was quick and painless. * Concierge was very helpful in getting our boarding passes printed out. * Breakfast buffet is decent. I thoroughly enjoyed it every morning. Cons: * Parking is expensive. However, there is a parking garage across the street from the hotel that is much cheaper. * Pool is shallow, run down. The pool area needs to be revamped. The lining that keeps the water in the pool is faded and the tiles in the pool area need to be scrubbed for mildew and dirt. It just looks like this area hasn't been maintained well for such a nice hotel. Pool is also very shallow - about 3-4 ft deep at most.

I accepted the prices because I just got in from Crescent City, CA, and just wanted to rest. Rooms didnt have house slippers and bathrobes and called housekeeping. That service was fast and good. Great view and good rest in the rooms. Eventhough the rooms were smaller, the bathrooms were better in size. Checking out was another issue.

I refused to pay the additional fees because that was not agreed upon booking or at checking in. I had to convinced Mr Tashima with printouts and emails to remove the charges. He agreed. When converting my JAL coupons( Yen <-> USD ), he made a calculation error and I mentioned to him. He was shaking his head and was rather rude and mentioned that this was how the calculation was done. I asked him for the exchange rate he had and showed him on my cell phone that the value he got was wrong. He finally accepted after he tried on his calculator a few times.

Upon check-in I asked for a quiet room as I explained we were on our honeymoon and were tired from travelling. We had booked a deluxe king room in about February using Expedia. Upon check in we were told that the hotel was fully booked (it was a Monday) and that they could only accommodate us in a queen standard room. We then very firmly stated that this was simply not good enough as we had pre-booked our room, were on our honeymoon and to give us less than what we had booked was less than what we had paid for and was misleading and deceptive. We then (at our initiative) had to haggle with the receptionist (who was incredibly incompetent, unfriendly and really needed to improve her people skills) to try and be compensated for taking the inferior, much smaller and cheaper room. We asked for continental breakfast each morning, wi-fi and use of the gym and pool (which quiet frankly should be included anyway) but no she simply could not give us all of that. She couldn't even guarantee that if we took the queen standard room for one night we could be moved to the deluxe king room for the 2 remaining nights. After arguing with her for about 15 minutes and standing our ground to say that we wanted the room which we had booked 7 months ago and paid for, and wanted to speak to the hotel general manager (who we were told was not available) we eventually got it. She told us that a VIP would have to be moved from that room. We did get one morning's free breakfast to 'compensate' us and use of the hotel's wine and cheese sundowner (which was pathetic to say the least) - which was big of them. Upon checking in to our room we were extremely disappointed. Gee I felt sorry for any 'VIP' staying there. Whilst clean the rooms are extremely small and dated. Having 3 suitcases, 1 carry on, 1 back pack and a piece of art we struggled to fit into the room comfortably. Lucky we didn't take the standard queen room otherwise our bags would have been in the hall way. After paying for wi-fi we checked out the Expedia website. There were rooms still available for the dates of our stay (including king deluxe rooms). We stayed at 8 American hotels during our honeymoon and this was by far the worst.

I suggest booking through the website because they usually have some good deals. I also suggest corresponding with the reservation office too, because if there is a problem, you have someone to contact. I highly recommend the Imperial Club rooms.

Not a big fan, but the Starbucks came in handy. If you decide to stay here, the Imperial floors are the way to go. The rooms are spacious.

The Imperial Executive Suite on the 22nd floor had big windows with a nice view, two queen beds in the bedroom, a living area separated by a partial wall, a large bathroom, a half bath, two televisions, hallway... not huge but lots of space. Beds were very comfortable with lovely bedding, bathrooms were great-- Furniture was otherwise a bit tired as was the carpet. But the room was perfect for us and very, very quiet. We slept really well-- not a sound from the hall or from other rooms. We really like the included buffet breakfast at ANZU --since we had coupons for two people for each day, we had breakfast there twice with all four of us. The other two days we had nice continental breakfast in the Imperial Lounge which was also included. We enjoyed the 5-7pm wine and hors d'ouevres in the Imperial Lounge. And we especially loved the large indoor pool, hot tub and locker rooms with saunas and steam rooms. This, along with free wi-fi was all part of the Imperial package. Our rate wasn't cheap, but nor was it particularly high considering all that was included--We paid around $250 a night.

The bathroom was huge and gorgeous with a deep tub and separate shower, tv built into the mirror and plenty of floor space! The room had a corner view and a very comfortable king size bed with wi-fi included in the price of a suite room and a large flat screen tv. The suite had a seperate queen sleeper sofa which I admit was nothing but wire coils and not comfortable for my teen so we had a twin size roll away brought up for a one time fee of $30.00 (some hotels charge nitely) the kids also had a half bath which helped with privacy. We really enjoyed using the fitness center and the hotel has a contemporary, urban vibe to it's decor. My teens ate at the hotel breakfast buffet which they loved and my husband and I just went downstairs for a Starbucks every morning that is on a corner adjacent to the hotel. Valet was expensive but friendly and efficient staff. The second night I kept hearing noise from the street at 11 pm (LOUD NOISE) and I was on the 18th floor! After an hour I called the front desk to find out the situation and the city was digging up part of the road downtown with jackhammers, beeping trucks, etc., until 4 am!! The hotel manager (Sue?) was very gracious and offered to move us that night or the next morning to an upgraded suite. We did move in the morning and went to the 24th floor Imperial Suite which is when things changed. This room was nothing like the Executive wuite we came from. The bathroom was dated and the grout was coming out from the tiles, the carpet was stained and the sheers on the windows looked as if someone had taken a knife to them and slashed them all the way down. The room had a musty old smell to it and the windows had a problem with fog and moisture. I appreciate the offer but quite frankly, I missed my previous room and would have gladly moved back if I hadn't had two teens who were so excited about their \"separate quarters\", I decided to just stay with it for one night but I was glad that I had not spent the extra money for an Imperial Suite, maybe they just haven't remodeled that far up yet or maybe it is a room they give to people to make them feel better when moved to an \"upgraded\" room.

I stayed in an Imperial King room on the 24th room and had access to the 23rd floor lounge but everywhere I went, from the lounge to the Anzu restaurant, the facilities were sad. Anzu, supposedly a sushi restaurant had zero sushi when I went, mediocre service and I ended up walking outside to have dinner. I'm writing this review from my Nikko hotel room right now and to be fair, inside, the room has a different (and better) feel than about the hotel. Still for the same price (almost $300 for the Imperial King) you can find a much better place, and for another $90 or so, you stay at the Mandarin Oriental or Ritz Carlton, either which completely demolishes Hotel Nikko.

However, the water feature wasn't working and appeared that it needed some major repairs. The carpets in the lobby needed to be replaced. The elevators were very, very rough - all banged up as people have stated here. In regards to checking in, I refused the upgrade and still wound up on the 20th floor with a city view. Reading through some of these reviews, the rooms must not be of the same quality. My room had two queen beds. The carpets were stained everywhere. I asked for a different room but was denied because there were no others available. I wouldn't walk on the floors without my shoes. I just couldn't believe how bad the carpets were. The furniture was all beat up - so worn that it looked like it was about to fall apart. The baseboards in the room were in terrible shape. There was at least an inch thick of dust on all the lights - especially the one above the TV. The bathroom was the only thing that was nice. It had been updated and was very nice. Bath products were a brand from London. Water pressure was strong. No complaints about the bathroom. The location is not very good. It is on the edge of a bad part of town. Be prepared to be bothered by people when entering and exiting the hotel. I saw a person get forced out of the Starbucks that is attached to the hotel lobby. Overall, my room was terrible.

At Hotel Nikko, the room was very small, the view was of another hotel, and wi-fi would have cost us $16/day.

Our bed was a double and when we asked about upgrading as we heard was an option from other reviews on Trip Advisor, we were told that the hotel was booked for the weekend and there were no upgrade options. The sign on the mini fridge informed us that everything was electronically monitored and if you even moved things around to accommodate leftovers, it would charge you...unless of course you called the front desk, then they'd only charge you $2 to move the things around. The bottle of water in the room was $6. If we had wanted to use the pool/fitness center we would of been charged extra. The furniture in the room seemed old and we were left wondering how this hotel has a 4 star rating. In our experience 3 to 3 1/2 star hotels seem to offer a lot more services to their guests.

Our previous hotel in the financial district was a much more attractive neighborhood for us- we enjoyed being close to Chinatown and North Beach.

We liked the location of the hotel but will not stay here again. There are so many other good hotels in the area, so don't make our mistake. We got a Imperial Club room to make sure it's not too small. We got there around 2:15. They told us the room is not ready but it will definitely be ready by 3. They got our cell phone number and told us they'll call us when the room is ready. We went to the concierge lounge and waited for their call which never happened. Finally, around 3:15 we went back to the desk to see what happened. As soon as the receptionist saw us, she remembered that we have been waiting for her call. Only then she checked to see if our room is available. They still didn't have any rooms available even thought it was after their official check in time. She asked us if we want to upgrade to a suite for $65 more?!!! Any other hotel, at this point would've said we'll upgrade your room since it's our fault that your room is not ready. We already had paid so much for the imperial level room and didn't want to pay any more so decided to just wait. This was just the beginning of their horrible service. That night when I was leaving the gym, I saw an Exit sign next to a door and by mistake thought that's the actual exit. Since there were no other signs there, I had no idea that this door gets locked behind you and you can't open it with your hotel key. I was stuck in a small hallway that led to the Fire exit. I banged at the door and tried to get their attention to open the door. Luckily, I had my cell phone so I called my husband. He called the desk and asked them to open the door for me. I waited for quite sometime and kept on knocking on the door but nobody showed up. Eventually one of the guests who was passing by was nice and opened the door for me. The hotel security never bothered to even call me to see if I'm out!! When we complained about the fact that they never called us to confirm if I got out of there, they were so unprofessional and rude.

All in all it was a nice stay that was a cut above a chain hotel Check in was prompt and efficient (at the time we were there at least; later on in the night there were some LONG lines), and the same lovely girl who checked us in also printed out boarding passes for us at the end of her long shift. I thought the Club Floor would have some exclusivity to it, but I think almost everyone in the hotel was staying on those floors! It was almost comical when a group got into the elevator, everyone reached for their keys for the club floor rooms. At any rate, expect a \"Grand Central Terminal\" kind of feel to the lobby and the public areas. The room WAS nice, but the entire design is a bit sterile. The king bed and bathroom were great. The view was OK, partial bay view but much of it was blocked by the Parc 55 hotel across the street. There is a complimentary wine and cheese happy hour from 5-7, we had to head to dinner around 4:30, I asked the attendant if we could perhaps have one glass early and a few nibbles of cheese as much of the stuff was already out.

Turndown service is offered for the club floor rooms, we got chocolates and our fortune on our pillows. Worst part of the stay was definitely breakfast in the restaurant, avoid at all costs unless included for EVERYONE with your room. We only had one breakfast included in our stay, the other one cost around $25 and was terrible. There are several reasonable breakfast places within walking distance of the hotel, these would have been better choices.

In principle I focused on a Superior Room but during reservation process (thru Internet) I realised that for a small increment in the price a double room at Imperial Club Floor was also available. This Club is located at the top of the building, floors 22, 23 and 24. The price included complimentary breakfast for three people (a $60 total value!), access to exclusive facilities, newspapers, free Internet, Gym, etc. Now, back home again, I am proud to say that I made a right decision, all expectations were met, no doubt, and Hotel NIKKO fully satisfied all our requirements. Staff personnel are truly professional, all levels, including personnel at the Reception Desk and in the ANZU Restaurant (used for breakfast every day) and also a super efficient concierge staff (special credits for Mr. E. Cerrillos) when specific information, not necessarily typical tourist information, was required. This is a very clean Hotel, one block away from Union Square and Cable Car stop in Powell Street, one block also to the huge SFO Shopping Centre, an very good breakfast with high quality food including but not only delicious fresh fruits (what huge & very sweet strawberries, never tasted same in my life, even though we have plenty of them here in Spain!). Also important to note, all major Rental Car brands are around the corner, plus a huge parking garage (4-5 floors) in front of Hotel ($15 per night if you leave before 09:30 a.m., which is a very convenient facility when all the Rental Car offices close down at 18:00 or 19:00 in the best case, too early if you decide to pay a visit during the day to either San Jose (HP Pavilion, a great place for fun!), Silicon Valley, Monterey, Sausalito, Sonoma etc and you return after-hours and need to park somewhere in the vicinity). The price of the Imperial Club room at Hotel NIKKO (mine was 2209) depends on the date and actual occupancy, as usual everywhere, but in my case was something like $258 per night (plus local taxes) for 3 adults which is decently balanced (cheaper, I would say) compared to similar Hotels in big capitals in Europe. Of course, current favourable rate Euro to US Dollar also helps. The bathroom included both a spacious Shower cabin and a Bath tube, plus a flat TV set embedded in the mirror. Plenty of clean white towels, no problems at all. Safe box and a Pioneer Stereo Receiver plus a 5-CD player (even 3 CDs with easy listening music) were also available inside the room. All in all, should I have any future opportunity to visit San Francisco, I will not waste one second of my time looking for accommodation. Simply I will come back to Hotel NIKKO. I cannot say that there are no better Hotels in town. There might be others with probably similar or higher quality and price. But I am pretty sure that I will no take any risk and will go straight on for a safe & good decision: Hotel Nikko.

Definitely a lot of homeless people nearby, but in any major urban downtown area, that is simply a reality. No issues with that. Hotel...only average. For the price paid, was just OK. We pricelined our room, and after reading the TA reviews, paid the $30 for an upgrade to a larger room, on a higher floor. Very glad we did. Did not pay for the upgrade to the Imperial Level (club level). I'm sure that those rooms are nice, but declined that $90 upcharge...stayed with the $30 bump. High floor, very quiet, pretty nice amenities. Had the minibar and the robes. Again, for the price, not bad. But not that great either. To give just one example...the furnishings. As another reviewer noted earlier, the furnishings were very very dinged up and worn. Note, I did not stutter with my typing \"very\" twice there. Meant to do that, to underscore just how worn the furnishings were. I couldn't believe it. In other hotel stays, when I've read similar comments about dinged up furnishings, most of the time I simply chock those bad reviews up to nit-picky people, expecting too much. Not the case with the Nikko, at least the room we had. The side table, next to the reading chair, was scraped and scratched like you couldn't believe....not exaggerating this to make a point. Just trying to relay our experience. One last thing...cleanliness. A little spotty. This was perhaps the most disappointing part, because all it takes to correct this is some elbow grease and care from housekeeping. Desk, table, dresser not wiped down properly, etc., etc. In summary, if you get a good price, and do a small upgrade, you can't go wrong with choosing the Nikko.

We didn't ask, nor did we pay more, but boy, did we luck out. The floor-to-ceiling window faced downtown San Fran and the ocean in the distance. The room had a mini-bar, CD system, flat-screen television, and free wireless internet. The bathroom was massive with both a bathtub and glass shower. There's even a small television screen embedded in the mirror! Pretty nifty. Imperial Club access was quite a treat. The Club Lounge was located on the 23rd floor, and between 5pm-7pm, they served beer, wine, cheese, and crackers. A good continental breakfast was served in the morning. I'd definitely stay at the Nikko again, but considering the other reviews, it looks like staying on one of the Imperial Club floors will make the experience much better.", "Date": "July 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "nevada", "Title": "\u201chighly recommended\u201d", "Author": "sikat2009", "ReviewID": "UR34870064", "Content": "i recently attended a conference here last week.stayed 5 nights . service and staff - 5 star rating room - high floor with partial view of the bay - partial b/c some other buildings were blocking the view.the room itself was small by my standards,but clean and comfortable;the bathroom an upgrade and was excellent.the breakfast buffet at the japanese restaurant was monotonous and not really anything out of the ordinary.on the 5th floor id their huge healh club with a pool spa etc...one of the biggest I ve ever seen in a hotel of this star rating. i've been to many hotels in my life, and this has to rank right up there on many levels.it is within walking distance of many sights;the BART station is about a 7 minute easy walk and the cable car station is even less. the only drawback locationwise is that it sits at the edge of the tenderloin district,which is sort of an area you would not like to wander in at night.if you walk in the opposite direction, then you're headed towards union square.the MOMA is about the 20 min walk and the financial district is about the same. parking will set you back 45 usd/day-don't bring a car if you don't have to.there is no shortage of tours etc...to show you the basic SF stuff. when in sf,you should try this hotel first ,unless you're on a budget,but what the heck - live a little,life will pass you by", "Date": "July 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aromas, California", "Title": "\u201cWorn Out Furnishings\u201d", "Author": "LeftenantMonterey_CA", "ReviewID": "UR34590027", "Content": "We booked the Nikko as a four-star hotel from Hotwire for $98.

The room itself has nothing on the walls other than a black rimmed mirror. A picture wouldn't have hurt but put in a hospital bed and some EKG machines and it could easily be a hospital! The bathroom, however, was very nice with a nice textured wallpaper and attractive, modern sink and faucets. I got the Nikko for 2 nights at $80 a night on Priceline. Be WARNED if you use priceline...they will put you in a petite queen room unless you want to pay $30 extra. I didn't pay extra and the petite queen was fine but you should not take it if there are more than 2 people or you don't like close quarters. The room was small but efficient with a comfortable bed, desk, large flat screen tv, and closet. Check in was fast and efficient. If you are up for it, I walked from the hotel to the Wharf area but it is a rather long trek (about 20-25 mins) but it's a great way to see the city. Watch out for steep hills and homeless people! Other than that, the hotel is close to all sorts of great shopping in San Francisco with Market St. mere minutes away. Couldn't ask for a better location. If you want to use the gym or pool prepare to pay extra. I didn't and got plenty of exercise walking around. Internet is $10.85 for 24 hours.

Internet was I believe $13 extra each day, which is not bad by some hotel standards but some may find too pricey. The room was clean and the en-suite perfectly acceptable.

Planned to stay in the city without a car so wanted a decent hotel in a central location. Hotel Nikko seemed to get lots of positive reviews from TripAdvisor and we initially booked a fully refundable internet rate on the hotel's website (approx. $200 a night). Later found a 30% off sale on Expedia of an Imperial Club floor room (floors 22-24) which gave access to a free (elaborate) continental breakfast in the 23rd floor lounge or the buffet in the hotel restaurant Anzu (normally $20 pp.), plus free beer, wine and soft drinks/cheese and crackers every evening from 5-7 pm (approx. $230 a night rather than $330). I booked it and never saw it offered again - half assumed it was a mistake it was such a good deal. At hotel check-in was informed that Expedia's message indicated one king bed rather than the two beds we needed. Helpful reception agent accommodated us and we spent the week in the nicest hotel room I have ever stayed in - two queen beds, spacious, clean, modern (flat screen TV on the wall and a small one in the mirror of the bathroom!). Great view from the 23rd floor. NY Times delivered every morning. Can not say enough about the access to the 23rd floor lounge - so nice to walk across the hall to the lounge for a cup of coffee, read the paper, check the complimentary internet, etc. while rest of family slept. Great location - we bought week-long Muni passes giving unlimited use of cable cars, buses and streetcars. Since many bus lines pass w/i a block of Union Square we easily got anywhere we wanted to go. We used the historic \"F\" streetcars on Market a lot - takes you down to the Ferry Building and Fisherman's Wharf. The Powell/Market cable car is always jammed - go down towards the Ferry Bldg. to the start of the California Street cable car - no waiting! Wanted to do a one-day car rental (Sonoma, Muir Woods) and saw many Trip Advisor reviews not too positive of the Enterprise Car Rental w/i the Hotel Nikko. Checked around the day before we wanted to rent (on a Wednesday) and all the other car rental places near Union Square were sold out. I stopped by Enterprise and since I was staying there, they found a car for us - got it late morning but it was great, wonderful service from the manager. Also saw Trip Advisor comments about homeless in area - really was not a problem, we would just say \"no thanks\" and they would move on. San Francisco was a wonderful city for a family vacation and the Hotel Nikko was perfect for our family. A main reason we initially focused on the Hotel Nikko was the indoor pool.

We booked a room in their Imperial Club (upper floors, keycard access, etc) through Expedia, which turned out to be an OK deal on price. Location: Nikko is located one block south west of Union Square. The location is very good for reaching the stores around the square and also for reaching the interesting SoMa district, which includes among other the Yerba Buena Gardens and the SF Museum of Modern Art. There are lots of bums and panhandlers in the streets surrounding the hotel(the same applies for the next door Parc55, Hilton, Clift, etc.). We were not really bothered by this, but travellers made uncomfortable by this should opt for lodging on the east side of Union Square. The hotel's parking option is expensive. There are a number of parking options in the area, most at 30-40% lower daily rack valet rates than the hotel (but the hotel offers deals including parking which would reduce the price difference). Room: The Imperial Club room on the 22 floor was OK spacious, with a larger than usual bathroom (separate shower and tub). The room was carpeted (a minus in itself). There were some cigarette burn marks in the carpet and some detailing was a bit worn. Apart from that, it was decent enough. Although we had requested a non-smoking room, none were available upon check-in (we showed up at ca 2.45 PM). We accepted the room based on the front desks promise that it would not smell too bad, as even their smoking rooms \"were not usually smoked in\". We would describe the smell in the room as the smell found in the living room of your grandfather who smokes one or two a day. The minibar was stocked, the coffee on offer for the machine was good and the wireless internet was working. Some reviews of Nikko talk about mildew etc in the bathroom, we found none of this. It was well kept and 100% clean. Other: We had breakfast included in the rate, and could choose between the breakfast in the Imperial Club Lounge and the one served in the downstars Anzu restaurant. We tried both. The one served in the lounge is simpler (cereal, juice, coffee, croissants/danish, fruit salad) but is served in a more quiet setting, whereas the one below also features egg/bacon and a selection of Japanese breakfast staples. We did not try the gym or pool. The staff was helpful and courteous and all the common areas was spotless and well kept. Our opinion is that the Nikko offers good accomodation at a good spot.

There was a long queue to check in and a bit of a wait. In time I was shown the room. Obviously this is a Japanese hotel and Japanese make up a large proportion of the guests. Japanese tend to be heavy smokers. I had booked a non smoking room. It was obvious that someone had smoked in the first room I was shown which was a petite queen room. I therefore asked for another room. I noticed in any event that the furniture in the first room was very worn and the room did not have a good feel to it. My opinion of the room was that it was tatty with marked furniture which was not of the standard you expect from what is supposed to be a luxury hotel. The second room I was shown was in even worse condition. The furniture was even more tatty, the room smelt [but not of smoke - more like a faint burning plastic] and to my horror, I saw that a light socket by the entrance had been completely smashed in so that there was, in effect, a gaping hole in the wall. I was shocked as I was paying for, and expecting, a luxury hotel. The state of the room was totally unacceptable. I complained to the front desk about it and the gentleman who picked up the phone did not care less. I said the standard of the room was unacceptable - he said if I wanted a better room I would have to pay for it!! I asked to speak to the manager - they said he was in a meeting. I have never encountered such a rude individual on the front desk in all my years of travelling. In time the head of housekeeping came up. I said the state of the room was unacceptable and did they really think that a gaping hole in the wall was good enough in what is supposed to be a luxury hotel. She couldn't have cared less. At this point I left the hotel to return my rental car as it was due back, on the understanding that I would speak to the manager upon my return. When I came back the head of housekeeping had had maintenance in to change the light socket so that there was no gaping hole any more and had plugged in an air freshener. This was not good enough - I should have been upgraded to a better room immediately. As the phone in the room now appeared to be broken, and would no longer work, I had to go down to the front desk - to another queue and the manager was still \"in a meeting\". My experience at this hotel is that they could not care less about the satisfaction of their guests. The Hotel Manager should be sacked immediately for not having procedures in place for this kind of occurrence. At this point one of the front desk staff recognised that my treatment was unacceptable and offered to upgrade my room. However it was too late.

It was exactly as described by others: (1) a nice hotel, (2) was withing walking distance of some nice restaurants, w/good food, (3) near cable car/trolleys, (4) near great shopping!. Previous reviewers were also correct, though, that it bordered on a not so nice area, so the street was a bit dirty, would be bums/ homeless people around, esp. at night, so really did not like walking in the street in the evenings--although I will admit that there were ALWAYS lots of people walking around, so it still felt somewhat safe.; and during the day it was fine. The hotel is nice, the rooms are nice--not spectacular--but nice. We did NOT like the fact that you had to PAY a separate fee to use the indoor gym and indoor pool! They really need to change that.

Called again and they said they would get someone up right away and waited another 30min. NO one came. Called again very upset at this point told them I'd be in th room another 10 min, if they could not have someone come up by that time we would have to do this after I returned back to the hotel.

Minutes from Chinatown on foot, and loads of restaurants (and shops) on your doorstep. Staff were really helpful - due to being full they couldn't upgrade us on the first night but recognised us in the lobby and asked us the day after if we'd like an upgrade - to a much larger room with a great view over the city. Rooms were clean and very modern (aside from comment above), lobby really plush with running water channels etc - really cool! Not overly expensive for what you get. Really nice bar with mirrored roof which made for interesting photos!! Overall, may not have been delighted if we hadn't been upgraded, but a great hotel in a convenient location.

There were a few things I should point out, both good and bad. 1) If you dont venture towards Union Square and venture the opposite way your`e in the HOOD (Tenderloin), so avoid that especially if youre with a family or a single women. Stay on o`farrel towards union square and DO NOT head the other way on `farrell. The area around Nikko is generally very good, however SF has a big homeless problem so just use caution, dont insult or question just keep walking and its like any other city. The hotel has 2 exits, mason and o`farrell, use the o`farrell exit and take a right had turn, youll be in the center of a great safe and fun shopping area. I highly reccomend foleys pub about half a block down the street its a great time. 2) The room I had was EXCEPTIONAL as far as a huge flat screen new bedding, desk, etc. The only problem was the bathroom was very nice except the tile was old. It is as if they redid the bathroom except for the tile which was a bit dated. it was nothing to bad but with a 40 inch flat screen the shower tile should be cleaner and the door should close. 3) THERMOSTAT! it really has a mind of its own, I agree with other posts. I had it set to 60 for 5 days, room temp never went below 70. I really was at a loss for what the heck the thermostat was doing. I am 26 was in town to party and didnt really care but when your drinking and want some cold area flowing and the thermo spits out 75 degree stuff it can drive you (hungover) mad! 4) General, the hotel lobby is very very nice, safe and clean. The hotel is a solid 3.5 star but not a 4 star. The staff is helpful and for the price the location, staff and hotel itself is very nice. I would prefer this hotel over the parc 55 which I also looked at, the Parc 55 is just to far into a bad area. 5) This is a very nice hotel for the price and is extremely safe and well located. I paid 190 for New Years eve and about 140 for other nights so thats what made it great compared to the 300+ everywhere else wanted. Also this hotel primarly caters to the Japanesse which I enjoy as the clientele and attitude of staff is much more service oriented. 6) sorry for my spelling 7) overall I give this place a solid thumbs up!", "Date": "January 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cAn Average Stay\u201d", "Author": "inchpebble", "ReviewID": "UR12209124", "Content": "The hotel is at a fairly good location with easy access to the shopping district and a Walgreens a block away.

Taxi ride fare from Oakland to Nikko, (in financial district) was $52 with out tip. It was around $55 coming back. PUlled up to hotel and was greeted by bellhop, expressing hellos etcc.. Very nice appeal. You then go up an escalator to the next level to check in. It is a massive open lobby, with all marble ,whites, and massive area to read, sit, and people watch. Check in was a breeze and very polite, all Asian staff, and always smiles. Arrived at 3 pm, so this will probably be why check in was done so fast.

Took the queen as we needed to get a shower before we went out for dinner.The elevators are plenty. 6 to be exact, and waiting was never an issue.

The mini bar is triggeed to charge you by weight, so if you pick out a bottle of Coke, and put it back, you might as well drink it($4). Very well stocked. Used about $20 in room beverages. The bed was very soft, and made up very nicely. Many pillows etc... The air worked fine and heat was not needed. On the thermostat are 2 bottons. 1 for do not distrub, and 1 for making up the room.

The hotel on Sundays has a quartet playing for the breasfast brunch. we did not partake, as we had to catch flight, but looked very classy. There is a high end sushi in the hotel, but never could find time to enjoy. Reservations highly suggested. There is a gift shop, and also a Starbucks inside the hotel. However when we went there twice the line was out the door....here is what I did, along with others that didn't want to wait. Directly across the street is a small coffee shop, and plenty of rolls , muffins. Like a small mom and pop coffee place. Only 5 people in line here, and all did the same as I, as we didn't want to wait 30 minutesin line at Starbucks. Other than that, valet always whistled for a cab and had no problems. Overall, this is a nice hotel...is it 4 stars???? Close but no cigar. It is a 3.8 one could say. I would for sure stay here again, but to me it is not a Ritz or Four seasons, but was well worth the cost.", "Date": "October 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London , UK", "Title": "\u201cTranquil and classy hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "lesleylhb", "ReviewID": "UR10089025", "Content": "We arrived from a very hectic 4 day schedule having flown in from the UK, attended a wedding at LakeTahoe, and to arrive at the hotel Nikko was bliss.

It is an excellent option for the business traveler who desires a comfortable, spacious and attractive accommodation with strong business services. Rooms at the Nikko are spacious and well-appointed. My room was decorated in sleek greys with blue accents, and offered excellent Internet access, a spacious desk, and a large, flat-screen television set. The room offered a large dressing and bath area, equipped with a dressing room, countertop sink, a excellent shower and a water closet. The size of the dressing/bath area alone was equivalent to the square footage of rooms in smaller San Francisco establishments. Book the Nikko through a website to enhance affordability. I booked here for three nights on short notice, earlier that day. For the date of my initial checkin, I was forced to book directly with the hotel and paid a hefty $359. For the following two nights, which I booked on a travel site, the rate was $229, and well worth it-- an outstanding value. Dining at the Nikko is pricey, but the cuisine is excellent. The hotel's menu offers both Japanese cuisine and Western offerings. I chose sushi and a California white wine-- both excellent. If you are a sushi afficionardo, do try the sushi here-- but be warned that the prices are steep-- in my case, $18 for 7 generous and flavorful pieces. For those seeking more affordable options, there is ample and excellent dining in the immediate neighborhood. Service at the Nikko is efficient. and capable, if a bit austere The business center is well-equipped and available after hours with one's room key.

What I found when I arrived is a hotel that is very uneven and inconsistent in its upkeep, maintenance and standards. The lobby is unmemorable and feels like the entrance to an office building. The walls and floors are mostly cold/80's looking white marble and brass, and a slightly random collection of chairs and sofas. The hallways on the room floors are a mixed bag - attractive new carpeting but old, dated flourescent lighting/wallpaper. I was booked into a \"deluxe king\", which apparently translates to(according to the fire escape floor map) one of four of the smallest rooms on the floor. Technically everything was there that was supposed to be (king bed, desk, easy chair/ottoman), but it left very little room to walk around. For exapmple, the drawers in front of the bed, when open, touch the bed. As I look through the candid traveler photos on here, it appears that some of the rooms in this category may be slightly larger, which is annoying (I believe all rooms in a category should be comparable). The remodeled things in the room are nice, such as an amazing bed that rivals the all the \"heavenly\" style beds at the big chains, and the massive plasma TV. The accent wall behind the bed also looked recently redone and stylish, and the climate control system was modern and easy to use. However, the room was only half-renovated -- the carpets are clearly 20 years or older, stained and dirty, and the bathroom is one of the sorriest/ugliest ones I've seen at a 4-star hotel in a long time. The pink tile on the floor reminded me of my high school locker room - old, ugly and grotty. The fixtures on the sink and the lighting are very old-school as well. The tub is small, and there was no seperate shower as advertised on the website (I guess they mean it when they say \"most\" and not \"all\" rooms). The desk and drawers were pretty large, but also pretty knicked and scratched. Also the \"desk chair\" is just a regular table chair, very short and stiff and uncomfortable. The lighting was poor and mostly very dated looking. The light on the desk, for example, is a classic late 80's banker's style light that doesn't really illuminate any of the actual desk. The lampshades on the bedside lamps are pretty knicked and torn in places. All in all it's a weird contrast of new (plasma, bed) and old (carpets, bathroom, lighting). It almost seems like they started remodeling and then ran out of money before they finished. A side note: The TV channel selection was very underwhelming - only one premium channel (HBO) and not very many regular ones (15 or so). For such a nice HDTV, I would expect at least one or two HD channels, but no dice. All in all, this property does not hold its own against most of the recently-renovated 4-stars in the Union Square area. Until it gets a more extensive remodel that makes it more consistently 4-star in appearance and amenities, it should only be a last resort if you're looking in that price range.", "Date": "September 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cQuiet, comfortable and great location.\u201d", "Author": "glb310", "ReviewID": "UR8766225", "Content": "Great location and view (16th floor) and very, very quiet.

They sell very convenient international phone cards in the business center. We stayed for 5 days and enjoyed our staying. NEGATIVE FACTS Concierge charges are not transparent. The concierge double charged us fot theatre tickets (330 USD for two tickets for the musical 'The Jarsey Boys', which would cost 160 USD if we bought them directly at the Curran Theatre, just two blocks away from the hotel). When asked for an explanation, they say they use a brooker.. So I would recommend never to use the concierge to reserve events or tours when staying at the Hotel Nikko in San Francisco. Any extras are unreasonably expensive. A regular double is actually a single room (we needed to upgrade to a deluxe room). Continental Breakfast for two is 50-60 USD.

There are great restuarants close to the hotel, China town is within 6 blocks walking distance and Fisherman's Wharf (if you can stand the hills) is about a mile walking distance. During the summer, if you have time, go down to the Ferry Building (about 6 blocks from Nikko Hotel) and hang out at the Farmer's Market on Saturday's and Thursday's. We didn't bother getting a rental car, as parking is very expensive across the entire city. If you can, take the BART train from the airport to the Powell Street exit, and purchase at one of the cable car ticket stations a 1 or 3 day transportation pass.

The room I had was clean; I found the size of the room to be acceptable. The bed was comfortable although way too many pillows which I had to cram in to the closet so they were out of the way, a small complaint really. The bathroom was a nice size, with a phone next to the toilet that I found to be a bit odd. The plasma TV was nice but there was nothing on to watch, the in-house movie selection was poor but that could be down to there not being many good movies about at the moment. I ended up watching stuff that I had brought with me on my laptop. With the right leads you might be able to hook your laptop up to the TV as there are the right plugs on the side but not sure how that would work, worth a try next time. The wireless internet worked well and I found the speed to be fine. One issue I did have with it though was if you forgot to turn off your wireless connection off on your computer before shutting it down, it effected by laptop when turning back on. Took up to an hour for it to go through the start up options rather than the usual 30-60 seconds. The view I had was not great, but not bad, overlooked the Hilton on the other side of the street, will ask for a better view next time. Room service was quick but the choice on the menu was quite limited and the food from room service was not the best in the world. The breakfast buffet was excellent value, you get a coupon to use if booked in to a Nikko Floor room (the cost of which I am sure is worked in to your rate) but there was an very good choice of food and set you nicely for the day. You can use the mini-bar fridge to store your personal items such as milk or whatever but phone the front desk first to tell them you need to have space in the mini-bar for this so that you are not charged for taking stuff out of it. I just used ice in the ice bucket and kept my carton of milk in that which worked fine, you just have to remember to put new ice in first thing in the morning and then again in the evening. Complaints: Windows did not open, which in other hotels in the area they do, the Hilton over the street where I have stayed before. Quality and choice of food via room service.

The room does have air conditioning (many of the older hotels do not!). The bathroom was generally clean also.

We even called twice during the day and asked them to come clean it and when we arrived back to our room at 11pm it still hadn't been cleaned. But other than that, no problems. The location is absolutely perfect. Very easy to get to the cable cars and shopping. Taxis are always lined up on the street between the Nikko and the Hilton.

Overall very clean however. The linens, top of line and plush, comfortable beds and great pillows. No safes or refrigerators in rooms, though. Rooms quiet. They charge $10/day for the health club and pool unless you stay on the club level. (Club Nikko). As with most hotels in SF, parking was $40/day. Some as high as $60/day. Leave the car home. Too hard to get around and park. Use public trans with a pass.You'll thank me later! Overall, loved the city, hated the huge homeless problem. This puts a stain on the whole feel of the city and can't understand why the taxpayers don't press this issue. Very little visible police presence even in tourist areas. This was shameful. For fun, do the night tour at Alcatraz. This was the best and worth the extra. Dress warm, its cold out there. Skip Pier 39 except the sea lions. Visit the Ferry Building. Nice shops and good food.

If you're a \"big red\" fan you have to try out the Viansa Winery in Sonoma. This is an offshoot of the Sebastianis and tasted some of the best big reds ever! I couldn't drink (or carry) enough! Muir Woods for the redwoods. It was surreal, quiet and majestic. No one was even talking here. It was so peaceful and the ride up was super. If you love nature, you haven't seen anything like this. Deer wandered by as I was snapping a picture of a brook. Remember to dress warm. In June temp was in 50's in the morning and foggy alot of the time. You'll have great food here.

I seriouly researched a number of hotels on the internet and phoned them for questions. Nikko seemed like the best value for location, size of room, trendiness and price. The location was good. Close to Union Square, public transport, restaurants and shopping. And from the entrance, lobby, and front desk appeared to be nice, clean and modern. Our room was a different story. The size of the room was not bad, considering most hotel rooms in San Francisco seem to be on the small side. I think we had a Delux Queen room. The bathroom was small, fit for really just one person. My biggest complaint was that the bathroom was pretty grungy. As a previous reviewer mentioned, they had what used to be white tile grouting on the bathroom floor and sink, that was so dirty it was dingy dark grey. It made me not want to walk barefoot in the bathroom. You could still see where it was the original white in the corners. We had to ask for extra bathmats to put down to walk barefoot in the bathroom. The tub was also dingy. The carpet gave me the creeps too. Also, each day that the housekeeping staff \"cleaned\" the bathroom, there were stray hairs left behind in the white sink and tub. They clearly were not from my boyfriend or I, wrong color. I am not super picky, but a clean bathroom is something I would expect from a 4-star hotel. I could live with a not so perfect bathroom if it was at a motel, because at least then I would know I was getting what I paid for. And it rubbed me the wrong way that they wanted guests to pay for extra toiletries left in the bathroom. And you had to pay to use the pool and workout facilities, which is kind of cheap of them. An they were not so great anyway. Our bed was large and comfortable. A few other reviewers had mentioned that they could not get the internet in the room to work. We had the same experience. Complimentary in-room internet access was one of the reasons I chose this hotel, but my boyfriend could not get it to work from his company laptop, which he never has problems with anywhere else. The front desk and IT person they connected him to were no help. We never got it to work. Upon checkout, they attempted to charge us about $40 for mini-bar items, but we hadn't touched a thing. They took the charges off without protest, but there was another customer checking out the same time as us with the same complaint. Overall, it was too expensive for what we got. If the rooms are going to be grubby anyway, I might as well only pay for a Best Western. We will not stay there again.

It is not that close to the Tenderloin such that, contrary to what others have written, there is cause to be concerned about homeless people or suspicious types.

I did, in fact, spring once for an updated room with special linens, fluffy robes, breakfast and a funky but entertaining television built into the bathroom mirror, but overall found the decor to be dated and the extra money not well spent.

Without exception, the staff was very helpful, smiling and gracious. We went to our room on the 8th floor. It was small, but not ridiculously so, although from the floor map it was probably one of the smallest on the floor. The bed was wonderful - very clean, fresh (no bleach smell), and comfortable. The color scheme in the room was neutral, calm and relaxing. The large, flat-panel TV was very cool, although I agree with the other reviewer who said that it should have been high-definition. The rug was stained, and I found a nasty dried-up spider on it, and the room just looked a bit tired in general. The bathroom was a complete disappointment. It was like a Holiday Inn from the '90s. The fixtures were so generic, there was mildew on the tiles, and the floor of the tub was stained. They really should put some money into upgrading the bathrooms. People expect it nowadays. Possibly most disappointing is the fact that no mention was ever made of the $10/day charge to use the pool/gym. I guess it's not a really big deal, it just seems deceptive to me, and I don't like that. This hotel is probably like many others, in that your experience may vary highly depending on what room you get. We got one of the worse rooms in the hotel, and I was not overly impressed. I'm sure the suites are beautiful and spacious, but they're beautiful and spacious in any reputable hotel. I'm more impresssed with hotels who go out of the way to make the experience a pleasure for EVERY guest, not just Lindsay Lohan. Overall, I won't be clamoring to return here. I'm sure there are better hotels in the area. From what I saw of the 2 Marriotts in the area, they looked very nice, and our friends were happy with the Sir Francis Drake.

There was a large dresser with lots of drawer space and drawers that did not stick (a hotel pet peeve of mine). Being at the bottom of the hill rather than than the top as you would've been in either the Mark Hopkins or the Fairmont, the views are not the best.

Hotel Nikko in San Francisco is by far one of the overall worst experiences i've had in over 3 years. I called the day before my arrival asking if it would be possible for an early check in and was told it would not be a problem. The next day when I arrived at 11:00 thwey said they had no rooms available and they could give me access to their \"spa\" for the time being so I could shower and freshen up before my meeting. I asked if i could upgrade or if there was any room open, and she rudely told me i was out of luck. I was given a key and went to the \"spa\" only to find a shoddy hotel workout room and a defunct key that wouldnt let me into the mens locker room. I went back to the front desk, waited in line for 20 minutes while the whole time the woman who i spoke with saw i was there, got them to re-issue my key, and returned. Once i was finally in, the floor looked as though it hadnt been cleaned in weeks. There was green grime and rust on all of the water handles and spout, typical of something one might see in a County Fair bathroom. 2.5 hours later, I was called on my cell phone from the front desk staff saying my room was available. I returned to the hotel and went to my room. \"Welcome to Hell\" should have been scrawled on the front door. The carpet looked as though it had been used to store dirt on and the bed was very sloppily made as though i just walked in on someone taking a nap. Seeing as how I could almots span my arms from wall to wall, the room very, very, uncomfortable. The decor belonged in the Brady Bunch, and the matress was probably from the same era. In the bathroom, the toilet ran constantly and there was women's hair plastered to the side of the tub. I knew there were conferences in town and most hotels in the immediate area were all sold out. Otherwise i would have been out of there is a second. I will say however, that the bellstaff here is very friendly and accomodating.

I have stayed in this hotel in the past and enjoyed it immensely, so I was looking forward to a return visit. With a rainy January predicted, I looked specifically for a downtown hotel with an indoor pool. The only matches I could find were this hotel, Courtyard by Marriott, and the Palace. Of the three, this one is the most conveniently located to Union Square. Since my last visit, while this hotel is still nice, it is in need of some upgrading. I noticed areas of the room that could benefit from a fresh coat of paint. The mattresses are a bit soft. I personally prefer a firmer mattress. It is a pillow top that is just a bit soft for my tastes. The entertainment center could use a replacement, with space for a larger television. It's been a while since I've stayed in a hotel of this caliber with only a 19\" television. Because we booked this place specifically for the pool, our kids had a great time. The pool does seem to have some issues with temperature, though. The first night, the pool needed some warming up. The other days it was fine. The hot tub ranged from lukewarm to very hot. Some fine tuning on the spa temperature would be great. The sauna was in working condition, but there was this big bath in the locker room that I think is meant to be large Japanese-style communal bath that was non-functional. There is a room in the locker room called a kamaburo that I think is supposed to be a warm moist sauna, but either it wasn't working, or it's meant to be something else. It looks just like a room with rocks and a plank slab to lay on in a room that isn't particularly warm. If I had to do it over again, I would have probably selected one of the other hotels. The Courtyard is rated higher, but is in a more inconvenient location. The Palace is relatively conveniently located, but also more expensive.

First impressions were good - nice lobby & lounge area, clean looking, nice waterfall, chic and modern.

It was so small, that I called the front desk to make sure we did indeed get the 'deluxe' room. Anything below that could easily be called the 'closet' room. The whole room, including bathroom, was maybe 300 sq. ft, and that's probably being generous. They must like things to be small. There's a huge armoir at the foot of the bed, with the TV cabinet doors closed. Big enough to fit at least a 32\" TV, so I'm thinking 'cool, good size TV'. I opened the doors to find a 19\" TV in there, dwarfed by the massive cabinet it sat in! The bed was thoroughly mediocre. A king size bed, but a bit on the stiff side. The pillows were small, not very fluffy, and the sheets were white and just, well, plain. Not really rough, not really soft. Kind of Motel 6-ish. The biggest complaint was that the room was too grubby. Stains on the carpet, chipped paint on the doors and door frames, peeling wallpaper in corners of the bathroom. They made the mistake of using white tile grout in the bathroom floor, so all of the grout in the middle of the room was a dirty grey color. If you're going to use white grout, you're going to have to clean it! Same with the bottom of the tub - looked like lots of people have used it since it was cleaned. The shower was more like a greenhouse mister than a shower, thanks to the low water pressure and the shower head. Overall, we had high expectations, given the rating as a 4-star. No way. No way, not even close. Mediocre 3-star at best. Not to be completely negative, the location was good, near Union Square, with lots of good restaurants within a couple of blocks (which means short walks in the cold weather, and only a few homeless people to dodge).

I'm pretty sure they give Priceliners the rooms that need servicing. Ours was nice, but not that clean (there was red candy embedded in the carpet and a VERY dusty air duct in the bathroom). After a few calls to housekeeping things were finally taken care of to my satisfaction. The beds are not the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in (try the Hilton SF for amazing beds!) but they were decent and had good quality linens. A desk with a fax machine and telephone, coffee maker, mini bar, and cable TV included. our view was just of the hotel next door, but the wall to wall windows gave excellent sunlight. Oh, and keep in mind that this hotel uses digital do not disturb signs. There is a panel outside your room that will light up when actived inside the room. Bathrooms: AMAZING and HUGE! The bathroom was easily 1/3 the size of the sleeping area of our room. Seperate glassed in shower and bath, plus a wide marble vanity were great. Everything seemed a bit dated but it was all very clean. Towels are big and plush, we had plenty. The toilitries are not what you would expect from a hotel of this caliber, and were just average. Pool: It was awesome to have a pool in a hotel in SF, this almost never happens! The pool was small but clean. I avoided the hot tub as always because those things are swimming with bacteria and who knows what. The tanning booth was out of order to my dismay. Be sure to check out their poolside balcony for a great view. Fitness Center: Small but plenty of equipement and towels. Free for us, I don't think they charge people anymore even though it says they do in the guest book. The locker rooms were nice and had saunas (but no steam rooms) and were pretty clean. TIP!!!! The hotel would like you to pay $10+ per day for internet; however, if you bring your laptop (with wireless card) you can pick up the free signal from neighboring hotels like the Kimpton properties and the Hilton. Additionally, you can walk to the Apple store 2 blocks away. They have a lounge upstairs where people chill out and use their laptops. Oh, and there is a Starbucks on site which is mad busy in the mornings. Avoid it and go elsewhere. I'd reccomend this place, I hope you all enjoy your stays and happy travels!", "Date": "September 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worksop, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIdeal for a first time visit to San Francisco\u201d", "Author": "blot57", "ReviewID": "UR3834166", "Content": "Stayed in the Hotel Nikko in mid-August and arrived after a morning flight at 12:30.

I chose the Nikko specifically because I we were married at a Hotel Nikko in Japan and we were celebrating our anniversary. The stay started out somewhat unpleasantly as the front desk staff at arrival were unfriendly. As we approached the front desk to check in, the man behind the counter looked at us angrily and said, \"uh uh uh\" and motioned that we could not come any closer to the counter because he was in the middle of something else. It reminded me of past encounters with customs or other government officials who requested I stay behind the yellow line. My wife whispered to me, \"we can't even go near the front desk?\" Finally, we were allowed to check in. The person that checked us in behaved somewhat arrogantly and condescendingly. When I started to explain that we had requested a room upgrade using our Japan Airlines miles, he snapped, \"I know that sir, now if you will just be quiet I will work on finding you a room. Because you realize sir that it is only one-thirty in the afternoon and our check-in time is three o'clock, so you will be lucky if I can find you a room at all.\" Needless to say, my initial impression was not positive. We took the elevator up to our room on the 20th floor. We had upgraded from a Petite Queen to a Deluxe room for a few dollars per night and then used our miles to upgrade to a Junior Suite. The room was spectacular and when we arrived there was a bottle of champagne and a card from the management wishing us a happy anniversary! The facilities were all above average. The room was very clean and in good condition although the fixtures, furniture, appliances, etc. had probably not been updated in 10-15 years. The fitness center and pool were also very nice and I have no complaints. Again, it was not the latest equipment, but everything was clean and in working order. After a few more hours in our room and a tour of the city, our mood had changed and Hotel Nikko's stock was moving up in our book. Our room included breakfast, but unfortunately Mr. Friendly at the front desk failed to alert us that we had breakfast coupons in the folder with our room key and some other coupons, so we made the mistake of ordering room service for breakfast--thinking it was included. Well, it would have been included had we ordered \"the continental breakfast\", but since we checked the box for \"Japanese breakfast\" we had to pay an additional $80! The breakfast was tasty, but it cost more than the fabulous dinner we enjoyed the night before! Anyhow, we found our breakfast coupons later that day and figured out that we should have gone to the restaurant ANZU for breakfast or ordered a continental breakfast through room service. So I explained our plight to the front desk and they said they couldn't help me...I was S.O.L. and had to fork over the money for breakfast. I said, \"well okay, it was partly our mistake so could you just deduct the cost of the continental breakfast from our outrageously priced Japanese breakfast?\" ANSWER: No! So having seen Hotel Nikkos stock in our book appreciate at the rate of an internet IPO in the late '90s, I also witnessed it crash like one that got audited after cooking the books. So I left to enjoy the city again, rode the cable cars, did some shopping, ate some seafood at fisherman's wharf and gradually forgot about my breakfast mishap. We returned to the Nikko for an absolutely fabulous dinner at ANZU. I had aged beef served Japanese style and my wife had sushi. We were both very pleased with our dinner and the service at ANZU. Our opinion of Nikko moved up once again only to come sliding back down a few moments later at the concierge, who was sipping champagne with her friends (who had stopped by the hotel to razz her about having to work while the rest of her friends were celebrating something). We asked the concierge if she knew some good places to get a drink or if there were Japanese karaoke boxes in the area and she said that she couldn't make any recommendations. Imagine a concierge that is too busy with her friends to mention a tavern in the area or open the phone book to make a call about karaoke...So we had a couple drinks at the pub across the street and enjoyed the rest of the evening there. We checked out the next day and were fortunate to get a Japanese staff. Having lived in Japan I'm well aware that it has many drawbacks, but outstanding customer service is not one of them. She took care of everything efficiently, accepted our air miles without incident, and even discounted our room service breakfast. So our trip ended on a pleasant note and I can give the Hotel Nikko San Francisco an above-average rating without any hesitancy. Perhaps we had some misguided expectations that Hotel Nikko in San Francisco would be able to provide us with the amazing customer service that you receive at Hotel Nikko in Japan. In fact, the service at the Nikko was not bad by normal standards. It is in a good location and the facilities were clean and MOST of the staff were highly professional. So I can recommend staying at the Hotel Nikko, but I would avoid it if you have short patience.", "Date": "July 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kirkland, WA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3633623", "Content": "We stayed on the Nikko Floor.

This was my first stay there in about three years and either I have become more discriminating or the hotel has begun a severe decline. My plan was to stay two nights in San Francisco then go to Seattle and then come back for another two nights. On the positive side, the hotel is perfectly located and the staff is very friendly. However, hotel management seems to be cutting corners. No robe. No evening turndown service. No USA Today. (Some guests got San Francisco newspapers, but I didn't.) My room wasn't small, but it seemed small because it was oddly shaped. The TV set was so small that I could not read the channel numbers from the bed. One thing I remembered loving about the Nikko were the bathrooms with stall showers and tubs. What I encountered this time was nothing to love. The walls are covered in rather worn and somewhat grimy pink tile. Wall coverings were peeling. The shower door seemed flimsy from age and no longer exactly clear. I went downstairs to the breakfast buffet which was probably the highlight of my stay. It's not free, but it's not expensive. (The restaurant is wonderful.) I was out most of the day and returned around 3:00 to find the housekeeper in my room. Why so late? I think she was combining morning cleaning with evening turndown service, such as it was. I wanted a nap, but that had to wait. I was once told by a travel agent that if you have a poor experience, you should tell the general manager because often the staff shields him (or her) from guest complaints. So I decided to call him (which took some persistence with the telephone operator). I learned that he was out, but his assistant suggested I speak to the manager on duty. Unfortunately, she transferred me to the wrong person. I reached the person in charge of sales who seemed to resent being bothered by a guest in her hotel. She asked her assistant to transfer me again. This time, I was disconnected. I decided that when it comes to hotels, treasure your memories because things inevitably change and rarely for the better.

But i made a huge mistake of not getting the Hilton across the street. We bought the air+hotel package from expedia for a \"Petite Queen\" room. We checked in and asked for an upgrade. The representative was nice and offered us an upgrade but told us to check the \"Petite room\" before we upgrade. So we went and checked the room we originally bought. The room is very petite. The hallway from the door to the actual bed is very tiny. The bed was horrible. We sat on the bed and we could literally feel the springs on the bed. So we decided to go for an upgrade. Upgrade of \"Petite\" was \"Deluxe\" and then \"Club room which comes with a continental breakfast\". We decided to check the Club room. One thing we noticed was that all three rooms had a 19 inch tv despite the size of the room. Club room was very spacy but the bed felt the same. Bathroom was ok with usual stall shower and a bathtub. There are alot of coffee shops around the block so we decided not to get the club room. So we decided to go for the delux room. I've gotta say all the beds in all the rooms were same despite the upgrade. We could feel the springs by sitting on the bed. At this point, i was very disappointed with the quality of beds in the hotel. The marble on the sink area was very worn out which made it look like the counter top was not clean. We finally checked in the delux room. The room was alot spacier than the \"Petite\" room. But the quality of the bed was the same. We slept on that bed the first night, i could not get a good night sleep. I was tossing and turning all night long. Next day we told them about the bed and the service representative said that she'll have the housekeeping put a mattress pad on the bed. If we still don't like it, she'll upgrade us. Not that the club room had any better bed. We come back in the room the next night and there was a full size mattress pad on a king size bed. At that point we really didn't care of having another upgrade and moving all our stuff to another room which had the same quality bed. Also, the stall shower door made a mess on the bathroom floor. I will really suggest that if you're picky on beds and like a good night sleep after having a nice day: \"DON'T STAY IN NIKKO\". Its not worth the money.

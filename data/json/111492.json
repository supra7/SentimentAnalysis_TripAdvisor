Kimpton hotels typically have a complimentary wine hour for their guests and we had made it just in time. We were surprised they even had salmon bruschetta bites from their amazing kitchen.

I will say that we slept well and the room was quiet, but overall the hotel was very disappointing. I spent quite a long time trying to decide which hotel to book for this trip \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was really important to me to have a nice view where I could sit in the window and enjoy the city. Every picture on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website showed window seats, and the reviews all described window seats as big as twin beds. It sounded great, a perfect place to relax and enjoy the city! For the first time in my life, I decided to spend extra money and upgrade for a river view as this was very important to me. You can imagine my disappointment when I entered the room and saw only one very narrow window (about 3 feet wide) and NO WINDOW SEAT. I did not realize that this was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extra\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd feature that I should have requested, but as the rest of the stay would prove, one had to ask for almost everything that might be assumed standard. I will say that the hotel delivered a fan to my room as requested, but many of the other amenities or lack thereof were very disappointing. (1) There was no hotel directory book (the little book that lists amenities and maps out the locations of things, etc). (2) There was no shower cap provided. I expect a disposable shower cap in even basic hotels. (3)There was no plastic liner bag for the ice bucket. Again, this is something that I have had in even the most basic hotels. I thought these omissions must have been oversights, so I went down to the front desk the next morning to ask. I was told by the front desk clerk, Ryan, that (1) I probably overlooked the hotel directory (I had not) and (2) the shower cap and ice liner were not, in fact, generally provided amenities and he sneered at me. Ryan was a very unpleasant hotel representative, and he made me feel as though my meager request was a great put-out. I was too afraid to ask him for anything else during the stay. He agreed to have a shower cap and ice bags sent to the room later that day. When we returned, an ice bag and shower cap were provided but were not replenished again throughout the stay. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that I needed to ask every single day, but apparently that was the case. And then the hotel was a little too involved when it came to turn-down service. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect this as a standard, but unfortunately it seemed to be the case. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like people coming in my room when I am not expecting it, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly what happened. I felt very violated by the incident. Who on earth needs turn-down? I can pull down my own sheets, thanks. I soon learned to put the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do not disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign on the door except during the few hours that I wanted my room cleaned. The hotel also made you feel guilty for getting basic services like clean sheets and towels. The little signs everywhere about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153protecting the environment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd give you the feeling that if you request clean linens, you might not actually get them. I always imagine the maids saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tough luck\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and just tucking the old ones back in. Also, the furniture is completely there for aesthetics and is very uncomfortable. I was disappointed as I really wanted the room to be a place of relaxation. Kimpton implies that it can anticipate your needs, but it did a very poor job with ours. I gave the San Francisco Monaco a top rating during a previous stay, and I expected similar service at this hotel. I did not receive it; instead I felt like my very presence was putting out the hotel staff, and I very much feel that I was a victim of false advertising. I would NEVER have stayed at this hotel had I known that I would receive the pitiful window with no window seat. I think that I will avoid Kimptons in the future.

Welllll....sure....why not??? This was a first for me. Upon getting to our room, we found a very nicely decorated room with a wonderful view of the waterway to our right. Each window had a good sized windowseat, where you could sit and watch the action down on the street. Just be aware that there is a building across from you and they can also watch everything going on in your room. :) It is a quiet hotel and did not hear any noise from the neighbors, which is important to me. They also provide very nice funky robes...not just the white ones you find in other places. There is a very nice bar and restaurant downstairs if you chose to stay there and eat.

The rooms and location are great, but the staff are amazing. You feel genuinely welcomed by the front desk. Room service is open late, so when your flight into O'Hare is delayed (which it will be) you can have a nice meal. They also keep delivery menus at the front desk, in case nothing on the delivery menu peaks your interest. Feeling lonely? Miss your pet? They will bring you a goldfish. The cleaning staff is also top-notch. One member of the cleaning crew left me a note asking me to leave her any special instructions on the nightstand so that she could ensure I would enjoy my stay.

We chose the Hotel Monaco for an overnight stay because I had stayed at a Monaco in Alexandria VA last year and liked it. The Chicago version did not disappoint! From the moment of our arrival until our departure, we were treated with attentive hospitality. If you are considering a stay at a Kimpton property, I recommend you sign up for their Kimpton Rewards. It's free. Also if you are on Facebook, \"like\" Kimpton.., you will get access to special unadvertised perks. We received a fantastic room rate, a $10 credit towards our in-room mini-bar, 2 free drink vouchers at the South Water Kitchen restaurant adjacent to the hotel, and a complimentary morning newspaper (although inexplicably we received the New York Times instead of a Chicago paper). Additionally we were surprised with a complimentary bottle of bubbly, compliments of Ryan, the assistant general manager. What a thoughtful touch to help us celebrate our special day! The lobby was tastefully decked out for the holiday season, and a cozy fireplace provided extra ambiance. The evening wine reception, a signature Kimpton touch, was delightful. It's a great way to settle in and meet fellow travelers from far and near. If you are a pet lover, there's sure to be a four legged guest in attendance as well. Our room was very clean and quiet, although our outdoor view was of another building next door. Since we were only staying one night, however, this was not an issue for us. The Aveda toiletries are very nice. The only improvement I would suggest would be to provide a complimentary shower cap, as this is typically something we ladies forget to bring. The hotel is located in the north Loop area, just a short walk to the theater district and lots of good dining. Walk one block east to Michigan Avenue and catch a bus for a short ride to the Mag Mile shopping district, or take a stroll through Millennium Park and wind up at the Art Institute for a world-class cultural experience.

It's near the corner of Wabash and Wacker, just steps away from public transportation, across the street from a 7-Eleven and one of our other favorite haunts in Chicago--The Emerald Loop. The hotel restaurant, South Water Kitchen, is just wonderful! Throw in the afternoon wine reception, and we are always tempted to just hang out in the 200-block of North Wabash and never leave...everything we really need is right there! The staff--every desk clerk, bell-hop, housekeeper--is tremendously friendly and helpful. Case in point: We forgot to bring the power cable for our laptop, and the front desk staff tried and tried to locate one for us. Even better case in point: Leftovers from our meal at the aforementioned Emerald Loop were re-warmed for us at 3:00 am when we returned from a night on the town and decided we were hungry. But, unlike at home, these leftovers weren't just nuked...the staff plated it up beautifully and served it as if it had come from their own restaurant! Way above and beyond!

Out of all of them, Monaco is the best I've found. The staff were all incredibly nice and friendly, and they made a point not just to give me what I asked for, but to ask what I needed, and offer things I didn't think of. Turn down service included bringing ice, so I never had to go get it. Joining Kimpton In-Touch before my stay let me enter my preferences and get free wi-fi. I saved up for a special trip and got a suite. It was gorgeous, huge, and luxurious. I've found that beds in four-star and five-star places usually aren't any more comfortable than beds in cheapo motels, but the bed at the Monaco was perfect. The decor looks a little tacky in the website photos, but in person it's beautiful. I especially loved the window seats. They were very high, but with a bit of a running start and a hop, I could climb up onto a huge, wide, thick cushion and look down onto the bustling street, up to the Sears (Willis) Tower and Chicago skyline, and catch a glimpse of the Michigan River. The window seats were big and comfortable enough to sleep in if I had wanted to. I had three of them in my room. The minibar did not have sensors, so I could store my own drinks in the fridge without worrying about being charged for something I didn't use. The bathroom was smaller than your average four star suite bathroom, but the jetted tub was almost big enough to swim in, and so deep the water would have come up to my neck sitting upright. It would have been nice to have more room and better lighting for makeup. I did my makeup in the full length mirror in the giant bedroom, where there was more light, and a tiny table. I had room service once, and the food was OK. The price was more than the convenience was worth. The location right next to the Magnificent Mile was perfect for me as a tourist and someone who loves to shop. Luckily I had a friend in Chicago to show me how to use the transit system and where to go for fun. The bare facts in this review don't quite describe why my stay was so much nicer than any other.

I've never been to a hotel that does turn-down service without being asked. It was a special treat. And I can't imagine a better location. We walked to everything we wanted to see, except Wrigley Field (took the subway, which was a few blocks away). My one complaint was the slowness of the Internet speed. It was glacial. But as a Kimpton member, at least I didn't have to pay for it. One other very minor complaint (which I'm only posting because I think the hotel reads this, according to their FB updates), is that there are no good places to hang a towel to dry when you're done using it. I'm glad that they are environmentally conscious in many ways and encourage guests to re-use towels, which we do at home, but with two of us, I had to put mine over the shower curtain rod and my husband put his on top of the door. There is one small hook on the back of the door, but is an odd design and the towel falls right off. The restaurant attached to the hotel is also very nice.

My suite was on the top floor on the corner with the best view. It was absolutely the very best single room in the hotel (Room 1411.....ask for it if you can). It was a two room suite with a huge sitting room with a sofabed and good work desk. The bedroom has a great bed with the softest, most comfortable bed sheets I've ever seen at a hotel. Plus a chaise and decent sized chest. (The drawers for your clothes are a little on the smallish side). The bathroom features a small corner shower but a huge two person whirlpool tub. The amenities are four star and plentiful (Aveda....I'm not a huge Aveda fan but at least they were big enough for use. Most hotels these days give you a scant few drops of shampoo and a soap bar shaving that's so small you can't hold it.) The countertop was solid granite. The shower and sink had plenty of water pressure with ample hot water. The closet featured two funky bath robes you can use or even buy to take with you. One of the best features is the large window wells (my corner suite had SIX of them) that have a large cushioned bottom and two pillows. They're perfect for sitting up in and taking in the view, which is nothing short of wonderous. My suite overlooked the river from two views....it was outstanding. There are two large flat screen TVs, but the reception on the one in the bedroom was a bit fuzzy. The wireless internet worked well but cost $10 daily unless you joined their free affinity program which is easy to do....a no brainer there. Parking is expensive at $46 a day. Try not to park here if you don't have to, there are other lots nearby within two blocks but they aren't that much cheaper. The staff was absolutely outstanding. VERY friendly and helpful. There is a spa and fitness center and they have complimentary coffee in the morning and an hour long free wine and snack reception daily. The location simply cannot be beat. It is just one block off Michigan Avenue and right on the Chicago River. Perfect Central Loop location. I probably wouldn't pay $400 or so per night unless you had to, but if you can get this hotel at this location in the low $200's, you've got a great deal for a very fine property in a great location in one of the best cities for visiting in the whole world.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver BC", "Title": "\u201cSuperb Location and Great Service\u201d", "Author": "KimVancouverBC", "ReviewID": "UR116491426", "Content": "Superb location.

I was impressed with service, when we walked in, and told them our name, they said, oh yes, you made your reservations through such-and-such and for this many nights, etc. No searching in the computer for us like I have had at other hotels (esp. when I book through a 3rd party), so check-in was a breeze. They are very pet friendly, but I never heard any barking, so I'm not sure if they alternate floors or something. So, even though it was unusally rainy and cold for May, we have a lovely time and were able to walk anywhere we wanted (excpet Wrigley Field, but you have to take a cab from pretty much anywhere downtown to get there). It's an unassuming hotel from the outside, but inside it has really fun decor, a pleasant staff and great amenities. Oh, and the beds were SUPER comfy!

I hung out at the bar for a couple of hours waiting for the call then I realized that I was probably forgotten after looking at my watch a little bit after 3 p.m. So, when I went to the front desk obviously the shift has changed because they had a different set of people working and I asked the front desk person if my room was ready. Of course, he has never heard of me before and asked me the same questions as if I was checking for the very first time. I asked him what happened the the woman before him and he said that I didn't get the call because the room wasn't ready. Oh, suddenly it was ready when I inquire? How about she forgot before she left. Honnesty is the best policy. Wonder if I would even get the call if I didn't go ask myself.

Room service, which I ordinarily NEVER use, was prompt and the food good. Even more, I request additional soaps and shampoos, and they sent me more than what I had requested promptly. This hotel is located right near the river, and across the river in Chicago is where you will find many famous bars and restaurants that are worth viewing. South and east of the hotel are many famous museums worth seeing: Art Institute, Shedd Aquarium, and the Planetarium (see a show; it is worth it). WINE HOUR Well, this is a totally true story. After my exam, I was feeling depressed, dejected, and exhausted. ASIDE: I passed. When I return to the hotel, the hotel was providing a FREE WINE tasting. This was EXACTLY what I needed. I had MORE than my fair share. A friend of mine also stopped by -- I texted him to stop by to grab a glass of wine-- and he sure did. We enjoyed ourselves. We both need a glass of wine at exactly the right now. I was so spent after two days of exam taking. My friend was not a guest, but they did not ask. It spared me the whole, \"Well, I am a friend, and he is my guest\" thing. Thank you for that. Again, on the location, it is not far from many bars. I used a cab from the hotel to go further up north for a bar and it cost only 12 bucks. I was very surprised. Thus, as for location, you are literally at a just about perfect spot for seeing Chicago.

One afternoon when we were stepping out, I asked the front desk to have our room cleabed (it was 5pm) he said \"On a Sunday night?

First, the location is quite good. Located on the northeast corner of the Loop district, the Hotel Monaco is just two blocks from the Magnificent Mile and one block from any of the public transit trains. Also, the guest floor public area was quite charming and warm, with big, mahogany doors, bright carpet, and lime/cream striped wall paper. Once inside our room, though, we were a bit disappointed. The curtains would not close completely, allowing beams of sunshine to burst in at sunrise. The curtains were also tattered, with holes and tears plainly visible. The seating chair was threadbare and the carpet could use a good steam-vacuuming. On the plus side, our bath was quite ample, clean and well-maintained. The lobby seemed over-run with people when we came and went (perhaps they all heard we were coming and wanted to catch a glimpse? Ha!)

And of course, the evening wine reception as usual could not be beaten. Monaco is also a few steps away from Morton's Steakhouse, which I highly recommend. And there is a well-stocked 7-11 right across the street. The hotel is in a great area if you want to take any of the river tours - the Chicago River Architecture Tour leaves from a stop nearby (it's great - be sure to get tickets in advance to be sure you get the slot you want). There are also water taxi stops within walking distance that will take you to the Willis/Sears tower or the navy pier.

And that is a GOOD thing. The decor, style and ambience of the hotel have held up well and are top notch. We were upgraded to a great Riverview room and absolutely loved the window seats and the view from the room. Perhaps the best thing about the Monaco is the location. Right on the bottom edge of the Miracle Mile and at the top of Chicago's Loop district - with easy access to everything - you could not ask for a better locaiton to take in all the city has to offer. You can almost walk to everything depending on how ambitious you are. We walked (with kids aged 8 - 14) from the hotel to the Shedd Aquarium, the Miracle Mile, the Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower), Navy Pier, etc... and while some of the walks were a bit long (1.5 miles) they went by quickly. Easy access to the \"El\" (elevated train) only one block down the street from the hotel is also a plus as is the immediate access (and view) of the river where you can take water taxi's and sightseeing trips along the river. As in all big cities parking is a bit much ($42 per day) which is in & out access (valet only attached to the hotel) but you can choose to park in a \"self-park\" nearby for approx $30 per day. On this trip, we chose to take the Amtrack train which was a good option coming into Union Station and a 5 minute cab ride ($7.50) to the hotel worked out well. On departure, (back to Union Station) we took a water taxi from Michigan Ave river bridge area (about 1 block from hotel - $2 per person) and the water taxi ride took about 10 minutes to the Madison Ave dock (about 2 blocks from Union Station). So the water taxi ride was well worth it to see the city form a different perspective. Back to the Monaco - the Hotel was 14 stories and we had a room on the 14th floor (1408 to be exact) which was a double queen bed room with PLENTY of space with two window seats to take in the view of the city. In fact, you could sleep on one of the window seats overlooking the river, views of Willis Tower, etc.. (which one of us did and I must say it was pretty cool). The service was excellent and attentive, we never had to worry about a thing. Being a boutique hotel, the Monaco is the perfect combination of medium size and great service. We definitely did not feel like we were \"just another guest\" as sometimes happens in larger hotels. No pool here but who needs one with so much to do in the area. They do have a decent workout room. Short walk to Millenium Park, Buckingham Fountain, Miracle Mile, Theatre District, etc... who could ask for more from a place to stay. And the AAA rate was more than reasonable if you can get it. All in all, one of the best vacations ever and in large part due to the comfortable hotel and location which we were lucky to get. Thanks Kimpton and thanks Hotel Monaco. Our new favorite. We will be back. Note: The Monaco also has sister properties (The Hotel Burnham and Hotel Allegro) in the same area - which I have stayed at while on business years back - and these are similarly well run...that being said, you just can't beat the location of the Monaco. In my opinion, the Burnham is very cool for it's architectural history and feel and the Allegro is somewhat of a \"hip\" style - but each of the hotels definitely deserves a four star rating. Note: While I hate to even mention this subject when speaking of the Monaco...I was quite concerned when looking for places to stay about the \"B e d b u g issue\". We all know it is an increasing problem in many hotels. I can safely say The Monaco has no such problems that we could tell. Totally clean. Trust me, I looked. No problems at all.

I explained that I was going to have my husband's office try to find another hotel with two beds while I took my boys for lunch. They understood and said we could store our bags there until we found another hotel since we had just flown in and had no place to store them. While we were having lunch, we received a call saying someone had checked in with a queen room but agreed to switch to our king room. After checking into our new double queen room, we found we were at the back of the hotel looking at a parking garage. Not the prettiest view but the room was nice and it was very quiet. The next morning my six year old mentioned our lovely view to the front desk. They said they would try and get him a better room. About four hours later we received another call saying they had a room for us with a view of the river and fantastic window seats. My kids loved it. They read their books in the window seats every night before bed. The hotel also provided little unexpected treats: they brought us a gold fish, a mini robe for my youngest son, free Starbucks coffee in the lobby in the mornings, iced coffee after breakfast hours, lemonade in the afternoon and a wonderfully festive wine reception in the evenings complete with \"lowkey\" Wii for the kids and young at heart. It was almost like visiting someone's home. Everyone we encountered was fantastic. My six year old also locked our safe and forgot his code. They fellow came up to unlock it and refused a tip.

But when I checked out and asked for confirmation that our number was indeed keyed in, I learned that it wasn't. That would have been OK, I guess, but I also learned that as Kimpton members, we could have enjoyed $10 worth of minibar treats on the house. That sure would have been nice to know when I was eyeing those pricey M&Ms around midnight!", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MissPT", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, good hotel\u201d", "Author": "MissPT", "ReviewID": "UR73459785", "Content": "I had a week at The Monaco with my partner; overall good stay. First of all the location is excellent- in the Loop for trains (train from O'Hare to Clark/Lake is $2.25, then 5 mins walk to hotel), Millenium Park is nearby, Cultural Centre 5 mins walk, Museum campus 30 mins walk, Art Institute 15 mins walk. Check out what is free- concerts in parks, days at museums etc. Near North and River North have better restaurants bars. Macys Walnut Room has good food, half price bottles of wine of Wednesdays. Pastoral on Clark, 2 mins from hotel, does gourmet sandwichs and salads- good option for picnic, if a bit pricey. 7/11 for basics across the road. Ladies, Fashion Nails on Clark has mani/pedi for $35, you don't need to book. The room we had was spacious with a kingsize bed with a large bathroom. The view was of a blank wall, but we weren't there to look at the view from hotel! Decor is a bit loud for my taste- patterned carpet, stripey wall paper and red upholstery. But there are photos on hotel website, so this shouldn't be a surprise when you book. Good bed linen but a very soft bed- if you prefer a harder mattress I'd suggesting contacting the hotel when you book. Located beside a busy street, but the noise was ok. But this is the middle of a city so expect to hear sirens. Aveda toiletries were plentiful, heaps of towels, plenty of space for our stuff. The bath was teeny, but at the next hotel we stayed at it was the same so I guess that is maybe standard in USA. Huge plus was the complimentary gold fish- he was very cute! I got the yoga bag, brought up very quickly, but the yoga chanel didn't work the whole time we were there. No big deal though. Good freebies- wine in the evening and Starbucks coffee/tea in the morning. Breakfast in the South Water Kitchen was very variable. Toast, fruit, juice and coffee were complimentary, but anything else to be paid for. First day, thick toast and nicely presented fruit and juice and coffee arrived quickly- perfect. On another occasion, the juice didn't arrived and we had to ask again for milk. Fruit plates and toast were very variable- some days it looked thrown together, like they had run out stuff. One day were told by reception that breakfast ran till 11am but the restaurant maintained it was 10.30, and when we visited reception both staff were more interested in something else. On check-out, with member of staff who had ignored us, we weren't asked if we enjoyed our stay. I got the impression he just wanted to be rid of us. However I would say this was isolated, all the other staff we had contact with were helpful and friendly. On the whole, good stay. Great location, spacious rooms, friendly staff, thoughtful freebies.

This gem of a hotel has a perfect location for getting to the best of Chicago. As for the basics, the rooms are spacious, uniquely decorated and clean with high ceilings, and the beds are very comfortable. The hotel has a tremendous view of the Chicago River and is very close to the Magnificent Mile. Our kids loved the window seats that give you a close up view of the city and the river. It is also within walking distance of many of the city's best attractions including Millennium Park, Grant Park, and the Art Institute of Chicago. If you don't want to walk, the hotel is close to CTA bus stops, subway and elevated trains to get you to Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, Field Museum, John Hancock, or Sears Tower. We took a CTA bus to Navy Pier to watch the fireworks on the Fourth of July. With all the people on the pier, we were concerned about getting back to the hotel safely. We were able to take the Shoreline water taxi from the pier to Michigan Avenue and walk a short distance to the hotel. This allowed us to completely avoid all the traffic and congestion in the aftermath. The staff at the hotel is extremely helpful and accommodating. They went out of their way to make sure that our family was enjoying our stay and that we had everything we needed. While the entire staff was exemplary, I was especially impressed with Peter and Amy. Peter was very friendly and answered every question that we had about making the most of our first visit to Chicago. When I called down to the front desk, Amy made sure that we received anything that we asked for. We exhausted ourselves for three days trying to see it and do it all. The hotel was an oasis to return to from the day's activities. The staff was very service-oriented, providing the little extra touches that made the stay memorable from chocolates on the pillows and a full ice bucket to the animal print robes. Each day we were there, they served lemonade and iced tea in the lobby at 2 p.m. We also enjoyed wine tasting from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. daily, while the kids were able to play Wii. On our last day there, we were given late check out and our luggage was stored until it was time for us to head to Union Station to catch our train. The bellman made sure that we had a minivan taxi to accommodate our family. From beginning to end, the hotel's attention to detail and service made our visit more than we expected. We would not think of staying somewhere else if we are able to return to Chicago in the future. Chicago is an amazing city and this hotel is an amazing value.

The location is fantastic, walking outside the hotel you are confronted with amazing buildings, it is just off the Magnificent Mile and there are lots of great bars and restaurants and bars right near by. We booked a King Deluxe room. The room itself was a little smaller than I've experienced with regards to American hotels but by no means tiny and very nicely decorated, clean and comfortable with an enormous, super-comfortable bed. One thing I must add though, is that before I booked this hotel, I had read about these wonderful window seat/meditation stations in the rooms - unfortunately our room did not have this luxury. Having booked through an agent with a Kimpton Hotel before and again, been given the smallest room on the floor both times (evident from looking at the fire escape layout), I am of the impression that the hotel favours guests who book direct through them for the best rooms. The added bonus of robes, the complimentary daily wine hour (with nibbles), free internet access and morning complimentary Starbucks coffee all gave this hotel a great welcoming and homely feel. The maid even left us a soft drink on occassion which was a nice little touch. The adjoining bar was great and did a 'TV dinner' special at a set time each day which was great value. The funky music in the lifts also added a touch of fun to the hotel. The lobby was very plush and a great place to sit and relax with a glass of wine after a hard day's shopping. The fitness suite was also great, kitted out with personal TV's on the machines and all the usual necessities. Overall, although my first choice for Chicago would be the Omni, I would still definitely stay at this hotel again and would certainly recommend it to anyone due to its fantastic location, great staff and comfortable rooms, and of course, the daily free wine hour!", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Herning, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "ceklarsen", "ReviewID": "UR55967612", "Content": "Location, atmosphere, rooms, service, restaurant - all great!", "Date": "February 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "D\u00c3\u00bcsseldorf", "Title": "\u201cextraordinary\u201d", "Author": "daydayday", "ReviewID": "UR55827773", "Content": "we've been staying at hotel monaco in early september 2009 for eight nights. the staff is fantastic: super friendly, funny and helpful and always greet you with a smile (this includes housekeeping as well). hotel's location is simply great, right next to chicago river, few steps away from mag mile and state street which gives you some extraordinary views from the rooms. we had a room on 9th floor overlooking marina city, chicago river, willis tower, trump tower and much more... the best (!) feature, as mentioned before, are the huge sills you can sit and lay on. perfect to chill and relax. our room was nicely renovated (we loved the wallpaper and the mirror) and the mini bars feature several items for every traveler's situation. we didn't feel anonymous at all (especially compared to big chain hotels) because you always had the feeling of being pampered with genuine friendliness. go somewhere else if you're looking for sniffy stuck-up personnel, extremely luxurious marble-stuff and a big choice of bars and restaurants. book monaco if you want the perfect location for discovering the heart of downtown chicago.", "Date": "February 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lodi, WI", "Title": "\u201cFive star service\u201d", "Author": "Pbish-592", "ReviewID": "UR55508042", "Content": "My husband and I just spent a weekend in Chicago and stayed at the Hotel Monaco.

(I had joined the free Kimpton rewards program online--not sure if the little gift was because of that or if they were giving these to all guests at the hotel.) Our room was nicely decorated and pretty roomy, for a boutique hotel. The staff seemed very willing to help with any questions. We enjoyed the wine hour in the lobby one of the evenings, although it was a bit drafty for those who had to sit closer to the doors (there is a fireplace on the far wall--seats on the couch and chairs there get quickly taken). The lobby also offers coffee and tea from 6 to 9am. (A poster in the elevator says that hot cider and cocoa is offered from 2 to 4pm, but i saw no evidence of this.0 We especially loved the location of the hotel--we could walk to the Goodman theater and to shopping, as well as many restaurants.

I'm a bit picky when it comes to cleanliness and decor and this hotel exceeded my expectations all around. I paid $119 for a river view king room and couldn't believe how \"fancy\" (for lack of a better word) this place felt. From the concierge hailing our cab, the upscale lobby (with a wine hour), to the nice bedding and toiletries and lighted make-up mirror in the bathroom, I was really impressed. I've spent a ton more on not so nice rooms with stains and generic , cheap decorating. The best part? THE WINDOW SEAT AND LOCATION! The river view was well worth the extra $20. We actually spent quite a bit of time looking down onto the city. It was a quick easy walk to Michigan Ave. and we had no problems walking back late that night from pubs on Division St. And the area is crawling with cabs if you choose that route. Also, while we didn't bring our pooches this time, we usually travel with our 2 dogs and LOVE the fact that they are dog friendly! The worst part? While the valet parking was REALLY handy, it was $42 a night. But we knew that coming down and had the choice of taking the train down from Wisconsin. And if we were driving to our city destinations and parking, it would have cost a lot more. It was worth it. Plus, even though check out is at noon, your parking is good until 2pm. So we could have left our belongings with the concierge and grabbed lunch or done last minute shopping before getting our car. I've always wondered about the Kimpton Hotel chain and the Chicago Hotel Monaco has officially made me a fan. I will be looking for their hotels on our other vacation destinations. p.s.

The hotel has a wonderful location, nearly on the corner of Wabash and Wacker, about three blocks away from the shopping on Michigan Avenue, and within walking distance from Macy's (formerly Marshall Field), Millennium Park, and all the action in the Loop. I also enjoyed running along the lake nearby. The hotel lobby was small but functional. Since we were there over the holidays (and I imagine this is a business hotel), there were not very many other guests. We had requested a Tall Room, which was quite large, on the top floor, and featured an extra-long bed and tall shower. The decor was quirky and colorful. The view was of a brick wall, but we didn't mind. As a Kimpton In-Touch member, we got free Wi-Fi service (a great touch, as some hotels charge $15 or more). We also used the CD player and enjoyed the $10 coupon to the minibar. We loved our \"pet\" goldfish (nicknamed Chubby). The service was outstanding, from the general manager confirming our special requests (which included early check-in), to the front desk staff to the bellmen. Everyone was extremely accommodating and friendly. We checked out the wine hour in the evening, and it was a great start to our evening out. There was a problem with the bathroom sink when we first arrived, but it was promptly resolved. We did not use the gym or the morning coffee, so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on those services.

The free Starbucks in the morning was much needed! The toiletries are top notch (L'Occitane is among my favorites!). We got a great deal on the room so the view was expectedly lackluster, but well appointed. When we had a problem with a shorted out lamp, it was fixed promptly. The art deco decor is so cute and although the room was small, I found it to be cozy and not too tiny. The printed robes were fun. They gave you free wifi if you became a member of the Kimpton In Touch program. But the best part about this hotel was the prime location! We're not big on taking cabs and loved the nearby public transit options. We could easily take the subway from O'Hare and roll our bags the few blocks to our place. We were also just a short walk from an El stop in the Loop! We could walk to the Chicago Art Institute's museum, there was an Intelligentsia coffee shop nearby, we could walk to tons of shopping (Macys, Nordstrom Rack, Loehmanns, Filene's Basement, etc.), the river, and Millenium Park. We walked to Publican. Although we had to take the train to shop North Michigan, I still thought we made the right decision in picking the Hotel Monaco.

If I compare it to hotels of equal price and location, it gets five stars, but if I compare it to another Kimpton property that we loved, the Monaco in Portland, OR, I have to dock it a star just for some areas that aren't quite on Portland's level. Anyway, we'd stay here again in a heartbeat. We had a \"river view\" King. Room 1409 (top floor) that we booked on a special rate of $159/night. Now, it isn't the same river view that we've had on a high floor at the Chicago Hyatt, but we didn't pay only $159 there either! Views were best if you climb up into the roomy window seat, and then the view is of the Wabash bridge, river, and the Marina Towers (\"corn cobs\"). If you increase in room numbers, you will get closer to Wacker St and have more view of the Trump tower and overlook the Christian Science reading room. Smaller numbers (01-07) are going to put you farther from the river and closer to the sounds of the el. We could hear the train, but it was not loud enough to bother us. If we had been in 1404 or 1405, it may have been loud enough to keep us up, but i don't know for sure. Looking back in the other direction, we had a view of the Sears tower, lit up for the holidays as well as the lit steeple of the First United Methodist Church which is across from Daley Plaza. Upon arrival we had a morning flight and then about a 40 minute ride on the blue line from O'Hare with a 4 block walk from the station at Clark and Lake to the hotel. That was all very easy and made me glad we'd skipped renting a car and paying the $42/night parking! We arrived earlier than we thought, around 11 am, but they had a room for us, so it was great to be able to go ahead and check in. Our Kimpton program perk for the weekend was simply a key to the mini bar and our choice of 2 free items, up to $10 in value. On the other hand, when we stayed in Portland, we had a room upgrade and a bottle of wine, but, sigh, I know that can't happen every time! The Riverview King is a typical King room, with one upholstered chair in the corner, and a desk. The bathroom had a nice size granite countertop, but a traditional tub/shower that was not oversized. We were very surprised that the hotel tv had limited cable and was not even broadcast digital (which I am not sure how that could be the case). I really think they need to go ahead and be providing HD. We've had it at home for 7 years! However, we weren't Chicago to watch tv, so that's all I need to say. I noticed some faint odors of mildew each morning, but I could not pin-point it, and it was not all that strong, so I did not complain. Overall, the room was quiet, and in comparison to other chains, it is exceptional, but there was some hall noise and distant chimes of the elevator. Also, I heard a barking dog from a room down the hall one night, and another night there was a crying baby. This is another reason that I only gave four stars. At the Portland Monaco, we never heard a THING and were so amazed at the soundproofing there! The nightly complimentary wine reception was cozy and the staff also brought out some flatbreads that were tasty. A psychic/handwriting analyst casually circled the room and offered her services in a non-imposing way. Interesting touch, but we did not partake. There is lobby coffee in the mornings but only until 9am. Our housekeeper must have noticed (from the empty paper cups) that we went down for coffee and brought it back to the room, so she had left us an in-room coffee maker on the 2nd day of our visit. We had turn-down service each night with chocolates on the pillow and the tv turned to a yoga program. (I'd been doing a yoga program one evening before we went to dinner, so perhaps the staff noticed and tuned it to a different program for me for the night??) I also like that we left for dinner at varying times each evening, but somehow the staff must have known because they always did turn-down service while we were gone, instead of knocking while we were still in the room, which I find awkward when it happens in other establishments. We walked or took the train everywhere we went, and found the Monaco a perfect location for Michigan Ave/Oak St shopping and checking out the German Christmas Market in Daley Plaza. We also walked to the Art Institute on Thursday evening because it stays open late with free admission (5-8pm). We took the brown line up to shop in Lincoln Park and rode the red/purple up to Evanston to visit friends. If you are a walker, then all of this is doable from the Monaco without a car! It was not a problem to check our bags with the bell hop on our last day and stop back by the hotel and get our bags before walking to the train station to catch the blue line back to O'Hare. So incredibly convenient!! Yay to Kimpton!

The staff greets you by name when you enter or exit, they have a wine hour in the living room like lobby (with wine served along with snacks, and even access to a wii game) and excellent morning coffee in the lobby. Since my traveling companions and I were only there for one night, we didn't seek out a goldfish, but it is a cute Kimpton touch. Our room had a lovely view overlooking the river, with two nice cushioned window seats to enjoy the view. Several bars and restaurants were within walking distance along with a 24 hour convenience store across the street. The reviewer who mentioned \"beware of train noise\" is correct, but it doesn't bother me--it's just a sound of the city that I kind of like, so not an issue here. The bed was very comfortable. I asked for a wakeup call in the morning and behold! A real live human called. It's been years since that's happened to me. Free wi-fi if you join the \"In Touch\" Klimpton loyalty program. A couple of things that I didn't like so much: There weren't enough outlets to charge phones, computers etc. There was no IPod dock which I do expect in these more contemporily styled hotels. The coffee in the lobby was wonderful, but there are people like me who just don't feel ready for primetime unless I have had my morning dose. Even a small one cup coffee maker would do the trick. I know most hotels feel they must have bathtubs for their guests, and I guess for those guests who have kids, or consider a leisurely soak in a bathroom some sort of luxury, they would get complaints if a room had no tub. But I really like a walk in shower with a real door instead of the bath/shower/shower curtain set up. The decor was fine, but not really stylish to me.

Wicker Park/Bucktown, Oak Park and of course O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare are easily accessed.

Hotel: This isa great hotel, very reasonably priced with excellent amenities, rooms and staff. We were given room 1208, overlooking the intersection of Wacker and Wabash with the river, the Trump Tower and a Mies Van der Rohe tower forming a backdrop. The room was very clean, large, cool and bright with two queen beds. Our only concern would be the lack of drawer space (maybe due to this being an adjoining room with 1207. The window seats are wonderful to lay on and gaze out on the view or for catching a short nap! The hotel was very quiet with no hall or room noise. On the 12th floor we could just hear the El down on Wacker which we really enjoyed (the El was a major interest of ours). We enjoyed the size of this hotel where front desk and lobby staff recognize you. Complimentary Starbucks coffee in the morning and wine late afternoon, offered in a double height room adjacent to the lobby, were very nice touches. Staff: The staff were very helpful and professional, offering interesting and important facts and advice. At 11.30 am arrival, our luggage was stored and front desk staff called our cell a few hours later to inform us that our room was ready. Bottled drinks were left for us be the housekeeping staff when they realized we liked orange juice. When a family emergency occurred on our day of departure, staff offered to help get our luggage to the Lake station for the trip to O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare.

The Chicago Food Planet Food Tours are a wonderful way to slowly get to know interesting neighbourhoods (and to get away from the repetitive nature of places like the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMagnificent Mile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (not so mag in our minds). 3. The Steppenwolf Theatre in OldTown was a nice treat and we were able to get some good food and drink at O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Briens. 4. The trip to Oak Park (self guided walking tour and home tour) is very interesting. This part of Oak Park is beautiful and the home tour guides offer great insight into the life of Frank Lloyd Wright. 5. Whatever you do, GO to Millennium Park and the Art Institute. World class all the way. Unfortunately Millennium Park closes at 11.00 pm so be sure to go earlier to catch the amazing light of the Pritzker Pavilion and the surrounding buildings. In conclusion, we would highly recommend this hotel for your next trip to Chicago.", "Date": "August 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "US", "Title": "\u201cHotel Monaco Has Flair\u201d", "Author": "HotelGuestTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR37611095", "Content": "I am a frequent travler to Chicago.

But the staff seemed as though they weren't thrilled to work there. They weren't unhelpful, per se, but appeared to prefer that they hadn't been bothered to answer a question, whether it was for a restaurant recommendation or for directions to a Southside location. We were assured by two concierges that mass transit from the hotel was unavailable. A bit of internet research on my part (as an NYC native I'm used to navigating a mass transit system) revealed that the closest El stop (State & Lake) to the Hotel Monaco would drop us at a station on the Southside and from there it was an easy bus ride (the connection was right outside the station) that would drop us right across the street from our destination. Because we'd bought a one day fun pass for the cta, the round trip bus and train was included in the flat fee for the card (which we used earlier in the day). So, the concierges could be a bit more knowledgeable and helpful to guests traveling outside the hotel's immediate neighborhoods. One of them also gave us incorrect directions to the Willis (formerly Sears) tower. And when we checked out on a Saturday and discovered that there was an erronious restaurant charge added to our bill, the front desk clerk informed us that she could not reverse the charge herself. It would have to be done by the accounting dept., which doesn't work on weekends, so the problem wouldn't be taken care of until Monday. The promised follow-up from the accounting dept. didn't happen either.

I was planning on proposing this trip, so I splurged a little and booked a Mediterranean Suite on travelzoo for $189/night. What a deal that was! This promotion booked you into a standard Med. Suite, so I emailed the hotel and told them my engagement plans, and they upgraded us to a river view Med. Suite gratis. This was above and beyond but greatly appreciated. I am a Kimpton InTouch member as well, so all my preferences were noted and accomodated. These suites are large with a separate living room with a rather uncomfortable sleeper sofa and bedroom, each with their own flatscreen TV. In the bedroom, we swiveled the TV around and watched the Olympics from the infamous window seats. The bathroom houses a humongous whirlpool tub, but the small standup shower tucked away in the corner seems like it was an afterthought. View the attached photos for a better idea of the room. Being from out of town, I dealt with the concierge quite a bit trying to work out the details of the special occasion, and Ryan truly exceeded expectations with trying to plan this special day. He went to Fox and Obel on his off day to pick up a picnic basket as well as Target to pick up a few items, set me up with a local florist, and even picked up our food the day of the event from Pastoral around the corner. Everything went off without a hitch. Let me sing the praises of a few other staff members. We met Oscar, one of the Bellmen, during our visit in March, and he recognized us this visit, which was fun. Also, a couple of new friendly faces this go 'round were Jared and Mark (red-haired guy -- hope I got the name right!). Jared was interested in our plans and provided friendly conversation as we came and went, and both offered suggestions on where to grab a late night Chicago dog, etc. Now with that being said, we did experience a few inconsistencies during our stay. For example, the first two nights our room was not turned down, and with the exception of the above, the overall mood and vibe from the staff was not as friendly this visit. The front desk staff often did not welcome us back when we returned from a day of adventures like they did in March, and no one ever greeted us by name our entire visit as they had previously done. I do know the hotel was booked solid this trip with a large convention in town, and in addition the hotel was hosting a wedding this weekend as well, so obviously they had a lot going on. The staff just seemed over the top before and seemed to exude cheerfulness, and now I'd say they were just above average with the exception of the above folks. They set the bar so high on our maiden voyage and couldn't sustain that perception with us this time. Lastly, while staying at such a property, one comes to expect a certain level of service. I just didn't feel the attention to detail was there. For example, since the hotel was heavily involved in the engagement, I halfway expected a congratulations note, or them to send up a piece of cake, etc. Overall, I'd give the service from Shannon (the director of rooms) and Ryan prior to arrival an A+++, and the service post arrival a solid B.

Everyone was friendly and helpful, particularly Ryan and Rich (the concierges), the desk staff and the cleaning staff. Speaking of the latter, we never saw a cleaning cart or maids in the hall; they cleverly stay out of sight and seem to duck in and out of rooms without ever being spotted. And the maids left notes and special treats for us on a daily basis. The hotel's reataurant--while a bit expensive--was also excellent. The decor is classic Chicago, and the breakfasts and dinner--both food and service-- were top notch. And we loved having the goldfish with us during our stay! A final note: as a Kimpton-in-Touch member, I felt we received even better service.

Instead we were pointed to the elevator and the luggage came up a few minutes later. We splurged and stayed in the Karen Newburger (sp?) suite. Since I was not able to find any info on this suite, I will try to elaborate as much as possible. The door is special with curtains pulled back along the side and the door itself is padded. Nice touch! You feel special just arriving! Inside the door is a small hallway with a closet containing the robes (safari prints), even ones for the children, Karen N. pjs and socks that you can buy, ironing board and iron, blankets, etc. The blanket was extremely soft~ My dd13 loved to wrap it around herself while lounging in the window seat! Next is the dining/living room. There is a small round table with two chairs, a couch that makes into a queen size bed (not too comfy according to dds), a cupboard with games and misc. in it with a fountain hanging above it. They make a big deal of this fountain on the website but it's just ok. This room also has a LG flat screen tv on the wall and a big window seat with lots of pillows. Each window seat (I think there are four total) has a very comfortable cushion to sit on...So comfortable I could easily sleep on it! The window seats are very deep with a ton of pillows. Our family loved to people watch from these, especially the construction of the Trump Tower just across the street. We also enjoyed watching the boats on the river. The next room contains the king size bed which was very comfy with a pillowtop on the mattress. There is a bench at the foot of the bed, a tv in an armoir which also holds the honor bar, a large, very tall chair with a small table next to it where we put our 2 goldfish, and 3 more window seats. Lastly is the bathroom with a very large deep tub with a built in sitting area like in a juccuzi. It has jet sprays too. The sink is adequate with a rolling cart underneath with a blowdryer, wash clothes, and fizzing bath balls (I tried one and it was just ok, I think it cost $6). The shower stall is very small with no room for the shampoo, conditioner, and soap. The shower is stuffed into the corner like they used up too much room for the tub and the shower was an afterthought. The toilet is in the same room as the shower and tub. There was only one garbage can in the whole suite, the one in the bathroom. The towels are very soft! We had room service which was timely and very courteous. The bellstaff was friendly, helping with restaurant suggestions. On our departure, the bellhop was also efficient and friendly. We didn't partake in the evening wine festivities so can't discuss that. Overall, my family enjoyed the hotel and would recommend it. Especially if you are planning on doing activities close by. We were able to walk to the following places: Millenium Park, Art Museum, Oriental Theater, Chicago Architectural Boat Tour (go early if you plan on doing the 10:00 ride). If/When we return, we will probably try the Rock Star suite as it seems like it would be more fun. The Karen N. suite is great for a romantic visit.", "Date": "July 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "cliff_rock", "ReviewID": "UR18096895", "Content": "Stayed here for just one night after an evening on the town.

This was our first visit to Chicago and as always, we used TripAdvisor to plan our vacation (thanks!!). We were not disappointed with the outcome! We took in all that Chicago AND Hotel Monaco had to offer. Hotel Monaco is conveniently located on the edge of the Loop and the Magnificent Mile -- it's a wonderful place to stay for those seeking luxury without snobbery. As a side note, we're from the suburbs of DC (Northern Virginia) and are accustomed to having private transportation. However, based on our research, we decided to \"rough it\" and not rent a car while in Chicago. We're so glad we didn't rent a car. The El is less than a block away from the hotel and bus stops are EVERYWHERE. On with the review of Hotel Monaco...the entire staff was friendly and extremely accommodating. Service is always important....we received extremely pleasant service from the doormen and front desk. It was especially kind of the hotel to allow our early check in AND late check out. Sometimes those traveling with children may feel as if they're treated inferior to other guests...but we were always treated with kindness and respect at Hotel Monaco. The room itself was spacious, whimsical and clean. We had a fabulous view of the Chicago River and Trump Tower. The major highlights included: *Great hotel rate! *THE WINDOW SEAT!! My husband is definitely a manly-man and I never expected him to be overwhelmed by a window seat...but this was his favorite hangout spot *welcome notes and present from management (don't want to give away the surprise) *stuffed fish, activity backpacks and ice cream gift certificate for our 2 children *comfortable beds with pillow options (we chose down pillows) *actual pet-away-from-home (goldfish) *L'occitane products *turn-down service with chocolates *complimentary wine reception each evening at 5 *complimentary fresh baked cookies at 3 *familiar/friendly faces among the staff *complimentary Starbucks each morning until 9 (I think Hotel Monaco should consider offering coffee all day every day) *close proximity to everything Extremely Minor Complaints: 1. The concierge gave us wrong directions for the bus (circled the route on our map), but that wasn't too big of a deal as we would've gotten lost on our own anyway. From what we could tell the concierge was well respected by the other guests. 2. Housekeeping was adequate but we had to request extra towels our first 2 nights as there were 4 members of our party (they only provided 3 towel sets).

Not a pleasant way to start out the day! These things happen I suppose, but I hope the hotel does have some system of trying to prevent it from happening, such as keeping track of how old the fish are and which ones are likely to die soon. Our goldfish was replaced by the time we retuned to the hotel for the night. Chewy II survived for the rest of our stay, thankfully.

The Hotel Monaco-Chicago is a fairly typical Kimpton which means to me...friendly staff, funky decor, offbeat amenites and a general \"hip\" vibe in a small boutique property. This location adds the positive of a excellent location right on the river, one block from Michigan Ave., which made walking to all downtown sights and shopping easy. My only complaint is this. At check-in, I was immediately recognized and welcomed as an In-Touch member and was told that a room with all of my preferences (high floor, quiet room) had been \"blocked\" for me. I appreciated the greeting and assumed that my allegiance to Kimpton would land me a choice room location. We headed up to our room on the 14th floor (top floor, so preference met!). Though, we had to search for the halls for the room awhile, it turned out to be down a small hall with only one other room located off of it (quiet room preference met!). The disappointment came upon opening the drapes to check out the window seat and views you have read about in other reviews for this property. To say I was shocked to find no window seat and a view of a solid brick wall from the building next door not twenty yards away is an understatement. Upon investigation, it appears there are only three rooms on each floor with no view and I was afforded the privilege of staying in one of those. Would it not have been better for the Front Desk Clerk to explain that in order to meet my In-Touch preferences, I would forfeit any view and give me a choice? Okay, I've vented and with that said, don't hesitate to book this hotel for business or pleasure. If you know and like Kimpton properties, you won't be disappointed.

Chose Hotel Monaco based on location and also an enjoyable stay at the sister property in Seattle last year. It was a good choice. For me the best things about the Chicago Monaco are its location and the excellent and friendly service. From here we were able to cover a lot of territory on foot (and wheelchair, in the case of my hubby). The staff were great starting with when we made our reservations - many hotels will not block a particular wheelchair accessible room, meaning you could arrive and find that you have a room that doesn't work for you. The staff at the Monaco blocked us a room that met our needs. We arrived tired and hot from the airport an hour an a half before check in time. Rather than giving us grief because we were early, the front desk crew immediately offered to hold our bags and then call on my cell phone once the room was ready. This little courtesy made us feel good about the place the minute we arrived. It was especially appreciated because it was the day of the Chicago Marathon and everything was hopping. We did not use the concierge so can't comment on that. But otherwise all staff were friendly and responsive, including when we asked for a chair to be removed from our room to give us more space. Someone arrived to do so almost immediately. We were a little disappointed in the restaurant, having been spoiled by the good one adjoining the Seattle Monaco. The South Water Kitchen is convenient to have next door, and is fine, but not quite up to the standard set by the hotel. The restaurant adjoining the Hotel Burnham, a nearby Kimpton property, is much better. Price was steep (with tax a 5 night stay in a not-very-big room totalled almost $2000) but since this was hubby's first trip to Chicago (and only my second) I thought the splurge was worth it to stay in a pleasant hotel in such a central touring location.", "Date": "October 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans, LA", "Title": "\u201cAnother great Kimpton hotel!\u201d", "Author": "NolaDoc", "ReviewID": "UR10055676", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for five nights for an anniversary trip in early October.

It was fine for us because we were splitting the bill, but obviously it's not for those on a budget. The good things: cute, funky decor that is well kept-up---not a bit worn. I love the Hotel Monaco for their originality. They will give you a pet gold fish if you like, will accommodate your dog, and will even help you find a place for doggy day care if you need to be at work during the day! What else? Great location. It's easy to arrive on public transport from the airport (I took the train in from Midway airport and walked no more than one block). Once there you can walk to more touristy things or take the L. I really love the location. It's close to the art museum, the magnif mile, and the theatre. We took the L to the Second City theatre (the etc stage) and walked everywhere else. Our room had a view of the river and fantastic funky window seats with big pillows. So much fun for window gazing. Oh, and FREE WIRELESS. Loved it. We looked at other \"cool\" boutique hotels and found that the Hotel Monaco had the largest rooms (vs. The Burnham which has rooms about half the size--be sure to ask, they can tell you in square feet how big the room is) or the best location (vs. Hotel Indigo). All were in the same price range (ie, EXPENSIVE). The downside: The price. It's not cheap. If you are on business, go for it! You'll love it. If you are splitting the cost, it's a good splurge. The only other thing I'd warn about is the concierge service. We got a TERRIBLE recommendation for a restaurant...I mean this was one of the worst restaurants I've been to anywhere. This has happened twice while staying at the Monaco, so I am not sure what motivates their recommendations, or whether they just aren't that good at this.

A goldfish adds a bit of whimsy, but it's the attention to the fundamentals that is important in picking a hotel. Friendly service, comfortable beds, a centralized location and a good shower and towels are those fundamentals and Monaco delivered those to us perfectly. The decor is exotic and funky and the doormen are pimped out to lend a handful of street cred to the younger, hipper, more adventurous crowd this Hotel is marketed toward. Lots of patterns and materials. The staff did not put a tip envelope in our room for the maid service. The cleaning staff instead received a chocolate bar from the honor bar. No biggie. The concierge was very helpful, booking tickets for the Architectural boat tour along the Chicago River and providing one 1/2 off ticket for the Art Institute of Chicago.

When we arrived early the next morning, I was expecting some trouble since check-in wasn't until 3pm. Our reservation was indeed canceled. It took 20 minutes to check in, but the up-side was that the staff put us on the top floor, slightly facing the river.

We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant, merely because we were too exhausted from our flight cancellation to venture to Michigan Ave. I would not recommend the restaurant- the fare was standard but the service was slow. This isn't a restaurant that locals would choose to go to, but isn't that a standard hotel restaurant? The room had all the standard amenities- high-thread count sheets, 2 funky animal-print bathrobes, Aveda products, but the highlight was the fabulous windowseat. I spent many times just sitting in the cushioned window, looking out at the river and the \"corncob\" towers. The window was HUGE and with it came major drafts, but the curtains were thick and helped alleviate the draft. Another minor fun perk were the delicious hard candies at the front desk.

My husband wanted to surprise me for my 40th birthday by staying overnight in downtown Chicago. He booked a room for one night, Friday October 27th, and asked for a room on the top floor with the best view. We arrived early -at 11:00 a.m.- and were told the room wouldn't be ready until 3:00. They told us we could check in our bag and they would call our cell phone when the room was ready. We paid to check in the bag and left to do sightseeing and shopping. Although no one had called, we returned at 3:00 and retrieved our bag. The room was still not ready. Now we were told by the manager that the guests had paid to stay in the room until 5:00 p.m. so it wouldn't be ready until 6 p.m. by the time housekeeping cleaned it. They offered another room on a lower floor without the best view. I asked what the rate would be and was told it was the same. We looked at it. The view was disappointing. Since they were going to charge us the same rate we decided to wait for the better room we had originally been promised. We paid to check in our bag again. We spoke to the concierge for recommendations on where to kill some time until our room was ready. He gave us a card for a free appetizer at the hotel's adjoining restaurant, Water Street. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and appetizers- a flatbread pizza and 2 \"sliders\", items the bartender described as the special appetizers of the day. When we presented the coupon with our order she said she could not honor it for the flatbread because that \"is not really an appetizer. It's just what we happen to be serving today.\" But she could apply it toward the sliders-$1 each. We told her to call the concierge next door. She spoke to him over the phone out of our earshot. She agreed to honor it for the flatbread but asked if we wanted the special one she had previously described or the one \"with just the cheese.\" I was ready to go back to the hotel and return the \"free\" appetizer coupon if it was going to be that painful for them to honor it. We were done at the restaurant around 4:30. Feeling like we were wasting our day, we went out again. At 7:10 p.m. still no one had called us. We went back to the hotel and asked if our room was ready yet. The girl behind the desk looked confused. Yes it was ready. I asked why no one had called us. She had no answer. During this conversation, the manager was present and he also offered no explanation why we had not been called. Once we were finally in the room we felt we should have a late check out to make up for the time we had to wait. I called the desk and spoke with the same girl we had just checked in with. She informed me the latest we would be allowed to check out was 2:00 p.m. I told her that was not satisfactory since when we tried to check in earlier we were told late check out was at 3. She put me on hold, returned and said we could check out at 3. Finally in the room and unpacked, I attempt to take a shower and no soap! I called the desk again. Housekeeping arrived shortly with 4 bars! I'm not trying to get extra soap. I don't think one bar of soap is too much to ask.

I printed out directions, we were coming from the Field Museum, but after 1 turn the street was blocked off for Taste of Chicago. So, it took us about an hour driving around downtown in Friday rush hour traffic stuck behind a bus, but we finally found it. We opted for the valet parking at 36 dollars a night. It seemed high, but when I checked with a nearby parking garage the fee was 27 dollars for 24 hours, so the extra few dollars was worth the convenience. Check in was painless, and our bellman was very pleasant. I thought he was going to unpack our luggage for us! The room was huge, two queen beds, etc, but no window seat, which was my determining factor for choosing this hotel over it's sister hotel, the Burnham. I called down to the front desk, and the very efficient clerk assured me that I had a really nice room and I should stick with it. If i wanted to switch to a room with the window seats, it may not be as large, and I may not get two beds. I didn't feel like making a fuss, so we stayed with our non view room. As I said, it was quite large, with 2 small tables with chairs, two comfy armchairs, one with an ottoman, and the cabinet in the corner with tv, honor bar, and cd player. The bathroom was especially large also, with nice size tub and shower. I was happy to see the magnifying makeup mirror, but the bulb must have been burned out. The extras like cotton balls and cotton swabs were provided, that was a nice touch. I signed up for the Kimpton customer loyalty program, and was pleasantly surprised to receive a tray shortly after we got to our room with a personalized card, a bottle of Fiji water, and a biscotti, as well as a complimentary menu item should we go to the restaurant. The beds were comfortable, one had a down comforter, one had a blanket. The decorative pillows were kind of stained and gross, but we always just toss those to the side as soon as we get into the room anyhow, so no big deal. We faced out onto an alley, and the first night I was awakened by garbage pickup in that alley, never heard a peep from other guests though. I didn't take advantage of the wine reception in the evenings, or Starbucks in the morning, but other people seemed to be enjoying them. We were in the room the first night when the turn down attendent came, so she just left ice and candy. The second night we got back late, and I was expecting to come back to a dark room. I was pleasantly surprised to come into a dimly lit room with the relaxation channel on the tv, and a chocolate surprise on the pillow. We had a problem with the toilet not flushing efficiently, and practically before I could hang up the phone, an engineer was there, plunger in hand, and had the problem taken care of. When I returned home, I received an online survey to fill out. I dutifully fill those out, as I have gotten them at other hotels I've stayed in. I was honest, and to my surprise I got an email back from the manager saying he was sorry my stay wasn't flawless, and should I stay there again, make my reservations directly with him, and he would do everything in his power to make sure I got my 2 beds plus the window seats. That was refreshing. I've had major problems at other hotels before, and no response back from management. To have this personal reply to my minor disappointment made the difference for me between looking at another hotel among the many fine ones in downtown Chicago, or going back to the Monaco. To sum it up, the location was great for the theatre, 3 blocks to theatre where Wicked is playing. Garrett's popcorn is right next to the theatre, Marshall Fields is right there....

I will preface this by saying it is possible that it is just due to the holiday weekend and the hotel being booked full, but we will not give it another chance to see. Arrival: Doorman literally just looked at us coming in with our luggage (we had to walk from down the street due to the parade). There was no offer to try and get the door or to even help us with the luggage. I thought that was a litte strange, but okay, whatever. Check-in: Perky girl at the front starts checking me in and then says \"oh, no...what do I do?\" Sorry, can't help you there! The young man next to her tells her our room is not ready and we can preregister. My husband and I were not upset at all that the room was not ready because we were there several hours before check-in. However, this young man looks at us and tells us \"we can't just kick them out you know!\" NOW I'm getting a little nervous that this is going to be the hotel from....but, we laughed and said that we understood and they said they will call us when the room is ready. We left, ate, walked the entire Mag Mile, sat at the Vet Memorial..la di dah...no calls...finally, at check-in time I ask a less perky girl if the room might be ready. She says \"no\". I mean, nothing else so I said well do you have an estimate? She said no, its hard to tell. I could go on, but lets just say that we finally were helped by an older gentlemen who was WONDERFUL. He called housekeeping got our room ready and we were in only an HOUR after check-in time. Room: Next time I won't ask about the room and maybe they will actually clean it. There was a mess left from the previous guest(s). Wrappers, plastic tags and lots of hair in the bathroom. UGH. To think we paid $309 for a Med Suite and actually had to inspect the sheets to see if they were cleaned. The couch had 'stains' (I won't go there) and the floor had lots of little puddle stains. I know they are pet friendly, but this seemed a little much. The shower was extremely small and you had to do some strange maneuvering with the bathroom door to get to it and the toilet. However, we did enjoy their bathroom amenities and their cute minibar offerings. Nice view of the Chicago River, State Street and Wabash. Restaurant: South Water Kitchen was actually pretty good. We ate twice in the restaurant and once as room service. It was pretty basic fare but it was all very good. Location: we liked where the Hotel Monaco is located. It was an easy walk to the Mag Mile, theater district, pretty much anywhere we wanted to go. The only thing I would suggest is if you are going to Chicago strictly to shop then the location may be out of the way. I can't imagine having a lot of shopping bags and not being able to drop them off occasionally. If shopping is your passion I would suggest staying on Michigan Ave somewhere such as the Intercontinental. In summary, I did not hate the Hotel Monaco. I think their front desk personnel needs training in basic customer service skills and their housekeepers (at least the ones on the third floor) could use some retraining.

Nice Aveda bath products in bath... wonderful. The negatives were few but will mention - $7 lovely brightly tissue covered bath balls next to tub beckoned children to throw them in at parents' chagrin! Overpriced honor bar with cute little stuffed toys, pringles, and candy and such that could not be moved out of kids eyeshot and reach (attached to armoir just under TV) - to parents' chagrin! We were put into a smoking room when asked for non-smoking - in hotel's defense, we did not mention and did not ask for room change and only asked upon departure whether it was smoking or not (it was smoking) and there was a mix up for which they apologized profusely. Also, wallpaper torn where chair rubbed it in livingroom - no big deal but looks shabby. they need to repair and get chair rail. The room service took way too long, cost way too much and was mediocre. The delivery guy complained that the hotel took 1/2 of his tips and held out his hand for more (on top of the 18% already charged to the bill)! The parking was high $36 per night - oh well... it's Chicago and probably not unreasonable for the area. The huge plusses besides the ones already mentioned, the staff was great!

The mini fridge was stocked well, but the little goodies bin looked like the goodies have been there for years. Dusty with crumbled wrappers.

Very good hotel, and I'd stay again. Some of the criticisms in the thread below are just unfair and harsh; e.g., fwiw, the front desk LV replica is NOT shabby. I prize the following in a hotel: value, convenience, cleanliness and ambience. Pros and cons as I saw it: 1) Convenience: arrived at Midway on Southwest at 0920. Took our carryon bags straight to the Orange line, $1.75 fare one way. Made the mistake of transferring to the State line, although we ended up in the new Pedway and exited through the Marshall Fields--my wife thought that was a good thing. The hotel is only a block or two away from the El station, an easy walk even with bags. Gate to door time was about 40 minutes, and was 30 minutes on the departure since we took the Orange line directly to the airport. I think Chicago is a very easy town to navigate, but the hotel location makes it extremely easy. The in room maps made finding our eating locations and walking strategies easy to figure. Concierge gave a very accurate estimate of how long it would take to cab to Charlie Trotter's; finding a cab on a wet Friday evening in December was a challenge; we walked over to the Wrigley building and caught one after about 5 minutes. 2) Cleanliness- the room was spotless. Be aware that this is an old building and there is some sound transmission from the halls to your room. We had room 1212 with an excellent view of the river, even with our early check in. The bay windows are nice. Most of the noise actually came from other guests who thought nothing of allowing their doors to slam behind them. Staff was very polite and appreciative when we gave her a tip at the end of our stay. 3) Ambience- a pretty good effort here. I like the Kimpton approach, having stayed at the Argonaut this summer in San Francisco. Kind of an eclectic decor. The room was comfortable, the bed was fine; there's about 25 cable channels (no HBO). Did not dine at the hotel or the adjacent restaurant. Did eat at the Corner Bakery just down the street. All staff were fairly friendly. Business Center on the third floor had free internet access and a printer (no printer from the front desk computer) so we could checkin with Southwest online and get our boarding passes ahead of time. 4) Value-- this is one of the city's busiest weekends; no discounts of significance. Paid $199 per night and felt good about it at checkout. Paid two and a half times that for a single meal at Charlie Trotter's (and, incredibly, felt good about that too!). No question I've stayed at hotels with higher marks, but often with a notably higher price tag. I have stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Chicago and liked it, but would return to the Monaco first. The Kimpton group is usually willing to exceed any discount you can find on the Net, so be sure to ask when you book. If you're a reasonable guest with fair expectations (unlike some of the whining I've read here), I think you'll have a good time.", "Date": "December 12, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, FL", "Title": "\u201cToo Snotty and ------ for Me\u201d", "Author": "Jude8", "ReviewID": "UR2868950", "Content": "Disappointed!

Looking at our juice, he then emphasized to us that the wine hour was \"FREE\" insinuating that cost was a factor to us and we were being cheap.

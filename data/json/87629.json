What a cool hotel. Not the normal adjective I use for hotels. The decor was very contemporary and soothing. The rooms were obviously retro fitted from renovation, but very cool. First time to Chicago. We enjoyed the exceptional hospitality and customer minded attitude. We ate breakfast at the in house restaurant-AWESOME!!!!! The food was EXCELLENT!!!! The waiter made note that the clear coffee mugs were not holding heat well enough from customer feed back -so they were changing them and apologized in the mean time......since when do restaurants skip image for practicality? The in room option to buy drawer was something new for us to experience- not your standard beer,water and snacks. The only downside was the mattress- the platform bed was uber cool but hard as a rock!!!! The area was very nice, we walked around (my husband went for a run) without concern and the area is stunning for the price! Be prepare to pay hefty overnight parking any where in Chicago ; (.

I left after one night because of the small room size (we had 2 kids with us) and the rude service. Decided to give the new ownership a try because of its location close to Rush/Division Street bars on St Patrick's Day weekend. A previous post hit the nail on the head. This is a refurbished property not a renovated one. The lobby, bars and resturant are very modern. Check in was efficient. Asked for a room with a view - got a room on the eight floor with a view of the fire escape stairs, looking into the windows of another room on the 8th floor (hotel is an L shape configuration). Manager said this was best available. Ice machines are on the 8th and 17 th floors only. In a building with old elevators this could be an inconvenience. I get what the decorators were trying to do. Everything in the room is of small scale - apartment size furniture, platform bed (about 12 inches off the floor) , shelving all at a low level tying to give the space a taller feeling, small desk with small uncomfortable chair with a sheepskin throw on the chair. (Really - do I want to sit on a sheepskin and have white fuzzies all over my clothes? ) Room had a fine layter of dust on the furniture (evident because some of the furniture is black. Temperature is controlled by a wall thermostat - but that is somehow hooked up to the old wall unit under the window. There are no ventilation ducts in the entire room. Just this old noisy unit. Perhaps the hotel had not switched the air conditioning on yet - the weather was unseasonably warn and the room was HOT. Thermostat set to 65 did nothing to cool the room. The closet (which is a walk in) and bathroom were very uncomfortable. Bed was ok. No top sheet - which was weird. Towels were luxurious. No hot water in the morning. A call to guest services stated they were aware of the problem. (Previous posts also mentioned this - perhaps a recurring problem?) Maid service left no soap or shampoo despite the original bottles being used up. Towels were just set on the counter not hung up. The ambience of the hotel was just not for me. Seemed like a bunch of young people playing dress up, all trying to be something they are not. Felt like the hotel is trying to be the poor man's Ritz. I would not stay here again due to the arrogant aire everyone gave off. Also it is dog friendly and I try to stay away from places the allow dogs in the lobby - I just don't get that (and yes I have a dog). If you are here to enjoy the bars this is a good location. If you are into the shopping on Mag Mile there are far better locations. Price on Last MInute Travel was about $80 a night.

Thought about it and you know what she was right. Each room i have been in since the new people took over is basically the old furniture spray painted white. The more you look around you see that every thing in the room is the old stuff, if you'd ever stayed her before, has been spray painted white ......crazy but that's what you experience. The bathrooms are still tiny, not renovated, just spray painted white except a new sink i think. Hallways are cool with brown painted walls, dark but looks beautiful. The famous Pump Room looks great now. Trendy small plates of food and drinks starting mostly at $19.00 each are lushish. NY city prices in Chicago. Kind of cool though, if you have money to burn and aren't too concerned about service. Skip staying here but spend a few extra bucks on a drink in the Pump Room to see what the famous old timers experienced. Didn't eat at the Pump Room in its glory days but the photos all over the place in the hotel will show you it's not like it was back then..... and it shouldn't be now it is 2012.

Our welcome was very pleasant taxi doors opened by the door staff and our luggage promptly dealt with. Check-in was a breeze, and we were soon escorted to our room by a very friendly chap. We opted for a standard room which was very comfortable, cosy and well appointed. It had everything we needed. I would like to echo a few points that have been made on tripadvisor already. I can imagine some of the rooms will look very tired, very quickly. Beige carpets will not last. Some of the decoration does look a bit rushed, and again, overtime may start to look tired. The public areas are clearly designed for locals and non-residents. This is not the kind of hotel where you can relax with a quiet drink after a long day sightseeing or working. Every night the bar, restaurant and public areas were jumping. It clearly attracts a youngish and affluent crowed, however, this didn't bother us, but it may bother some guests. The hotels biggest asset are its staff, everyone we met was great, helpful and in no-way pretentious or snooty. If you like the latest, trendy, place to-be-seen hotel, then this is for you. If you want a more traditional business hotel or a quiet relaxing hotel, then perhaps look elsewhere. Location.... this is a matter of opinion.

We live in the CIty, but enjoy occasionally staying at a hotel here and there. I must say, this hotel definitely did NOT disappoint. It was a fabulous stay! Lobby - Front Desk Area - Beautiful. Very sleek, clean, modern decor. Service is excellent, valet parking ($45 in and out service), front desk help, everyone is very friendly and accommodating. We had a Standard King on the 7th floor, and it was beautiful. There are a total of 17 floors. The rooms are similar to the clean, sleek modern decor that is displayed throughout the hotel. Room wasn't very large, however it was comfortable, attractive, and lovely. Simple clean lines, great design, the bathroom, while on the smaller side, was also very clean. Loved the products given too! Complimentary Wi-Fi given, which is a plus, as some hotels charge $10/day for it! Location - right in the heart of Gold Coast, and a couple of blocks away from the Lake, shops, and restaurants. GREAT location, and being residents of the City, I can vouch that you will feel like a million bucks staying around this areal Parking and Transportation - couple blocks to the Clark buses, and the 151 Sheridan bus that takes you right onto Michigan Ave. If driving, valet parking is available for $45/night, with unlimited in and out service. There is a parking lot across from the hotel but does not allow you to go in and out, therefore my husband and I opted for the valet parking. Very quick and convenient. Just call about 10 minutes before you are to head out, and when you get to the lobby, your car will be ready!

Walking in, you will feel like you are among the few people that have been told about this secret sophisticated sanctuary. I will say that that checking at a place like Public was almost like going through a screening process to get access to all areas of the \"cool kids clubhouse\". -Rooms- Not much to say except the rooms at Public left me with mixed feelings. When I first walked in, the first thing I said out loud was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, this is bland.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I had higher expectations after just experiencing the game-filled lobby. However, after \u00e2\u20ac\u0153connecting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the room, it started to grow on me. The rooms had a freshness that I found quiet calming considering all of the action in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153public\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd areas. However, I would have liked to see a little more color. Overall, the rooms were comfortable and temperate, but not spectacular. -Food- I would describe the food at Public as pleasantly decent. I decided to skip the Pump Room restaurant and order room service, which offered the same menu items. I ordered the Public Burger, which was absolutely amazing. Usually I find myself spicing up a burger, but I was shocked that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to do that this time. I also decided to try out Public Express, which is Public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gourmet fast food option. I ordered the slow roasted organic turkey sandwich, which tasted way better than it looked. Aesthetics aside, Public Express is a nifty option if you are on the way to the airport or wanted to stash some food as you explore Chicago. -Bottom Line- So, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the deal... I am not sure that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d sleep here again (don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hold me to that). However, I would hang out at Public every chance I got. It is a perfect watering hole, lounge, and brunch spot, which is what it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s known for. I am not sure why the name \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Public\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was chosen, but if it was to be open to the public then the mission was accomplished! There are so many different inviting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153public\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd areas from the coffeehouse-like library area to the sophisticated Pump Room. With rates starting around $140 a night, you might want to give this hotel a try. I paid $195 a night, which included a complementary upgrade and $25 food/beverage credit\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6not bad at all. Public is an inconspicuous little hotel tucked in a residential neighborhood 10 minutes from Michigan Ave. You are so close to the action, but off the beaten path enough that you could call yourself a local\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6at least for the time that you are a resident at Public.

The 270 $1 rooms sold out in minutes, and many have argued that the sale was a marketing hoax/publicity stunt on behalf of the hotel. The good news is, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m living proof that it was a real deal, and frankly, my entire decision to take a trip to Chicago with my girlfriends was influenced by this sale. In fact, we were thrilled that we were able to make this trip possible for under $100 each including round trip airfare. Overall, we had a great 2-night stay for a grand total of $2.34 including all taxes. The chic boutique hotel is conveniently located in downtown Chicago, a few blocks from the famous Michigan Ave (The Magnificent Mile). A cab ride from ORD is about 20-25 minutes depending on traffic and will cost roughly $35; luckily there were three of us to split the cost. As you can see from the website, the Public Chicago is a new addition to Chicago, with its grand opening in October of 2011. The Public is a very sophisticated luxury hotel conceived by Ian Schrager (creator of Studio 54). Inside the Public is the Pump Room restaurant, bar, and lounge. We did not dine at the Pump Room during our stay, but we did have a drink during happy hour (5-7 pm). The crowd was a bit older (45 ish), and very upscale. As far as drink prices, they certainly were very expensive for Chicago. I ordered a mojito, and it was $15; let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just say that I was sure to sip that drink for a very long time. The staff were friendly and accommodating overall. Since we arrived to the hotel before check-in, they allowed us to leave our bags with them so we could explore Chicago for a bit. We had lunch nearby at Gibson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Rush Street, which was only about 3 blocks away from the property. During lunch, the front desk called us to inform us that our room was ready. The lobby, common areas, and rooms were absolutely stunning, modern, and artistic. We were certainly impressed, and most importantly, we enjoyed some much-needed quality \u00e2\u20ac\u0153girl time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd away! If you missed out on the deal the first time around, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fret. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be another chance of scoring a room of your own for $1. The Public Chicago will soon be announcing another round of 270 rooms available for $1. You must register your email address to be notified of the sale, and act quickly! The lobby of The Public Chicago was definitely chic, modern, and stunning. We were given a standard king room. I'm surprised all three of us were able to comfortably share this bed. Flat screen TV and decorative artwork I loved this modern desk and faux-fur throw. The mini bar and menu (caution: very steep prices). Fully stocked mini fridge. Again, very steep prices. In-room snacks and gift memorabilia. The Public candle costs $65. Ouch. The bathroom was stocked with The Public's own line of bath products (shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, and bar soap). The sink was modern and had plenty of hand towels. The shower was new, immaculately clean, and had the best water pressure I've ever experienced at a hotel.

Upon arriving at the hotel it seemed pleasant, a bit hip on the style, but the crowd that was hanging out in the lobby was definitely carrying AARP cards. The rooms are very small and very stark. The heating system was extremely loud, but it came in handy when we were trying to go to sleep and needed to drown out the noise from the adult movies which seemed to be on continuous play all night long in the room next door. At 4 in the morning we were awoken by voices that sounded like they were in our room but they were coming from the adjoining room which we had a door to within our room and you could see light coming thru the room. We started talking ourselves and I think we shocked the new arrivals b/c they were a little quiter after that, but you definitely could hear everything thru the walls.

The walls are paper thin, as we learned after the next room turned on Sportscenter at 1 am as we were trying to sleep. We were meeting family in town, and since there was no room or seating accommodations in the suites, we decided to meet downstairs in the lobby. After getting Starbucks and cupcakes, we were informed 10 minutes later that there was no eating or drinking in the lobby (what?!?). Meaning you can't find space in this place to hang out for a bit and enjoy coffee or a drink with friends and family. I don't get that philosophy, especially for a hotel. There are two restaurants in the hotel, but I must say the patrons were given more preferential treatment than the hotel guests, which is consistent with the other reviews I've read. But hey, there is free wireless, nice Mac desktops downstairs, and nicely decorated. But compared to the 15 or so other hotels we've stayed at in Chicago, ranks up there with the worst for us.

I found the hotel to be somewhere in between \"average\" and \"very good\". From the photos I had seen and from the write-ups I had read, I think I was expecting something a little more along the lines of a W or a Sofitel - very modern and style-focused with touches of luxury. This was not a gut renovation of an old hotel. There was no gutting, merely putting in new furniture. It almost felt like they didn't finish the job. For example, the wall outlets and light switches hadn't been replaced and were old and yellowed. The doors and door knobs were all original. I don't know if this was a stylistic choice, perhaps it was, but it didn't have the effect of \"modern meets vintage\". Instead, it came off more as a lazy job of updating. My husband and I stayed 3 nights in a one bedroom suite. The suite was large and comfortable; however, the bathroom was small. The suite came with two very large closets, one of which was right next to the bathroom. I told my husband that they should have knocked out the wall in between the bathroom and this second closet and made a lovely, spacious bathroom with separate tub and shower (ours only had tub/shower combination). There was also no storage or counter space in the bathroom. And, possibly most egregiously, our bathroom had no hot water on our first morning there. Inexcusable for any hotel, but particularly in Chicago in February. The staff took care of it and was very apologetic about it, but I don't think a hotel that is trying to position itself as \"high quality that is affordable\" should have this problem. It made me think that they didn't put new plumbing in the old building either. We did enjoy our stay because we like Chicago and it is in a nice neighborhood just north of downtown - close, yet quiet and more neighborhood-y. However, I do not think I would recommend it. We paid a special, discounted Jetsetter rate for our room so it was fine, but I wouldn't pay the full price for it. Lastly, the public areas of the hotel are fantastic, Library Bar and Pump Room. We had one experience with the Pump Room that left us slightly upset - we arrived at the hotel on Saturday night at around 7pm. We had just flown in from LA and were starving and pretty tired and we didn't have the energy to venture outside in the cold and darkness to find a restaurant. We knew beforehand that the Pump Room is an extremely popular, new Chicago restaurant; however, we thought that as hotel guests they might be able to squeeze us in. We mentioned it at check in and were told that the front desk and the restaurant are kept separate. So we talked to the host at the restaurant and he told us he would call us and we were the first on the list. We sat up in our room until 8:15 when we went down to inquire and ask them to tell us honestly if we would get seated because if not, we were going to go somewhere else. There was an empty table right there for us. He had neglected to call us. As a restaurant in a hotel, do not make your hotel guests feel like second class citizens. We know that the Pump Room is not a typical hotel restaurant as patronized by non-hotel guests as well; however, as a hotel, you will have guests arriving who do not know the area and do not know where to go to eat and for convenience sake just want to eat downstairs. Maybe keep aside a few tables for those last minute hotel guests. We did get seated and the food was incredible, one of the best meals we've had in a long time, but we didn't appreciate the feeling that we were second-class citizens. (We had the same issue a couple years ago at the Surf Lodge in Montauk and it really negatively affected our perception of our stay there).

Close to everything, without the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave. When we arrived, the doormen where very polite. We had our 2 yearold with us, in a stroller. As others have mentioned, upon entering the hotel, one MUST use steps. Not many, but steps none the less. The doorman helped carry the stroller up the steps. Once we got our bags to our room, we were very disappointed in the size. The bed is almost to large for the room. In the room, I did not have enough space to take a full step without running into something. Our view was ok. Nothing spectacular. After traveling all day, we went down to the Pump Room for dinner. It was around 7pm. We had just traveled and we were wearing jeans and polos. Almost half of the tables that we could see where open. We were told they had reservation wait lists for many hours. I left thinking it was because we were underdressed. The doorman who helped with the stroller helped us find a place to eat. When we got back, it was different doormen. They were counting their tips and never even acknowledged us. As others have mentioned the walls are very thin. I could hear the TV and conversations of rooms around us. The mattress was harder than I prefer. After check out, we left our bags at the hotel. When we returned to pick them up, there was no greeting or assistance with the stroller from the doormen. We had to hail our cab as well. They were just standing around shooting the bull. I'm not sure if I would recommend this hotel. I guess I expected more from a 4-star hotel.

A birthday cake was delivered right after check in without silverware or plates to eat it with. A quick call to the front desk did solved the problem in less than 10 minutes. I requested said cake in the afternoon the day before my arrival so the hotel was not able to accommodate my request. The concierge was at a loss as well.

The hotel is in a great location and the lobby area is very stylish and clean. However, as soon as I came into contact with the staff, I was very displeased. I paid for my reservation in advance, but upon arrival I was told that I would need to provide a credit card for an additional hold for incidentals. I travel very frequently and from previous experience, when a reservation is paid in advanced whether through the hotel or a third party, the EXTRA fees to be paid are listed in the terms and conditions of the reservation. I had no knowledge of this hold, so I refused to provide a card for it. A manager was called to the front desk and she was very dismissive and rude and acted as if she wouldn't let me check in unless I provided a card. After telling her more than once that I was not prepared for this, she handed me my key without telling me what floor my room was on, nor where the elevator was and that someone would be coming up to my room to collect all snacks and drinks from the mini bar! How rude and unprofessional! I was also told that I would receive a complimentary upgrade as soon as I arrived, but after meeting with this manager and denying her my card, I guess she had a change of heart and I never received that upgrade. My room was very clean and comfy, but very cold. When I turned on the heat, the room became extremely hot too fast! There is no balance. Also there are no heating vents in the bathroom. I also noticed in the menu that there was a Happy Hour from 5pm-7pm, but I checked in on a Saturday and wanted to make sure that this applied to the weekend. The front desk staff could not answer my questions and told me that while I was out, they would leave me a voice mail letting me know. I never received that voice mail and was told that they forgot my room #, so they could not call AND it turns out that the hotel NEVER has any drink specials, even during the week, so this is false advertisement. The drinks in the pump room lacked ingredients stated on the menu because they \"ran out\" and I paid $14 for a tart martini. Overall, this hotel needs to train their staff on professionalism and to be more knowledgeable of the hotel, the \"Happy Hour\" that does not exist needs to be removed from the menu, the heating system in the rooms needs improvement and the bar should be re-stocked of all necessary items before they run out!

The hotel is newly renovated, the lobby is really impressive and at the time was decorated with a huge Xmas tree. The bar and the lounge are really gorgeous, with comfy sofa, loungers in front of a cracking fireplace and cool bar area always full of cool people. The restaurant, Pump Room is stunning decorated, service is impeccable and food is light, simple and delicious. I would say the common areas are the reason why you should choose this hotel. We had great breakfast time every morning in the lounge eating yummy \"pain au chocolat\" and drinking super cappuccinos ( really Italian style!! Compliments to the guys at the bar, I only had better in Milano's cafe Cova) while reading magazine or simply enjoying looking at the fire and great evening with lounge music and drinks before going out for dinner. The hotel bar and lobby are a venue themselves you don't have even to go out and look for something else as they are packed with a beautiful crowd! The hotel is a really cool choice but.. The rooms are quite small, we booked a deluxe room and were quite disappointed for the size and the decor. Previous we stayed at the Trump Hotel and I must admit is difficult to bet concerning room size, quality of the furniture and atmosphere. The rooms at Public are sadly just old rooms with a \"touch-up\". They are all white, looking also modern with new bed linen, new flat screen TV, new side boards and desk, modern lamp, carpet on the floor is also new but... There are stunning old light-switch /socket that totally clash with the new interior, carpet looks like just temporally placed (seemed not glued with all the cables passing under and over) and of a very low quality, air conditioning/heating is extremely noisy and looks as old as was the Ambassador West (former name of Public Hotel) door, walls and wardrobe are just painted white over (under still the old Ambassador stuff) and bathroom is tiny and definitely very poor in style! No bathrobe, no slippers, no quality toiletry product. The sensation we had is that money of renovation were just lacking at the room level and things were arranged to be looking as best as possible with the minimum investment possible! Nothing to do with keeping the \"old spirit\" because those things have nothing to do with history are just poor details that may not appear to everybody but were definitely disturbing our general feeling about the hotel. Overall we would recommend Public Hotel for young couple, friends looking for a cool hang-out, good location (easy walking everywhere especially to the stylish Rush street and neighborhood) we would go back most probably for another weekend of shopping (with low budget on hotel despite the prices are not so low!) but we would not choose it as comfortable hotel for a family trip with our kids.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, WI", "Title": "\u201cModern, with cool amenities\u201d", "Author": "DJSteve4", "ReviewID": "UR122376367", "Content": "Stayed here for NYE, booked the standard queen room, upgraded to a larger king room, would recommend not staying in the queen rooms, they remind me of staying in a NYC hotel.

This is an Ian Schrager hotel and should be understood as such! We stayed at the Public mid-week in December just before Christmas. We booked a superior king room. Initially we were offered one across from the elevator on the 12 floor facing Goethe Street \u00e2\u20ac\u201c south \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with a good view. The room was quite nice and the bathroom not as small as others. However, we could hear the elevator door and bell noise, so we asked to be moved which was done without question. The new room was slightly smaller facing State Parkway on the 13th floor. No real view. Smaller bathroom. Ok. Those are the facts. Now for the review. I think others have described the place pretty well. I liked the rooms very much. They are serene and in keeping with Ian Schrager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s style, filtered perhaps through his time at Marriott. He did preserve the footprint of the original rooms and so yes, the bathrooms seem small by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standards. Yes, white paint goes a long way when covering age, but many of the doors and moldings are original and still show their paint layers. The hallways are dark, also hiding age I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure, but all his hotels have dark hallways. We slept really, really well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even on the platform bed everyone else complains about. However, being an Ian Schrager hotel, I should have been better prepared for the public spaces and what goes on there. When we arrived on a Monday afternoon at 3, the place was dead \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so dead that we could not get a cup of coffee without begging at the bar. However, that night, when we returned from dinner, the bars and Pump Room had turned into such a scene that we had NO desire to stop in the bar and have a drink. As guests of the hotel, we felt that our hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that we were paying to stay in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c had been taken over by external forces unknown. They really should reserve a place for guests only, so that one feels the hotel cares, even values, the people who pay to stay there. As a consequence we had not desire to eat in the Pump Room. But like I said, this is an Ian Schrager hotel! As for service, well, it is young and green and spotty. When my father used to stay here after Canadian fishing trips, back when it was the Ambassador East, the cooks in the Pump Room would keep his catch in their freezers and my sister and I would be led down to pick out our fish. Something tells me this is no longer my father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pump Room. Final note: the art is terrible (except for those hanging orbs in the Pump Room) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fire the art consultant! Cows with hats? Really?

The lobby is as impressive as a new iPad. Modern, brash, youthful, vibrant - everything you'd expect from Ian Schrager. We got a real buzz walking in, past the outdoor heating units with their tall flames trapped in glass cylinders that emitted a welcoming radiant heat on the rather raw day that we arrived. Then we entered the elevator. It opened on our floor and the hallways were gloomy and uninviting. Then we opened the door to our room. The very comfortable bed was very close to the floor. No great issue there. The room was clean and white. The first hint of an issue was the popcorn ceiling. This told us plenty. The old hotel that this was must have had cracked and unsightly ceilings and the quick and easy way to deal with that was to apply popcorn. Our hearts sank a little. Then we walked into the tiny bathroom. Only room for one, I'm afraid. No bathrobes or slippers, either. Body lotion was missing and we went down to the front desk to get that. A simple note in the bathroom telling us to call the front desk to ask for this would have been easy to do, I think. No other major issues. But this isn't a Hilton Garden Inn, either. And we had just come from staying at one of these in Indiana and that room was larger and the bathroom much more accommodating and for a LOT less. But this is Chi town, after all and the nabe was quite upscale. We just wanted to feel pampered, though, for what we were spending, and after the experience of that lobby, we felt a tad let down. Breakfast was not included. We went elsewhere for that. Hugo's Fish restaurant nearby is a must. Wonderful service there. Pleasant service at this hotel, too - but the overall experience was not good enough, alas, to warrant another star.

I have also stayed at the AW many times and while it was always a place steeped in history, the rooms where what you'd expect from an iconic Chicago hotel-classy, dated, but fine. As my mom lives in chicago, we come back to visit often and have stayed everywhere (Drake, W Lakeshore, Peninsula, Grand Hyatt, Intercontinental, Marriott, Westin, Indigo, Sax, Aventi, Elysian, Four Seasons) and while midwest hospitality is amazing at all of the above, we have finally found our home away from home in Chicago. Ian Schraeger surely put his touch on the AW but luckily it's not as dark and eclectic as his recentish redo of the Gramercy Park Hotel in NYC -it's light, modern, beautifully decorated and with incredible service to boot! If you are looking to stay in the middle of the shopping area and want to walk outside to shop big box retail, this is not the place- although oak street and michigan avenue are just a short walk.

Will keep this hotel in mind when I come back to Chicago. Tips: 1. Review the Hotel Website for room promotions (special offers) and you will save money. I saved $40 on parking and got a room upgrade at no extra cost http://www.publichotels.com/chicago/home/ 2. Try the coffee and the coffee lounge its about $4.00 but worth the price 3. Take a walk around the hotel to scout the area for possible dinner or lunch spots 4.

There were plenty of restaurants to choose from and all within walking distance. I'll put that in another review. We were about a five minute taxi ride to the Chicago theater which cost $15.00 with tip for five people (not bad) Staff: courteous I must mention that Albin the door man was exceptionally helpful and Phil at the front desk was also helpful.

I think its difficult to find any business with such a staff. kudos to the hiring manager(s) Room: I found everything to be comfortable the bed was a king with plenty of space This was also the case with the bathroom.

What we found to be the most impressive aspects of PUBLIC Chicago are: * the beautiful public (no pun intended) spaces - lobby, Pump Room, the Library & Coffee bar * GREAT service from staff - everyone was very friendly, helpful, and responsive * free WiFi throughout the hotel as well as 4 iMacs for guests' use in the lobby * very clean, modern, minimalist decor in rooms * some of the best towels I've ever used in any hotel Things we a little bothered or put off by were: * tiny bathrooms * no dresser in a Standard Queen room * location - the hotel is located in the beautiful/quiet Gold Coast, but it's not as convenient as many other major Chicago hotels. It's not near the El and it's a bit of a walk to Michigan Ave. Since it's also nowhere near any expressways, getting to/from the airports takes a bit longer and costs more $ via taxi. What we found odd about the hotel is the clientele. For a modern, trendy reincarnation of a classic hotel, we expected a younger, more trendy guest population. However, most of the guests we saw during our stay were geriatric Midwesterners. When we did encounter an expected trendy clientele at the hotel's restaurant/bar, the Pump Room, it was full of pretentious, wealthy, older middle-agers trying too hard to socialize w/ equally pretentious partiers half their age. It was just weird seeing such a dichotomy amongst the people coming in/out of a hotel that openly markets itself as a hip, trendy, style over substance establishment.

In terms of service, the front desk doesn't allow guests to borrow umbrellas (in a town where it rains for like 5 months nonstop), it took them 20 minutes to check us out and fix a charge on our invoice (and it wasn't fixed so now I have to call them when I get home), and no one was particularly welcoming our 3 day stay there. Plus the Pump Room was unable to move our dinner reservation from 2 to 4 people, which is silly and tells me they don't value guests staying at the hotel. There were two things I liked about the hotel: the fitness room had many, new machines and was decent sized, and the people who came to get dinner and drinks at night were all well dressed. It was a good scene if you stayed in the Library Bar and didn't hang out in the other bar near the Pump Room. Overall, I'd say this hotel is just a 3 star hotel that caters to one time guests and locals who will take friends and business clients there for drinks and dinner. Nothing really wrong with that but potential travelers should book knowing this.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mission Viejo, CA", "Title": "\u201cVery good but they are still working out the kinks.\u201d", "Author": "CocoFranco", "ReviewID": "UR120961169", "Content": "I stayed here on business for a few days and conducted all of my meetings at the hotel and the Pump Room so I am very familiar with it.

It actually has a feel of a W, but less stuffy, or maybe that's just Chicago. From the second the door of your cab is opened, the staff are great, directing you to checkin and the woman there was really nice and quick. The room itself is really modern, super low bed, desk and massive closet. The bathroom is a bit on the small side and the sink area a bit oddly designed so difficult to spread out your toilettries, but overall it the room was really comfortable and I liked the design. So my one complaint, yes, I literally think I found just one thing I would recommend for them to change - get body lotion in the bathroom! All 3-star+ hotels have this now and when I called down to get some, they checked and offered to run out and get me some, but that wasn't necessary. A hotel of this calibre should have body lotion in the room. Perhaps they had run out or hadn't gotten it in yet, I know this is a new hotel, but that was the thing I noticed. As far as our meeting went, I had 2 days in the conference rooms and everything was great. There were plenty of healthy options at breakfast - yogurt and berries, my standard breakfast, and everything was really fresh. There were more choices on other days too and really fresh orange juice. We didn't have any technical problems and everything was set up nicely. We did turn on the heat at one point and it smelled weird, but I guess it was probably the first time of the season that the heat had been used so that's normal. The lunch we had was really good, although the dessert portions, 3 huge donuts each, were a bit much :) I'm not too familiar with this part of Chicago, but we were able to walk to restaurants, even though when you're driving up to the hotel, it appears that it's at the edge of a neighborhood.

The proprerty is located in the Gold Coast area - if it is a nice day, it is easily walkable to downtown (my meetings were downtown - I walked it in about 15 minutes). The best part of the visit for me was the proximity to Lincoln Park and other areas that made me feel like I wasn't even on business. I don't know Chicago well, but loved the area. If you know DC, it is similar to Georgetown or Dupont Circle; similar to the upper west side in Manhattan. There is an L station a few blocks away from the hotel, so you don't need to take a cab unless that is your preference. The decor is sleek - the rooms have a platform bed and simple but functional modern furniture. The service is great.... as an example, the mattress was too firm for me - they put a pad on the bed after a simple request. The staff gave great restaurant recommendations, and was quick to recommend best routes for walking. Although the hotel has a 'swanky' feel, the staff isn't stuffy or snooty.

If there was a minor issue with the room or any part of our stay, they went above and beyond to provide an immediate, timely solution with no attitude whatsoever--love that! There's no being put on hold or transferred around, someone answers the phone from outside or inside the hotel and is immediately ready and willing to assist. Todd, the \"Chef Concierge\" was most helpful and really seemed to know a lot about the history of the hotel and many local attractions. A few of the Guest Services staff I met were truly outstanding; especially Katie and Alexa--both were extremely helpful prior to our arrival and proactively attentive during our stay. Can't say enough about the willingness of practically every staff member we encountered to deliver the best possible experience. We were very happy with the location; this beautifully renovated, classic old hotel is surrounded by wide residential streets, mature trees and charming residential buildings and brownstones. It's a short walk to several good restaurants like Hugo's Frog Bar and about a 20 minute walk to The Loop / Michigan Avenue. [We found it easiest to take a cab from the hotel to the nearest blue line and take the train directly to/from the airport, otherwise you have to switch lines and walk several blocks.] The hotel common areas are stylish and stunning--high ceilings, cozy seating areas and all the original architectural details dressed up in neutral tones and quirky accents. The Library room with a roaring fireplace off the lobby has wonderful coffees, salads and deserts to eat-in or to go. We loved the concept of express room service; a set menu where the wait-time was minimal minutes. There's no spa in the hotel but the concierge or guest services can order a masseuse to come to your room--in addition there was an Exhale spa a few blocks from the hotel. Our room was the best part of our stay...we booked a Loft and were graciously upgraded to a one-bedroom suite which was like having a chic, comfortable and relaxed apartment of our own. The rooms were beautifully appointed with every amenity and thoughtful detail, including a king-sized bed that was amazingly comfortable--Frette linens and huge down pillows. The only downside of our stay was some late-night street noise--a result of the vibrant scene that flocks in and out of the lobby Thursday - Saturday nights. The Pump Room restaurant, bar and lobby areas seem to pull huge crowds. We ate several meals in The Pump Room - every breakfast and a memorable dinner that was one of the best we enjoyed during our stay. Again, the food was great but the service really distinguishes itself and elevated the entire experience. Highly recommend it if you can get a reservation.

Notable: I also have HIGH expectations for the BEST service, products, options, connectivity, quite room atmosphere, world class fitness equipment, cleanliness and STYLE -this is how I roll. Period -to please me is no easy feat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I AM MORE THAN PLEASED WITH MY STAY AT THE PUBLIC HOTEL, the newly refurbished former Ambassador East in Chicago's elegant Gold Coast. Below you will find exactly what I find to be appealing, attractive and addicting enough that I extended my trip twice whilst residing, have entertained important business customers 4 times at The Pump Room - new food and wine list and priced very well -see below: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Precision: Every single staff member went through a 3 week training process and it shows (I got to know them in the Library bar and restaurant.) The staff is HAPPY so guess what? Happy people deliver HAPPY precise service- \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Style: The hotel kept the original architecture and integrated incredible style, casual chic with the most beautiful working fire place, open rooms, the highest ceilings, love seats and a scrabble (my fav,) always on hand. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Casual Chic: I am American so to see all staff wearing the latest skinny jeans from Levis, Chuck Tailors and high heels and tasteful fitted black little numbers for the cocktail ladies, I am thrilled and my customers, most financial, are, its perfect. I am able to hang out in a Cavalli number or flip flops and it all fits . .advising all to shower up - the crowd around here is easy on the eyes - :) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Service: This is a BRAND new hotel with BRAND bar, restaurant, service rules and staff. A few times there were silly mishaps but were fixed so quickly and SOLVED without drama, I have never experienced such great attitude service, probably because these people are happy to serve, they are cool with it and so am I. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Best Effort: With a new establishment, not everything goes according to plan, flexibility, customisable things, and trying a bit harder to impress the first time are all key initiatives. I do think BEST EFFORT is directly related to leadership and guidance and also, is directly correlated with HAPPY people - it is not PUSH or aggressive, but mellow and effective. These people cannot do enough to make everything work to your liking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Finally, I am thrilled to have discovered this place in my most coveted old neighbourhood, I even checked out an apartment to buy across the street. I have decided not to buy the apartment and just stay here when I am in town.

Right from the start: located in the best Chicago residential area - the quiet, aristocratic Gold Coast,- you arrive at this elegant, welcoming entrance. The staff is sweet and helpful (and they remember your name for days!) then you walk into this cloud-like place, like a hip temple for every day and for everyone, with communal tables and computers for all. The lobby, the library (where you read, talk and drink delicious coffee or libations at night) and the rooms are exquisite! You must order breakfast: a new way of getting your morning fix is in place: you're in for a surprise, that arrives fast too!

I have never reviewed for trip adviser, but had to relay the story of this great place. First, the location. It is a one block walk from Lake Michigan beaches and Astor Street neighborhood represents a walk around one of the most beautiful residential streets in the world. Gorgeous old mansions-prettiest street in Chicago. The restaurant is a spectacular recreation of the famous Pump Room. Pictures of Cary Grant, Don Rickles, etc. are remembrances of the past, but the modern decor of the restaurant is a knock out. Two rooms of bars, library, and couches surround the restaurant and at night were filled with crowds of people from 25-70 years of age, straight and gay, white and black, all mixing to music and discussing everything under the sun. We spent half an hour just sitting on a couch and people watching as men mostly in blue jeans, mixed with well every sort of friendly individual you can imagine. The food in the dining room for dinner and breakfast(everything made fresh in the kitchen) was great and meals were about a very reasonable $20 or so. My wife's pasta was the best she ever had and my pork chop was terrific. The atmosphere was simply electric. We were on our way to a $100 a person restaurant when we decided to eat here as it was as fun as can be mixing with loads of couples before dinner. The rooms were decorated with fun and leisure as goals, and our upgraded room was huge.. Every person working in the hotel went out of their way to make our trip terrific. The location is a short cab ride from downtown and Michigan Avenue shopping. We love Chicago and have lived here all our lives. We would recommend staying here to anyone-from out of town or for a romantic weekend away from home. If you fly into Midway or O'hare you can cab around the city for a weekend without a car. Great for singles or couples. Seemed to attract many locals to the location. Makes me proud of our city and certainly the friendliest atmosphere possible and This is an independent for real review. We have stayed at all of the $500 a night Chicago hotels and would pick Public over all of them.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Woodstock, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cPublic Chicago\u201d", "Author": "gmweber", "ReviewID": "UR118788088", "Content": "We recently spent an night in the newly renovated Public Chicago and loved the hotel.

Great service, always responded to every request quickly. Just needed to tweak some things: * The all white decor is overwhelming. Maybe a bright painting and a few colored throw pillows would help. * If you are going to supply candles in the living and bedroom areas, supply matches or lighters. * a mini bar but no glasses? * the lighting in the bathroom and vanity area are horrendous (coming from a woman!). They probably didn't want to mess with wiring in an old hotel, but seriously that horrible ambient yellow light is ridiculous to apply makeup in!! Overall, a great hotel. The rooms were huge, bed comfy (low platform bed, hard to get out of for older people maybe!), and amazing service. The room seemed \"cool\" and we loved the floor to ceiling curtains around the room. I went with 3 friends and we felt like we were rockstars with this amazing room and the staff falling all over to help us (hope they keep that up!). There seemed to be a lot of extra staff, but it was opening weekend so that might change. Our room didn't get cleaned on Saturday until almost 6:00 (even though we told the desk we were going out at noon and asked of it to be cleaned while we were gone).

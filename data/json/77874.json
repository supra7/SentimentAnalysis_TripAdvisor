Once in 1994 and last week. The hotel is massive, has many shops, restaurants and things to do such as a running track, pool, and meeting rooms. The color coded elevators are very confusing if you are going to the ballrooms for meetings or finding your room. The elevators did not go to the 2nd level for the meeting rooms. I ended up taking a service elevator where I found myself somewhere in the bowels of the hotel. My room was big, but my bathroom was so small I thought I was in an airplane. The counter tops have not changed. I understand the shape of the hotel, but they have to make the bathrooms bigger. There is a pungent, musty and moldy smell which is a shame as I love the Westin candles/aroma stick oils. The service however is outstanding from the valet who retrieved my blackberry cable and had the bellhop bring it up to my room without hesitation, the check in employee who made me feel welcome, and the gentleman I ran into in the basement, who redirected me without making me feel as if I was intruding on private territory.

The walls were a bit thin as well; I could hear the neighbor's tv. The most interesting aspect were the elevators -- an amazing view of LA in the glass elevators. Just don't be agoraphobic.

Room - It was fine, clean, bed was comfortable however the room itself was quite small which doesn't tend to bother me except that there was a door to an adjoining room hence it felt a little intimate being able to hear someone russling about on the other side. I was however annoyed about the card swipe into the room (which is amusing seeing someone else comment on this.) After checking in, I had to return to the reception as my cards didn't work to get into the room and to get them re-magnetized..... lo and behold, they still didn't work when I returned and after trying them again and again, finally managed to get the door open. Every time I returned I would have to swipe 15-20 times to get the card to register (and I stay at hotels regularly hence am not unfamiliar with how these work!)

I couldn't find it on tripadvisor so I am putting down my review as part of the hotel entry. I visited the lounge with friends while on a leisure trip with friends in January 2012. I was referred to the place by a friend and I can say that it was one of the best referrals I ever got fro a fellow traveler. The lounge is located at the top of The Westin Bonaventure hotel in the LA financial center. It has a magnificent view on all of LA, Hollywood and Santa Monica. the view is simply breathtaking regardless of what time of the day you are in. It it probably the best attraction of the lounge. If you come in the afternoon you will sure experience the wonderful LA skyline and the great residential plains scattered all across the city. At night the scene changes into something out of a fairly tale. The view transforms into a dazzling festival of lights, you can see all LA lights shining everywhere among the darkness of the clear Californian sky. The lounge is revolving, so it turns at 360 degrees each 50 minutes and it gives you the benefit at looking at all sides of the city without leaving the comfort of your seat, although I doubt that you will stay put as you will want to snap pictures from every single angle. At some point you become facing the tall skyscrapers of the commercial district and that's another magical show of lights. The service at the lounge is worthy of a 5 star. All employees are simply perfect at what they do, they are always smiley and help in anyway possible to show you around, point at the best things to see, suggesting the nicest cocktails and meals on the menu. They are always surrounding you without barging in. I loved how I was treated knowing that I did not have a huge bill. This shows great value and great respect to customers. Needless to say the menus were also fantastic, very easy to understand and very easy to order from, they hold all what one requires from a lounge. The drinks, cocktails and wines are just great. The list is endless and very refined. Prices are very balanced for such a place and you can sure enjoy the best of the menu at very reasonable prices knowing that you are being served in a 5 star place. I fully recommend the lounge for all visitors to LA and even to residents of the city. you don;t need a reservation if you are going for drinks, just let the elevator lift you to a dazzling world of lights amidst a gorgeous sky. trust me you will not regret it.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Menifee, CA", "Title": "\u201cBusiness of making me feel comfortable\u201d", "Author": "NurseBethany", "ReviewID": "UR124210417", "Content": "I was in LA on a short business trip.

My room was a 31st floor suite (thank you SPG platinum), with a very comfortable bed, great furnishings, and incredibly spacious. Views were unbelievable, and I got to make fun of my colleague who could not face the windows in the elevator (cowered against the door due to fear of heights). Breakfast in the restaurant was very well done, albeit at large downtown business hotel prices. Staff in the restaurant, front desk, bell desk, and doorman were great. My only critical comment would be a softball I threw to the concierge. I asked if he could have a bottle of champagne couriered to a business associate who is taking a new job. The request befuddled him, offering room service on the telephone. I know I was looking for a creative solution (the Ritz or the St Regis would take an address, and charge me out the wazoo to do it, but they'd do it). Instead I had to make other arrangements.

Rooms were a bit smaller than I expected, but the bed was very comfortable, so I didn't really mind. When in LA, one doesn't really stay in their room too much anyway.

I give great credit to the maintenance and front desk staff for getting that problem fixed up in a hurry, especially for such a large hotel. I also really like the complementary WiFi you get in your hotel room, you don't find that in many of the larger chains. I did expected the soundproofing to be better than it was. On the third night, the person in the room next to me apparently had too much to drink, and I got to hear in every gory detail as he became quite sick in his bathroom... so loudly that it sounded like he was in my room. I suggest getting a room away from the elevator, because you can hear the hallway noise quite well if you don't have a TV on. As for the location, don't stay here if you expect to be in the middle of everything. The Staples Center is about a 10 minute walk from here, but other than that there isn't really anything to do outside of the hotel that doesn't mean taking a cab to. Now the hotel has several dining options, and several different bars. I suggest the Bonaventure Lounge, a rotating eatery/bar at the top of the hotel.

The price of room service is the reason I gave it four stars, not five; the food was fine, but not worth what they are charging. Tip: If you cannot live without Diet Coke or some such, bring your own. There's a nice fridge in the room, and room service charges almost 5 bucks for a soda.

We went out for something to eat, came back and went to sleep and when we woke up in the morning it was really cold. Thermostat was not working again. Being private people we did not want to have the technician come in the room while we were in our pj's and in bed. We just left after breakfast. Other than that, everything was really nice. LA is a great city (we both have lived 15 miles south of LA our entire lives) and we never had experienced the city life. We would recommend going to downtown and stay and enjoy the scene but will we stay at the Bonaventure...probably not.

Great architecture, the rooms are well laid out, and have great views, are clean and the beds are comfortable. Everyone on staff was very pleasant. A small annoyance: being a guy, I should not have to hold the toilet seat up with one hand while I'm standing there using it. I thought this was a problem unique to the first room I had stayed in there at the Westin, but apparently it's all of them. The marble shelf sticks out too far so the toilet seat cannot be put back to where it will stay up on its own. Not a problem for women, but a bit of an annoyance for us guys. And for the price I paid for a Friday night, I think all of the outlets in the room should work. On one outlet, neither plug worked, so I wound up unplugging something in order to charge my laptop.

The lights. The busy office people. The hustle and bustle. The sounds. Stayed at the hotel for one night. This place is HUGE! Really something to look at. Calming in a strange sort of way. I was one of the lucky ones and did NOT have a car to park. Avoided the $400/night parking fee. Ok, not $400, but not cheap. Hate paying for wifi at hotels, so I didn't. **I think the time has come for luxury hotels to STOP charging for wifi! The room cost should cover that, especially at these rates. If even a 2 star hotel can cover the cost of wifi for the guests as most do, pretty sure, Hilton, Weston, Marriott etc. can afford to do so. I had a King room. Small room, but decorated nicely. Flat Panel TV. Good coffee. FREE water (Good job on the \"free\" water Westin) and a small, but well appointed bathroom. Loved the leaf formed soap! The views from the 25th floor were OUTSTANDING. Open the curtain and you are faced with a sea of lights. Thousands and thousands of lights! Loved it. Even this high up in the sky, you hear a lot of city noise. But I liked the noise. Felt like I was in New York for a night. The only lights I did NOT like, were the lights in the room while I was trying to sleep. I like it dark when I sleep, but it seems more and more hotels are using TVs, Clocks, Phones, all with lights that emit all-night-long. A green light. A red light. My room looked like a lazer light show was going on! Had to use my shoe to block the green light from the TV. Had to use my other shoe to block the light from the clock. Had to cover the phones with books. Had to put a towel by the base of the door- you get the idea. What ever happened to dark rooms? In the morning I found USA Today at my door. I also found, at my door, 2 empty drinking glasses that had been there since the night before, when I checked in. I know the place is huge, but someone really should have picked those up. Overall, I really enjoyed the place. Felt very comfortable and clean. Was looking forward to taking a shower in the morning with the nice shampoo and soap. Bummer. The shower sucked. The curtain smelled of mildew and the actual space to take a shower could not have been any smaller. My arm kept touching the nasty curtain! Oh, and after 2 minutes, I was standing in about 5 inches of water. Gross. Horrible draining problems. But WOW! My hair smelled amazing after!

I have stayed there for many years, but the last couple of stays the old girl was starting to age a bit. Arriving in the underground carpark this time, I knew instantly that something had changed. It's been about a year since my last visit, and right off I noticed the proper desk for the valets and the fresh paint and wood accents. That feeling carried over up the series of escalators to the lobby where I felt like I was looking at an old friend for the first time and thinking something is different, then realizing that everything is different. Reception is a sleek desk of the same colors and wood accents used throughout the hotel now. It was inviting and chic, although the wood couldn't look anymore like plastic than it does. Check in was the usual quick en efficient affair, and then up in the famous glass elevators to my room. I booked a Tower Suite, which is love at the Bonaventure. They are two regular rooms adjoining through a sliding door. Both rooms are curved with stunning and iconic views of LA. I remember when the Bonaventure was the tallest building in LA. Now it's dwarfed by it's neighbors, but that just makes the views better, more dramatic. The Tower Suites have been completely refurbed, and look great. Still 1.5 baths, which is really handy, but everything has been upgraded and improved. The wet bar area is now attractive and useful, and there are shelves in the bathroom. The furniture is very comfortable, and the TV is now flat panel. The desk still faces the windows, so it's hard to work there because you end up staring at the activity going on below you. But it's a very useful desk, and there is plenty of light throughout the suite. My rate included breakfast, so down I went. The lobby restaurant has been thoughtfully redesigned and organized, and is bright, attractive, and welcoming. A far cry from the dark abyss of yore. And the food at the buffet was delicious, a big surprise and huge improvement from years past. Parking this time around was expensive, more than I remember from before.

I think they are exercising due diligence to keep the rooms spotless considering even a single and unconfirmed report of bed bugs can be a death knell for its business. The hotel has been the setting for several blockbuster movies too, including one of my favorites, In The Line of Fire. It was a real treat to be standing in the same elevator John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood were in for the elevator scene. Westin consists of 4 towers that are color coded. Once you know the color code of the tower your room is in, it should be fairly easy to navigate around. If you want to exit onto Figueroa Street, you will need to take the escalator up from the lobby, but other than that it was easy for me to get around. The rooms were clean and the maid service very prompt and thorough. Valet parking experience was acceptable, sometimes the attendees will be a bit harried and confused, but they're hard working and bring your car out quickly even when you don't call ahead. There are a few dining options on the 4th floor, but to access it you need to ride to either the 3rd or 5th floor I believe and then take the stairs, so it's a bit of an inconvenience, plus their opening hours don't usually extend to the evenings, so you'll either need to head out or order room service. Room service was for me was predictably expensive but actually pretty satisfying. The hot chocolate itself might have been the best deal: while it's $5, it comes in a huge pitcher and could easily serve 4-5 people. Delicious too. My major complaints had to do with Wi-Fi and the holds they put on my PayPal card. I was there for BlogWorld so it was expected that everyone in creation would be using their Wi-Fi, but I especially needed it because of having to get my iPhone replaced after the antenna stopped working. I was trying to do an iCloud restore which only works through wi-fi and despite being at the hotel for 4 nights, the wi-fi STILL wasn't good enough for me to fully complete my restore. There were times when the wi-fi disappeared altogether, leaving me to use my cell phone or a wired connection just to get online. To be fair though, the wired connection did work really well. Still, it was the wi-fi I desperately needed, and the hotel failed miserably there. Secondly, I understand that hotels will sometimes put a hold on your debit card if you opt to use that instead of a credit card. What I don't understand or accept is putting a $824 hold on my card. Seriously? Because I opt for the convenience of using a PayPal card (which I reserve for all my travel expenses) it was necessary to hijack almost $1000 of my money? This, despite the fact that the room had ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR. While I understand a hold for valet parking and room service, holding the cost of the room when it was previously paid for and debited already was ridiculous.

Several calls to the Guest Hotline and an frantic search by hotel employees finally found the clothes a few minutes before I was checking out for the Red Eye flight back home. It seems that do to some screw up my clothes had not been laundered but it really wasn't a big deal because I was heading home and could get them cleaned there. The hotel staff fell all over themselves apologizing for the problem. Although I had been charged for the laundry they immediately removed the charges from my bill without me even having to think about it. The manager came over to personally apologize after the customer service person had already apologized and given me 5,000 points on my SPG account. I told them that this was really no big deal and that mistakes happen and I was just glad they found the clothes. They insisted on taking my luggage to the curb and get me a taxi. While going through security at LAX the manager left me a message again apologizing and raising the point credit to 10,000 points. Now THAT is A+++ customer service.

I've been in love with this place since it was used as a futuristic backdrop set for NBC's Buck Rogers in the 25th Century shortly after opening in the early 1980's and have been coming back ever since. It's recently had a slight makeover to update the fixtures & look, but it's still a glass-tastrophe & crazy concrete cavern of a lobby. Phil Spector and his murder trial legal team loved it so much awhile back they rented a whole floor, ran up a huge bill in the 100s of thousands and then didn't pay...isn't that just so LA? I read other reviews and the things some people complain about, I find endearing or have just become used to. I consider this place my favorite 4 star budget hotel...and what I mean is that I usually get the rate reduced as much as half via a bidding site, and never park in the hotel's own garage which adds $40 to your bill a day (parking $8 a night one bldg over at World Trade Center garage)... I also rarely order anything from room service or the hotel's restaurant or bars...I'll buy beer at a little shop on the third floor for $2 and walk around drinking those looking at all the plaques from all the movies that have been shot here. It's a big busy place & after check in, no one is probably going to hold your hand, so just start adventuring and you'll figure it all out. It's in the heart of LA's downtown biz district, which can be a little boring or bleak if you don't know where to go for fun, but even if you don't leave the building their are worthwhile ways to kill time. Check out the actual beer brewing pub on the outdoor plaza, or go the top of the hotel for the rotating spinning bar with a view. I once got so buzzed at the center lobby bar before closing time, that I then got lost in this hotel and it took me over an hour to get back to the right tower and figure out on which floor was my room. The drawbacks are there is no free internet, that's pretty standard policy in most big-city big name properties, so bite the bullet and get used to it. The bedding, as in most Westin properties is always superior to whatever I sleep on at home.I like the baffling maze like winding stairwells that still disorientate me on my way to buy sundries, and cheaper quick serve food from the independent vendors that inhabit the third floor, which is absolutely inaccessible via any elevator I know of. If you find the weird little food court, you'll run into counters offering pizza, pasta, middle-eastern fare, salads and Asian dishes...and of course the food group known as Fried.

I recommend using a private transportation service like them if you are planning to stay at the hotel instead of driving yourself or a taking a taxi from the airport.

And I do often get my room via priceline/betterbidding research--so the extra tip is simply part of my expected cost in my opinion. the internet alone i get free pays for the tip. the service people there are smart and respectable--so if you treat them nicely, they will be nice in return.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eureka, California", "Title": "\u201cI had a great stay\u201d", "Author": "MajDollison", "ReviewID": "UR118544657", "Content": "I would definitely recommend this hotel.

Don't expect personalized service and if you like square boxes; note that the Westin's rooms sit within cylindrical towers. I stayed in a standard King room. It was pretty standard, a little on the small side and equipped with thinner walls than I expected. I couldn't hear the neighbor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full conversation, but this isn't a place where you can play the music loudly. The room had a small lounge chair, king bed, flat screen and desk. The bathroom, also small had a shower/tub. While fine for 1 person, I wouldn't recommend if your traveling party is greater than 2. The location is downtown LA, not near any tourist destinations. The downtown area is getting more residential so there are some nice nearby restaurants as well as plenty of Starbucks locations if you want to skip the hotel restaurant. I arrived very late my first night and went to the restaurant. For $25, I got a beer and a bland burger, though the view from the hotels penthouse revolving restaurant was nice. Parking in LA is notoriously expensive and the Westin fulfills that reputation at $35 per day.

We went to the hotel bar the night before so didn't get to bed till late. At 830am we were awoken by hammering from the room above. I can only presume they were having some sort of renovation. I rang the front desk to complain and was told that they would sort it out and call back. About 35 mins later it was still going on. We rang the front desk again and they apologised and said they would speak to a manager. The hammering did then seem to move to another room but we could still hear it faintly and never received a callback from reception. The second time we booked again in this hotel for two nights. Although we had a negative experience we felt this hotel was still good value (booked on hotwire) and in a good location for what we wanted. We were arriving from Cabos mexico and missed our flight (not our fault). We booked into the westin in cabos for the night and contacted LA to let them know we would not be arriving that day. When we did I spoke with the front desk about a refund for our first night and they explained that hotwire would be responsible. After speaking to hotwire I was getting nowhere so the gentleman on the front desk took over and spoke to the manager who in turn contacted hotwire for us and arranged for a refund. This was a big relief as we had spent so much extra on having to buy another plane ticket and booking the hotel in mexico. I really appreciate that they went out of their way to help us and thought this was excellent customer service. On this basis I can only imagine that our first experience was an unfortunate one off.

Overall, I had a comfortable stay, but the housekeeping could have done a much better job. I might stay here again, but for the price, I think the Hilton Checkers two blocks away is probably better. Check-in and check-out was quick; although there seemed to only two or three people at the front-desk at any given point despite there being at least 6 or 7 check-in counters. No one at the Starwood preferred guest check-in all the times that I checked. I got a room on the 27th floor, which was reasonably clean and large enough. The nicest thing about the room was the floor to ceiling view. The king bed was large and comfortable. The flat screen TV had a good selection of channels and movies. The bathroom was very clean, but the tub had a few stains - an indicator of the age of the place, more so than anything else. Plenty of plush towels and a complementary robe. The amount of hot water and shower pressure was also pretty good. The trash bins in the room were not empty on check-in which leads me to think that the room was hastily cleaned. I immediately checked the bed to see if the cleaning was superficial, but it appeared to be clean enough. Two of the pillows had a couple of small spots of blood, so I was worried about bedbugs. It took a couple of tries calling the front desk to get housekeeping to come and clean the room again. There was no complementary water in the room on check-in, but the housekeeping included this on the second day of the stay. The hotel complex is a labyrinth, and the concrete structure is reminiscent of a shopping mall, but I actually liked the architecture. There were some reviews about waiting ages for the elevators but this was not my experience. In fact, I felt that average time I needed to wait for was 30 seconds or less. I was given complementary internet access which was unexpected and pleasant - connecting to it was quick and it was fast.

The architecture of the building is really interesting and the exterior elevators are fun to ride in.

Also a note on the neighbourhood - we (small town Canadians) had been scared into not looking elsewhere for cheaper parking fearing mugging or break-ins, but we walked to Pitfire Pizza (about 6-8 blocks away) and back that evening, and although the neighbourhood does have some interesting residents, its quite busy and we felt safe the entire time.

We thought we were clever, since we had rung a few days before and were assured that there should be no problems with an early check-in, and the request was in the system. So we went to the reception desk and were met with a VERY icy reception. The desk clerk told us that check-in was 3 pm and that the hotel was full. I asked to speak to the supervisor, and Sonya came out. She told me that there was a \"request\" for an early check-in, but that really didn't mean anything. I asked if there were any rooms where the guests had already checked-out and where we could get in early. Sonya was uninterested in checking for such a room and told us that check-in was at 3 pm and our \"request\" was really unimportant. We finally did get into a room at about 1.30 after annoying the desk staff every half hour to check on room progress. We ate at the lobby restaurant and again service was terrible. We had to request service, although there were many staff. The food was adequate but nothing special. Internet service at the Westin Bonaventure costs about $12.00 per day and starts at 3 pm -- not $12.00 for 24 hours! Fortunately the internet service went down on the morning of our second day, so we were not charged for 2 days (even though we only were in the room for 23 hours!) Although the rooms were adequate and the views good, we got the idea that the staff were doing us a favour by allowing us to stay at the Westin Bonaventure. In over 30 years of international travel, I have never received such snotty service.

Certainly. Is there much they don't have to offer... Not really. So... If you can land an hot Priceline rate like we did, jump on it. This is a quality hotel with everything any upscale, large chain, downtown hotel would have. There are so many rooms here, it would be unlikely rooms are not available. Great downtown location to get you on your way to anywhere in L.A. quickly. We traveled with kids and requested a high floor, with 2 double beds. On Priceline, you are not guaranteed the double beds, so be sure to call the hotel directly as soon after you land your Priceline bid. You are most likely to get your request (we got the 14th floor, so not the highest, but more than adequate). If you drive a car, do not feel forced to pay $38/night. Park your own car, but use the right parking location. Just a mere 1-1/2 blocks away is the World Trade Center parking garage. Use the right WTC garage. Enter from Figueroa and 3rd. There is an automated lot with a max overnight of $16. If you enter after 4:30 pm, overnight is $7 (but get out of the lot early if overnight is Sunday turning to Monday, the per min starts at 6 or 10 or something). I paid $23 entering after 4:30 on Sunday and leaving at check-out at 11:30 am Monday. All other (Fri, Sat), I paid $7 with no hassle, no safety issue, and no valet tip or waiting for the valet. Added hassle - a little, but much worth it to avoid the crazy rates any downtown hotel asks for. The good: Very nicely done, with all major services available (concierge, bellman, front desk, - the works). Not many requests denied. I even needed to print some tickets for Universal from an online portal site, and the concierge (Roxanna) was so nice to help me. She allowed me to log into my Gmail, access the link, go to the tix website, and print 5 pages for no charge and no hassle. AWESOME! The bad: Not much. Worst thing is no free lobby WiFi and $13 for 24-hrs in-room WiFi or Wired Internet. Business center available, but remember - this is a 4* hotel, so all services cost you something (crazy per minute fees). But, I was told the Fedex office (or something) offers cheap per min. So, the best tip I have... Visit the area in and around the Suede lounge on the Lobby floor. This place has an open WiFi (but once I list this here, they'll probably lock it down). So, grab your iPhone or laptop and sit down there for free WiFi. Expect an occasional security dude to ask you if you are a hotel guest, so be ready to show your room card and just say thank you. Anyway, the hotel is huge and has all sorts of stuff (shops, restaurants, etc.) - almost a mall atmosphere - in and around the hotel. Just, one tip, don't be looking for a meal after 9:00 PM. Place shuts down all over (one of the biggest negatives). We did not eat at any Westin restaurants or bars expecting them to be all expensive. We did not use the gym (which is supposed to be terrific), and we also did not use the pool (on the 3rd or 6th floor - can't remember. So, end result - get a rate (around $100) on Priceline, and you are golden.

Compared to other Starwood properties that Ive stayed at, this was a pretty disappointing experience. It started at the check-in counter on the Tuesday. The room with the king bed I reserved was not available so I was a given a room with two queen beds. No big deal until I got into the room and it looked as if the previous guest was still occupying the room (beds not made, towels on the floor, etc). Back down to the registration desk. I was given another 'wonderful' room next to one of the elevators on a lower floor. I had to adjust the AC fan to high in order to drown out the external elevator and guest noise. It did not help me the next day for my business presentation. The registration desk told me they would call me the next day with a new room assignment and never did. This is an older hotel and navigating around the 'cloverleaf' silos and outside crosswalks is a pain. The rooms are renovated but the wireless did not work for me, nor did the ethernet cable in the room. I was lucky I had an aircard with me. Also, the desks do not have powerplugs and are positioned too far away from a wall plug, so I had to relocate the furniture in order to even work on my laptop. Phone, ipad and bluetooth I had to charge in the bathroom. Staff are friendly (when you can reach them). I spent more than 5 min on the phone waiting for someone to pick up from the operator and the phone was never picked up when I was transferred to the registration desk. I had to call the operator back and have someone call me. I know folks are busy, but this was a little frustrating. I just switched to the airport westin instead, even though it means dealing with the LA traffic to get downtown.

We chose this location because we were seeing a concert downtown and didn't want a late night commute back to the room afterwards. All in all, I think it was a great choice. The check in was painless, with friendly people working all around. The trickiest part was figuring out which tower you were in (there are 4 and they are color coded). The lobby is dated, but still clean and interesting. The elevators are big fun because 1/2 of the trip is inside the building, the other 1/2 is outside, which kind of surprises you when you pop up through the roof. Once we reached our room, we were pleasantly surprised. The room was adequately sized with a big fluffy bed, nice desk area and a wall of window, providing awesome views of Los Angeles. The bathroom was also lovely, with wonderful toiletries...a guilty pleasure of mine on vacation. I always check out what shampoos, etc. they provide. Needless to say, after a day of flying, losing 3 hours due to the time change and then sightseeing, we slept like rocks. I thought that being a little farther away from Hollywood/etc. would be frustrating, but it was not bad at all. We were able to get to all of the touristy areas, and some other fun spots within 20 minutes, which is completely reasonable seeing that we had such a nice room for such a reasonable price. The valet is EXPENSIVE and the only way to park there...but they are wonderful. It does take some time to get your car, which you should take into consideration if you have reservations, etc., but the valets are super nice. That was a good experience. One negative...they don't have many decent food options in the hotel. We tried to grab a quick sandwich or coffee and we ended up giving up and driving around to find something. There are a few restaurants that aren't expensive in there, but they were atrocious. They say that they have a Starbucks...but really its just the bar that serves really basic coffee, and thats about it. Definitely bring drinks/snacks with you for the room. A bottle of soda is like $3.

We arrived, and noticed this hotel is absolutely enormous and had a huge lobby. Most of it was already remodeled and very little construction going on. Check in was awesome and gentleman was very nice and gave me a newly remodeled room with 2 double beds. We took the lightening fast elevator up to the 19th floor (32 floors in all) and unpacked our stuff. Room was a little on the small side but it was just me and my sister so it was ok. Nice, newly done bathroom, plasma screen TV, coffee maker that makes 1 cup of coffee complete with condiments. Fridge, dresser, desk, iron board, closet, robe. TV had some very cool channels-Nat Geo, HBO, TLC, CNN, Fox news,WE, AP, etc.. This is the largest hotel by far I have stayed at. 20 restaurants in all and a huge food court/shopping area on 4th floor. In lobby there was a large circular bar, there is also a very busy bar/nightclub called Suede. Reasonable drink prices too. This is downtown so this is not the most convenient area if you go to Hollywood. Traffic is terrible an it is 30 minutes at least, to get to Hollywood area. There is a small Macy's plaza near by as well as many high rise buildings. Hotel was very quiet Fri night. However, Sat night hotel had a very large number of high schoolers there for prom. Every floor was like animal house and I had to call security twice before they came up and finally took care of the many teenagers who thought they were at a pep rally. Apparantly a large fight broke out on 23rd floor. My floor the 19th one was VERY loud. Noise appeared to be a big problem that night and hotel should have had extra security to keep the teens under control. The second time I called security the man was nice but said they were very busy with noise complaints and that they could not be everywhere at once. Luckily I eventually fell asleep. Be advised no free wi fi anywhere in hotel. I just used my sisters wi fi hot spot through her phone but I rarely stay at hotels with no free wi fi I only stayed here because of the great rate.

As other reviews have said, this hotel is showing its age. The room I stayed in had been fully renovated, as had the floor it was located on. However, I visited some other floors, and the hallways had not yet been renovated. I didn't get to look inside the rooms on those floors. I don't know if they were putting guests in those rooms/floors or not. However, even the renovated floors did not get their doors replaced. This may seem odd, and it is certainly nit-picky, but the doors into the rooms are very narrow, and seem to have just been painted over, rather than being replaced. Once inside my room, the doors were the only visible (and rather ugly) clue that the rest of the hotel was not as nice and modern as my renovated room was. The main age-related problem is the lobby and the 5 floors above it, which they call the \"Bonaventure Galleria and Food Court.\" During my visit, the lobby was visibly improved from recent renovations, and even more extensive improvements were still under construction. The Galleria was not getting any such special treatment at this time. As such, it just looked tired, and I found myself avoiding those floors as best I could. They were downright depressing! Anyway, my room was very nice. I had a normal room with a king-sized bed. It was large enough for me, and 2 would probably have been comfortable. However, unless the rooms with 2 double beds have more square footage, then I would imagine they would feel small. The recent renovations to the rooms produced an outstanding result, especially the bathrooms. My room felt comfortable, modern, and inviting. The views out the window were also great. Breakfast is, of course, not included, room service is outrageously expensive, and WiFi costs $13 a day. This pretty much seems to be expected of hotels in downtown LA. I will note that the in-room coffee maker includes complementary Starbucks coffee and Tazo teas. The housekeeping also provides 2 complementary bottles of water each day, though I found the tap water quite drinkable when those were empty. The service at this hotel was excellent. I never made any kind of hard-to-fulfill request, but everything I did ask about or request was answered well. The concierge and staff helped me find my way around LA, and housekeeping provided impeccable service. I used the laundry service as well. Ordinarily I wouldn't pay such high prices ($12.50 to wash and press 1 pair of men's jeans!) but I happened to really need the service, so it was nice to have. I simply hit the \"Service Express\" button on my phone, said I had laundry, and within minutes the staff were at my door to take the laundry bag. (A nice touch of Service Express is that they always address you by name every time you call.) The jeans were hanging in my closet when I returned to my room the next day. Though it does not excuse the exorbitant price, I was impressed by the impeccable service. The galleria area has several fast and fast-casual restaurants. Avoid them all as much as possible. (The Subway is OK if you must. I did not try the restaurants on the roof, which I'm sure are much nicer and way more expensive.) Across the street, there is an entrance to the underground \"505 Flower\" shopping center. There are TONS of good choices down there for inexpensive food, and you hardly have to leave the hotel to get to them. Try the cupcakes at the \"Lemonade\" restaurant! Overall, this is a very good hotel. The rooms look great, and I could tell that the nearly-complete lobby renovations were going to be superb as well. Though an online special, I paid $113/night (tax included in that price) for my room. I don't think you could find a similar hotel with a better price than that, so I consider it to be a very fair price for what I received. Do be warned if you are a light sleeper or easily disturbed- I could hear my neighbors talking (and they weren't even yelling) through the wall, and even on the 26th floor traffic was very audible. It did not affect my sleep or comfort one iota, but I know I sleep quite heavily.

Times Travel Show. This hotel was the official hotel of the show and they had a shuttle going back and forth for it. Loved the room. It was small and we could have used another chair. There was only one comfortable chair plus the desk chair. I like the Heavenly comforter that Westin always provides. But the bed was a little hard and the fact they don't use a fitted sheet for the bottom makes it weird because the flat sheet crumples up under you, and I had to keep flattening it out to be comfortable. Lots of pillows provided. Mini fridge. Safe. Nice clean modern bathroom with more than enough towels. Complimentary mineral water bottles. Floor to ceiling windows which can look a little scary when you are on the 29th floor. However, great view of Downtown L.A. We could even see the Hollywood sign. Expensive valet parking: $35/night, but very helpful valets. Outstanding service in this hotel: the registration agent, was very welcoming and even provided us complimentary wireless service in our room even thought we were not gold Starwood Prefered. I looked so disappointed when she told us that our regular Starwood Preferred status did not give us free wireless, that she gave it to us. The bell service goes beyond the call of duty. My husband was waiting for boxes and they got them all, found them, took care of transporting them to the car, did everything right. Kudos to Calvin, the bellman. Duvon Collins, the concierge, gave us a great recommendation for dinner, two blocks from the hotel. In turn, we can recommend Maria's Italian Kitchen at 615 S. Flower St. It was copious, delicious and reasonable. We also ate at L.A. Prime, the top-notch steakhouse of the hotel on the 35th floor, and received excellent service from Robert the host and Mark our server. On our last night, the rain was torrential, we had forgotten our umbrella and Chaya, the restaurant we were going to have dinner at, was only a block away. However, it was raining so hard, we knew we would be drenched in water by the time we got there. We told the doorman we wanted to get a taxi, but he seems reluctant to get us a taxi for just a block. It just happened that a friend of his, one of the Japanese guides from the hotel was going home: he took us in his tour van one block down, dropped us off in front of the restaurant and even gave us both one of those little Japanese umbrellas that is practically disposable. Incredible service from the Westin Bonaventure all the way around. We will always remember it. They also gave us late checkout at 2pm. We also had purchased the breakfast buffet plan, and did not regret it. The buffet is very good and copious. You also can get made to order omelettes. A buffet offers lots of choices. Recommended. The hotel itself is very cold in looks: it's all concrete towers and quite impersonal. The service makes up in warmth and hospitality what the physical structure lacks. For business in downtown L.A.

The first thing I want to say is that we worried about the size of the room after reading reviews on Trip Advisor; we wanted to set up a cot for the baby and weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure if there would be room to do that. To all of those in the same situation, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry. The room is not huge by any means but there is plenty of room between the bed and the window for a wide portable cot \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and to have your suitcases laid out on the floor etc. The hotel was clean and well organised, and the shops and fast food restaurants located within the hotel affordable and very useful when travelling with small kids. Also, staying in downtown LA meant that while there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that many facilities open after the end of business hours every day, it was handy for travelling to other places in LA when we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to rent a car. There is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rapid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bus which goes from just up the street around the corner of the hotel through to Beverley Hills and Santa Monica (OK, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not fast but it does come very often); and the metro to Hollywood is within easy distance. Anything more off the beaten track would have needed a car; but being in a central hub for 6 days was perfect for us. The only complaint I would have is that one of the bell staff completely cracked our new hard shell suitcase on our arrival. Bummer. A security manager, Larry Corley, came to investigate. He was very polite, gave us a complimentary breakfast for the family to make up for the inconvenience (by the way, the selection and food was very nice) and even organised some gaffer tape so we could fix up the problem. No complaints about Mr Corley, but the damage to the case was referred by the hotel to the insurance agency \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t called, even though we were still in the States for 3 weeks after the incident and we kept advising our contact details; and on our return home, has barely made contact (and that only after about six calls and three emails from me). Now more than a month and a half later, we still have a broken suitcase and no compensation. Maybe this is a way of trying to shake off all but the most determined of clients\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 anyway, I would have thought that a hotel of the Westin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation and standing would have done something to compensate us directly.

Check in took 5 minutes at around 4:00 p.m. that day (I was shocked how organized the front desk was)! The hotel really cares about its platinum guests as well ... always extending a courtesy drink invitation in the revolving lounge on the 34th floor. It was great up there with a DJ and a dance floor ... you couldn't ask for more. And, the lounge manager, Sonny, was wonderful. Without a reservation on New Years' Eve around 10:30 p.m. he found us a wonderful table ... thank you very much again Sonny!! The breakfast buffet is always wonderful and there is a great waiter there named Rehan we always enjoy waiting on our table.

A young \"star\" in the works for Starwood is Jennifer to be sure. Parking is at a discounted rate for overnight guests ($35/night) (and that is not so bad for downtown LA), but I have also found the hotel has a \"package\" rate at times which includes parking as part of the rate. There are many independent restaurants on the 5th floor of the hotel for mostly inexpensive snacks and meals and I have tried several and they were good. The hotel also has a very exclusive club on the first floor but generally not for us \"married guys\" (I will let someone else review that club). The hotel is also nicely located if you are going to the Music Center for a musical or a play, etc. We always walk right over (about a 15 minute walk). While we generally walk back to the hotel after the show as well, at that time of night, it is a short cab ride back if you prefer.

Be comfortable with your body if you plan to use the gym because it has see through walls and extra exercise equipment located outside on the bridgeways... we could watch the gym users exercising as we walked between meeting rooms on the third floor! Services seem much higher priced than average - many of my colleagues were complaining about printing costs and the paid wi fi connections are one per computer not one per room (the other person in my room had to buy a separate subscription). Compared to some other US hotels that host conventions the good point is lots of cheap or casual snack/lunch options rather than just having an overpriced hotel restaurant (though it has one too) - that said 6-10 outlets seem to have recently closed, although the microbrewery is still going strong. Beds in the rooms were extremely comfortable with the usual US overabundance of pillows; bathroom was pleasant and very clean although one couldn't actually sit down in the shower bathtub.

I was a bit nervous at the prospect of staying at a hotel with a pet, esp. after being assigned a room on the 28th floor but the check in staff assured me if it created too much of a difficulty due to dog walking, they'd be happy to change the room to a lower floor. The advantage, of course, was less traffic in the corridors which definitely in our favor; less noise, less risk of barking (gratefully, our dog is not a barker by nature anyhow). Fortunately, the elevator rides did not present a problem - we never had to wait long and puppy was well-behaved with his first experiences riding in one. What is not as pet -- or human -- friendly, as one reviewer previously pointed out, is the elaborate and confusing elevator systems, which beyond the color coding is the fact that they don't run to some of the floors most frequently used -- for instance, the 4th floor which has access to the pool and grassy dog-walking area. We found we'd either have to go to the 5th floor and walk puppy down a circular flight of stairs, or go to the lobby and use the handicapped elevator by the bell hop counter to make the fastest trip for a walk....which is really not so fast at all. In addition to the grassy area on the pool deck, there's also a park that's accessible from a pedestrian bridge which we never figured out exactly how to access. The run area by the pool deck was sufficient for all intents and purposes, although it would certainly be more pet friendly - and probably guest/cleanliness friendly - to have a discreet pet sanitation stand that offers plastic baggies and a trash container near the back - for guests who may not remember, or have enough, supplies of their own for disposal purposes. I had brought plenty of bags but felt awkward about depositing the soiled and tied up ones in the trash container I spotted not far from the outdoor cafe. I signed a general waiver upon check in for any pet-related problems that may occur, but overall I found the staff to be extremely solicitous, friendly and helpful when they saw the puppy. As a guest, I'd like to see more of that same friendliness offered to me from the staff who works the gift shop (the most I can say about the women I've encountered there during my stays is \"they do their job\" but if you're looking for a warm and/or pleasant greeting, that's not been my experience) or the sole early morning coffee shop open on Sundays that I've gone to. No smiles, good mornings offered - just a cup handed to me when I requested a coffee and a point in the general direction of the muffins when I asked if they had any. A little effort on the part of such staff to make a guest feel welcome rather than feeling as if one is intruding upon their day could make a big difference in customer satisfaction. However, the main point of this trip was to enjoy seeing my son who enjoyed seeing his dog who enjoyed staying at his first hotel.

The primary reason not to stay at this hotel - bed bugs. I suffered around 25 bed bug bites while staying at this hotel. I reported this to the hotel and they maintain that the room was inspected for bed bugs and that no bugs were found. I asked when the room had been inspected and I was told between the hours of noon and 5pm. Well, of course they didn't find any bugs. Bed bugs hide during the day and only come out at night. I question the inspection methods of Steritech - the pest control company that they use. If they didn't find bed bugs, then why did I get 25 bites on me while staying at this hotel? I asked if there have been other infestations of bed bugs in this hotel, and the answer was \"I am not authorized to answer that question.\" In other words, Westin is hiding a lot with their bed bug problem. Just read the reports from other travelers about bed bugs through TripAdvisor. Additionally, to make sure I do not bring bed bugs in to my home, I am now having to wash all my clothing on hot water and hot dryer cycles. Needless to say, this has ruined a few articles of clothing, which I am sure I will not be reimbursed by Westin. The second reason not to stay at this hotel - it's filthy dirty, and not up to Westin standards. Our room had dark stains on the carpet and the bedding - disgusting! The chairs in the bar on the lobby level are very badly stained and falling apart. Our room was not cleaned very well either. I noticed that our room was never vacuumed during our 5 night stay and the bathrooms were hardly cleaned. Upon entering the room, there was hair from the previous tenant in the bathroom and fingernail clippings were never wiped away. Absolutely, disgusting.

Super fast elevator service... with 12 elevators serving almost all floors, you rarely had to wait for an elevator.

The hallways are all very reasonable in length once you get used to the 4 pod surrounding a central pod configuration.

Negatives include poor selection of food choices. You're left to choose between airport style fast food on the 4th floor or $60 steaks at LA Prime, A New York Steakhouse (we all thought that was a really weird name).

This is the hotel the cheap Asian tour groups frequent because it is so hopelessly unaligned with the rest of the Westin brand in the US. The lobby shops seem subterranean and remind me of a Blade Runner like underworld. Exorbitant prices, very poor quality. Same with room service. The standard Westin menu is used. \"Berries with Sabayon sauce\" means berries with yogurt, or berries with whipped cream. No one in the hotel's staff knew what Sabayon sauce was. Funny, because 10+ recipes abound when you search \"Sabayon\" on the internet, and it's a simple recipe. Obviously no one on staff thought to attempt this \"getting it right\" when implementing Westin's menu at this hotel.

We got our room and went up to find out it simply smelled so we went down unhappy. The clerk quickly fixed us up with a new room for their members which I must say was a bit better and pretty alright renovated. Now the trouble happened after 1 hour our luggage still didn't arrive so I called when they told me within 15 minutes it would be there, after 15 minutes of course it wasn't yet nobody was busy with it either it seemed so I kept calling till I got fed up with it. I went downstairs and expected my luggage to be there, which it wasn't. Actually nobody knew where it was after another 30 minutes it seemed that the clerk who booked us in didn't make it clear we changed our rooms and the luggage was left unatended in an unlocked room. The manager gave us as compensation a breakfast card for in the morning. The trouble was because it was that late because of this mess we weren't able to get any food except calling in some food in the room which we did which wasn't that great. In the morning after cleaning our tooth we found out that the bathroom was rather unclean. It has a lot of shiny materials which require clean water in the cleaning process which obviously didn't happen here. After going downstairs we had our breakfast which was another disappointment. The deli at the corner serves better food then here which made me happy I didn't book the room including breakfast. The last great feature of the room is that it has no soundproofing so if your neighbour picks up a girl, you can also enjoy it. Now it is a lot of negative things, but then if you look at the price actually it figures. It's rather cheap so yes... service is poor (or atleast we had a bad experience), the food is bad and the style itself is rather dated but its cheap.

The Bonaventure Brewing Co. inside hotel had great service and very good food. Glad I had $25 restaurant.com coupon, paid $33 for meal for me & hubby. When I was doing an expense voucher for my boss (attorney) he stayed at the Sofitel for $200 for 2 nights in LA, wish I had gotten that hotel. It would be interesting to see the list of hotels that are contracted with Hotwire.

Views were super! We wanted a high floor, got the 20th because we requested a renovated and 2 bed room. From what I understood, to get a higher floor you should only require a king. The room was not large, and these beds, \"full\" size as they are called, is small if you are sharing a bed. The comfort of the beds is great, the bedding is nice, but I just want say that if you think you will be sharing a 'full' size bed, it is not such a great idea. Our daughters would have preferred a larger bed, and actually my husband and I quite filled ours as well. He is 6'5\" and I am small, but pregnant! The windows do not open, of course, so to get your air fresher, the air conditioner is perfectly adequate. Not a bad sound in my opinion, just a white noise. Quickly remedied the stuffiness of the room air. No bad odors as I read in other reviews, no bloodstains as i read on previous reviews, no ickkiness to carpet. Bathroom is stone and plenty big. Housekeepers were nice to provide whatever we wanted off their cart. We paid 169 a night to include parking. Otherwise it is like 40 to park. Food all over the place, the best deal we found was at the Bonaventure Brewing Company on the 4th floor....happy hour menu was good, not a huge culinary delight, but we are a family who wanted a bunch of food after our drive, and loved that we could eat super cheap...the highest price menu item was $3.99. Happy hour is from M-F 4pm til 7. The beer was really good, and such a great selection. The kids ate from happy hour menu as well. All of us ate for just under 50 and we had a table filled with food! The gentlemen who were serving that afternoon were very friendly, and answered our questions regarding the local area. Room service menu is costly in our opinion, and thus we did not use it. Lots to do around the hotel. Walking distance to L.A Live, but it is about 20 mins walk. That was super fun, the walk thru the city was wonderful, so many tall and lovely buildings. We saw a 3D movie and had espresso at the Ritz Carlton lobby's Illy espresso cafe. The walk back to our hotel after the movie was also so fun because it had gotten dark while we were in the theatre and upon walking out, it was neat to see the city and the tall buildings lit up! That is one of the main things we came to L.A for! The pool area is nice. Not the warmest heated pool ever to be found, but sparkling, has towels, umbrellas, and very comfortable teak lounge chairs with cushions. We see that if a person WANTS to pick apart the place as I read over and over in most previous reviews, that would be possible, but we were fine with it. This is not a luxury place, but it has its uniqueness. The elevators are exterior, and cool. Our travel objective was to take our daughters to the heart of downtown Los Angeles to stay in a high floor hotel room. Internet does cost 12.95, breakfast is NOT included in room rate, although there are many different packages available on the Westin reservations website that can be selected to include such things. My youngest daughter and I ate at the breakfast buffet, and found the food selection to be very good, the coffee and fresh OJ was great. Food quality was fine. Typical buffet experience. Again, more nice and friendly servers/attendants. The rotating lounge on the top floor is pretty and has a great view of course! There is a fitness center, but why bother with a treadmill when you can use 5 flights of circular stairs on lower lobby levels, and so much walking to be had around the hotel. It was fun for my daughter and I to walk around as the hotel was waking up! All in all, this hotel was a good deal for our trip, and if you want a \"better\" experience, you will be paying more elsewhere.", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greenbelt, MD", "Title": "\u201cHousekeeping Issues & Poorly Soundproofed\u201d", "Author": "GoBanana", "ReviewID": "UR70180605", "Content": "Things were fine till the next to last day of my week-long stay.

I had everything set up just the way I like, and found this very presumptuous. On top of which, she took my toothbursh & flosser out of the cup I'd been using & put them on the counter WHERE I PURPOSELY DIDN'T PUT THEM!! This was not only rude, but unsanitary. Yeah, wipe the toilet, then handle my toothbrush. So I had to throw out the toothbrush & buy a new one. I suppose it was because of all this that I didn't look at the bed to notice the bloodstain on the replacement sheets till evening. It took 90 minutes & 2 calls to get someone to come up, and then she argued with me. She tried to claim that it had to have been like that, because the sheets were wrinkled. This was absolute crap, since the stain was quite obvious at a glance. So that just told me that someone had put stained, wrinkled sheets on my bed. Also, the door wasn't sound-proofed well.

There are a lot of negative reviews. But here's the deal. It's downtown Los Angeles which, as a city, is just seeing what urban revitalization can do. The hotel is a kickback from the 80's. I kinda like the decoratve pools with fountains and under water lighting. It reminds me of grand Carribean resorts when I was a child. It is a 1200 room hotel with countless meeting and conference rooms, so it is tailored for that market and it's busy. Real busy. While I was here this weekend, there were Emmy Technical Awards for Daytime, a wedding, an NHL draft, three days of Dodgers-Yankees games, an Electronic Music Festival, LA Film Festival and that's just what I was aware of. The lobby, hallways and most common spaces definitely made the bottom of the priority list in what I assume is an ongoing renovation. My room was medium sized, but immaculate, great view, Heavenly Bed (TM) nice Panasonic Flast Screen television a great desk and ergonomical chair. The staff are really pleasant, welcoming and accomodating. The maids scurry around the floors trying to be is unobstrusive as possible. The servers and bar tenders are quick, know the product, perform their work accurately, professionally and politely. Bellmen were very eager to assist me with luggage and holding luggage on my check out day. Front desk remagnetized my room key on at least three occasions. Concierge is amazing, I'm just about to write a letter to Westin with compliments to him. So, I'm not sure where people were staying before they came here -- that would motivate them to criticize so heavily. I took a quick wander to JW Marriott and the Ritz Carlton to scope the place out and have a little bite to eat. Yes, they're nicer. Newer furniture, fresher paint, tailored uniforms for the staff, but when I was shopping for a hotel for this stay, I ended up using Hotwire but had looked at Expedia prices for the competition pricing. They were all $300+ P/N.

Because the hotel is round (there are several towers) the room is pie shaped, which makes everything seem out of whack. The housekeeping staff do not replenish the bathroom or coffee supplies which is very aggravating. They pretty much make the bed, and put fresh towels in the bathroom. My room is in desperate need of vacuuming, but I'm sure it won't get done until I check out in 4 more days! I hate this place and wouldn't have stayed here if it weren't for the fact that this is where our business meetings are being held. I sure hope they never book this hotel again.

It is located in downtown which is great for businesses and conferences but not good for nightlife. Parking is expensive, but if you go 1 block past the hotel, you can park overnight in the garage for $9.90. The good points: We bid on the hotel via priceline and received a good, low rate. It had a desk and a LCD TV. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if this was one of the renovated rooms, but it seems to be somewhat updated. There is a gym, spa, several businesses and a mini-foodcourt in the hotel. We ate supper once and breakfast once at a couple of these places and the prices are reasonable. This works out really good if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like paying the expensive hotel restaurant prices. The metro station is only two blocks away and we took it to Hollywood blvd and then caught a bus to the Hollywood bowl. Total trip time was about 35 minutes. The elevators are fast and come quickly when you push the button. The bed were comfortable. We did not have any problems with the staff, but we never need them other than to change out our towels. The bad points: Parking is expensive at the hotel-around $30-$35 a day. The room was small. Barely enough room to move around comfortably, but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend a lot of time in our room when we travel so this didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter to us. The room service was pricey, but it is comparable to the same hotel chain at all other cities I have been to. We were in the yellow tower and the elevators we had to use did not stop on the 2nd or 4th floor. So you had to get off on the 1st or 3rd floor and take the stairs or escalators. The hotel is a little dated and I guess most people categorize this as a bad point, but I usually see it as part of the atmosphere of the place-I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not the type that likes to have the same exact room, hotel, carpet, food, etc. etc. no matter where I am visiting. Some other points to mention: We did not eat at any of the restaurants, but we did order room service late one night after the concert around 2am. It was delivered within about 20 minutes and the food was decent, nothing to rave over but it was ok. Overall for the price and the level of service we received, we were satisfied with our stay.

In an attempt to improve the chances of a comfortable stay here's what I did: 4 days before arrival, I called the local hotel number, asked for the front desk, and they forwarded me to reservations to confirm my reservation. I pecifically asked for a renovated room. Though my original reservation was made for 2 double beds, I was told that the renovated rooms were only outfitted with king beds. No problem! I'll take the king. Then I was informed that they could only enter a request on my reservation and that the actual room assignment would be made upon arrival. During this time I also made sure that I gave them my Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) number and that I was staying for five nights. I figured every little bit helps. At 09:00, six hours before my arrival, I called the hotel front desk and was again switched to their reservations department. I again asked to be assigned to a renovated room, and when the reservationist opened my reservation, she said that they still had my request on file, but, as before, the room would not be assigned until check-in. When I arrived to register, my room apparently had already been assigned since the receptionist did not have to look for a room in the system. THE ROOM ITSELF I was ensconced in a 24th floor room in the yellow tower (there are 3 other color-coded towers). To my relief, the room was clean, looked and smelled new, and there even was a flat panel TV! In the bathroom I found two bars of soap, but I still got sealed-in-a-wrapper plastic cups. But what the hey, everything else was within expectations of a comfortable and clean room. TIPPING THE HOUSEKEEPER I commonly tip the housekeeper a dollar, but towards the end of my stay, I tipped $2 because she went to the trouble of arranging the toiletries that I left on the bathroom counter the day before. Later, when I returned to my room in the evening, I found that she had brought in and hung up a bathrobe and left an extra bottle of water for me too. I can only assume that she was expressing thanks for a tip that perhaps does not come that frequently. A NEW MARRIOTT WITHIN A STONE'S THROW Our association had booked hotel rooms months ago for our meeting and was planning to use the LA Marriott Downtown as its headquarters hotel. However, the Marriott's completion date was pushed back so Plan B was invoked, i.e., to use the Bonaventure. I suspect that the new Marriott is causing the Westin to respond with the upgrade and make-over. SUMMARY Had a nice stay; the staff was universally friendly, the room was comfortable.

While waiting for the shampoo (which took over an hour we had left, and they brought everything but shampoo so we had to call AGAIN), we noticed we could hear the elevator clearly!

As we arrived, I started smelling this strange stench throughout the lobby. When we entered our room, I immediately noticed the stains on the 20-year old carpet and the disgusting smell of cigarettes. I called the front desk to complain, and they sent up a gentleman to spray our room with air freshner(it may have been worse than the cigaretts0 :(:( The furniture in the room was at least 15 years old. The best part was the TV. It was the same television my parents gave me when i was 10 years old!!!(15 years ago!!) The bathroom had visible rust around the lighting fixtures and the bath was not even close to Heavenly!!! More like a deathly bath to me!!! I called the front desk again and I asked them about the web-site and how disgusted i was with the hotel. They explained that they were in the process of remodeling their hotel, and no new rooms were available. I was very upset because I was never told this prior to booking my non-refundable room!!

I dont use credit cards. What did I pay a deposit for if I couldnt use the internet or make outside phone calls. There were pay phones by the restrooms, which meant I had to go down the elevator again to the lobby to get to the phone.

The one restaurant I ate in was reasonable. It was on the 4th floor, and by the time I got to it I had worked up quite an appitite. To get to the pool patio area, you had to walk all the way around to the green tower. A long long walk.

I got out of the car to speak to the bellboy but he was too busy smoking and speaking on his blackberry to talk to me. Eventually he waved me round to the other side of the hotel and left the car with the valet. I went to the front desk and they checked me into a SPG room on the 12th floor. This room was despressing and had not seen a paint brush for 20+ years. The lamp shade was broken and was hanging off the wall and this room stunk of smoke. I called the front desk and was finally moved into a different room. This was no better and also stunk of smoke. Despite these being non smoking rooms the smell of stale smoke is clearly lodged in the carpets and curtains which have not been upgraded for many years. Again I asked to be moved and this time spoke to the duty manager who had no interest or care in the problems experiences so far. Fortunately they moved me into a renovated room the following day and this room did not smell. On the day of check out I explained to the front desk that I had a night flight back to the UK. I asked if there was anywhere I could take a shower before leaving for the airport and they told me that there was a shower in the basement below the swimming pool. So at the end of the day I tried to access this shower room but I could not do so using my key card. So I went back to the front desk and asked them to give me a key card so that I could get into the shower room. After much discussion with the girl on the front desk she reluctantly agreed to let me use the shower room but would not give me a key. Instead she organised for securty to let me into the shower room.

This past weekend my boyfriend and I decided to have some fun in DTLA so we booked a night at the Bonaventure so that we could do some bar hopping and end the night at Suede. We arrived to the check-in line which was only staffed with 2 attendees and about 15 ppl standing at the check-in line, about 5 ppl in the Starwood line and another 20 ppl from the airlines at a seperate line. It was a major mess!!! We finally arrived to the checked-in counter and were told that our room was not available. We requested a double bed and the hotel only had singles. As a Gold member, our rooms are confirmed upon booking. We couldn't settle for the king because we had two friends that were not capable of driving home that night. I asked to speak with a manager and Dora came out to tell me that my room was not available and I could cancel without a penalty. I have never, ever been given the option to cancel. Usually, a manager will attempt to accomodate the guest before they cancel a reservation. Aren't we in a recession - fix it before you loose $$$?? Why would a hotel manager cancel a reservation before attempting to remedy the situation? I was so angry that I cancelled the reservation and immediately called the Westin's courtesy desk for SPG members and complained. I'm not a whiner but I felt compelled to do this because I have never been treated this way! The service was so bad that the person that was checking in next to me approached Dora and told her that this was the worst service he had ever seen at a Westin hotel. This was a complete stranger!! Dora got a call from the SPG people and ungratefully gave us a suite with a roll away bed. Why didn't she do that from the get-go? Now comes the room: the room was outdated with stained carpets and the entire place looked like a time wharp to the early '90's when True Lies was filmed there. Nothing was really nice about this place. There are several other nearby hotels that would be pleased to have your business.

This hotel definitely is going through renovation but I did not stay in the renovated tower suite. I was put in the suite on the high floor in the green tower facing the 110 freeway. I can see how others complaining about how \"date\" the room is (as well as carpet and stuff). It does seems to me that their renovation are going at very slow pace due to the economy downturn and low occupancy rate. Before I start this review, people:: ***** PLEASE LET THE MANAGER KNOW YOU NEED 2 BARS OF SOAP AND SHOWER GEL IN YOUR ROOM ***** Earlier this year Starwood has implemented this \"Green $\" policy to place only 1 bar of soap in the room. However, due to the overwhleming response, they stopped this policy but most of the Westin Chains are NOT following this policy to RESTORE 2 Soaps PER ROOM. (Westin Las Vegas, Westin Bonaventure comes into mind). So Please, If you only see ONE bar soap in the room, call housekeeping and let them know its mandatory/brand standard to have 2 bars of soap in the room. Location: This is a downtown LA hotel. Means, Most of the LA tourists should not stay here since not many attractions nearby the walking distance and the general area in downtown LA is left to be desired (especially at night, I don't want to walk on the street at night) However during day time is adequately safe. Parking: EXPENSIVE. One of the most outrageous Hotel Parking ever, $35/night. For the price, you can almost get a cheap motel 6 room with a free parking across the freeway. I suggest you park in the adjacent buildings for cheaper rate but again, be careful as you walk back (I was being warned by one of the parking attendant to watch out my back as I walked back to the hotel, you know know what I am talking about). Check in: Went to check in at 5pm. (Their standard check in time is 4pm). Boy, they were sure understaffed. Only 2 people at the check in counter at the time I was there and its similar to a TSA line. However, the staff I encountered was friendly enough to accommodate my request. Lobby: Very Impressive public area with a Bonaventure Malls thats filled with local workers during business hours. Gym: Located on the 3rd floor of the hotel, various equipments and there's actually a running track in the center of the hotel. Pool is located on the 4th floor. Elevator: Need to mention this one, its the glass elevator so you get very nice view of the LA as you go up. Room: Received a Tower Suite. View is nice and the part of seeing LA Freeway didn't bothers me. Soundproof is good as I had a really good night sleep (Thanks to the Westin Heavenly Bed). The tower suite has separated living and bed room . 1.5 bath. The room decor is certainly dated. I was so surprised based on other review's photo even the renovated rooms don't have a LCD tv yet. I am sure surprised! I have to said the room is dated and somewhat functional. My chair was not even allow me to sit upright! so saggy!!! Plus having a Mirror behind the bed's headboard is a weird idea... I don't know what they were thinking when they built this place. Bathroom: Oddly triangle shaped and boy, their heavenly shower head is rusted already!! Pressures were good but rusty shower head plus the bottom part of the tub cracked already! That's the sign for immediately DESPERATE repair/renovate. I went down to ask for an extra soap but the counter didn't have it..crap they have to send it up to my room. So much trouble for a bar of soap. Lounge: Bona Vista Lounge is nice, I will cover in another thread.

Each time we have been unimpressed with the rooms - which are small and outdated (orange striped wallpaper, old green carpet, blue and gold upholstered chairs) - and on two visits have had ripped or very faded, mismatched furniture. When we checked in late at night ( I had called at 3:30 pm in the afternoon to confirm that we were arriving late and to please hold a room for us) we were told that the only room available was a \"handicapped access\" room which was not very nice (according to the front desk clerk) and they were sorry. They wondered why I had requested it. Of course, I hadn't. I had only made the reservation on Priceline and called in the afternoon to make sure a room was available, but had no specific request for a handicapped access room. The room was small as are all the rooms in this hotel and when we asked for two beds the clerk told us the hotel didn't have rooms with two beds- weird! Anyway, he apologized and said he couldn't do anything about it and he was very sorry. Since the hotel was full no upgrades were possible, either. We were tired so we didn't argue with him. He did offer us complimentary parking which was very nice since parking costs $35.00 a day. When we saw the room, we understood the caution: the bathroom had a very cheap hand-shower which only delivered a weak ring of water - damn near impossible to get warm or clean! And it had a huge special bathing chair which took up a great deal of space. It also had no closet and no safe and the area for hanging clothes was low so everything dragged on the ground. The bed, however, was a great Westin bed so that made up for some of the discomfort. Since this is the third time we have received what we considered a \"substandard\" room, we have decided we will never stay here again, even with the Priceline discount. We hate the lobby which has heavily chlorinated water and no place to gather. The elevators broke twice during our two day stay and the hallways and elevators themselves are not airconditioned so those areas get very hot and stuffy. Also, on Sunday morning at 8:30am we were wakened by loud drumming and music coming from an event at the lower level (near the pool) and we were up 24 floors!

After a trip throughout the City I thought about using room service, but there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a menu in the room. I strolled around the mall located on floors 2 to 6 and found a cheep pizza vendor still open- not very tasty, but cheap and fulfilling.

It is based upon a set of circles and the rooms are therefore wedge-shaped. With that in mind, it's interesting. As a place to stay, well...it's another story. I arrived by taxi at the front entrance in the early evening. There were no staff members in sight to assist with luggage and one must take an escalator down one level to reach the front desk. Although the hotel is noted to have an executive club level, that isn't true. There are floors set aside for Starwood Preferred members, but there is no club with the typical breakfast or evening snacks. I was given one of the Starwood Preferred rooms, which the front desk staff advised me was larger than the typical room, with more amenities. The room had a bathrobe and small refrigerator but I didn't see anything else that stood out as such. The room is somewhat dated, with numerous scrapes on the wallpaper, peeling of the paint on the bathroom door, and the pipe feeding the shower had broken loose from its attachment point. The soundproofing is not up to date and there was much noise from the nearby elevators and the traffic. The TV was an older 4:3 model Magnavox, perhaps 19 or 21\" with a fuzzy picture. The beds were comfortable enough and the HVAC unit was modern and worked properly. Internet was available through a provided ethernet cable at a daily charge. I didn't have any luck with the wireless. Getting around the hotel required some education as the elevators don't serve all the lower floors. Getting to the second floor requires going to either 3 or L and then taking the stairs or escalator. Getting to the fourth floor again requires going to 3 on the elevator, then taking the stairs to 4. There are four color-coded sets of elevators and each room is accessible from any of the elevators but it's often unclear as to where you are given the circular nature of the design. There are many restaurants but most of them looked empty or closed (though they were open) due to a lack of occupants even during lunch hour. The walls through the public areas are largely concrete but badly in need of a sandblasting or cleaning. Think of a mid-70s SF movie like Logan's Run and you will understand the overall feel of the public areas. Room Service was on time, friendly, and the food was hot, tasty, and well prepared (though expensive).

One thing to know is that this hotel has a mix of recently renovated and downright junky rooms. I found it really tough to rate this hotel based on how much it can vary depending on the room you stay in. So, I've tried to do with by mixing my experiences. Since this is the largest hotel in Downtown LA with over 400 rooms (unverified) and seem to always have a plethora of business, they seem to be lax on customer service at the front desk. Even if you have Platinum status, they usually don't go out of your way to ensure that you have a renovated room. So, with status or not... remember to ask in advance for a newer room, it will make all of the difference. Standard Renovated Room: On the small side, especially for the price... there really isn't much room to walk around in them due to the unique design of the building (five tube shaped buildings connected by walkways). Each rooms resembles a wedge of the tub and thus you really have most of your SQFT near the outer windows where there isn't much reason to have space. Size aside, the renovated rooms offer light modern but not flashy furniture with decent desk/work space. And of course, the heavenly bed/shower. The bathroom is decent and if you get a chance to stay in the old vs new rooms, you'll notice that they've addressed some of the awkward lighting issues found in the old bathrooms. Standard Non-Renovated: Old dark, smelly carpet and furniture. Less efficient room layout than the renovated rooms with no desk/workspace, rather an old awkwardly placed 3X3' marble table past the foot of the bed as a \"desk\". You still get the heavenly bed/shower, but overall the rooms stink and your feet stick to the floor. Heavenly Shower: If you've ever stayed at a newer Westin, the heavenly shower is usually an impressive sight. Both of the renovated and non-renovated rooms simple have a dual shower head and bowed out shower curtain which allow it to be called a \"heavenly shower\". Um... not so much. Pretty standard shower if you ask me. Restaurants: They boast over 40 restaurants/shops in the mall area from lobby to floor 5 atrium, but most of them are empty come dinner time. I never really ate in any of them because there are better options elsewhere downtown, and whenever I passed by there were only a few patrons inside (unless a convention was in town, then they'd be lucky to have a few patrons X3). The breakfast buffet is great, and the wait staff is friendly. Fitness Center: Just barely above average for the class of hotel and competition downtown, but for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Westin Workout\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it is sub-par. Overall this hotel just simply doesn't meet expectations of a Westin. For downtown LA it's not bad, because downtown LA is not known or great hotels, and there really aren't many to begin with but there are at least 5 other hotels that make a better option for the business or even leisure traveler. Even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a terrible option for downtown it is not a stretch to say that this is one of the worst Westin's in the SPG family I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed in.

I travel back to L.A. frequently on business and normally stay at Hilton Checkers, the Biltmore or the Omni, but I have been trying to pump up my Starwood points so I thought I'd give the Bonaventure a try. The hotel has a number of problems. Number one might be it's size. Other than Las Vegas I try not to stay in places with more 400-500 rooms, 1,300+ is just too big. It was very warm in LA this weekend so I went to the pool to cool off. The pads on the lounge chairs are so filthy I hardly wanted to lay on one. I did what most people there were doing, covered them in towels. They do offer poolside cocktails and snacks, but only if you place a call from the house phone by the pool entrance. The rooms are decent sized, but there were no amenities (soap, mouthwash, toiletries, etc) on the bathroom counter. I found that surprising. I had to reach into the bath tub to get soap. There were also no hand towels on the counter. I had to reach into the shower to get a hand towel. That seemed weird too. This is supposed to be a business hotel and they want to charge me $13 a day for Internet access? I get free Wi Fi at almost any place I stay these days on business. And then they charged me $42 to valet my car? I called down to have the car brought up. When I got to valet they had no idea what I was talking about, no one was getting my car. I had to wait ten more minutes. I paid $42 for service like that? Another odditiy here are that the elevators don't stop at every level. If you drive in to the valet entrance on Figueroa, you have to take an escalator down to the lobby, the tower elevators don't stop on levels 2, 4 or 6. So when you come down from your guest room to get your car you have to get off at level 1 or 3 and then stake stairs or escalator to get your car. The plus side of the Bonaventure is the mini mall on levels 2-6 and the bridges to other parts of downtown. When I worked in downtown L.A. I ate at the food court on 4 often and it has some good places. Mandarin West and L.A. Prime are also pretty good upscale restaurants.

The hotel is a bit of a paradox. It is ranked as a 4 star hotel, and while it has potential, in most aspects seems more like a 2~3 star. I arrived fairly late and check-in went well. Took the well known hotel glass elevators (from movies \"True Lies\", \"In the Line of Fire\", etc.) up to my room on the 27th floor. The room and hallway interiors seem a little dated...they could really use a little freshening. The room itself was a little small, especially the bathroom. The only towel bar in the bath is inside the tub/shower...which has never made sense to me. Otherwise the bath was well appointed with granite counter tops, a real hair dryer, and a personal coffee maker and reasonably thick towels. The armoire that holds the TV, refrigerator, and a few drawers was falling apart from failed previous repair attempts. The wallpaper and carpets were clean but could use updating. There is a single table that could theoretically be used as a desk, but no good chair for working and no power nearby (closest required you unplug the alarm clock or lamp). And I don't understand why the alarm clock is across the room from the bed (I'd think there should be a plug behind the bed..but wasn't going to rearrange the furniture to find out). The \"Heavenly\"(tm) bedding was nice and comfortable, and I like how many hotel chains are moving to a more washable bedding ensemble. The full height windows looked out over the downtown area, and I could see the Hollywood sign from my room. In a day when even the likes of Motel 6 and Super 8 can offer free Internet, a $15/day charge seems a bit excessive. I didn't try it but another guest said it was not working well (limited/no connection much of the time). The hotel is convenient for downtown access. In addition, the first 6 floors of the hotel are essentially a mall...with a number of stores and several restaurants ranging from fast food to full restaurants. The hotel also has a bar, but you'll find better deals and quality of food at the other establishments. Also, there is no complimentary breakfast option at this hotel. I didn't drive, but I heard there is an additional and steep daily charge for the parking garage if you bring a car.

A previous reviewer referred to it as the \"mother ship\" and was right on! This was our nickname for the hotel for our 4 day stay. Definitely reminds me of something out of the Jetsons. The lobby is one of the least relaxing I've encountered. The noise of water echos around the cement interior and is annoying rather than serene. It took me all of 4 days to find my way around the towers even with the color coded elevators, wallpaper and floor covering. The rooms were tiny & cramped for two visitors. Hardly enough room in the closet and drawers for a few days of clothing. There is a small fridge, so you can stock up on your own water & drinks. The beds are small, but \"heavenly\" and water pressure & shower head were the best! The carpeting needed a good scrubbing. There's a food court on the 4th floor with inexpensive food options, beer & wine. Pool was just outside the food court & was nice, but didn't get much afternoon sun.

The room contained a very comfortable queen size bed, a large desk, desk chair and a very good TV that could be viewed from the bed. The bathroom was high end and very nice.

We went to the restaurant at the top of the hotel for a drink and a snack. Its a great view, especially at night, because the restaurant turns and makes a full circle each hour.

Downtown LA has a bad rap for being riddled with crime and homeless throngs roaming the streets. I went to school at USC just south of downtown, so I know the old reputation well. I also know that downtown LA has changed. It's the home of significant urban renewal...and renewal can't get more urban than this part of LA. The old garment district warehouses are now semi-luxury lofts. While it's no parade from the nearby Disneyland...Main Street LA is now in the overwhelming shadow of the gorgeous new Disney Music Hall. The theater complex and Museums have really taken root and make the area very enjoyable...and easily walkable which is a real treat in Los Angeles. But...about the hotel...the architecture was tres avant garde back in the day it was built. You're faced with basically 5 giant room-filled columns. From an architectural vantage, that was probably pretty cool. As a guest, it's not an age of architectural glory that you're trying to remmber. Instead, you're faced with sometimes challenging task of remembering which elevator ascends the column that will take you to your room, and if you're wrong, it may be a while before you find your heavenly bed.

The toiletries in the bathroom were sparse, but I thought that the room was generally very nice. The trademarked Heavenly Bed was heavenly, and the decor wasn't dated at all. An odd function of the cylindrical architecture is that an elevator ran literally within an arm's reach of our windows. Noise was never a problem, but if you're not an exhibitionist, you might request a room away from the view of elevators. We didn't bother changing rooms, so read what you will into that.

If you arrive on a weekend, you can park on the street until Monday morning at no cost or you can park across the street in the parking garage.

Thankfully, once I checked out of the Westin Bonaventure Hotel, my vacation took an upward turn and became very enjoyable. The Bonaventure hotel caused me nothing but grief! At check in I was told that there was no room available. Then a king-sized bed became available. After much insistence, my reserved 2-bedded room miraculously appeared. A few hours later, I found out that my roommate had been placed in a separate room. Please note, that upon my arrival, I was told she had not yet checked in! Now, I was told to move my belongings to her room on a lower floor; no assistance was offered. Later, I discovered that my camera was missing. I called the front desk and was told to come down and get a new key to my old room, so I could search for my camera. Upon entering the room, I noticed that the toilet paper had been \"re-pointed\", soap replaced, and that the bathroom trash (my tissues and soap wrapper) removed but the room had remained unoccupied. Only the housekeeper had entered the room and my camera was nowhere to be found. Lost camera, I sadly returned to my room and notified security. Just as my roommate and I were about to fall asleep (2 AM), the phone rang. Scared to death, fearing bad news from home, I quickly answered the call. Thankfully, it was only hotel security, informing me that my camera had NOT been found...Could this not wait until sunrise? Next morning, securing my belongings, I called for the housekeeper. We had been told to phone, when we were leaving the room, or the room might not get made-up, as on the previous day. Around 6 o'clock the following evening (7/15/08), the fire alarm went off in our room. We called the front desk and were told that security would come up to check our alarm. Ten minutes later, when security did not arrive, I heard noises in the hallway. Upon peeking out of my door, I smelled strong smoke and saw many security men. One said to me, \"Ma'am, you'll have to evacuate the building.\" Strangely, nobody had bothered to knock on our door nor did the front desk advise us of the emergency. My roommate and I, plus a few others on our floor, were ushered by police into a hallway for evacuation. Unfortunately, the uninformed officer had placed us in a circular hallway without an escape route. Luckily, an officer was standing near the fire door and heard us banging. We were then escorted through the smokey building to an actual stairwell. We walked down the 14 flights and attended our formal banquet in our street clothes. Next morning, the alarms sounded once again. Again, we phoned the front desk for information/assistance...The phone rang and rang, never to be answered. In a few minutes, an announcement came over an in-room loud-speaker (where was it the previous night?). We were told that the situation was being investigated, to remain calm, and that we would be updated, shortly. Since we did not smell smoke, we tried to remain calm. The message repeated itself, numerous times, as we dressed and went to our Hadassah Brunch. We never received an \"all clear\" but the lobby seemed calm and quiet. This was truly the vacation from hell...And I have not even mentioned the food service; yikes...4 bagels for every 10 guests! Although I did not pay for my room (front desk comped for my troubles), the lost camera, which cost over $300, more than made up the difference. I could go on with this horrific tale but my blood pressure is going up...I will, however, mention that a microwave, as was promised, was not available during my entire stay. The good news is...NutriSystem meals are not bad at all, when eaten cold! Upon returning home, I found my camera battery charger, in my suitcase.

For anyone who has never been here, the hotel consists of five circular glass towers. The first five floors are a shopping mall of boutiques, gift shops, and any type of food you can imagine, from fine sit-down, to quick take-away. This entire area is an open atrium of lakes, fountains, plants, trees, all done in an unfinished concrete style. Very nice and tranquil. Many seating areas, some open and some tucked away. There's a large open bar that wraps around a bit where you can people watch; and also another large bar/pub (Bonaventure Brewing Company) area a few levels up which opens up to an outdoor seating & patio area which also leads to the pool where you get a magnificient view of the hotel towers and a great deal of LA. All the way up to I believe the 35th floor of the central tower is a revolving bar coupled with a restaurant on the adjacent floor. Amazing views of miles of LA in all directions. As far as the hotel proper goes, all of the elevators are clear glass on the outside spines of each tower. If you have fear of heights just face inwards.

The parking was only $9.90 with no in/out privileges if you arrive before 10 AM or after 4:30 PM and you could park for 24 hours until the regular rates kick in. This was fine with us since we only use the garage for over night parking. The hotel even has a walkway that connects the world trade center parking garage. Just take the elevator to the 1st floor and follow the sign to the Westin hotel, take the escalator to the 2nd floor and take the walkway to the hotel, which will get you to the sixth floor of the hotel. You will then need to go down a spiral staircase to the 5th floor to take the elevator to the room. It is inconvenient, but I am OK with a little inconvenience to save over $32 per night. The hotel has 4 sections (blue, orange, yellow, red) where the rooms are located. All the section are connected, it is designed like a rotary. So, if you go up the wrong color elevator, just follow the signs to the center and go around until you see the color you want.

The rooms are small and shaped funny that in order to open the refrigerator, I have to push the chair to the desk all the way in or remove it to be able to use the refrigerator. The room that we were first assigned had a stains on the carpet and seems dirty. We had a connecting room to a family that was so noisy that we had to request another room. The carpet in the second room was also stained and dirty, but at least it was quiet. The room has the air vent about a foot above the headboard, which I did not like. The bathroom sink was situated far in the corner, which makes it hard for our family to use the sink being only 5 feet and under. The edge of the sink was about 6 inches away from the edge. The shower had 2 shower heads side by side. We were on the 19th floor and had a nice view of the city. There were lots of shops and restaurants from fast food to high price restaurants. There were about 11 fast food places like subway, seafood, pizza, hamburger, Korean BBQ, Chinese, and Starbucks. Restaurants include Chinese, Italian, Japanese, and steak", "Date": "June 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "CA", "Title": "\u201cBed Bugs in the Westin Bonaventure Downtown LA\u201d", "Author": "RegBusinessTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR16983151", "Content": "I am a regular Mon-Thurs business traveler to LA. I've been staying in the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in downtown LA since December 2007. It's a great business hotel and it has many conveniences. Unfortunately, I stayed two weeks ago in room 2958. (Yeah I have a good memory for numbers) It's one of the smaller suites on the top floor of the hotel (aside from the restaurant and rotating bar levels which are 30 and 31). Room 2958 had bed bugs. I didn't see the bugs but I noticed the bites immediately. Like I said, I am a very regular traveler and have heard about these things. They were definitely bed bug bites, the right pattern, the right appearance, the right insanely itchy sensation I have read about. I'd never actually gotten the bites before but I'm sure these were bed bug bites...also I noticed it the next morning after staying in the hotel and I did not have them the night before. There's nowhere else they could have come from. The manager at the front desk who is very friendly and helpful, he always helps me out since I basically live in the hotel, is named Patrick. When I told Patrick that my room had bed bugs and that I was sure they were bed bugs he explained to me that it's very difficult to prove anything but that he would have someone inspect the room. They didn't find anything..which isn't surprising since the bugs are really small and really hard to see and usually live in places that we can't see unless we rip out floorboard and mattress fluff. He said they would fumigate the room anyway. I asked him to call me and let me know when they had fumigated the room, and to keep me posted if they did find the bugs, etc, just for my own peace of mind. (I mean I really do live in this hotel) He still hasn't called me back and it's been about two weeks. Obviously that sucks and I'm a little pissed at Patrick. But I am more upset because right now I am in the Westin Bonaventure hotel in downtown LA writing this review at 11:21pm in a room on the 22nd floor and I can't sleep because my skin is crawling thinking that it may have bed bugs. I'm not sure why I came back to the hotel because I've gotten so used to living here I guess I didn't think I wanted to leave. I mean, Dec thru May were fine, no bed bugs to worry about. Needless to say, I've decided to switch hotels for next week - or maybe even starting tomorrow night. I can't sleep here anymore. If you've never had bed bug bites, trust me, you don't want them and you should not stay in this hotel for at least a little while and you should especially not stay in suite 2958. I feel bad for besmirching the hotel's name, but it's the truth and I thought I should warn other travelers.

The hotel was built in the 1970's and is definitely dated---they used a lot of concrete and it almost feels institutional. As another reviewer mentioned, the 'mall' of shops and restaurants is deserted----the restaurants that are there are open at odd times---you'll walk all the way around a tower only to find that the restaurant is closed. The Bonaventure Brewing Company was closed for the first few days we were there due to a kitchen fire---not their fault, but just contributed to the feeling that while the seems to be lots going on in the hotel, there really isn't. We avoided the outrageous parking charge by not renting a car and using mass transit instead(we're NY'er's after all!). Took the bus to Santa Monica one day (really easy) and the Metro to a concert at the Hollywood Bowl (not so easy---took two hours to get home). I wouldn't stay in downtown LA again (was there for a convention)---it has the same deserted feeling that the hotel has----there are all these really tall buildings, but no one on the streets, no Duane Reade-type of convenience stores or interesting-looking bars/restaurants.

They will make you pay up front. Please keep up with all your receipts so that you can always validate that you paid. Its a short walk across the street. TIP #2: BECOME A STARWOODS MEMBER - If you become a Starwoods Member, you can get an upgrade to a suite (when available). TIP #3: DON'T EAT HERE - the hotel Breakfast buffet is EXPENSIVE without a cause. The food was SUBPAR! Save your money and go to McDonalds or Denny's which is several blocks up the street! TIP #4: INTERNET - The 24-hour internet Wi-Fi charge is $12.99. Either bring your own Wireless Broadband or go to Starbucks down the street. Don't try to use the phone in the room for dial-up.

That said, the Westin Bonaventure (a franchise hotel) is definitely not \"On Brand\". I find that the customer service is uneven and more focused on tourists than frequent business travelers. Maybe its a silly detail, but I was shocked to see that all glassware in the room was universally replaced with individually wrapped plastic cups (a la Motel 6). This is NOT the Westin, I thought. The smallish pie-shaped rooms are actually very nice and cozy if you get one of the recently renovated spaces. The furniture is more to scale and they offer a decent workspace and desk chair. Older rooms are impossible to work in. Unfortunately, they only renovated two floors and haven't made any new progress in 2 years or more. Even the renovated rooms have old style TVs rather than flat screens, which would open up even more space. Note to someone on the technical staff: PLEASE fix the wireless broadband service!

I've stayed here on a few business trips, and it takes a while to work out your way around the lobby (no straight lines) the four banks of elevators, the various shops and restaurants and so on. But it's a fun place and more interesting than your normal hotel block. The rooms are much like any other standard hotel business room, although they are wedge-shaped due to being set around the edge of a circular tower. Mine was a standard room with a large comfortable bed, a desk, TV and bathroom. The room has been refurbished, but some of the equipment in there (TV, ironing board) is pretty old. There is a fridge, but it's empty. The bathroom wasn't huge, but plenty big enough, and the room has the Westin double shower head, which is a great shower (although I did hear one guest complaining about wasting water as they were checking out). As a Starwood Gold member, I got free breakfast and free internet as part of the package. During the week, the internet voucher code I was given stopped working and I was told to buy a connection and they would take it off my bill. Needless to say, when the bill arrived the charge was still on there - a detail, but an irritating one. Also, due to various logistics my 7-night stay was booked in two reservations, one for three nights and the other for four. When I checked in, I was told that I could stay in the same room for all seven nights, but I had to call back into reception after the first stay was over to 're-check' in, give them my credit card details again, get my breakfast vouchers for the second stay etc. This seemed a bit odd as I was surprised that their check-in system couldn't cope with consecutive reservations. The breakfast staff aren't the most efficient ever, and people were frequently kept waiting for tables when I was down at breakfast. This seems to be a common theme in LA as while I was there, we encountered quite a few cases of inefficient waiters - much more so than other places in the US. Not sure if this is a trend or we were just unlucky. The breakfast buffet is good though as there's a wide choice of both hot and cold food. Even though many other people have mentioned it, the parking charges do seem high. I know it's a major city, but $42 per night? It has gone up considerably in recent years; about 4 years ago when I was there, it was $28 - and that seemed expensive then. I didn't actually have a car, so didn't feel ripped off by the parking charges, and the free breakfast and internet as a gold member meant that i got a pretty good deal overall. I think the breakfast buffet was $22, and internet $12.95 for 24 hours so you may need to factor these costs in. There's a well-equipped gym and two floors with various shops and restaurants in, plus other eating places within walking distance. It's a good location in downtown LA if you need to be in that area. There are other hotels around that offer a similar level of service, but go for the Westin if you want to marvel at the concrete design, lobby fountains, glass external elevators and other features of its 70s heritage.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aurndale, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Rooms, Rude Front Desk personnel\u201d", "Author": "Danarenaeb", "ReviewID": "UR14565606", "Content": "My husband and I were on our honeymoon.

I thought it was cool then, I and I think it is cool now. I stay here frequently ... about once a month. This is not your typical Westin and you should approach it that way. It was built to be architecturally interesting and decades later, it still is. Just don't expect cookie cutter design. Clearly those that have had a problem with the 70's look to the architecture in the lobby areas (lots of concrete here) just want this Westin to be like all the others. The Bonaventure is a very interesting place if you look at it that way. Yes, this hotel was built in the 70's and was pretty bold in its design during that time. As noted in other reviews, the rooms are smaller by U.S. standards. They are pie wedge-shaped and the bathrooms are sufficient, but on the small side. Who wants to spend all their time in L.A. in the bathroom, anyhow? I had noticed that furnishings were getting a bit worn, but voila ... the last two times I've stayed here I've been put in one of their newly renovated rooms (see photos). The renovations and new furnishings are quite tasteful and make better use of the room's space. The desk is a great addition ... clearly a nod to the fact that hotel rooms are more like offices on the road for many more of us now, than when the hotel first opened. Colors are in the earth tones and the rooms are accented by some nice vintage photographs of L.A. There's new carpeting in the rooms with a modern design, set on the diagonal, which probably helps make the room look bigger. Every time I stay here, I eat dinner down in the lobby bar and, in general, I've been pretty pleased with my meals there. The halibut and chips is pretty decent. Plus, it is fun to people watch from that location. There are a couple of items that I feel compelled to nit-pick, even after the renovations: (1) My renovated rooms still had big, black, tube TVs. Surely they will replace them with flat-screen LCDs ... but then again, there's a new swivel stand beneath those black bulky dinosaurs, so that may not be in the works. Drat!; (2) The bedside tables are kind of built-in (or made to look like they are built-in) to the headboard surround and there are no electrical outlets bedside. You can move the bedside table and reach into the wall (or at least into the headboard surround ... see photo) and find an outlet there, but this is really poorly designed. People always complain about the mandatory and expensive valet parking. Hey, it's a big city and parking is expensive ... everywhere. I stay in a lot of hotels and while the Westin Bonaventure is not the most luxurious place I've stayed, it remains one of my favorites and with the renovations currently underway in the guestrooms, it should remain a favorite of mine for some time.", "Date": "February 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cWhat a rip-off.\u201d", "Author": "djdog", "ReviewID": "UR13439635", "Content": "How did thee rip me off, let me count the ways: (1) $42/night valet parking fee, which they don't disclose till you bring your car into the basement parking area. again, that's $42 PER NIGHT.

It is true that the hotel is located in the Financial district and the streets roll up after 4:00 and there is nothing to do unless you take a $60.00 taxi ride out of the area. The hotel is set up in the \"colored tower\" system and you get placed in one. You can get to any other tower from the one you are staying in, but if you want to get to an elevater to get to your room, that can be tricky. If you are on the first through the sixth floor you need to be on an odd numbered floor to get an elevator to your room; it is the wierdest thing I have ever seen in a hotel. If you want to go to dinner at the steak house on the top floor and overlook the city, you need to go to the red tower; it is the only elevator to take you there. You might want to bring dinner with you though, it took 20 minutes to even get a waitress to walk by to tell us she would be with us in a minute; we just wanted drinks and dessert; we walked out. The rooms can be small and we had one of the smaller rooms; two double beds up against the wall and the windows. With four people you will tripping over yourselves trying to move around. The shower dripped the entire time we were there even with three calls to the front desk. WE didn't HAVE ANY HEAT in our room the entire time we were there. I called for service five times. I finally stopped the service guy in the hall because he was working on the connecting unit next door. The heat worked for about an hour and then was blowing cold (in mean air conditioner cold) air the rest of the time. I did again tell them on checkout and got an \"I'm sorry\" from the clerk. I bought a new pair of slippers for the trip for the room; when I left, from the room only, they were black on the bottom; YUK. There is only one small outdoor pool and no jacuzzi anywhere in the hotel. You have to pay for internet service and to use the workout room. The downstairs bar and restaurant(s) are terrible and over priced. A child's order of pancakes from room service was $13.00 (tax, tip, delivery incl.). We did go to the garment district shopping. If you take the bus it is at 7th and Figeuroia and it is the E DASH bus. It only costs a quarter but the bus is always full and everyone pushes and shoves to get on it; it is the primary transportation system for the Hispanic population in LA and the bus driver was not fluent in Enlgish to help get off at the right stop; get a map from the hotel before you go. A taxi is $8.00 one way. The American Girl doll store is also located in LA; there are only four in the US and one is here. My girls loved the store and we took a doll home. It is about a 25 minute cab ride without heavy traffic from the hotel. The cab is cheaper from the hotel to the store than the cost for the ride back.

He had read and heard that Westin is a very nice hotel. I have stayed at a few myself and have loved them all. He picked this one because it is in the center of downtown L.A. and thought the atmosphere would be good. I had nothing to do with the planning (it was all a surprise) so seeing his disappointment broke my heart! We were only staying one night because it wasn't far from home and because they are so expensive. He reserved a room one price level down from a suite, so he was expecting much more than we got. When we arrived they were doing some kind of remodel on the fountain so the smell of paint was everywhere. It also was a bit of an eyesore. My boyfriend was excited because he thought we had a really good view of the city in our room. However, when we arrived at our room it looked out across a street, nothing like what he was told. The room was big, it had a living room and a separate bedroom. But on the hotel's website it showed flat screen t.v.'s in every room. We had 2 20 inch regular t.v.'s, nothing like what the website said. Also, the bar area was old and paint was chipping off it. Maybe our standards are too high, but the little things do make a difference. Anyhow, we ordered room service which was pretty good and then went out for the night. My boyfriend surprised me with Cirque du Soleil tickets! The next morning we awoke and went downstairs to eat breakfast, which my boyfriend had bought a package for. However, when we arrived and gave the breakfast coupon to the waitress we were told it was only good for one person. We were told when we checked in that it would be good for 2 people. I was very upset at this point because of all the money and thought my boyfriend had put into this so I went to the front desk to ask why we were told one thing and now were being told another. They told me that when my boyfriend bought the package he bought he didn't put down that there was 2 of us. However, the package says a continentel breakfast for 2. They wanted to charge us an extra $20 for another coupon. I was irate at this point and almost in tears so I stormed back to the restaurant and was just going to order from the menu and pay the extra money. The only good thing about this hotel was the waiter who felt so bad for us that he bought my breakfast for me! I was very grateful to him.

The Heavenly bed was not as nice as the one I slept on in Vegas last month, with far fewer pillows and just not as soft. The room and bathroom was long-overdue for a remodel, definitely an original. I would say it was a solid 3 star room, but not up to 4 star standards. The service and and lobby were very nice. The architecture is definitely interesting, as is walking from one end of a floor to the other, winding around the different columns. We were on the 30th floor, so we had a nice view of downtown, and glass elevators were quick and scenic. There are a number of restaurants and eateries in the atrium and across the street. Many of which rely on the downtown businesses, so they may only be open during the work week, but some are open every day. The location is only a few blocks walk to the red and blue line subway station, which gives you good access to Hollywood and Universal Studios, as well as LAX access via the blue and green lines. You can also get to San Diego and Disneyland via the red line to Union Station.

I found metered street parking Saturday afternoon. Check-in was a breeze even though I was there early, around 2:30pm. The layout of the hotel is comical. It's a well-known structure comprising five cylinders that was radical in the late 70s when it was built, and I'm sure it was impressive to all the disco dancers who stayed there, but now it just seems arbitrary and confusing. Elevators and wings are color-coded, but it's easy to get turned around. The lobby area is a brutalist concrete nightmare, with a maze of gangways and columns, seemingly always dim and dreary even at noon. My room was on the top (31st) floor and faced away from the glass elevators (from which you can look into some of the rooms). The room itself was very nice, if oddly wedge-shaped, with a large comfortable bed and multiple pillows, double-headed shower, and desk with internet cable. Internet is $12/day. It was quiet with a responsive thermostat. Trying to leave the hotel later that afternoon, things turned to the worse. The elevator wouldn't come, and the minutes ticked by. Finally I crossed over to another column and pressed that elevator button. Minutes passed, and nothing. Trapped in the Westin! When the elevator finally came, almost 15 minutes had gone by, and it was packed; everyone else had had the same experience and was incredulous, if good-spirited, as we stopped on practically every floor on the way down, trying to squeeze in more desperate guests. I never got an explanation for the problem. Of course, the elevators don't stop on floors 2 and 4 for some incomprehensible reason. If you exit on the Figueroa side, floor 2, keep that in mind; also keep in mind those doors are often locked after 10 or 11pm -- I was only able to sneak back in one night since a custodian had propped a door open. Otherwise I would have had to trudge all the way around the gargantuan property to the other doors. While room service is 24 hours, you can't order food at the downstairs bar and lounge after 11pm, something that's annoying if you sit down at 11:01pm and watch everyone else digging into their just-delivered snacks. The \"restaurant row\" on the east side of the 4th floor gangway is kind of ghetto, although the fish and chips from the seafood place was pretty good for $5.99. The outdoor pool is shabby, located across a huge expanse of dirty concrete on level 4, and in shadow most of the time due to surrounding buildings. Parking is rough. While I got lucky the first day with a metered spot, these are hard to find, and I never got lucky again. The lot across the street charged me $38 for a few hours even though it was a holiday. Just use the hotel's parking. All in all, $139/night was far cheaper than most comparable LA hotels for the weekend (the nearby Standard was advertising $240/night, for instance), and my room was pleasant enough. A cheaper price on a bidding site might make it more of a value.

His attitude was very condescending and racist, the food portions were extremely small and overpriced (we paid $100 for two people and were still extremely hungry afterwards). On top of his awful attitude he quietly slipped himself a 20% tip without telling us (in fact he would not even hand us the itemized receipt to look at, he just asked directly for our credit card), so when we unknowingly added gratuity to the final credit card receipt and a few minutes later went back to him asking him to remove the extra gratuity since we had not been able to check the itemized bill earlier, he got extremely angry and offensive, and called us all kinds of expletives in a foreign language.

The room was clean and comfortable and the dream beds are hard to beat! But the front desk was perpetually understaffed creating long, tedious lines.

What irked me most about the concierge service was their combined inability to get me the correct details on taking a public bus to Dodger Stadium.

While I realize that most employees and tourists drive to each point of interest, I was traveling from Boston and NYC and sought easy public transportation and walking routes to some sites. At the very least for travelers such as myself, the hotel should make available simple directions to local sites via walking or bus/metro. We ended up walking home the 1.5 miles from Dodger Stadium. While it wasn't the prettiest walk, it was easy and safe. For those going to an Angel's game, we took the Metro Orange line to the Anaheim stop and the Amtrak home. It was quick and direct.

I really like the building's unique shape and the external glass elevators that shoot up to the 22th floor in a matter of seconds. The lobby is huge and dimly lit. It doesn't help that everything is concrete and glass - makes the space feel cold and unwelcoming. This was reflected in the front desk staff - no smiles, though they were helpful and gave me a nice room in the centre tower (tip: the centre tower tends to have the larger rooms - I saw a king room in the Red tower, and the furniture was older, the room was much smaller). Wireless on the 4th floor worked perfectly. The mini fridge was useful, but the electronic safe was broken. I was later told that half of the safes in the hotel were like that, but in the future they will be updating all of the safes.

I didn't like the toiletries provided (very drying - the Marriott's BBW ones were better). The housekeeping service could use some work. On the 3rd day, they woke us up at 8am asking to clean the room. Er, ok that's a bit early, no? The room was adequately cleaned, but items were not replaced daily even with a note + tip. No new tea (although they did replace the Starbucks coffee), no paper or pens, no lids for the coffee cups, fewer towels, no bath mat on the last day, etc. The valet parking staff ranged from surly (the first time I pulled up to the Flower St entrance) to skeevy (when one was trying to be 'overly' friendly with me, yuck!), though the ones inside (next to the front desk) were very nice and helpful, more so than the front desk staff! Tip: if you're parking at night, find street parking or nearby underground parking lot - MUCH cheaper. The location was fine and provided a good base for sightseeing. At night, there are homeless people on the streets, but I never felt unsafe. One morning, we were awoken by protesters shouting in the streets at 6:30am but it was just a minor annoyance.

At a shocking seven feet, the ceiling height increased the sense of claustrophobia any guest to this room is likely to have.

On the positive side, the room offered spotless bedding and a surgically clean shower. But the carpeting was old and just felt dirty to walk on. This hotel participates in the \"Wayport\" internet access racket, whereby you get to pay a hefty $12.95 per day for wireless or DSL access in your room. (This rate is per computer, not per room.) Other hotels in LA provide complimentary internet access (The Belamar in Manhattan Beach), so why can't the Westin? Instead it seems they are into nickel-and-diming their customers. As I was there on this visit to search for housing, and could not reasonably live without the Internet for the duration of my stay, this expense irritated me. To add insult to injury, Wayport does not offer a volume discount for several days of access. File under: DUMB.

The lobby smells of chlorine from all the tacky bubbling pools and on the whole feels severely dated. It's 2007 and 70s retro concrete chic is no longer chic.

It was a fiasco from start to finish. Booking hotel accommodations isn't brain surgery. A hotel's employees should be able to follow it's own policies and procedures without me having to constantly be in contact with them from across the country. Bottom line- I got nothing but hollow excuses and absolutely no service what so ever from corporate.

My most recent stay was in a room that was nestled up along side one of the elevators (they run up and down the outside of the building towers) but this simply was not an issue to me. I did keep my drapery liner closed on that side, but I do think the windows are coated for privacy from the outside. My only issue with the hotel is that the pool needs some work (it's on schedule for upgrading) and many of the shops and independent restaurants on the floors above the lobby are often closed on weekends, at least during the day.

If you drive a car, the best option is use the hotel's valet parking. It's a bit steep in price - 25 USD per night - but it's worth it, definitely. Check-in staff at the front desk is welcoming, always smiling and accommodating. Checking-in was easy as 1,2,3 and we got our room overlooking from the 13th floor the AT&T building. The room was clean, even if furniture was a bit tired and old. The bed was very comfortable, the room was spacious, and so was the bathroom. No shower stall but only bath tub, even though it was very large. The heavenly shower is very pleasant, you should try it. Amenities were provided, as well as hairdrier and double basin and bathrobes. The view was spectacular, overlooking LA's downtown skycrapers! The hotel lobby was big. Well, strange was the first thought which came to my mind, as it was pure, plain cement. It's incredible the number of restaurants present in the hotel! You can have a bit of everything: chinese, japanese, korean, american pizza... WOW! The lobby bar was nice, with many monitor broadcasting sport (college football was at its peak). We had breakfast at the bar one morning, and even if pricey it was delicious (try their eggs benedict, please!) The hotel hosts also a restaurant at the top floor, a steakhouse, famous for its steaks and its view, but it's pricey and a formal/smart-casual dressing code is required. So we avoided it. The gym club is very nice, on the first level of the hotel, and it's Adidas sponsored! Take a look at the jogging loop, wow, never seen something like this anywhere else! The Westin has also a pool, outdoor, but it's small and to be honest not so clean (sunbeds are availables too). I liked this hotel, and so did my girlfriend. If you're in town for business, probably it's an unmatched spot in downtown LA.

For the same price I paid here, my other choices would have been much less appealing. This is no five-star hotel, though, and even giving it four might be a stretch. The location dowtown is convenient to freeways and pretty central if you need access to several parts of the city. But you should absolutely know that parking is valet-only in an underground garage, and the hotel charges guests $35 a night to park here. When you enter, the lobby is impressive in a \"Secret of My Success \" (80s Michael J. Fox movie) sort of way. As you ride up the elevators to your room in one of several towers, you go past several levels of defunct mall-style shopping and restaurants. It's actually quite creepy. Anyway, the elevator ride is cool with views of the city, and then you arrive on your floor. Here, the rooms are arranged in circular towers. The rooms are very small, but typical city hotel room size. Decor is dated, but the room was clean and pleasant. I had a room on the 28th floor, and the view was spectacular. It really made the room. Signature Westin Heavenly bed is here, but I was disappointed. It seemed really firm, and I didn't sleep well. Bathroom was clean and re-furbished, and nothing was too scary about the room or bath. My biggest complaint is that for such a large hotel, it really lacks any good fast and healthy food options on-site. I did realize on my last day, though, that there is a walkway that connects the hotel to a little strip mall with a Jamba Juice, Starbucks, Chipotle and some other choices that are waaaaaay better than the choices you'll find inside. I ended up with some so-so coffee in a plain styrofoam cup and a Costco muffin in a zip-loc bag two mornings because it was the best thing I could find on-site.

Could hear one of the hotel's trademark outside evalators from within the bathroom, but not in the bedroom fortunately. Enjoyed my stay then and thoroughly enjoyed my return visit. Judging by the carpets, the place has been refurbished recently. Bedroom was large in my opinion, with plenty of space around the king-size bed. The famous \"Heavenly Bed\" was just that. Temperatures rose outside while I was there, so I had cause to use the air con. This was very quiet...the quietest I've ever experienced in a hotel...so kept the room chilled at night, but without disturbing my sleep. Bathroom was a good size too and the double-headed shower was a bonus. Clever idea that delivered a great shower experience. I was on an SPG floor, so not sure if the wide range of bathroom products is normal. Impressed to find not only a toothbrush but a small tube of Colgate toothpaste and a small canister of shaving foam. If I had one negative comment to make, it would be that the bathroom could have benefitted from one more light above the sink, but that's a personal perference matter. Minibar was really only an empty fridge, in which I put my SPG complementary bottle of water. Used the wireless internet connection which cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13 per day. The system did suffer from some reliability problems. Every now and again, the connection would be lost altogether, but would either correct itself within seconds or, if it didn't, I was able to \"repair\" the connection quickly from my laptop without any problems. It was only a minor inconvenience....\"niggling\" more than annoying. I ate breakfast in the atrium poolside restaurant. Wide choice, piping hot food and beverages and a chef on duty to prepare eggs and omlettes. The $20 buffet was good value, when compared to ordering off the a la carte menu. Friendly wait staff too, although the one on the first day did slip in a pre-filled out feedback form with my bill, that needless-to-say gave her a glowing rating. I would have marked her highly anyway, but it was still a bit cheeky. I also had a meal one evening in the lobby bar area. Not a wide choice from the bar menu, but good value and very tasty. Hotel is on the edge of the downtown area. I wanted to be close to the opera house and it was just a 10/15 minute walk (uphill). Superb fish restaurant (McCormick and Schmick's) around the corner, at the top of a staircase feature (Bunker Hill Steps) on 5th Street.

I'd read the TripAdvisor reviews and they were pretty much accurate. This is a hotel that charges nice hotel rates, and there was much about it that was nice, but there are signs it's going downhill. The good points: with a couple of exceptions, service from staff was excellent. Booking was pleasant and easy; I had a fairly complicated booking and the young man helping me was very helpful, patient, and seemed genuinely determined to help me meet my preferences. A + for that. Likewise, the concierge was great, as were the people at check-in and check-out, the bell captains, and the doorman. The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable, and my room was quiet. The not as good points: I had a change in my flight, and missed my hotel arranged shuttle. Upon arrival at the airport, I was informed by the hotel I had to book shuttles 24 hrs in advance. I suspect someone was new, and was following the letter of the law, not the intent. In any case, had to get my own shuttle, which wasn't difficult, fortunately.My unhelpful hotel staff person didn't mention the private shuttles there - he had suggested I get a taxi, which I could have done - for twice the price. Likewise, on my departure, I'd booked their shuttle (which I might add, was NOT 24 hrs in advance, as I was there less than that) and it was late. This wasn't the driver's fault, he got caught up in a traffic jam. The big problem was, they didn't handle it well. The doorman was helpful, checking for me, but I got the distinct impression that if the driver had not made it (just in the nick of time) they would have been at a loss, even though more than one other shuttle of theirs had pulled in. Apparently these were not scheduled and so weren't taking me to the airport. In addition, my driver said he'd called several times, yet no-one seemed to know. The hotel itself is a nicely appointed place, but it's huge and difficult to get around in. It's organized into four color coded towers, and could do with a few more signs. It took me forever to find the restaurants - the elevators don't stop on the 4th floor - and, I might add, some escalators and elevators were being fixed while I was there, adding to the complication and sheer distance I had to walk to get where I was going, once I figured out where that was. The restaurants themselves, once located (listed as \"fast food\" in the hotel guide) were exactly what another tripadvisor member reviewed had described them as: \"nasty\". I would think the hotel would be a little pickier about who they allow to rent space in their hotel.They were the kind of place that has faded photos of their entrees displayed in the window, and the couple I walked into looked like they could not care less that a potential customer was walking in. I should add that it was a very slow time, apparently, there were maybe three of us wandering around that evening, so you'd expect them to be pleased to see you if not downright obsequious. I finally settled on one of the non-fast food places, the Bonaventure Brew Pub, and it was not bad: reasonably priced, decent service.

Felt breaksfast buffet was too expensive, but there was a nice takeaway coffee shop opposite reception where we bought pastries and took them back to the room and made coffee using their filter and the sachets supplied which appeared to be free of charge Night one we had intended to eat in the Bonaventure Brewing Company but it was booked to a private function. Actually we were only looking for a snack anyway. We dismissed all the places on Floors 3-6 foodcourts - they all looked awful and decided just to treat ourselves to a drink in the revolving bar on Floor 34. Great place to see the city at night, lovely service and we had a wonderful appetizer to share platter for $20 which had lots on it and fitted the bill perfectly. We got the concierge to set us up with Guideline Tours around LA next day - this is whom the hotel work through and we did not have time to work anything else out. In the event we found them to be very good,nice small vans and good service. Contrast with the concierge who was disinterested and pretty rude when we asked some basic questions (OK we are from the UK we do not understand everything and how things work first time!) Second evening ate in LA Prime on Floor 35. Beautiful steak meal but a tad expensive and the wine was overpriced. We were still getting over jet lag so only had an entre and a dessert to share and we got the feeling the server was hoping for a bigger order from our table so we rarely saw him!

I have stayed at a number of hotels that have been poorly reviewed on this site and never had a bad experience at any of the ones I've ended up staying at. As for the Westin Bonaventure, for $60-$70 per night, this place is awesome. Yes, the parking is high, but with a priceline rate, you're still staying in downtown LA for under $100/night. That's pretty good. One warning--be careful if you check in late. The Westin garage is full every night and if you are not a hotel guest who has managed to get in earlier in the day, they will send you across the street to park, which is $50/night. Try to get there early or pick your rental car up when you can park it early in the day. Once you get your car registered with them, you can get in even if the sign says the garage is full. Yes, the rooms are a bit on the small side, but for a couple, this poses no issues--at least not for us. The rooms are well appointed, and the bath was bigger than the larger Westin room we stayed in out at the airport before we left. We had a room on the 30th floor with fabulous views, great air conditioning and a heavenly bed! Housekeeping was great, and everyone we dealt with was courteous. The location is totally convenient--a good section of downtown with super-easy freeway access. Room service was surprisingly good, the brew pub had decent food, though service was a bit slow, and there are a ton of food options to choose from in the area, so you aren't stuck with hotel priced meals. It's a walkable area, at least during the day and early evening. The pool is fine, with big fluffy Westin towels, but keep in mind it is a \"rooftop\" pool and a bit on the small side. Also, wear your flip-flops--the concrete gets hot and is pretty sooty from being 5 stories above downtown and near a freeway. Not a luxurious pool by any means, but kind of cool to lay out and look up at the surrounding skyscrapers. We had quick and easy check-in and out, and while our experience with the concierge wasn't the warmest, he was efficient and courteous. This hotel is enormous and busy--I'm sure they do their best.

I then call down to the front desk again and the gal tells me there is no one working on my floor and that she has not heard of a problem with leaks. I blow it off and take a breath and go to the concierge and ask for some help locating some tickets for a concert at the staples center and he responds to me \"if I were you I would try to find them else were because my services are out of your league and you could not afford them or this hotel and you do not have the kind of money it would take to purchase them\". Basically he was an [--------] and does not realize that I have plenty of money and that just because someone looks like they might not be from money or have it don't mean they don't, I work hard for my family and took that comment very very personal.

We ended up carrying them up ourselves. There was also no parking because valet was full, so we were told we could park across the street in a hotel unrelated lot, which ended up being $15 with no ins/outs. Once we got to the tower room, there was some security guy inside still \"checking it out\", which was kind of weird. The tower room was large, but outdated. The tv remote didn't work. And the carpet near the bed was soaking wet (gross). We were told that it had been just cleaned. The bathrooms weren't as clean as they could have been. We ended up leaving for the day, only to find that valet was still full when we got back, 6 hours later. When I complained to the front desk, I was given a smug attitude and the manager told me that valet parking is not guaranteed, and sometimes guest will have to park across the street because \"this is a 35 story hotel\". He ended up attempting to get me parking downstairs, but my boyfriend ended up finding a park down the street after circling the block 4 times. We wanted to leave to go to a bar or club, but ended up staying in because we didn't want to lose our parking space. We ordered a late room service, which ended up taking an hour and 15 mins to arrive (we were told it would take 30 mins).............we only ordered a fruit plate, juice and 2 dinner salads which were horrible.

When I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in downtown LA, I prefer to stay at the Omni because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a classy yet affordable hotel with great perks for its preferred guests. But I thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d give the Bonaventure a try, given its illustrious history and solid reputation. From the outside, the Westin is quite impressive. The architecture is still futuristic to this day and I can see why many movies have been filmed there. The lobby area is like a cross between an airport terminal, mall and Vegas hotel lobby. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s large and bustling like an airport terminal, has several food courts and shops like a shopping mall, and features ponds and fountains that resemble a half-hearted version of the Bellagio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s atrium. Check-in was a breeze and valet parking was prompt as well. The $25-plus-tip-cost for valet is typical of most downtown LA hotels. The famous Bonaventure elevators are definitely the best feature of this hotel. The elevators are speedy and offer great views of downtown LA. Depending on which elevator you take, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a unique but equally breathtaking vista. The rooms, however, are a different story. Despite the modern outside appearance of the hotel, the drab interiors show its age. Each room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spectacular views make up for the tight space, but the bigger problems are the peeling wallpaper, crumbling ceiling corners and worn furniture. The air vents were quite noisy, as were the neighbor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s water pipes, which we heard at all hours of the night. The bathroom was also a major problem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when we first turned on the sink tap, BROWN WATER came out of the faucet! The bathtub didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drain properly and we were ankle-deep during showers. The water temperature was very volatile, constantly changing back and forth from very hot to very cold, and the towels were stained. A fine layer of dust covered the counters and coffee maker. Keep in mind that this room was on the Preferred Guest floor, but it looked no different from the 21st floor room that we had originally been given. Although the hotels boast many stores and restaurants, I found that most of them had closed permanently or by 8 p.m., which was when we wanted to eat. The stores also seemed a bit cramped and like they carried old merchandise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c think Chinatown. The gym was all right. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re brave, you can exercise using the machines right outside the elevator that are actually in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hallway\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and overlook the lobby atrium. There is also a workout facility in an enclosed room on the 3rd floor, with individual screens for each cardio machine, towels and water. The pool is small and at an odd location on the fourth floor. All in all, the Westin Bonaventure is very much like LA itself \u00e2\u20ac\u201c glamorous and exciting at first, but seedy once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been inside it.

First, the service is great. I'm in the medical field so I don't get perks like business people. So, try to get a good deal on priceline. Shoot for $65-ish for weekdays. Little touches like the Hotel Operator greeting you by your name on the phone was very nice. The hotel has a lot of choices on food. Most open until 8pm-ish but I can tell that they make most of their business during lunchtime with all the LA downtown business workers strolling in. I ate most of my lunches in the hotel and only 1 dinner on the top floor Japanese restaurant. The japanese restaurant was overpriced and didn't have much of a selection...but the service was excellent. Gym: Those little 'pods' off of the track displayed on Expedia/Orbitz, etc aren't the only machines. There's a separate room with more machines and free weights. The running machines had TVs. Towels and disposable headphones are supplied. Free weights are good but only went up to 50lbs. No bench press. Internet: High speed is offered for $12.95/day. Easy to use. Parking: $25/day. The parking staff is probably the nicest on the property. The first night, I tried to look for a cheaper alternative, but most places within a 2 block radius had similar prices. There is a place called Pershing Square Parking that charged $14 overnight...but no in/out and it was 4-5 blocks away. I decided to pay for the convenience and parked at the hotel parking. Safety: I have to say, I lived in NYC for 4 years and I'm from Chicago....LA downtown is DEAD. It is perfectly safe during the day but the streets clear out at night. I felt safe on the big streets but I noticed a lot of homeless people on the sidestreets. It's ok if you're a guy but just be careful if you're a girl walking alone. Pool: Layed out twice. The pool is privately gated, but anyone can use it if they stick their hand through the gate and open it from the inside. Perfectly safe though...I'm sure 100% of the people at the pool were hotel guests. The poolside chairs/beds were very comfortable. Not your ordinary cheap poolside chairs. Other: One day the bathroom light bulbs went out. Got too lazy to tell them and decided to just use the alternate light source in the shower as the bathroom light....When I got home that night, room service had fixed the problem w/o me reporting it. Everybody greets you warmly. Just a really good experience. Yes, the beds are nice but aren't you sick of reading about this on this site?

The rooms are small but beautifully renovated - Westin really has it going with the Heavenly Beds and Baths - really, really appreciated after a long day of touring the LA area.

It's a great spot for the kids - I think they'd have lots of fun here. One final note about parking: Valet parking is the only option in the hotel and is $25 with in/out. I found it a bit of a pain - I really hate the whole concept on valet parking, however the system was relatively painless.

There are some of the complaints I have read on the shape and size of the room. They weren't that much smaller than the average Westin.

Now, that you realize this, don't reserve the hotel and go somewhere else! What mattered to me was the room was quiet, clean, well furnished and to the standards of a Westin hotel. I always love their signature heavenly bed. One negative comment: If a gift shop or business center is in a hotel, they should accept room charges.

I got a package deal on Expedia with air for this hotel. The hotel is downtown with easy access to highways and to the more popular areas of LA like Santa Monica, Hollywood, and other beach cities. You can take public transit but we had a car. We had a standard non smoking room on the 14 floor in the red tower with 2 double beds. What to expect Hotel -the hotel is huge with 4 towers accessed by 4 elevators to each tower although you can take any elevator to gain access to your floor/room as they are all connected though the center -lower floors of the hotel have a food court although when we were there most of them were closed. There are also stores but as another reviewer pointed out, it does give the impression of a lower end mall. -the gym is nice. There is an indoor running track and a well appointed fitness room that was in use constantly. -there is an Enterprise Car Rental Agency desk on-site in the lobby of the hotel. We rented from the airport. -the pool is outdoors on the 4th floor and is just that, a pool. It was heated though. We didn't spend too much time at the pool but when on the elevator during the day, it seemed like the building shaded over it. -the lobby is a little on the dark side as there is very little natural light that comes through the concrete building. There is a glass roof in the center but it really doesn't allow for much natural light. -buffet breakfast is $17.95+ tax which is a deal when you look at their a la carte menu for breakfast in comparison. The buffet offered a wide selection and variety such as coffee, tea, orange juice, pancakes, waffles, omlets, french toast, sausages, smoked salmon, cheeses, toast, cereals, eggs benedict, The fresh fruit offered included blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, pineapple, watermelon, canteloupe and honeydew melon. We would have a big breakfast each morning that would hold us over until dinner each day. -food portions are HUGE so be warned when ordering. We had a ceasar salad with grilled chicken one night at the hotel in the cafe by the bar and asked to share it and there was enough there to feed 3 of us! -parking is valet only and costs $25 per night for hotel guests which includes tax. This is outrageous and quite frankly a money grab by the hotel. A lot across the street charged $8 per day although I am not sure if they allowed overnight parking. -rooms are relatively clean and spacious. The bathrooms are nice with granite counters and floors -towels for the most part were thick and absorbent but during our stay we had a few that although clean had awful stains on them ICK! -a robe is provided in each room but they didn't replace ours when it was thrown in with the towels after the 3 day. -the maid wasn't always consistent - sometimes the number of towels she left were more and other times less. Also it was a crap shoot when she'd put a new liner in the trash cans in both the bathroom and in the room -there is no bar fridge in the room but there is a safe -lighting is very dim, especially in the closet area where the full mirrors are located. We had dim lighting in the bathroom the first 2 days but they changed the bulbs without asking Downtown -a few Starbucks located within walking distance but only open during business hours. -restaurants within walking distance Cafe Pinot and Stef and Nick's Steakhouse which we went to - both very nice -there is not much to do or see downtown - we knew that going there but we decided to take a walk there during the day and we were not impressed at all. The downtown core is pretty run down and rough looking in comparison to other downtowns we've seen like Chicago or New York. In addition, we went for a walk downtown the first night we arrived and cut it really short as we didn't feel safe. There are ALOT of street people roaming the streets and hanging out in Perishing Square. We didn't feel as unsafe in the daytime but if I was traveling alone as a woman, I wouldn't feel safe. Getting Around -highway access is right there. You can get to anywhere if you have a car and a map. We did day trips on our own to Sequoia National Park and to San Simeon to the Hearst Castle with relative ease. Locally we visited the Queen Mary which was a waste of time, Santa Monica Pier, Hollywood (we were there for the World Music Awards 2005 and got to see a few stars walk the red carpet and be up close, Universal City Walk (for dinner), 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica and of course Venice Beach. -Wilshire Blvd which is a few blocks over from the hotel takes you to Rodeo Dr, Hollywood, Century City, Venice Beach, Santa Monica (about 15-20 minutes with traffic) - ask for a local map at reception or you can get one at a car rental agency.

Toting your bags from this area may also be cumbersome so you may require a bellman--that translates to more tipping.

We got a great rate through Travelzoo for $99, which included the free valet parking (normally $25). Our experience was mixed. I lived in LA in the '70s, when the Bonaventure was the coolest building around. I stayed there for the first time several years ago on a business trip and didn't think much of it---it was dated and appeared to be abandoned. It felt pretty much the same on this visit. If you are bringing your own car, be advised that it can be a nightmare to get to the garage. Even though the hotel has what appear to be manned entrances on Flower and Figueroa, you cannot get out at curbside to check in. You have to drive into the garage to valet parking, then walk down a long corridor and up two escalator flights before getting to the lobby. Definitely not a great introduction to the hotel. To get to the garage on subsequently days, we had to drive around the block because of the one way traffic. Getting to the hotel from the freeway was also a problem. We never could figure out whether there was a straightforward freeway exit for this hotel. It usually took at least 5 minutes to get from the freeway to the garage, even though the 110 freeway entrance is literally on the next block. We were initiallly assigned to a perfectly dreadful room. It was very small and right next to the elevator (with no view) and we could see the circular glass elevators hurtling by our window every 30 seconds or so. It looked as though the elevator occupants could see into our room if we didn't keep the drapes shut. (Although I think the chances are very slim--the elevators move very quickly). We then asked to be relocated, and were put in a much nicer situation, on the 27th floor (the preferred guest floor). The room was better furnished, with a view, and an upgraded bathroom. It was still small, but there was sufficient storage. No frig, but there was a coffeemaker and microwave. It reminded me of hotel rooms we've had in Tokyo. We had high hopes for the Heavenly Beds because we are in the market for a new bed and would have purchased one from their catalog (a king costs $1300) if we liked the beds. Were we ever disappointed! The beds certainly looked heavenly, but they turned out to be too firm and we did not sleep at all well on this trip. I realize that many people love these beds, so I can only say, to each his own. We bought our breakfasts from the take-outs on the 4th level. (By some oddity in planning, it is not possible to get to the 4th level on the elevator. You have to take a flight of stairs or the escalator to complete the trip). The prices at these places were extremely reasonable (considering they are located in a 4 star hotel). You can get fruit, a cooked American breakfast (though it's only fuel) and sandwiches. We took out one dinner from a Korean BBQ, but my husband had a bad reaction to the kimchi (which wasn't very good anyway). The hotel is in a good location if you want to do things in the city or in the general vicinity, such as Pasadena or Hollywood. The Central Library is right across the street (quite interesting and open until 8 during the week). Shopping is so-so. The area is primarily high-profile office buildings. We drove to other areas for dinner, although there are restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. The area appears to be perfectly safe.

Having already pre-paid for the rooms, I couldn't cancel and was very very nervous about our stay at the hotel. Turns out, there was nothing to worry about. Yes - the hotel is a little too \"urban\" and can come accross as very crowded. But at the same token, the floors were quiet. The check-in was fast and efficient and we got both of the rooms on one floor, close to each other. It is true that you could potentially lose your way around the floor because of the different towers, but it's not THAT big of a deal. Both rooms were great, clean and well decorated. They were a little small and oddly-shaped but not to a point where it bothered us. The view was beautiful, especially at night (well, we were lucky to be up high in the building).

In downtown LA, the location was fine for bus trips to the Cathedral and the new Disney Concert Center. We could have walked there. Inside, the hotel is a maze of colors and shapes throughout the building. The elevators seem to work either very quickly or very slowly. It took several days to become accustomed to the locations of the various conference rooms, restaurants, lobbies aand elevators. The rooms were OK, but on the small side for two full sized beds. Airconditioning worked well and was easy to operate. There was no refrigerator in the room; when I requested one, I was put on a waiting list. The coffee pot's lid kept coming off, but the machine did produce coffee. I did not have time to check out the TV, nor to try the fitness center or the various items of physical training in small areas along the center. Nor did I have the opportunity to visit the restaurant on the 35th floor, atop the tall tower. Energy conservation policy is in effect; if you want the sheets washed, leave the official note on the bed. If you want the towels washed, leave them on the floor of the bathroom. Otherwise, they would not be changed during your stay. Unfortunately, our convention occurred over the 4th of July weekend. Most restaurants were closed on the 4th and 5th. That meant only two workers on duty Monday morning for 2,000+ hungry people who had to catch a bus by 7:30 AM. Breakfast of low-fat granola cereal, a 2 oz container of milk, one glass jar of juice and 1 medium coffee cost $14.24. The banquet, for the most part, was well done; at my table one person collected the tickets reflecting choice of entree; two other waiters seemed terribly confused as to the number of chicken and beef dinners desired. The outdoor reception (for which convention guests paid $15 each) left something to be desired. The champagne flowed freely; reaching the hors d'oeuvres required standing in a long line.

I had the SAME problem as another reviewer - I reserved and pre-paid for a king sized bed online, and arrived to find we had been assigned a queen sized bed, right next to the elevator (like someone mentioned - anyone in the glass elevator could see right in our room if our curtains were open). I called the front desk and asked to be moved to a king sized bed room, and the woman was very friendly and accomodating and told me to come right down to get a room change. But when I went downstairs, I got a bit of attitude from a different front desk attendant, who said, \"What? You don't like your room?\" and sort of acted like I was being funny to request to move to the type of room I had pre-paid for. I wish I had known about the $6 parking around the corner!

We were given a special room rate of $159/night. Apparently, the rooms go for around $200 plus, normally. Location is great. About a block from Canal on Camp St. The lobby is nice and spacious. They have the usual free breakfast offerred at La Quintas. But, you need to get there early to get the popular items like bananas and eggs. The other reviews mention this, too. But, it's New Orleans, and you really should venture into the Quarter at least once for a good breakfast. The rooms are decent, updated, and fairly modern. Some king rooms are larger than others. The staff was friendly and even accomodated our early check in. The only downside to this hotel, and probably is like this with most of the cheaper downtown hotels, is the potential for loud and drunk guests. There was a large group of highschool or young college students staying on our floor who felt the need to party and/or argue near the elevators and in the hallway both nights. But, a call to the front desk handled it quickly.

The location is perfect, just 2 blocks from Canal Street and close to Bourbon Street. The only 1 thing we had an issue with was the air conditioner; it stated it was 68 degrees in the room, but we both felt it was more warm than that. We didn't spend too much time in the hotel room, and had already unpacked, so we didn't worry about it and just dealt with it. But there were many bright sides to this hotel that will bring us back for a 3rd time this year. The location is perfect; and even better, they have a 'carport valet' that you can pull your car into. When we've stayed at other, cheaper hotels in New Orleans, but it gets very frustrating when you have to park your car in the middle of the street and stand by it so you don't get towed, while waiting for the valet to come move your car. At La Quinta, you have a driveway you can actually pull into for the valet. It is about $26/night, with in and out privileges, but well worth it. If you call 5 minutes ahead, they will have your car waiting for you downstairs. In addition, the breakfast is pretty good, and the hotel is very clean. We have never brought a pet here, but we saw plenty of pets; and for a hotel that allows pets, La Quinta was very clean and pristine. I never would have guessed they allowed pets! The beds and pillows are very comfortable, and we love the flat screens on the walls. We had a great view from the 14th floor, facing Harrah's and the bridge. We also needed directions several times, and the front desk associates were very helpful and took the time to ensure we understood the directions so wouldn't get lost.

After spending the night in the room we were really wanting to change as we realized it was a disabled room and therefore the shower was open and let water all over the bathroom despite the curtain and everything in the room including the hanging bar in the closet was lower and therefore we could not effectively hang full length garments. In the morning my husband asked about the room change and was told it was not possible as they were short staffed and couldn't clean the extra room! We weren't happy with this response so asked a third time later in the day and we were assisted by a very helpful woman who asked 'did you request a disabled room?' She immediately a moved us to another room on the 8th floor. This room had a better outlook from the window and the bathroom had a shower in a bath which prevented the water going over the floor.

The lobby is funky with the cute multi-color dotted armchairs and soothing color scheme. However, I have a few bugbears with the cleanliness of our room. The housekeeping/ upkeep is on the sloppy side. For instance, the corners of the bathroom floor look a little grimy, the grout on the bathroom countertop is accumulating dirt, while the air conditioner & vent in the bathroom are both dusty. The tap in the tub is also chipped. After housekeeping was done with our room, there was still a few strands of hair on the bathroom floor and bits of dirt on the carpet. I understand that this is just a job for the housekeepers but wish they made more of an effort to clean the rooms and maintain the condition of the hotel. I would rate this hotel as 'good' or 3 and a half stars but since that isn't an option on Tripadvisor, I couldn't justify the 4 stars for 'very good', hence I settled for the 'average' rating. Overall, this hotel would be a good choice for someone traveling with a dog or cat as there aren't too many hotels that accept pets or do so without charging an exorbitant fee.

The free \"Bright Side\" continental breakfast (plus waffles) was a dollar saver, and while I found some of the available breakfast food options uninspiring, they were included in the room rate after all and probably kept me from overindulging. :-) And it's tough to justify the high wi-fi charges of so-called \"full service\" hotels when budget lodging options such as this one offer it for no additional charge. Our one-bedroom suite was decorated in La Quinta's newer, brighter color palette and included an imaginative take on the sofabed concept on which our daughter had no trouble falling asleep. It was a bit bothersome to be located overlooking the pool deck while actually on the pool level, as we had to keep our window shades drawn to prevent pool-goers from seeing into our room. That said, our daughter couldn't get enough of the admittedly small pool which may well have been the highlight of her week. While no proper restaurant is located in the hotel, we found a nice custom-built burger restaurant across the street which felt very cozy, laid back, and welcoming. It's also possible we may have partaken of the local Domino's one rainy evening.

We were put on a floor with a lot of other dog owners apparently, every time we walked by a few doors dogs would bark, but we never heard them over night.

But we made it by walking all around the Quarter with dinner and shopping without too much complaining, and the kids were beat by the time we made it back safe and event free.

Lots of room and the main bedroom closes off, leaving the kids to a pull out sleeper and their own TV separate from the adults. Also the location was great - right between Poydras and Canal. And it looks like some effort was made to update the room with some contemporary design. On the flip side... 1) the room smelled stale and damp. The cleaning lady was next door and sprayed the carpet upon our request, but the smell never quite went away. 2) The toilet made a horrendous sound each time it was flushed, and needed multiple flushes to be effective. 3) Two lamps did not have light bulbs. 4) The bed was hard, and the sheets were old and worn. 5) The hotel allows pets, and there was a barking dog next door 6) Only partially cleaned room by housekeeping one day. 7) We had hoped the pool would be a real amenity, but it was a cruel joke. Maybe 20X10 feet total size with 4 ft maximum depth. My son looked at the water and said - \"Wow - that's murky.\" We did not use the pool. 8) Poor front desk service. I called three times and got no answer, so I had to go down myself. When I told the desk clerk that I had been calling multiple times, he just stared at me and offered no response or apology. 9) No bar, no restaurant, no room service.

There is a basic free breakfast every morning, but nothing special. The price was affordable. The valet parkers were very helpful and pleasant to deal with. The Cons: When we checked in we were given a smoking room even though I reserved a nonsmoking room. When I went downstairs to have our room switched the girl at the front desk radioed a maid to see if there was a clean nonsmoking room, she preceded to say, \"please hurry and get a nonsmoking room clean because I have a lady who is upset that she didn't get a nonsmoking room.\" I was not upset and was polite about asking to be switched. The shower was terrible! The water pressure was weak and we could not get anything but scalding hot water. When I mentioned this to the guy at the front desk his reply was, \"Yeah, I've heard that before.\" He didn't offer to do anything about it however.

We chose this hotel because they were advertised as pet friendly and my daughter & her husband insisted on bringing their dog for the trip. All of the staff I encountered was very friendly, & patient which was a little suprising considering the hotel was fully booked and very busy. The room was comfortable although the sofa sleeper advertised in the Executive suite room was actually a king-sized futon. My daughter & her husband said that it was very comfortable. However, it is very low to the ground. An older person with bad knees may have problems getting up from it. The bathroom was average; clean and nice size, but nothing outstanding. We had no problems with noise although several other reviews here have complained about that. The only noise we heard was from the street; we heard none from the neighboring rooms. The hotel remained remarkably clean during our stay despite the fact that it was Mardi gras & there was constantly a lot of traffic in & out. The \"business center\" is very small - just one computer and printer. The continental breakfast had a good selection, although I think that hotel managment should have had more than one person working the breakfast considering the hotel was at max capacity. The one young lady working the breakfast did her best to keep everything restocked and the trash cleared, but it was just too much for one person. Parking is valet only; the rate is comparable with hotels in other major urban areas. I did not visit the exercise room, so I cannot offer any comments on that. My daughter & her husband go to NOLA at least 3 times per year and now plan to stay at this hotel when they come (they always bring their dog).

On a positive note - the hotel was very clean and was in a spectacular location. Very convenient to everything you would need to be close to Harrahs, Bourbon Street, Canal Street - and at a very reasonable rate. While we were very pleased with the rate as well as the cleanliness and the location there were 2 things that were just unacceptable. I had read another review where someone checked in and they had the wrong rate - well luckily I read this on here and printed out the reservations w/ the confirmed rate b/c upon check in I was give a rate that was $60 more per night than the original quote. I had to produce the confirmation or I would have been charged the additional $60 per night so please be careful if you are staying at this hotel. I was told upon check in that they had problems with the website not confirming rates but from the looks of the reviews this is just a practice this hotel has - and they try to get you to initial by the rate upon check - in so if you catch it later - too bad you've agreed to the rate so please proceed with caution upon check-in. The only other negative thing we had was the breakfast. If you go in and expect the breakfast advertised please note you will be disappointed. They did offer all of the things on listed on their website however they fill it up in the morning and when its gone - its gone. We went to breakfast at 9AM and they were out of all juices, eggs, sausage, milk, waffles - this might not seem like a lot but it was all they had other than muffins and toast- when you ask for refills the breakfast hostess gets really upset and goes at a snails pace and gives you dirty looks (she likes to sit in the back room and talk with her co-workers) - if this was just a one day thing it would be more understandable but it was every day that we were there so we eventually just gave up on breakfast as we knew we would be disappointed and frustrated from having to wait so long on items. We asked for more juice (again all juice and milk was empty) - waited for 20 minutes - it never came so we just gave up and went and bought our own breakfast.

We had the chance to check out a room over at the Sheraton (his conference was being held at the Marriott and Sheraton, which were right down the street from La Quinta), and I have to say we were very happy we chose the hotel we did. Our room was at least twice as big as the room we saw at the Sheraton, and for quite a bit less per night (we got our King Room for $105 per night through the La Quinta website). Pros: LOCATION; spacious rooms; pleasant staff; really comfortable beds and bedding. Cons: Valet parking is $22 per day...however, every hotel we saw cost at least that much (no free parking at any of the downtown hotels); no pool; no restaurant or room service.

My husband was doing business in town and so we did not have a choice in hotel because his company was paying for it. I am not a fan of La Quinta so I will not try and not be too negative. I will outline everything with pros and cons. FYI - I am 31 year old female and my husband is 37. We usually prefer Hilton brands or Wyndham. Pros: 1. Very nice staff at front desk, always said hello or good morning, etc. 2. Hotel allowed dogs, which is very nice. We brought our labrador. It was difficult, however, to find places to walk her (not hotel's fault of course) 3. Good location. Walking distance to French Quarter, Riverside, etc (about 1/2 mile - but I like to walk)... 4. I would say above average comfort on beds for a 2 star hotel. Feather like pillows and mattresses were acceptable. I have been to other 2 star hotels where the beds are not tolerable. 5. Decent size room for 2 star hotel. Nice large work desk. 6. We had a microwave and refrigerator (not in all rooms though) which was nice. Cons: 1. I read online that they had a heated pool and whirlpool. I was excited to possibly have the chance to swim. Well the pool was not heated and the whirlpool was full of brown, trashy water ( I should have brought my camera to post picture, but did not have it). It was a shame because, I think winter is the best time to use a whirlpool. If something is not in operation, at LEAST empty it so you do not have to see a contaminated tub of water. 2. I did some laundry since we were here for 5 nights. There are 2 washers and 2 dryers. One of the dryers made a horribly loud noise when drying. The other person in the laundry room told me they have informed the hotel and that they still have not fixed it. If I were the hotel, I would worry about the horrible sound disturbing guests in the rooms nearby. 3. Continental breakfast was OK. I found it to be comparable to other 2 star hotels with muffins, pastries, yogurt (some days), fruit, watery scrambled eggs, sausage (or bacon some days), oatmeal toast, OJ, coffee, tea. Not sure whether to put under pro or con - just average I guess! 4. Speaking of continental breakfast. The first morning we were here the sign stated breakfast was 6-9 a.m Mon.- Fri. We had to wait until 6:45 for it (my husband was a little late 1st day because of that. The 2nd morning it was ready at 6:30 and the 3rd morning it was ready by 6:00. I guess they realized they needed to open on time with our business group. Maybe it is slow season for them so they are not always punctual! I would probably not stay at La Quinta again if I had a choice, although I do have to admit having my dog with me was wonderful!

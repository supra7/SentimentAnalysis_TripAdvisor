{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Avoid this place ! Got stuck in Miami because of flight delays and were told that every room in town was booked because of events. Then we heard about this place. We got there and stood in line for 45 minutes while they slowly checked people in. Most people seemed to be so happy to find a bed that they would have settled for anything at midnight.After we checked in we went to the room. This was probably a chain restaurant once-upon-a-time but I'm sure it was de-listed a long time ago. Everything painted bright white, but Dirty. Poorly maintained. The locks didn't appear to work so we decided to keep our luggage with us while we got something to eat. When we came back, someone else was in the bed !They claimed that since we didn't leave our things in the room that we had checked out and they were free to rent to the room to someone else. WHAT A JOKE !They didn't want to refund our money until I stepped outside and flagged down a police car.We went back to the Airport and slept on the floor. A far more satisfying accomodation.", "Date": "Mar 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR585445595", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "martyspaulding"}, {"Content": "WORST hotel ever Do not waste your money! This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in! We were turned away when we first got there because our room wasn't clean. We came back 2 hours later to check in and got the same story (come back in 30 mins and it'll be ready). Came back another 2 hours later and heard the same thing. When we finally got into our room, it had definitely not been cleaned! The towels were filthy and there was dried urine on the toilet seat! Not only that but there were skid-marks on all the chairs, the ceiling in the bathroom was literally falling down, cockroaches in the bathroom and after walking on the carpet barefoot for an hour, my feet were black! To top it off, I also got bit by bed bugs. Lovely. The health department needs to pay a visit to this hotel!", "Date": "Jan 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR810859962", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "chirp16"}, {"Content": "A dump! In fact when I reserved this hotel I was not expecting somenthing good, and I made the reservation because at that week there was so many events in Miami that was almost impossible find a room (or at least a room for less than US$ 300). But this hotel is worst then my worst nightmare. Dirty, with a terrible smell in the room, the oldest furniture I ever saw in a hotel, and no one can feel safe inside or outside the hotel.

Even $US100 a night gets you the cheapest, shabbiest rooms on the market (recent experience also Orlando, Tampa, W Palm Beach) - double what. you'll pay in other states At some, as here, cheapest room has no microwave or fridge - you can pay extra for a fridge but, if you'd just like a cold drink, crushed ice is free - just throw coldies and ice in bathroom sink. Free wifi lobby only. Staff cold. Breakfast better than some (but still basic - coffee's awful, but it is everywhere in US). I've had a month in Florida and it's a state to avoid in you're on a budget.", "Date": "Mar 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR906858548", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "aussienashville"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34438-d85195-r13965007-Best_Inn_Miami_Airport-Miami_Florida.html", "HotelID": "85195", "Price": "$74"}}

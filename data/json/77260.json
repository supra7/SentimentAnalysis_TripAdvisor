After reading other reviews on this property, thought for the price, it was worth giving a try. The hotel itself has an interesting layout, with a courtyard pool. Upon check-in, you are met by hotel staff who are behind glass. Needless to say, this was a little disconcerting, as the area is a bit sketchy. Got checked in and was given room 227. The room was facing Vine, with major road noise, due to insufficient windows and proximity to the street. Even with the air conditioner cranked, the road noise was unbearable. Went to the front desk to ask to be moved to a quieter room, but was told that none were available. Went to the grocery store around the corner to buy earplugs in order to sleep. The floor felt dirty, the air conditioner let out a smell of urine and the filter looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years. Not a great first impression, to say the least. On morning 2, I went back down to ask for a quieter room, for which the staff obliged. In the meantime, stopped for the continental breakfast, which consists of two boxes of dounuts from the store just down the street. It is an Econolodge after all. The room we were moved into was noticeably better than the previous nights lodging. Newer carpet, larger room, flat screen T.V. and no traffic noise. Truly a different experience from the night before. Not outstanding, but certainly far better than night one. Overall, this hotel was very reasonably priced for the Hollywood area. If I had the same room both nights, I would have given it a better rating. It is, after all, an Econolodge, and you clearly get what you pay for. It was an adequate stay, but if I am ever in the area again, I am likely to take a pass and try out some of the other hotels.

Went to room and it smelled like urine and musty. Turned on air for a while and it was better. Went to the front desk to request an extra pillow and the lady was most helpful...we went to the storeroom and she provided the pillow. A short time after the wife went to make a coffee with in room maker. She found an old very moldy used coffee filter in the maker. I took the coffee maker (minus the carafe) to the front desk and showed the lady and asked for a different maker. She explained the room had not been used due to a lock replacement issue so that sounded reasonable as to why the filter was that moldy, having been left there for sometime. The lady and I went to the storeroom but she was unable to find an extra. I told her my wife really didn't want to use or have the moldy coffee maker in the room so the lady said she would have it cleaned and replaced. It never was replaced but since wee were busy touring hollywood and universal over the 4 days it wasn't a major issue. A couple days later I saw a 50.00 usd charge on the visa so I called choice hotels international (ashley) to report the illegal charge. Ashley said hotel has 7 days to respond. I confirmed our home phone number but said we would be on the road for another week.. Arrived home and there was no message from the hotel so I called the hotel direct on July 23 and gave date of stay and clerk was confused why I was calling about a past stay and said to call manager (Karen Anderson). In the meantime I called choice hotels international to follow up on the file and Sarah said her records show the hotel never responded but also said the complaint is marked \"international\" and she didn't understand why. She said international complaints have 7-10 days to respond and it has only been 7. She put me on hold to call the hotel direct then came back on the line and said the hotel rep had hung up on her! I asked her to document this as it doesn't seem wise for an employee of the franchisee to hand up on the franchisor! Sarah said she would try to contact the manager later and get back to me. Sarah said to check my original bill as I didn't know the name of the lady who checked me in and had possession of the coffee maker so I did. The invoice indicates Karen Anderson, the helpful lady, had checked us in so it seems that housekeeping hasn't communicated with her or they would know why, and where the coffee maker is.

We were in Los Angeles for eight nights, five at the Econo Lodge. Our goal was to see Hollywood and experience Los Angeles. The hotel was for sleeping, showering, and resting. We arrived at 6:00p.m. and were shown our room. It was room #105, pool level, non-smoking, king size bed. After reading the reviews I examined the room carefully and found it clean and orderly. There were no ants, the carpet was clean, the sheets were fresh smelling and clean, and the bathroom appeared to have recently been remodeled. The hotel reminded me of the many road trip vacations taken during the 60s and 70s with my parents. This is a MOTEL, not a HOTEL. What did I like about this motel? The clean room, the laundry, the general vintage appeal, and the grocery store right next door!! I walked to the grocery store every morning to get my fresh fruit and Starbucks coffee. There is also a Panda Express and a deli. Yes, there is breakfast with donuts, english muffins, coffee, tea, and a juice product (Hi-C while we were there). The donuts were not \"prepackaged\" items, they were purchased from the Yum Yum donut store on the corner every morning. The toaster was not broken, it worked perfectly. My husband loved the donuts, I prefer fresh fruit and yogurt. To further my list of \"likes\" I utilized the fridge and microwave every day. It stored soda pop, milk, fruit, yogurt, and bottles of water. The microwave worked great to heat up left over food. What didn't I like about the hotel? Well, it was hard to find much wrong except perhaps the cobweb hanging from the ceiling in the main room area. I snatched it down with a towel - you may find cobwebs at my house too! Further, perhaps the area? I can't complain about the area as we chose to stay in Hollywood and were well aware of the \"night\" activity in the area. During the day the area is fine, yet at night there are numerous street people as there are in ALL areas of Los Angeles. We walked during the day and up until 1:30a.m. while we were there and never once were bothered by anyone. Be both confident and aware of your surroundings as you should be in any city. Also, it is true the walls are thin and you can hear people outside and above you, but that is a common thing with all older lodging facilities. Now, I have to throw this into the review.....we stayed one night at the Roosevelt Hotel (big 5 star hotel which we paid $280 for one night, stayed next to the Marilyn Monroe room) and I say the Econo Lodge was far better than the Roosevelt. The hallways at the Roosevelt are dark and had an odor. Dark brown carpet, tan walls, dark brown doors, and absolutely no wall decorations at all.. The room was similar to the Econo Lodge, perhaps more plain in the color scheme. We also stayed one night at the Beverly Hills Hotel and as expected it was an EXTRAVAGANT, POSH experience which was far above the Econo Lodge, but the price was six times the Econo Lodge also!! We will be returning to California in the next six months and plan to stay at the Econo Lodge again with our three children. The hotel suited our needs, was clean, and the staff was pleasant.", "Date": "August 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens & Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cGreat - and true value for the money\u201d", "Author": "RealSlowMoe", "ReviewID": "UR27522455", "Content": "We stayed at the Econo lodge last year.

For two people we paid $63.74/nite ($72.66 with tax) using the Go West Rate on the ChoiceHotels website, which offers a number of name-brand properties under $100. You must give a credit card to hold the room, but can cancel for free until 4PM on the day of arrival. This is a basic motor hotel, with room doors opening into a courtyard with a pool. We walked the 1 mile north to Hollywood Blvd, and found the neighborhood ok. We did no walking at night, but there is nothing really to walk to in the area. We did not see anything particularly menacing in our nighttime drives to and from the hotel. There is a Starbucks and a 24-hour Pavilions/Von's super market next door to the south at Melrose Blvd, and a CVS a block north. We stayed here for 4 nights, and had no problems. The walls are quite thin, as you could hear coughing and conversation from the next room. Luckily our neighbors were relatively quiet. If you had loud neighbors and were a light sleeper, this could be a problem for you. Although missing the advertised clock/radio, our room did have a coffeemaker, hair dryer, and the refrigerator and microwave oven came in handy. The hotel offers both wireless Internet and a guest laundry, but we used neither to attest to their quality. There was free coffee and donuts in the lobby every morning. Note that the hotel charges your entire stay to your credit card upon your arrival, so if you are picky you may wish to inspect your room first. We had a late-night 11PM arrival, and had no problems. Our room was clean and large (some reviewers of other area hotels described those rooms as tiny), and the staff were ok. The owner even let us pick a lemon from the poolside tree. One of the best things is that the parking is free, protected inside the motel grounds, with access by automatic gate (but it opens for any car). There were always enough parking spaces, even with late night arrivals. (At one of the other ChoiceHotels, the Rodeway on Beverly Blvd, reviewers complained of not enough parking, so we chose the Econo Lodge for the ample parking, plus it was $10 cheaper). Many LA hotels charge for parking, so the free parking affectively lowers the total room rate. We would recommend this place for anyone wanting to save a buck.

In my case I experienced three different men at front desk. One of the men was totally rude. We got there for check in at about 7 pm and he was taking a nap. He didn\u2019t even look at us entering the lobby. He was kind of angry why we were disturbing his nap! I asked him about the area and he didn\u2019t like to talk. The other guy was okay and the last old guy was very nice. But the first one was enough to ruin the courtesy of the front desk. There was a refrigerator, coffee maker and microwave in our room that worked well. The room is a little small, but okay. The hotel is old, but not very dirty. The gated parking gave us the feel of being safe and secure that was very good. You can drive in to the gated parking and access your room from there. The breakfast was small, but not bad. It includes Coffee, bread, butter, jam and bagels. The hotel is less than 10 minutes drive from major Hollywood attractions. I recommended it if you are in a limited budget.", "Date": "November 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coppell, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAdequate lodging, but rude staff\u201d", "Author": "MeanGreen", "ReviewID": "UR5468471", "Content": "Room was quite adequate, clean enough, not disgusting as reported by others.

Second, the staff (only one person, actually) didn't really care whether we were there or not. Never any greeting or \"thank you\" or \"have a nice day\" or anything. Not to mention the fact that she was wearing the same outfit two days in a row! I should mention that the shower was great, very good pressure.

I often pick a lemon from the lemon tree. Secure parking via an electric gate adds to security. There's a great supermarket adjacent with a full deli and a Starbucks. The hotel provides in room coffee and a hair dryer.

We were wonderfully surprised by the refrigerator and microwave that we found in each of our rooms. Even more pleasantly surprising, at least compared with my other west-coast trips to more expensive hotels was the terrific water pressure in the shower. While the hotel has obviously not been refurbished lately, everything was clean and the staff was responsive to our needs The beds were comforatable, and there was a desk in each room and enough electrical outlets to meet the needs of the various devices we needed to use and charge. The low price and good location, with convenient access to tourist spots, a supermarket down the block and a laundry mat including wash-n-fold service across the street let us have the trip we wanted on the small budget we had.

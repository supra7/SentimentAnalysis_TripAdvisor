Our first night was spent at a high-end hotel that was overpriced and designed to rip-off the business traveler. Fortunately, for the second night, I located this very nice, comfortable and affordable refuge. I was rewarded immediately upon arrival with an early check-in (before noon !!), so we could freshen up as we had no luggage. The hotel provides an excellent shuttle service so we were able to entertain ourselves with a day shopping, dining and attending a movie at a local mall, with all of the \"necessary stores\" that follow along with Neiman-Marcus. The property itself is dated, almost to the point of when you see a cathode ray tube television you think \"antique\", other than that our accomodations were very nice. WiFi was free, no continental breakfast, however a Starbucks is right around the corner. Our dinner meal was very good with large portions, our server was overwhelmed with other chores; however, he was attentive enough to accomodate us. Hopefully, flat-screen televisions will eventually make their way into the upcoming budget for this very nice property with excellent staff.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, FL", "Title": "\u201cNeeds updating...

Their \"mistake\", our \"fortune\", was that we had just a few extra moments to spare, which we took full advantage of by popping in to the nearby CP Park Central to just check-it-out. We had already unpacked and been settled-in at the nearby \"sister\" hotel which, I might add, had fabulous reviews through TA and other sites, so we were quite content with the original reservation. That is, until we entered the lobby of the CP. Whoa! Just take a look up and take in the atrium that constitutes the main lobby area. It was amazing to gaze \"up to the sky\" and take in the interesting architectural concept of the walk-way spoke-like view to the central elevator banks of each floor. Add in a nicely appointed, large bar, an open, airy Cafe with plenty of seating, and a small convenience store, this hotel was looking really good! We approached the front desk to just \"inquire\" about this beautiful hotel, and whoa - the front desk Rep either has a twin brother, or that bright, smiling gentleman who checked us in at the \"sister\" hotel is blazingly fast and \"moonlights\" at this hotel as well. Actually, Ken works at BOTH - remember, they are \"sister\" hotels! It was an amazing check-in that took place at the other hotel, and to be honored with his welcome at this hotel was truly a double-shot of WIN! We asked about this hotel, and all its' features, and he immediately popped us 2 keys to checkout: 1) the indoor-outdoor pool and spa 2) a room on the 10th (and top) floor. Naturally, we took advantage! The indoor-outdoor pool is a unique concept that we've only ever seen at one other hotel locally in Texas. It was a nice feature. The only issue is that whatever blows in to the pool from the outside, also meanders in to the inside, so at times can appear cluttered. The hot-tub is a nice option, and for those looking to start up the bubbles, you'll find the button located in-ground beside the tub (not on the usual wall-locales). The room: Whoa! again! We were told to head to 1027 to see what it's like to stay here. What an incredible view! Nice amenities, to include: 2 tvs, pull-out sofa-sleeper, sitting table by the window, computer/work table, bar with microwave and fridge, two large double-beds, 2 phones, dresser, incredible view to the west, and nicely appointed bathroom. The ceiling in the bathroom above the tub was in need of a cleansing, as this is where the AC/heat unit appears to be. A door separates the sleeping area from the living room area. All-in-all, a nice size, relatively clean room that definitely suited this family of 3. Alas, we were already booked in to the \"sister\" hotel, and would unfortunately have to hand the two keys back to our wonderful Ken...left to imagine what it would be like to stay here. After some quick friendly chit-chat with Ken, and some quick clicks of the keys on his keyboard, we found ourselves dragging our luggage and belongings from the \"sister\" hotel to - yep - the Crowne Plaza! As ICH members, and Ken's genuine interests in making us the happiest travelors ever - he immediately transferred our reservation here!!! Oh what a truly awesome way to start our 3-day vacation!! Our rate included the fabulous breakfast buffet each morning, which featured: a delicious array of hot foods - bacon, sausage, pancakes, fried potatoes, biscuits, gravy and hot syrup. Ask the chef behind the counter, and he'll whip-up an egg concoction to your liking at your request. Throw in the usual fruit bowl, yogurt bowl, bagels, bread, butter, cream cheese, peanut butter, green and red salsas, pastries, milk...etc. Remember to ask your waiter/waitress for juice selections as well. Oh, and did I mention, because of our rate, breakfast was included!!!!! Normally, breakfast like this will run about $15pp. But, it's all worth it whether you're paying for it or not. And the staff are very attentive and caring. Oh my goodness Yum is not doing this breakfast enough justice! From what I hear, they do lunch and dinner as well... The area is relatively safe, and very convenient to 635, Coit Rd, 75, and all points around (including about a 5 minute drive to the Galleria). There are tons of restaurants nearby, from the chains to the independents. Consider this review a 4.5 stars EASY - and if you go here and have the opportunity to meet Ken (and even Scott! :) ), you will truly understand what it's like to be taken care of and treated with absolute, genuine professionalism, care, courtesy and respect!

The food was good, but when they say breakfast ends at 10 do not expect there to be food at 10 even if you have paid for the included breakfast. You can still eat what is out there, but they do not refill anything it seems after 9:30. They had no eggs, biscuits, or bacon left around 9:45. The rooms are suites. We had a King suite. It was clean and had what we needed, but I was surprised at how outdated the fridge and microwave were. The decorations were cheap and older looking, but like I said they were clean an everything worked fine. The indoor heated pool wasn't very heated while we were there. It connects to the outdoor pool and it rained 2 of the 3 days so the rain may have cooled it down. The outdoor hot tub was super!! There was plenty of tables and seating outside also. The fitness room was pretty good. It is open 24 hours. There are 3 treadmills, a few stationary bikes, an elliptical, and some hand weights. They do have a tv and water inside the room. The best part to this hotel is the staff. The first moment we arrives they were extremely friendly and helpful. All 3 days we had the same experience. I would stay again just due to the good service.

Staff is very friendly. I would like to suggest to the hotel that they make the restaurant something for a quick bite and affordable. Like a pizza parlor with a salad bar, and family friendly. $13 is too much for a burger when you can walk to In and Out Burgers nearby, The steak is expensive and I prefer to go to a fine dining establishment in Dallas for that, Give me a casual place I can grab a bite and hang out with my friends and family, The bar is nice but not so much a place for families, Something simple with a limited menu is fine. About $5 a person around $12 for a pizza to share. This will help your cost conscience travelers and make your restaurant more busy and profitable.

At the Crowne Plaza, they still have the older furniture and TV's along with peeling wallpaper.

The only thing missing is a manager's reception and a free breakfast. The main reason I have started staying at the Crowne Plaza is the price. With Priceline's name your own price, I can stay at the Crowne Plaza for about 1/2 the price of the nearby Embassy Suites. The lesser price overcomes the no free breakfast or drinks in the evening.

I've divided my review into several parts in order to organize it a little. ROOM: As the name says, this is a suite hotel. The suites are among the nicer mid-price hotels at which I have stayed and are quite large. All face an inner courtyard that goes up multiple floors (a la many Hyatt hotels). There are bridges that connect walkways from each floor to the elevators at the core. If you have problems with height, therefore, it would be best to ask for a lower level suite. The railings are ironwork and it's a looonnnng way down from the upper floors. The suites consist of a living room in the front with a very nice kitchen area and a good work space (good light; lots of outlets). The WiFi functioned superbly. There is a nice sofa, a chair with a hassock, and a fairly decent television that got good reception in both the living area and the bedroom. The kitchen consists of a small refrigerator and a microwave. There were very limited kitchen tools, cutlery, and so forth. There is a small coffee pot with ceramic mugs, which are so much nicer than the plastic cups Holiday Inn makes available. The pot supports what seemed to me to be average sized mugs (brought from home) for coffee; however' the cups provided (which were smaller) are the same as those used in the restaurant. The bedroom is separated from the living area by the bath and therefore is away from hall noise (for example the screams of guests falling over the railings...just kidding). The bedrooms have windows opening to the exterior. Since the hotel is plopped in the midst of vast concrete network of parking lots and strip malls there isn't much of a view. The bath was very nice and there was plenty of hot water and large, fluffy towels. The closets were more than adequate for a single traveler. I had a friend visit me over the weekend and there was plenty of room for her clothes as well. FRONT DESK AND FACILITIES The hotel has laundry facilities on two floors that consist of one washer and one dryer. They seemed to work very well (I used them). Front desk staff were very welcoming and helpful, including helping me to mail letters, which is not always the case. The concierge was dismissive of inquires before my arrival (it WAS, as she archly informed me when I called, Superbowl weekend after all). In person she was quite pleasant and I believe helpful. One of her activities was gathering, when informed by guests checking out, left over foods from the refridgerator for distribution to the homeless. There is a very nice gift shop staffed by helpful and friendly people on the ground floor. The lobby is quite nice with lots of comfortable seating and the Hotel offers a good bar with a decent selection of wines by the glass (or I suppose by the bottle). The bar is an open lobby bar and was a good place to sit during the day outside of class for work, email checking, and so forth. The hotel \"boasts\" a fitness center which is easily identified because there is a sign on the door. It is just off the lobby and has nice views of the pool. The equipment is acceptable but limited (two tread mills of reasonably recent vintage and some other aerobic type gear), I did not use the pool, which is mostly outside. It appeared to be small, but probably great for a dip at the end of the day. BUSINESS CENTER There is a business center, right off the front desk, but it's small. As a result it was often in use. There was plenty of paper for the copier, the computers seemed to work well (I just used them to print boarding passes) and the Internet connection was reasonably fast. Help was not far away if it was needed. FOOD The restaurant is one of the two weak points for this facility. The menu is limited, the food tastes, well, like hotel food, and it's extremely expensive given what is provided. The management obviously is aware that there are literally no real restaurants in walking distance (more on what IS available later) and charge for the convenience. There is a buffet for breakfast and that can be a reasonable choice, although it is somewhat expensive. The coffee was good and the staff was willing to fill cups for those making their way to meetings. I ate dinner at the restaurant one night. That's how I know about the quality of the wine at the bar. Sometimes we drink to forget. CONFERENCE SERVICES (SO TO SPEAK) The second weak area for this facility was its conference support. The refreshments were put out late and pulled early and consisted only of sugary pastries and the like. There was seldom enough coffee and when it was gone...it was gone. The staff working in the conference area were abrupt and in some cases rude (not the waiters; what appeared to be the management). I was not managing this effort, but from what I could understand from the conference coordinators the hotel was minimally cooperative, especially to special needs. It is possible, however, that the quality of the food was directly related to the budget. I was not involved in that, do not know what the alternatives were, or if the offering was expensive relative to the offerings of other hotels. I can only say that I attended several meetings with this group in 2011 and assume their budgets were relatively similar. The food and service at the other two sites were significantly better. THE SURROUNDING AREA The only food within walking distance was a Subway, a Quiznos, a burger restaurant and (I am not kidding here) a CVS drug store. The area is bisected by 8 and up lane highways and is not pedestrian friendly. Even if you brave the traffic and walk, you are still a long way from anywhere. Restaurants are available a mile or two up Coit Road as well as in toward downtown Dallas on Coit (both 20 minute or so drives). Having a car here is essential. With a car -- and the Dallas freeways -- much more is possible. That is, given the traditional hazards of driving in Dallas: traffic jams that materialize out of no where and drug store cowboys with big pickup trucks and short tempers. All in all, however, I found very few decent (not great; decent) restaurants at all in this part of town. Downtown Dallas is a reasonable (if occassionally hair-raising) drive down the freeway and the Galleria (which is a fairly large, but very pedestrian shopping mall) is also only a couple of exits and a traffic tie up or two around the beltway. Downtown Dallas has several interesting art museums, closely located. Fort Worth, also within a reasonable drive has even better museums as well as the stockyard, which is worth a visit if for no other reason than to people watch. And, if you want to trace the history of drugstore cowboys with short tempers and bad driving skills, South Fork, the ranch where Dallas was 'set' is not far from the hotel. Like most of Dallas, it's been surrounded by a sea of suburbs. SUMMARY The rooms at this hotel and the staff make it a good value.

I also asked them for King suite. They said, \"sorry we can't book rooms until you checkin\". Ok fine. So I go to checkin and the guy tells me I got the last room in the hotel.

The worst part of the hotel is that the rooms are DAMP. REALLY DAMP. Everything is damp in the rooms and it feels nasty and there is a funky smell in the air. (Both the first room and the second room I moved into were the same...nasty and damp) Besides the place being disgusting and old and very outdated, the hotel next door is ghetto.

This is an all-suite open atrium hotel, which is quite nice but feels a little dated. That's not to say that it's old or run down, it's not, it is just the general design of the hotel and furniture that feel much less contemporary than some of its competitors, including the Embassy Suites just down the road from it. The rooms are quite large- two full rooms, a living room with large desk, TV, sofa, and such and a bedroom with one or two beds, a TV, corner arm chair, etc. The furniture is all pretty nice and high quality, just not new. Nothing is particularly worn, however, and it appears they try to keep the rooms updated. The TVs are old and need to be swapped out for some flat panels. The bathrooms are pretty standard, but with a few nice touches. There is a little kitchenette like area between the bedroom door and the main part of the living room with another sink, the coffee maker, mini-fridge, and microwave. The beds are very good- if you like a little plusher bed with high quality linens, sheets, and covers, the Crowne Plaza's bedding collection is pretty much perfect. I like this hotel overall and it's a great deal for the amount of space you get and the comfort level of the beds, but I had a few gripes the most recent time I stayed. First, the room was not cleaned properly- I found food in the mini-fridge and there was something (food substance) sticky on the counter top above the fridge. There was a candy wrapper just laying out in the floor in the bedroom as well. Also, the prices at the bar and restaurant are a bit inflated for the quality you get. The food is pretty good, but not close to worth the price (of course, that is true of most restaurants in hotels like this). The desk staff here is pretty flat too- they were all professional, but seemed pretty unmotivated and didn't really stand out in anyway. I do like the information touchscreen by the concierge desk, it allows you to pick categories of services, attractions, and other points of interest and shows you where they are from the hotel.

It's a beautiful hotel, inside and out; I was given a roomy king suite even though I had gotten it on Priceline. (Maybe all the rooms are like this.) The hotel is kind of circular and all rooms face inside - and there are no long hallways to walk, etc. The hotel is certainly nowhere near downtown Dallas but is located somewhat close to a DART (light rail train) station, though not quite close enough to walk and I wouldn't try. Instead, I took the hotel shuttle (free) to and from the DART station, though on the day I went (mid-week) the free parking lot at the DART station had spaces open, so I could have just driven and parked. I took DART into downtown Dallas to do some site seeing (e.g. Dealey Plaza - get off at West End) and it worked very well. Actually, if you do use the hotel shuttle, make sure you ask ahead of time (like the night before) about your potential use of it, because it gets booked up sometimes. I was told that in the afternoon the shuttle was booked for a few hours during rush hour (about 4-6pm) collecting local people who were coming from working at job sites all day. I got the idea that you can't rely on just calling the shuttle and having it come get you immediately. Service at the hotel was excellent - everyone I talked to was friendly and helpful. In the room, the bed was very comfortable - I slept well. Free wireless internet at the hotel worked great. There were two TVs, one in each room, though they were the old-style \"tube\" type not flat screens or anything. I didn't eat at the hotel; there are fast food places and a Starbucks nearby but lots of restaurants within a few miles if you have a car. I used the spa one night - it's outside, by the half of the pool that is also outside. If there were bubbles I could not find the switch to turn them on - oh, well, still very relaxing. If there was one downside (?), it was that there were no nightlights in the room and none of the light switches were lighted, so if you need to get up in the middle of the night, the room is completely dark.

In fact, a tour bus driver bursted in outraged, since the whole bus were waiting, and no one was available to coordinate the guests.", "Date": "April 25, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAloha on Alpha Rd!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1552094", "Content": "Very nice all-suite hotel. We were here from Europe and were pleasantly surprised with our first TX hotel. Room had a living room, bedroom and bathroom, all kept clean and in a good condition. You need a car to get anywhere from the location. It's nice quiet neighborhood and it swiftly connects to downtown Dallas and the highways. North Dallas is also easily accessible from here. We were late due to an 30 hour journey from Northern Europe (3 flights with delays) and came to the hotel at 2AM. We were welcomed nicely and there was no hassle at all. There is a picturesque lobby with elevators in the middle. Service was good all the way. Continental Breakfast was maybe a little overpriced, but still very good. We didn't try buffet breakfast. Would stay again, one of the most memorable Crowne Plazas I have been.", "Date": "January 14, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1526028", "Content": "The Crowne Plaza was a very nice hotel. The rooms look exactly like the Embassy Suites design. When you first walk in, there is a living room with tv, table, couch, chair, phone. The middle part has a bathroom and basic kitchen (microwave, refrigerator, and sink). The back part is the bedroom with tv and phone. It was very clean. We did not try the restaurants during our stay. They have an indoor-outdoor pool & hot tub that are nice. Our room faced I-635 but the traffic noise was not bad at all. You could occassionally hear some traffic noise but it was not disturbing. The only negative I have is that the only restaurants close by were fast food. To go to a nice restaurant you had to drive a while. But overall the hotel was very nice.

This hotel has true \"suites,\" with a seperate living room and bedroom. The living room has a couch, chair with ottoman, desk/chair, TV, and small kitchenette with a microwave, refrigerator, coffee maker, sink, and cabinets. Next, is the bathroom and hallway closet, then the bedroom, with another TV. I loved the fact that there was a solid door between the living and sleeping areas--it was so easy to go to bed and not be disturbed by the TV in the other room. The suite was clean we arrived and housekeeping did a fabulous job everyday. The hotel is easy to get to off of I-635 and it's easy to find restaurants, malls, etc. in the area. I highly recommend this hotel.

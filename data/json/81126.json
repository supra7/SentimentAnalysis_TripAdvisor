They sent someone for gatorade and room service sent me the food I requested, which was off the menu. My only complaint was that it took a while for warm water to reach the shower - I had to let it run for a good 5 minutes -- and also that the shower head faced the door so the floor got wet when the shower door was opened to step in.

Like any hotel with an Asian heritage, service is outstanding. Truly. And the views, as others have said, are amazing. The big place where the hotel falls down and is no better than, in my opinion a Holiday Inn or Motel 6, is outlets. If you are a business person and you want to sit at the desk, no outlets. You will crawl under the desk to see one outlet only with the other one taken up by the lamp. This makes a material difference if you are using a MIFI device, charging your phone, and banging away at the laptop. It's really bad. There is a 4 plug (you get 3) on the left side of the bed behind the night stand which you have to move to get to them. If you are the lay in bed with the laptop person, phone on night stand, okay, you'll be okay. The hotel could easily solve this with a power strip in the room up on the desk. Internet is expensive just because they can. So, I nail em with average because the plug situation is poor for a business, high end hotel but also because when I called for a power bar, nobody could get me one.

The room was undeniably blessed with spectacular views of the Bay, and it was well equipped, but somehow it felt a bit \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tired\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We felt the major problem was that the reception and restaurant are some 36 floors below the accommodation, so it feels quite detached. Its location however is fabulous and the rooms were quiet and very comfortable. We did have an issue at check in. We were checked into the wrong room!!. We noticed personal welcome letters to another guest and even a monogrammed pillow. We reported this to the Front Desk who simply wanted to ship us out the room as quick as possible in a very unceremonious fashion. No porter was made available to move our luggage and the promised complimentary coffee never appeared. We had to call twice to get it delivered. Not a very good impression on our first arrival and certainly not the level of service we experienced in their Singapore hotel. It was also evident that we did not qualify for welcome notes! After this episode everything went smoothly. The other staff were fantastic, courteous and caring.

Lets forget the view, there isnt a bad view in San Francisco. The hotel is jaded-dated and really feels that it should have had a makeover in the last 10 years. Check in was standard. I had a corner room on the 38th floor and was not impressed by the dated decor and furnishings. I ordered room service for two and for pre-prepared food it took a long time to arrive, and with a very limited late night menu, no french fries etc. The grilled cheese sandwich was foccacia with feta spread, disgusting and inedible and my chicken sandwich a close second. A call to complain to the front desk was met with \"thats how the chef choses to prepare the dishes'. What chef??? Clearly there is none in the building overnight and frankly in a hotel of this reported caliber I expect a lot more and a better response from the front desk. The bed was ok, the thread count and pillow number a far cry from other MO's and the bathroom towels getting on the thin and grey side. In fact, nothing exuded a sense of luxury. The next morning the elevator was out of service and I was stuck on the 38th floor until after a number of calls to the operator (handled poorly) it began operating again. Asking the doorman for the nearest drugstore resulted in me being sent on a 6 block hike, although I subsequently find one just around the next corner. The front desk did not know where there was a good late night deli or restaurant and thats how things just continued to go. A burger and fries in the lounge bar area took an age to arrive mid-afternoon and just ok, and for which they comped us a couple of drinks.

I was really put off when reading reviews about outdated or faded rooms, but am glad we gave the MO SF a chance. Rooms were in perfect conditions. Pristine and perfect.

When we pulled up at the hotel, we were greeted (by name) at the car by one of the staff. Check in was super quick. A lot of people have complained about the lobby being dark and dreary, but I thought it was very nice. The hotel rooms occupy the top floors of an office building in the financial district. The view is AMAZING. Unparalleled. I looked at some of the other 5 start hotels in SF, and while they were nice, the view at this property beats all of them. There were a lot of nice touches in the room-- a smal fruit platter, fresh flowers, personalized stationary... but the view-- WOW. The windows open a little so you can get fresh air. We could see alcatraz and the bridges from our room. Really nice.... which brings me to the room. I hate to say this, but the room itself was dissapointing. The furniture was old and outdated. There were 2 TVs in the suite, and they were both fuzzy in reception. There was not much of a channel selection. There are also 2 bathrooms in the suite, which was nice. The showers were really old with some unattractive tiles (reminded me a little bit of a locker room shower). The bathtubs were also small. The bed was super comfortable, though-- and great quality bedding. I used the gym one evening, and it was great. A huge variety of updated machines with a TV on each machine, water bottles and towels were also available. While the view and service were unparalleled, the room furnishings were too dated. At $900/night, it was dissapointing. I recommend it for the view and if you have extra cash to spend, do it.

I had to stop a business mtg to go do all this. I work in same city as hotel and live ten miles away yet they spelled Piedmont as Tiedmont and that caused problems.

My fax was \"sort of dark\" but he would accept it anyway. What? Is this a five star hotel or Motel 6 in Amarillo? Who asks for all that \"proof\"? They usually contact the credit card, yes? The customer service is the poorest I have ever encountered, and I stay at five+ star hotels all over the world. Their arrogance knows no bounds.

One note - if you drive your own car to the hotel, there is limited space to pull over for the bellman, and if he is not out in front the hotel is easy to miss.

We did not eat lunch or dinner at the hotel -- there are superb restaurants just around the corner that we wished to try (Michael Mina, for instance).

Look for the state resident weekend promotion, which nicely includes the valet parking. Is it the newest hotel in SF? No. While the room furnishings have been very nicely updated, with very comfortable new beds, there's certainly no hiding that the building dates back to the late 1980s. Is it a \"be-seen\" venue? Nope. The lobby and the public spaces have a decidedly residential feel, and the relatively small room count adds to that. But this place absolutely wins over them all with the warm, genuinely friendly, unchanging staff (they recognized us after the second visit); understated, comfortable elegance; and the unbeatable views, on which much praise has already been heaped. As an area resident, it was a real treat to enjoy a portrait of San Francisco -- the changing lights, rolling fog and all -- from this perspective. It gave me a renewed appreciation for the beautiful city that it is. On the subject of views, I too would recommend the Bridge-to-Bridge view rooms. Previously we had also stayed in the Golden Gate Mandarin rooms, and didn't find it such a great idea for a couple of reasons: (1) One of the windows facing the Golden Gate is located in the bathroom, over the tub. Which would otherwise make for a nice brochure shot, but really, how much time can you spend in the bathtub?

Unfortunately we have to say we were dissapointed. Firstly the positives. Clearly as all the reviews mention the views are incredible.rooms, as you would expect, are clean with nice flat screens, molton brown toiletries etc. Beds are great and room service good. However as this is an MO you'd expect this. Unlike some of the reviews, we found the staff very good especially the concierges. Now the bad. The decor in the public areas is horribly dated.Dark, uninviting and looking like it hasnt been touched since it opened. The MO bar is dreary and felt like a relic from 20 years ago with the piano player in the corner. Hard to believe this was the same chain as the fabulous MO bar in prague. Why when you have the best views in san francisco would you cram the bar into the tiny dark lobby on the ground floor?The restaurant was nothing special. The whole hotel just felt horribly cramped. Perhaps the most irritating thing was the relative lack of amenities.Gym and spa were across the road in a public gym. Frankly i cant be bothered with this sort of arrangement. Especially dissapointing given that one of MO's usual high points are their spas. The room decor whilst inoffensive is certainly not as stylish or as up to date as other MO's. In conclusion, this simply didnt feel like a mandarin oriental hotel. One ordinary restaurant and a horrible lobby bar does not merit the rates charged. If i were the owners id forget about the views and go and look for a new location and start from scratch.

The hotel town car gave me a ride back from the wharf one night and I dropped my wallet in the car. The car came right back after dropping off another couple from the hotel to a club and the wallet was gone. I told security that the wallet was in the car and if he found the couple (who were obviously staying at the hotel), most likely he would find my wallet since the driver said he didn't see it. Sure enough, security got it for me the next morning - minus all my cash. My stupid move for leaving the wallet, however you always wonder what actually went down with the cash.

Unfortunately we were very disappointed. At check in there was some confusion about the booking with one of two rooms booking being lost. The receptionist was slightly flustered and eventually blamed our agent (Amex platinum service) for the error. Luckily we had a printout of the confimation and she eventually found the \"lost\" booking on the computer. In addition the scheme that we had booked offered an upgrade if available - I had to specifically ask for this and at first she denied we were eligible for this but then in view of the delays and lost booking one room was upgraded to a higher floor. During the whole process the receptionist made me feel that the fault was mine! Then she forgot to swipe my credit card and I received a phone call at 9:30pm requesting that either I come down or that the card be collected from the room and swiped. I told the receptionist that it was inconvenient at this time and I would bring the card down the following morning - she reluctantly agreed to this. The next morning I took my card down and complained to the duty manager. As a result of my complaint, our breakfast plan was uprgraded (from continental to full) for our stay and a small bottle of port was placed in our room. All in all the discussions were very hostile with none of the charm that I expected from MO staff. In addition our teenage daughter was placed 6 floors away from us despite a specific request to have the rooms close together. The rooms were excellent with magnificent views though the decor slightly tired, the bathrooms were nice and the bed comfortable. Breakfast was a major disappointment, if you are in need of quick service this is not the place for you- it took up to half an hour to get a bowl of cereal and although the staff were running around and polite the delivery seemed to be very inefficient with items missing from orders, and delays requesting milk and coffee. The overall impression was one of chaos with poor staff leadership. The lobby and bar area was the opposite of welcoming; gloomy and cold and seriously in need of a make over. The concierge service was the only aspect of the hotel that lived up to MO standards. I do wonder if there are some serious managerial issues as we overheard numerous other guests complaining both at breakfast and at reception about the service. In fact a friend of ours waiting for us in the lobby commented about the number of guests complaining.

I had a King bed reservation with the Ritz, but Mandarin said they didn't have any available and they stuck me in a room with two twin beds. Each bed was jammed against a wall, so there was no room to move on the walled side, and the twin was narrow enough as it was, without this added restriction. Anyone who is even the slightest bit claustrophic needs to stay far, far away. I'm 5'8\" and my feet hung over the edge of the bed. I have never had such a miserable, cramped night of sleep. I know that last minute guests can't be choosy, but this room was listed at almost $500 per night. It wasn't an economy selection. I didn't know hotels still had twin beds, especially luxury hotels. I've only seen rooms with two double or queen beds. I don't think the Mandarin Oriental should even offer this type of room. Like the beds, the room was elongated and narrow, so much so that the television could not even face the beds squarely. The tv faced the opposite wall and could not be fully turned towards the bed, because there was not enough room on the tv stand. It's like the hotel took two closet spaces and made an awkward, L-shaped hotel room out of them.

Recently I decided to spend a Saturday night in San Francisco. A lot of things have changed. Check in was a breeze. I requested a room on a high floor and they gave me the 38th. This is akin to being put on the second floor of a ten story building. Hmmmmm - okay. Arriving at my room I was sad to see it's been reduced to the most basic of functionality - it didn't look luxurious the way I remembered. No comforter. Scuffed and tired looking upholstery on the chaise. Ceiling molding cracked and coming away from the wall. Smaller furniture than existed in prior decor. Magazines were minimal and dog earred. I had the room with the big window in the bath and when I walked in the bathroom I noted \"minimalist\" had taken over. Not a twig of green plant or decorative item around. Four hanging white towels was about as edgy as it got. The soaps and shampoos have been reduced to motel size. The Great Recession strikes again. I began to wonder how big a bar of soap is in your basic motor lodge. On the up side, the MO remains a place of tranquility and peace. With only 10 or so rooms on each end of the big hallways, there's not much door slamming or neighborly chit chat outside your door. I had wonderful food from room service which made the low floor placement forgotten. Similar to what others say - come for the view, although a \"city side\" room is a bit industrial in tone and would have me back down at the front desk asking to be moved. In the end, the MO-SF is now a very nice four star business hotel, worthy of a two day stop over in SF if you've never been or on your way overseas. It's not worth a five day honeymoon. It's in the heart of the financial district which turns into a ghost town Friday night through Monday morning. On the weekends plan on having to walk several blocks to find a functioning Starbucks.

Highlights are: - excellent views from the Bay view rooms and the corridor connecting the two towers - exceptional service, food and beverage. Everything I ate or drank during my stay was very good - very friendly housekeeping and room service staff that go out of there way to take care of guests and anticipate needs Despite these pluses, I thought a number of aspects were a little disappointing for a Mandarin, specifically: - bathrooms are 3.5 star: thin towels (think Marriott, Hilton, Sheraton, et. al.), only one sink, old showers (tile instead of marble, with 70s/80s tinted glass doors and steel frames). Only 5 star bathroom feature was the Molton Brown amenities - very basic fitness facilities. A very small area with no natural lighting tucked away next to the executive offices. No wet area and limited equipment. Definitely an after thought and not acceptable for a 5 star property and unusually bad for a Mandarin - lobby is nice but nothing special. A bit of a lost opportunity that they didn't place the bar / lounge and restaurant on a higher floor so that the incredible views could be enjoyed from the public spaces. Views are great but hard to access unless you have a Bay view room. It is definitely worth confirming one in advance if you can Be aware that the design aesthetic is a little different from most Mandarin Orientals where I have stayed. Instead of being Asian minimalist / modern, this property has a more traditional Chinese feel (i.e., red, gold, jade) and feels a bit more like a mix between a Shangri-La and an older Ritz or Four Seasons. Although the views are nice when you get them, I don't think the facilities and decor at this property will impress true fans of the chain. However, the staff at this property are exceptional and are clearly doing everything they can to help make this one of the better properties in the city --- if not the best.

Pros: Excellent service just like you would expect from MO Incredible views, I doubt any other hotel can beat their view and this is the same in many of their properties. Cons. Location: great location for business but not so much for a weekend getaway. Lobby and bar: I think that this is the main reason why I would not stay here again. All of the MO that I have stayed in have a spectacular lobby and an even more spectacular bar, usually with an incredible view (Tokyo, NY) and always with a great ambience, I like a hotel with a great bar so that my wife can take her time getting ready while I have a cocktail or two. The lobby of this hotel could be the lobby of any 4-5 star chain hotel, nothing special, but the lobby bar which is right next to the front desk is the dullest bar I have been to in years, it has absolutely nothing special, no view, no ambience no nothing ! Rooms: Although the view was incredible, our room (a bridge to bridge room) was nicely decorated but very small and very plain, again what you would expect from a \"hotel chain\" like Marriot or Westin but definitely not from MO. We picked this room for the view and it was great but it would have been incredible if it had floor to ceiling windows and electric curtains, the windows were small and you have to manually operate the curtains (2 per window times 3 windows). The TV in the room has no pay per view or movie channels which now a days is hard to believe but worst of all was the bathroom, small, dated, old tiles on the shower wall, I could have been at the Omni down the street ! All in all you could say \"you get what you pay for\" because this is I believe MO's least expensive property but if you like to stay at their hotels you are not looking for a bargain, I believe you are wiling to pay for an overall experience that at least for me was not delivered at this hotel.", "Date": "December 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cDo not stay here!

Both the museum and Ferry Building are near Market St., as are several BART subway stops (we would be car-less, taking BART from the airport, SFO, into the city). In the past, we have had memorable stays at the St. Regis, Ritz Carlton, Palace, and Campton Place. All except the Ritz are close to Market St., all except Campton Place have indoor pools. Online, I discovered an enticing California resident weekend rate for the Mandarin Oriental. We have stayed at Mandarins in Hong Kong and New York and think it is a luxurious collection of properties with an elegant Asian aesthetic, so we decided to book here. Of course, we had heard about the Mandarin's vaunted views. The Mandarin is located in the Financial District, 2 blocks north of Market St. This is a very quiet area on weekends--even McDonald's and Starbucks are closed--but more active areas like Union Square and the aforementioned Ferry Building and Market/SOMA are within easy walking distances. The hotel occupies the top 11 floors (38-48) of the 3rd tallest building in San Francisco, so yes, the views are fantastic. The lobby, restaurant, lounge, meeting rooms, well-equipped business center and small fitness center are on the floors 1-4. There is no pool or spa, but guests have access to these at a fitness club across the street. The floors housing the guest rooms are dumbbell-shaped with about 7 rooms at each octagonal end separated by a \"skybridge\" corridor with windows overlooking the bay and city. The 38th floor has 2 suites with large terraces replacing the skybridge. Our reservation was for a city view king, but I noticed online the price point of a bay view queen, with the same square footage, was often identical, so we requested and were given this room type. I thought it well worth it to sacrifice a larger bed for a better view. The bay view extended from the Golden Gate Bridge to Alcatraz, the Transamerica building, Coit Tower, almost to the Bay Bridge. An insulated wicker basket with jasmine tea and almond cookies is delivered shortly after you arrive in your room. The room was beautiful, far from a simple box shape with few 90 degree angles. The sheer shades on the window are elegantly embroidered. The MO channel on the flat screen TV is fun to watch, quite imaginative. There were 2 clocks--one a standard gold alarm clock, the other a fancier clock/CD player whose alarm I couldn't figure out. There is a DVD player and large closet. We had to request slippers. The bathroom was fairly large with 2 types of marble, although the counter space around the single sink was not ample. There was a wall clock whose loud ticking could be heard in the bedroom. The separate stall shower also was large but its tiles reminded me of a locker room. The toiletries and towels were a bit disappointing--the towels neither large nor plush, the toiletries small (1 fluid ounce each). The bath soap was the same tiny size as the soap for the sink. Overall, this was a great short visit to a great city. The SFMOMA exhibits were worthwhile, and although we missed the Farmer's Market at the Ferry Building, we were able to gorge ourselves at Taylor's Automatic Refresher, Mijita, the Slanted Door, and Hog Island Oyster Co., plus Sear's Fine Foods by Union Square. We wanted to try the renowned Dottie's True Blue Cafe in the Tenderloin, but the line was too long.

The hotel had actually booked the car later than we asked so it was their fault, yet when I asked to be compensated somewhat for the late delivery, they took my name and number and I NEVER GOT A CALL BACK!

Finally I went to another bellman and said that guy said I cant park her but I need to check in.. He said \"sorry\" and when and got my luggage. I don't know if the was a language problem or what? But it not the usual greeting I get at hotels. I complained as I checked in and got a cool response apology. It was Valentine Day weekend and stayed in the Lotus Suite. I had flowers delivered and I noticed the bell man had them in his hand in a box.. I quietly said to him why do you have the flowers in your hand in a box, it supposed to be in the room as a surprise. He seemed not to understand as he puts the flower down on the dresser, I ask can I get a vase? It was a weird start to a trip at a 5 star hotel. The trip got better because the Lotus Room was simply beautiful and the view was spectacular out each window. I say through out my 3 day stay, I didn't find the front desk to be that friendly like other 5 star hotels, but the room made up for the lack of good customer service. A week after I the trip I received a request for a customer survey like many hotels send. I gave the hotel great marks besides customer service. When I marked down customer service then the survey ask me why low on customer service and I told them what happen when I arrived. Within a week I received a scolding letter from the hotel customer service supervisor mad because I marked them down in customer service. I couldn't believe it? They were saying will we investigated and they were making excuses for the bellman and said the bellman said he was sorry. Which didn't happen the other bellman said sorry for his co worker. But it wasn't just that incident that made me give low grades on customer service, it was the overall way they treated us. They didn't greet you as you pass the lobby, didn't rush to open the door as you came and they weren't that friendly or welcoming. I wasn't going to write a review on this hotel but when I got a scolding letter from the hotel because I marked them down was very insulting. When I wrote back and told them well I thought the customer service could be better and that I never got a apology from the bell man, they NEVER wrote back or responded to my letter it was like they just want to tell me off about my survey answers.

Great pillows; I slept very well. The bathroom was my favorite. It had a large, deep tub overlooking the city. However, the tub is only big enough to fit one person at a time. The service was good; they were very attentive. Although I must warn you, you will get outrageously charged for everything you do. We wanted to eat at an Indian resturant, so we called the front desk and asked them directions to a nearby Indian place. They were very nice, and even printed out directions for us. However, when we checked-out, we saw that we had been charged $6.00 just for having someone tell us where to eat at. We also had room-service ordered. It was $80 for two entrees and an appetizer. Normally that wouldn't bother me if the food was good, but it was not. In fact, I couldn't even eat most of it because it was so gross. I had the pan-seared seabass. It was way over-cooked and was placed ontop of bland mashed potatoes and prego spaghetti sauce. We also had breakfast ordered the next morning. Breakfast was better, but it was still ridiculously expensive. $50 for two breakfast entrees. A glass of orange juice is $6.00! For a hotel that is so high-class, I was not expecting to pay such outrageous prices for something I could get elsewhere for much, much less. Also, everyone expetcs to be tipped. This gets tiring after a while. Oh, I should mention that in the morning we stopped by MO bar to get a water and a coke.

An obsequious front desk attendant checked me in and proceeded to bring me up to my room to show me the amenities. While the hotel is housed in what I was told is the third tallest building in San Francisco, the lobby occupies the first floor while the rooms begin I believe somewhere on the high 30s floors. I had a Queen Bay View Room, located on the 41st floor, which allowed unparalleled views of the Transamerica tower, Coit tower, Alcatraz, the Bay Bridge, and the Golden Gate Bridge. There were so many sights to photograph from the room window alone! Luxe Amenities: Hot tea and cookies are presented shortly after arrival. Two different options for bathrobes: one terrycloth, one chunky waffle weave. Slippers and elegant turn down service nightly, along with bottled water presented bedside. Molton Brown toiletries were excellent. Fabulous points: Concierge was amazing and recommended great places to shop, how to differentiate between the trolleys, cable cars, and other modes of transport in the city, where to eat, and also arranged at the spur of the moment for an almost private tour of the city on an 8-person bus. This tour was exhaustive in terms of the areas we explored and the guide was able to take pictures and provide us with even more suggestions for restaurants and places to visit. The van drove us all over the city and we stopped to get out at the more critical spots. It lasted two to three hours and was a very reasonable $50. Back at the hotel, the fresh apples by the elevator were a nice touch, as was the impeccable service which even extended to the cleaning staff. Concerns: I travel very lightly (I only brought one carry-on and a messenger bag on my trip) but even I was surprised at how little drawer space they provided. There were a few at the bottom of the closet but it was tough to locate any others. There was a floor lamp located near the desk which I needed to use for the added light at night, but I had to plug it in myself (very minor concern, obviously). To access the internet, I had to call the front desk and then was transferred to a tech support line, and surprisingly was never charged the access fee at check-out. Also, one major concern (although it provided a bit of comical relief one morning) was that I could hear EVERYTHING the neighbors did in their room. Now, either my neighbors were very loud, or the hotel's walls need a bit more insulation added in the next renovation. Overall: The views from the room make the stay worth every bit of the cost (which drops drastically if you stay any nights between Friday and Sunday as it's primarily a business hotel). I found the location very convenient to SoMa, Union Square, the Farmer's Market at the Embarcadero, and everything else in the city. However, I would not stay at this hotel if a big draw for you is a bustling hotel atmosphere, particularly at night. This hotel is so amazing in part because it is almost museum-like in its quietness (bawdy neighbors aside). While I am also inclined to visit the St. Regis or the Four Seasons for my next trip to San Francisco, the Mandarin's price drop on weekends, mixed with the superlative quality of the views (and the envious looks you get when you mention where you're staying) make it a must to stay here!", "Date": "January 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, England", "Title": "\u201cThe best views in the Bay Area.\u201d", "Author": "vacationloveruk", "ReviewID": "UR23218003", "Content": "We stayed here because of the height of the hotel and the views we would get.

I booked the room expecting spectacular views and was not disappointed. The room was well appointed, of a reasonable size (I had toyed with the idea of a suite but thought the short stay did not warrant it) and generally satisfactory for a chain hotel. An initial word of warning - the hotel is a little hard to spot; if you expect a large frontage you will go directly past it, as we did. Once we found the entrance, first impressions of the hotel were good; we were greeted politely and our car was promptly parked and our luggage unpacked. The first warning of one of the minor problems with the hotel was the wait for the elevator \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are only two servicing the hotel and, while the Mandarin Oriental does not cover all 48 floors of the building, there can be a considerable wait, especially at peak times such as breakfast and dinner. Another note of caution I would proffer is that bridge to bridge rooms all have interconnecting doors with adjacent rooms, thus offering families the opportunity to link more than one room during a stay. This is, of course, of benefit to families wishing so to do, however, for those needing a full night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep, the noise that comes through the door can be an unwelcome disturbance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were woken on two mornings at 6am by our early rising neighbour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s television. I complained to the front desk, albeit not forcibly, and asked what could be done. Their first suggestion, placing a pillow against the door, was as laughable as it was derisory. Subsequently I was told no other rooms with similar views, I had made this a prerequisite, were available. While I understood and accepted the explanation, I was a touch put out by the lack of apology or indeed the option to upgrade the room. The restaurant on the second floor, Silks, is of a high standard and the meal we had there was one of the highlights of our trip to California \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it exceeded our expectations and bettered many of the establishments we visited that had boasted multiple Michelin Stars. The highlight of the meal, indeed three of the four of us dining chose it, was the exquisite scallop and pork belly starter. The sommelier was well trained and recommended an exceptional wine to accompany our meal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in fact he chose something cheaper than the bottle I had sought his opinion on. Breakfast was also of a high standard and I would recommend the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGreen eggs and ham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 without hesitation. In addition, the barman at the bar on the ground floor provided excellent service and gave sound recommendations. We found the front desk staff of mixed ability and demeanour. The concierge was a delight to deal with and he helpfully made reservations for us and printed off various pieces of information without hesitation. In contrast, the main front desk team seemed rather inexperienced and some struggled a little with spoken English. All in all, the Mandarin Oriental is a great hotel to stay in if one is visiting San Francisco, however, it is not a destination in itself.

Things did not improve when we entered our Dynasty Suite - the rooms were dark and the layout not at all attractive. Whilst the soft furnishings had supposedly recently been upgraded, the decor in the two bathrooms was shocking - poor lighting, seventies' style mini tiles in the shower and the shower head height located somewhere around my chest. On our floor at least, the rooms were laid out in a barbell with approximately six in a cul de sac formation at each end of the hotel. This very quickly became an issue when we became aware of the sound proofing in the suite - there is none. With our bed headboard adjacent to the hallway door, we were consistently bombarded by the thud of bedroom doors slamming closed.

I spent many hours trying to decide where to stay. On my last trip in June I chose the Four Seasons; it was a superlative experience and a good value to boot. But I wanted something different. I originally booked the St. Regis, but the numerous Trip Advisor comments about noise worried me; the location of the Ritz Carlton does not appeal to me, so sort of by default that got me to the Mandarin Oriental. After reading all the reviews of this property, I can say that I understand both the positive and the negative comments. No hotel is perfect (or at least I haven't been there yet!), so it really depends on what you value for your money. Let me start with the positives. 1. As everyone says, the view is unbeatable. I had an executive king with a view south and west. I could see some of the Bay Bridge, but very little of the Golden Gate. If that view is important to you, you need to book a higher category room. Expect to pay $100-200 more per night for that privilege. And, as others have noted, there is no guarantee that you will have that view if there is thick fog, as there was for most of my stay. 2. I loved the layout and decor of the room. In fact, I was shown a bridge to bridge room and a Mandarin king (the pricey one) and the living area in my room was more spacious. The color scheme (red, gold, white) is cheerful yet soothing. The furnishings, art work, throw pillows, bamboo plant, sheer blinds, etc. are all lovely. The bed linens were top of the line, really, really silky smooth. Great air conditioning, although I'm not sure I really needed it in the chilly August fog. 3. The hotel is very quiet for a big city. I think being on the 41st floor keeps out a lot of street noise. I heard doors in the halls, but not people, even on a fully booked Saturday night. There are only about 15 rooms per floor, divided by the walkway, so there just aren't that many guests to make noise. Now for the not so good. 1. As a luxury hotel bathroom junkie, the M.O. was a bit disappointing. Mine was a bit small, with a very narrow tub. There are appeared to be three types of wall covering, the ugliest of which is in the separate shower. In the other rooms I saw the walls of the separate shower were marble where mine was just ugly yellow tile. The Mandarin King bath with the tub by the window is lovely, but it does not compare to the bath at the Four Seasons. The towels were a bit scratchy and I didn't care for the toiletries. I went from two bathmats on the first day, to one on the second to none of the third. Housekeeping must have forgotten. But the room itself was super clean. 2. The public areas of the hotel are sort of dark and pretty small. I don't spend time in public areas, so this didn't matter to me. But the appeal of the hotel is on the upper floors. It's really too bad that Silks has no natural light windows because it is a pretty space. 3. I was on a breakfast package so I had two meals in Silks and one from room service. They were okay. Be aware that you are kept to a $32 per per person maximum for the package. At the Four Seasons they just paid whatever I spent (one breakfast upwards of $50). 4. For the non-smokers: this hotel is pretty lax about smoking in rooms. I was told the only floor where smoking was allowed was on the 48th, but there was definitely a fresh cigarette smell in my 41st floor room on Saturday night. One of the staff told me that they don't charge people for smoking in non-smoking rooms as there are a lot of Asian and European clients who smoke. I found this annoying. 5. No wifi the rooms, ethernet connection only. Not enough information about TV channels and no info on PPV. 6. The staff did not impress me much. Check in was chaotic -- the person serving me seemed not to know what she was doing, and there was a problem processing my credit card. It turns out it was the M.O. system and not my card, but the 15 minutes spent trying to figure this out was embarassing and annoying. I found the breakfast server unfriendly. But these negatives do not outweigh the positives, and all things considered, I would definitely stay here again. The price was reasonable for a luxury hotel in one of the world's greatest cities, and I really, really loved the room. The pictures posted on trip advisor and on the hotel website are accurate.

She whisked us past the check in desk, straight up to our rooms, and we checked in from there.

While we were there everyone was so kind and helpful to us. We chatted to the doormen a few times and they went out of their way to help us, it was the same with everyone. They all had a genuine smile for us, it was wonderful. We had a drink in the bar, that was a lovely experience. We had breakfast in Silks which was very nice although quite expensive. One warning - nothing to do with the hotel but on Saturday night it seems like everything in this district is closed. Even McDonalds, can you believe it! We wanted a simple meal out and couldnt find one on foot that didnt involve seafood. We gave up and found a Subway open near the Ferry Building in the end, and walking around at that time of night in an empty neighbourhood was not a great experience.

The queen rooms aren't huge, but are certainly comfortable enough and the bathrooms are quite large even in this smaller room category. The absolutely spectacular view, taking in the \"greatest hits\" of San Francisco--Transamerica Pyramid, Coit Tower, Alcatraz, and the Golden Gate--makes the room feel larger. From my room, I could lie in bed and look at the GG in the distance. I also had a perfectly-framed view of the fireworks down at the Embarcadero. The lobby is smallish, but the greeting staff is top-notch and you will feel like a cherished guest every time you enter or exit. The lounge is just off the lobby and can't quite escape its '80s layout, but there is a great deal of seating so you could usually get a quiet table. Bar staff is professional and attentive. Dinner at Silks, tucked away by itself on the 2nd floor, was a relaxed, calming, and delicious evening. The restaurant's more of a lunch spot, so evenings tend to be quiet. The chef's tasting menu was wonderfully creative and had four well-sized courses plus three amuse-bouche servings, including a post-dessert combo of hot chocolate and bitter German beer that was an innovative meal-ender. I had figured the price was so good on the holiday because of the Financial District location being a bit off the usual tourist path. However, I found the location to be quite convenient. It was a five-minute walk from the Montgomery St. BART station, a ten-minute walk from the Ferry Building [you must try Cowgirl Creamery], and ten-minute walk [straight up] to Nob Hill. If you're a hotel junkie like me, you can explore the Fairmont [lethal rum drinks at the Tonga Room], the Mark Hopkins, the Ritz-Carlton, and the Huntington all in one easy loop once on Nob Hill. Other SF must-dos: Dinner at Gary Danko will leave you reaching for superlatives; Cafe Claude is a nifty French bistro on the edge of Chinatown; a bay cruise under the Golden Gate bridge is awe-inspiring. All in all, even with the many great hotels in SF, I would feel very comfortable returning to the Mandarin Oriental.

You feel special every time you walk in. After service and hospitality the next best thing is... the views. This hotel has the best views of San Francisco you have ever seen and an upgrade to a room with a Golden Gate view is well worth it. The views are indescribable. I knew what to expect, but it still takes my breath away, my girlfriend had not been and was, as I anticipated, stunned! As I did on my first visit, she sat and drank in the views for an hour after we arrived :-) I do love the place and will always try to visit if and when I am in the area although I would note there are one or two very small niggles starting to appear. I doubt they will remain for long and do not spoil anything but things like the heat lamp timer in the bathroom being from the 80's and the TV speaker in the bathroom not working were surprising. But Ia) who really needs those things and b) I repeat... the hotel is still fantastic! The turn down service is wonderful and when you return in the evening it feels like home (although I urge you to open the curtains again to take in the sensational night time city view).

They were very loud and entered and exited their room several times before departure. The clock alarm also went off at 5:00 a.m. so I guess the last guest forgot to turn it off. I finally took the battery out since I couldn't figure out how to turn it off at 5:00 a.m. in the dark. Minus these few events which the hotel had no control of we had a great stay. I would advise that some local restaurants were closed when we arrived. I believe that since this is a business area that some small restaurants are closed on the weekends. This is not a big deal since you will want to experience the wonderful restaurants in other parts of the city especially Micheal Mina at the Westin St. Francis. Hands down my favorite restaurant.

The hotel itself is in the business district but the area had quite a lot of parking which was a bonus. We decided to take full advantage of our room so didn't venture out into the surrounding area, however as we were there on a Sunday night everything seemed very quiet when we drove in. The ground floor reception area is nice, clean, modern and well decorated with a very polite reception staff who booked us in quickly and with no fuss. The ground floor has a nice bar/lounge area where they serve lovely cocktails, a great variety of wines and delicious (complimentary) snacks of nuts and olives. I have to admit that my one reservation about staying here was also the main reason for the stay - the height. The room was on the 42nd floor which gave it such beautiful and stunning views (from the large windows as well as the glass walled corridors) but also meant a long elevator ride, which for a claustrophobic was quite a daunting prospect. Thankfully, the elevators are large and airey and speed directly to the 40th floor (they don't stop before this as the first 39 floors are offices) so the experience was pretty painless! The rooms themselves are wonderful with large, comfortable beds and sparkling, well laid out bathrooms. We ordered room service and spent the evening eating incredible stone baked pizzas and drinking champage whilst admiring the view and it is an experience I would highly recommend. The complimentary binoculars were very much appreciated and came in handy for zooming in on Alcatraz and the Bridges.

It took 35 minutes for the doorman to get a cab for us. We learned later that the hotel promotes a car service that they bill directly and as a result cabbies are reluctant to service them. What we discovered later was the car service, billed through them was double the price of booking it on your own. After returning from dinner we opened the door to our room and a tremendous amount of particles rained down upon us from the vvent located directly above the door. Our clothes literally looked as if we had been out in snow. The particles were also pulled through the room creating a layer of dust over everything.

He also assured us that the room would be thoroughly cleaned the next day. For our inconvenience we were to receive breakfast and an adjustment to our $610.00 rate.

I've stayed in the Four Seasons and the Ritz and many other hotels in SF. Four Seasons may have better rooms in terms of architecture and the modern facility, but the location is not desirable (too many homeless wandered nearby and didn't feel safe at night). Nothing stands out at the Ritz; it has no view and its location is mediocre; services were good but the decor is a bit stuffy, old school like, typical of the Ritz chain. The view, services, and location at the MO makes it the best choice for me. I stayed at the Bridge to Bridge View room in July 2006 and the Golden Gate Bridge Mandarin King in August 2007. The main difference is that the Mandarin King has a bathroom with the tub by a large window with fantastic view. From the 48th floor, watching clouds rolling in below us and birds flying by the window, we felt like we were in an airplane. The sky bridge on every floor provides panoramic view of the entire city. Check out my photos for the amazing view. The services at the MO are always top notch. It's not the kind of hotel to nickel and dime its guests (unlike many other five star hotels). The business center offers computers with free internet access and printing (FS and the Ritz charge like $10 for 15 minutes). Also, I called up the room service to inquire about the name of the complementary wine we received upon arrival and was instead offered another complementary bottle. Housekeeping services were good and discreet. Its location is the best compared to the the FS and the Ritz. It's close to Embarcadero and the clock tower, next to a cable car line and the Bart station, within walking distance to Chinatown and the downtown shopping area. The food from the room services were quite good but the taxes, services charges, and gratuity accounted for a third of the bill. I didn't like the fact the the invoice include both 18% gratuity and services charges of $2.5/person, it seems like double charging but at least it's disclosed properly.

The hotel is the best hotel that we have ever experienced - truly a 5 star. We were fortunate to have a room on the corner of the 45 floor and the views of the bay and city were spectacular. I cannot imagine any better views within the city. This was our first trip to explore San Francisco and we could not have been more pleased with our hotel experience. Room - outstanding from every perspective! The size of the room is huge - a spacious seating area with chairs and sofa, desk for business or internet use with an incredible view of the city all the way to Monster field. The hotel even provides binoculars to provide a close up view of all the city and the room has three large windows that almost provide panoramic views. The decor of the room is gold and black asian theme that is very tasteful and well done. The room is so spacious in ever way including the closet, built-ins for luggage, and a very large bathroom. The room has a large LG LCDTV that swivels for the entire viewing from any angle. A DVD player is also provided along with CD/radio for music and alarm. The window treatments were awesome in that there was a transparent screen and blinds with the Mandarin logo for allowing light in, but shielding the sun at the same time. The windows do open which was nice to allow some air into the room, but also allowed in some noise from the city below. Nice touch, but I would not think that many would open windows 45 floors up... The bed is elevated to allow you to enjoy the views out of the windows from the bed and the bedding is top notch. I normally do not sleep well in hotels when traveling, but this bed and bedding provided the best night's sleep ever - outstanding! The bathroom was quite large with separate large shower, tub, and plenty of space for everything. All of the accessories that you could imagine are provided down to the bathroom scales. Every detail was well planned and executed to the light switches for turning on/off lamps beside the bed. Everything was at your fingertips including a single remote control that controlled multiple electronic devices. We were delivered hot tea and cookies of our choice upon check-in. Turndown service provides house shoes, cloth on the floor for stepping into an out of bed, robes, window treatments closed, turndown, music, etc. the list goes on - dimmers on all lights, etc. Other minor details - the iron was the best ever at a hotel - high quality every place - marble and stainless in the bathroom, the soap and shampoo, etc. The elevator was extremely fast and the walk from the elevator across the bridge or connector provides the best views in the city - bay and city views - fabulous! I used the workout facility and it was very nice - TVs on the equipment with headphones provided - my only complaint for the workout facility was the treadmills did not provide any space to hold a bottle of water - you had to place on the floor which caused interruption in workout to stoop and get a bottle of water... They provided chilled water, apples, bananas, plenty of towels, very nice equipment with the exception of the treadmills as noted. The staff were very nice and would do everything to accommodate our requests. The concierge made Alcatraz reservations and made very good dinner recommendations outside of their hotel restaurant - Silks. We wanted to experience some of the other places for meals and did not dine at Silks within the hotel. Cons - valet parking is $50 per day - very pricey, but about the norm in San Fran. For the price of the daily room rate - it should include high speed internet - I think requiring additional $12.95 per day is ridiculous since every thing else is incredible. First impression - the lobby does not provide the overall first impression that you would expect from a 5 star hotel, but wait until you get off the elevator and move to a room before you judge the hotel. This hotel does not the have the marvelous lobby of the Fairmont per se, but the rooms are out of this world as compared to any other hotel in the city.

The service at the Mandarin was impeccable, the room was fabulous, the staff courteous and perfect. We had a bridge-to-bridge view room which allowed us to see the entire bay from the Bay Bridge to the Golden Gate. The only obstruction was the Transamerica Pyramid which was very close by. Our room was on a corner and had huge windows. You could lie in bed (watching the big flat-screen TV) and see the skyline. The one drawback to our type of room, high up with great views, was that no one wants to close their curtains. If you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t careful you can see other people in their rooms, and they can see you. This is just something to be aware of. I mean, the room comes with binoculars so it is no surprise that a bit of people watching occurs. The bathroom was quite nice.

Service is absolutely top notch, and I find one of the reviews below which says you are treated as number in a computer curious at the very least and downright slanderous at worst. The staff goes out of their way to address you by name and provide as much or as little service as you wish. The criticisms of the bathrooms, however, are quite accurate. They were not refurbished in the recent remodeling and should have been. (One pet peeve is that the towels are not as luxurious as other luxury hotels I have stayed in, but that's sort of a minor issue.) The only other criticism I have is that while the TV's have all been updated and are plasma screens, the hotel has no movies on demand (yet, I am told). Other than the above, you will find finely appointed rooms, friendly and accomodating staff, and some of the best food in the city at Silks, the onsite restaurant. While some below criticize the size of the public areas, you should keep in mind this is a boutique hotel with no more than 110 rooms. That is a plus if you are looking for excellent service, as the small size allows the staff to attend to the guests. The lounge and bar are well-appointed and service is phenomenal. Other criticize the small workout room, but the fact is, it is seldom used and it is like having your own personal gym. Moreover, passes to Equinox Health Club & Spa across the street are available, as well as passes to numerous other health clubs throughout the city.

This is essentially a boutique property, with a small lobby, lounge and restaurant on the first two floors of a high rise, with the rooms at the top of the tower. The public areas are small, and good looking enough, but for some reason feel very impersonal, and lack lounging space. The rooms, while not large, are not too small, but are beautifully decorated in a mixture of European and Asian furniture. The bedrooms are essentially like jewel boxes in the sky, and the views are breathtaking. The bathrooms, as other have noted, look a bit worse for the wear, but have a separate soaking tub and shower, which seems to be where the 5 stars try to break from the 4 star chain hotels. The baths, while spotless, apparently were not renovated with the rest of the rooms ... they have that \"glamorous\" 1980s look -- chunky beige and pink marble with gold fixtures. I suspect the baths have had little change since the hotel opened in 1987. The service, as one anticipates, was very, very good -- from the welcome tea service to the friendly and informative desk and door people.

The doormen went above and beyond for any of our needs and I give them credit for learning my name and remembering to call me by name every time I entered or exited. Something I don't ask for but certainly is nice to hear. The one concierge (male) was very nice and helpful, recommending and even making reservations at different restaurants that are unique to San Francisco. Although I did think that the female concierge could of been a bit more attentive when my wife's heel strap broke on our way out one night. There was no recommendation of shoe repair, though it was late and I doubt one would of been open. The best she came up with was pointing us to the mall down the street. Just nitpicking, but she didn't go above and beyond by any means. Overall a great hotel and upon departure my Hertz rental car was brought to the front door and bags placed in them by the wonderful doormen.", "Date": "April 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans, LA", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "nolatravel", "ReviewID": "UR4595637", "Content": "Knew of the views of this hotel and the glass walled hallways that face north and south between the two hotel \"towers\" on the upper floors of a multi-use building.

The staff at Mandarin Oriental treated their guests as if they were very important people. Our wedding's ceremony and reception were held in Mandarin Oriental's Library Room. We stayed at the hotel but our guests and family members stayed in a different place downtown. Afterward, our children wanted to go back to their hotel so they asked the desk staff to order them a cab. \"No, you don't need a cab; our limo will take you anywhere you want to go.\" The desk staff replied. At the time, our children were not very polished if you judged them from their appearance. They were the typical college students who lived in (and sometimes even slept in) their jeans, T-shirts, and track shoes. They were intelligent, polite, and articulate, but they were not preppy and definitely not the limo-rider kind. They were also not Mandarin Oriental's guests, but that fact did not matter to the staff. Everyone treated them with respect and courtesy. Every room in the hotel has panoramic view because of the floor-to-ceiling windows and because this all-glass hotel is the third highest building in The City. There are different views available with different room series. In every room, there is Frette linen, thick and soft bathrobes, his and her slippers, and high quality bath products. Evening service includes fresh fruit plate brought to room. Limo service is gratuity to guests (and in our case, family members of guests).

We selected the hotel largely based on the review of this site and we were not disappointed. We had arranged for a town car to collect us from the airport through Virgin and this more than likely put us in a great mood as it was an excellent welcome to a fantastic city. The doorman was waiting to great us by name (we still haven't figured out how they knew who we were) and instantly made us feel like royalty. The check-in staff were so friendly, again using my name and making me feel valued as a customer (some will say at $500+ a night they should but you certainly get more than you pay for) and we were upgraded from the Bay to Bay view room we had booked to a suite with sunken bath in the window and much greater floor space. We were introduced to one of the concierge team who made reservations for us at a local restaurant after which we were escorted to our room. I believe that first impressions (certainly when it comes to hotels) count a lot and our first impression of the room was excellent. The room was light and airy and the views were breathtaking - on the days when the famous San Francisco fog took a break you could see for miles - our room had views of the Bay Bridge as well as the Transamerica Pyramid - we couldn't see the Golden Gate Bridge but this was shrouded in fog for the majority of our stay so no great loss (you will see it constantly when you are out and about on the multitude of tours available). The room was incredibly clean and tidy, a complimentary set of binoculars enhance the view and the tv is a decent size and hidden away in a cabinet - it could do with updating as many similar priced hotels have larger and flatter screens but we didn't come to watch tv!). The bed was incredibly comfortable, with more cushions and pillows than a soft furnishing store which all added to the sense of opulance and luxury. Also in the room were a selection of comfy chairs which were really handy after long walks taking in the sights. One of my favourite aspects of the suite was the bathroom - it was massive, luxurious and had one of the best hotel showers I have come across. The walk in shower had enough room for about six people (I haven't actually tested this statement!) and the power was excellent especially given the fact that we were on the 38th floor. Two Mandarin embroidered robes were provided - they were a little on the small side - as well as slippers. The toileteries were E'sporta which my wife advise me are very good, combined with some fab bath salts and a Bonsai tree next to the bath. Again the views from the bathroom and the sunken bath were breathtaking especially at night. We had a turn-down service every evening, the robes were laid out on the bed, water provided, relaxing music played and bedside mats and slippers placed at the side of the bed. The hotel gym is fine for a quick workout with plenty of cardio machines, free weights and fixed weight equipment. I was the only person using the gym for much of my stay - a bonus of visiting the gym are the complimentary bottles of water and fruit. Transfer time (by town car) from the airport is around 25-30 minutes. The hotel is located perfectly - the California cable car line is only a short walk from the hotel, with Union Square around a 10 minute walk. Also nearby is Chinatown - an excellent experience with some superb restaurants. We never ate at the hotel as we were more often out but I can recommend the local Deli's for breakfast. The Mandarin Oriental San Francisco is not the cheapest hotel by any means but if you want a really special experience where you are made to feel like a king and queen then this is the hotel for you.

As others have noted, there isn't a better view in town - lying in my bed (I was in a Bridge to Bridge Room) I could see just about every notable attraction in town - the bridges, Coit Tower, Alcatraz, etc., etc. etc. However, this is where the greatness in this hotel ends. Though I usually stay at the Four Seasons when I vacation, I decided that I ought to give the Mandarin a shot - hey, AAA Five Diamond, Mobile 5 Star - it can't be that bad.......let's find out: A stain on the bed sheet; pink gum on the top left door of the bathroom stall; foot prints on the carpet; mug stains on the marble around the sink and on a coffee table; a turn down service that was so insistent on getting the job done that they returned twice within an hour (the last time forcing themselves into the room as I dressed for the evening); a lobby and lounge staff about as personable as a paper weight; a doorman that was on his cell phone more often than he opened the door; and a concierge staff that said they would call me to follow up on an inquiry and forgot one too many times. These unmentionables were during the first two days - at which point I started complaining to my wife - telling her that we had made a mistake in the hotel we had chosen and that this hotel didn't hold a candle to the Four Seasons. I'm not one to publicly complain, but this deserved it, and my wife, without me knowing it, went down to the lobby, pulled a manager into the lounge, and in a very nice manner, without any of the aforementioned detail, summed it up for the manager by saying that the place sucked! The manager proceeded to offer my wife breakfast, a discount, etc. My wife refused everything, which she said surprised the manager. But, we weren't looking for handouts - we were looking for the level of service and attention to detail that we had expected when booking a hotel company that claims that it can and does deliver (and which I and many of you had read about and which I personally had heard about from some of my wife's colleagues who have stayed at their hotels in Asia). Well, over the next two days the level of service did a 180 - not just for us, but noticibly for everyone else as well! For us, the hotel town car, which hadn't been offered before - was now at our becking call; our names were used regularly upon entrance into and from the hotel; the front door was sprinted to as anyone approached; and we got reservations, on fairly short notice, to two of the city's hottest restaurants - Slanted Door and Betelnut. In summary, I guess I left wondering why this hadn't been the case from the moment we got there. If it had been, I wouldn't have written a few of the above paragraphs. This can be a phenomenal hotel with a few modern updates to the rooms, the fitness and business centers (sorry, fitness and business closets), and complete consistency in service. Maybe I was there on a bad week, but hopefully, we did everyone staying there from now on a favor - I doubt it though - excellence isn't sporadic and I am pondering on whether I should give them another fat chunk of my wallet at another one of their hotels/resorts.

On the negative side, a few minor things. First, there are only 2 elevators which made for a couple minutes of waiting from time to time (usually not a problem). Also, the gym is very small and on the 4th floor with no windows which isn't ideal and not what I'm used to at other MO's (DC and NYC) which have much larger gyms with views and a pool (DC at least) - no pool here (unlike the Ritz and Four Seasons). And the hotel lobby is nice but pretty understated and small so don't expect a grand entrance - the location and views are what you pay for here. I will come back to this hotel, but as I'm a big exerciser I think that the Ritz and Four Season are also great choices if you want a larger gym and pool.

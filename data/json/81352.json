David Birt, the manager, was so helpful from my very first email asking for prices, and this friendliness/helpfulness continued right throughout our stay. My family (me, husband, 5 kids aged 5-12) stayed in a 1 bedroom family suite which had 2 queen beds in the bedroom, a fold out sofa in the lounge, and full kitchen. David allowed us to have an additional trundle bed in the living area for no extra charge. The room whilst not overly large was certainly perfectly adequate for our stay of 6 nights with a large group. The beds were excellent, the room was clean and well maintained - the cleaning staff even made up the kids beds putting their teddy bears on the middle of the pillows - lovely personal touch. The kitchen had full range and stove and microwave - we brought a lot of groceries and made our own meals without any problems. We thought that the free breakfast was fantastic - waffles (kids loved being able to make these themselves - David even made them some as he wandered through the breakfast room one morning as the waffles had stuck and he helped the kids scrape it off, got the machine oiled and then made them a replacement). Other items were cereal, bagels, toast, hard boiled eggs, coffee, hot chocolate, juice, fresh fruit, muffins and pastries. We had our breakfast later in the morning around 9.30am and never had a problem with the breakfast room being full. Free wi-fi worked fine, laundry facilities were a big bonus for us - not having to hunt down a laundromat around the motel. There is a pool that the kids used, and also a bbq in the pool area which we used also. Yes, it is located away from the main tourist areas of San Diego, however we had a rental car and found it very easy to get to where we wanted to go and most places only took about 20 minutes.

There is a nice little breakfast set up (pastries, bagels, cereal and make your own waffles) served until 10am every morning. Its a great way to start the day and save a bit of money on food. We stayed in a suite which was very spacious (small sitting room with a pullout couch and then an attached room with a nice sided bed) and perfect for me, my husband and our young son (there's no door between the rooms - so don't look for privacy). One of the best features is Len - a member of staff at the hotel. He is very friendly, seems to know most everyone by their name and is a fount of information. We checked in daily with him for the scoop on things we were considering seeing. The only downside to the hotel is the location. Its not terrible - but its not a 'walking' friendly place. There are a lot of little local shops (drug stores, nail salons, that sort of thing) but nothing necessarily 'pretty' or tourist friendly places. That being said, it is very easy to get in a car and drive to many of main attractions of San Diego - and the staff is more than happy to give you driving information to them.

It doesn't have anything interesting (that I want) around it. It has a mortuary, a Rite-Aid, a tattoo shop, a bar called \"Effins\", and a place that had a menu in our room called \"Cheba Hut\". Needless to say we drove out of our way to look for shopping and better food. I was happy that our room had a microwave and fridge, but we only used the fridge for our bottled water. The bathrroms are hilariously small. I laughed at the toilet because the opening is too small to use. It doesn't accomodate a large butt. When we got into our room we did the thing we always do....lift the mattress and check for bed bugs. We noticed under each mattress had extra sheets or blankets under the mattress. Under the second mattress we noticed blood or a \"red stained substance\" on the sheet underneath the mattress. The leg on the table by the doof was about to break off. It was bent inwards like it was about to snap off. I moved it back in its original position so the table wouldn't collapse. Walking on the carpet turned my feet black. It looked like someone seriously cracked the front of the sink, but there was a line where it was glued together, so the motel made an attempt to fix that. When I took a hot shower in the morning I didn't get enough hot water. It ran out about 8-10 minutes into the shower. The steps going up to the second floor by room 218 were burned out at night ao it was very dark. Please fix that. i almost mis-stepped and fell. It's a small parking lot and very tight parking. The walls are very thin. I could hear arguments, conversations, tv's, toilets flushing and showering through them. Also, if get a room on the bottom floor...be prepared to have headlights shining through your window when a car parks. Headlights are at eye level with the motel windows. All in all, I think the people who own this motel try very hard to make this a nice place. There's a dog park behind the motel. They have a continental breakfast in the morning, but I didn't use it.

I noticed kids playing in the swimming pool, which seemed to me to be a lovely thing for families, although I did not take advantage of that ammenity. What I really enjoyed was the quiet. Remember, I said that there were kids and families...well, I've been to hotels where the kids run amuck stommping up and down the halls, and this hotel was NOT one of those!! It was quiet! After brutal days of slogging through thousands of people, what a pleasure to come home to a quiet and restful place! If I have to \"downgrade\" at all, I would say that the breakfast area was incredibly small. It is uncomfortable to have more than a couple of families at any one time in that area, so I hope that eventually they will consider expanding.

Len did credit us with half off of that night's stay and genuinely seemed concerned. The other two nights were quiet and peaceful. I believe the event that first night was unusual for the hotel. -The facility is kept very clean - I am speaking here of the grounds and pool area, as well as the rooms themselves. The housekeeping head seemed to really care about the state of the property and our experience. -The pool is not large but is open 7am-10pm and is heated. -The breakfast was basic (no meats) but a nice touch given it was free. The waffles, in particular, were very tasty. -My only caveat is that the walls in the rooms are very thin. If you are a light sleeper or happen to get a loud neighbor (e.g. who might play the tv at a high volume until late) it could make for a tough night. We did not experience that, however, as our neighbors were decent. -The cost of the hotel (less than $100 during the week) is fantastic in relation to the overall experience. We found it a very reasonable drive (15-20 minutes) to the zoo and other attractions.", "Date": "February 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cGood, clean hotel in conventient location\u201d", "Author": "juniorjetclub", "ReviewID": "UR56364686", "Content": "Len, do you work 24/7?!

I can only say, I'm so impressed with this modestly sized and modestly priced motel, I was moved to write a review while still here. Although not in the tourist areas of San Diego, it's very convenient to SDSU, and moreover, easy on/off at 70th St. exit to I-8, which makes it simple to get just about anywhere from here. The Spanish-style buildings evoke a 40's era film set in Los Angeles, a very positive \"retro\" effect in the best sense of these words. The grounds are beautiful; the pool very well maintained, the rooms clean, simple, nice. Any contact with mgmt is very friendly, supportive, highly service-oriented, intelligent. And they remember returning guests in a way that no large hotel could manage. They can't do enough to ensure a very pleasant stay for their guests.

Unfortunately there was no fridge/microwave in the room. But there is the usual ironing equipment. Large counter with small sink is in the back of the room. Bathroom was very tiny with tub and toilet, hardly any space to turn around. Enough towels provided, as well as shampoo and soap. There is a hair dryer as well. All clean and looking new. The only problem I had was the beds. They are too soft and old and one night I could not sleep at all, getting back aches. Most horrible beds we ever had! That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I never would come back again. They have a cozy pool in the court which is right on the parking lot and surrounded by plants and trees so you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the expression, it is on the parking lot. Nice place! Seems to be heated. No jacuzzi though. In the back of the buildings (2 complexes) is a guest laundry and even a tiny dog meadow. Wifi-Internet is free but did work only for a few hours, after that we never got connected anymore. But they have a free computer to use in the lobby. So no problem at all. Breakfast room is too small, only a few tables cramped in there and not enough space on one morning. We had to take our food to the room that morning. The next we found a place in the breakfast room which was ok. Small variety of food but ok.

Let me take a quick second to address the supposed thinness of the walls. We had zero problems with noise from neighboring rooms, outside cars, pool noise or TV's. The Lamplighter Inn should be your absolute top choice for a stay in San Diego. Plus the rooms were under $100/night. A++ value !

Slow in the early evening hours when perhaps many other guests were sharing the wireless link. Laundry - Was very convenient to have on premise laundry. We took full advantage of this.

My husband and I walked around the block one morning and saw a fraternity/sorority row and a neighborhood. For our purposes, location was just fine. We drove all over the place for the 5 days we were there (La Jolla, Del Mar, Sea World, Zoo, Wild Animal Park) so it was a fine home base location.

Our room was extremely clean and kept that way by housekeeping throughout our stay. Generally the whole place is kept really nicely, everything in its place, clean, organised, smart and presentable. The pool and parking area with the grass and palm trees are very pleasant and given the space available I don't see how they could be made better. Our suite had 2 queen beds in one room then a door to the sitting room with armchair and sofa bed. TV,s in both rooms. Wash basin just outside bathroom, nice powerful shower with un-ending hot water. Full kitchen with everything you really need but not more. There was plenty of room for my partner and I for our extended stay which was why we booked the suite so we would not be couped up. Beds were very comfortable. The breakfast room is small but we always managed to find somewhere to sit if we wanted to, just had to wait a few minutes a couple of mornings. Breakfast was very nice with plenty of choice, the waffles are good and the coffee is ok to start you off in the morning. Parking was easy, we had no problems at all getting a space almost right outside our room everytime. As far as the people at the Lamplighter are concerned there are to kinds. 1st the staff who we found to be warm, friendly, welcoming, hospitable, professional, helpful and informative in all of our contact with them, they cannot be faulted. 2nd the other guests who in the overwhelming majority were just ordinary folk. However as will be found wherever you go there was a rogue few percent who had little consideration for others. These ones slammed doors, talked / shouted loud and late, left a mess on the breakfast room floor and their table full of rubbish for someone else to clear. As mentioned previously these were the exception and not at all the norm. If you get one of the noisy ones next door to you it does show up the walls as being rather thin. We have stayed at many places with higher star ratings than the Lamplighter and have been dissapointed at some of them. The opposite is true at the Lamplighter where the 2 star rating does not do it justice, it really deserves a third star.

Our choice was based solely on \"Tripadvisor\" ratings, following a very last minute change in our vacation plans (flying in from Vancouver BC). I can say unequivocally that we do not regret our decision. This is a small but well managed establishment. Rooms are clean (which is the most important factor in selecting a hotel). Staff are very courteous and helpful. The reception area is not 5 star but it does have a computer with free internet access. We had no problem whatsoever with the (free) parking; maybe a bit tight if you drive an unusually large vehicle. The hotel is NOT located in the immediate vicinity of major San Diego attractions like the beaches, the zoo, Balboa Park, the \"old\" San Diego, Legoland and SeaWorld but it's right off the interstate and with a GPS, a no-brainer to get around. The first night, we had noisy neighbors and we could smell cigarette smoke in our supposedly non-smoking room. However, we were promptly moved (read \"upgraded\") to a better room the very next morning. The general manager, David Birt, was quite accommodating. No questions asked. BTW, I strongly recommend a room with fridge and microwave, especially if you're with kids. Noteworthy is the fact that there is a VON's supermarket a few blocks away where you will find everything you might need. After a long day on the road, we thoroughly enjoyed their roasted chicken brought back to our room with a glass of wine! Also, there is a delivery pizza nearby called \"Milo's\". Their pizza is top notch. The breakfast is quite basic, as described in other reviews, but OK to start the day. Waffles, cereal, muffins, bagels, toast, boiled eggs, the usual continental breakfast suspects. The room where it is served is indeed quite small and you may have to wait for a table (we did) or else bring the food back to your room; better yet, eat it by the pool. There are two Starbucks nearby where you can have a better coffee than the one served (really quite watery). Bottom line: for the price, you're not likely to find better value in the San Diego area.

I decided to give them a call and spoke to someone at 2:00 a.m. their time. To my surprise the night clerk was very pleasant, knowledgeable and gave me a fantastic AARP rate. In less than 10 minutes I had an e-mail confirmation for my reservation. So far, so good. As I approached the Lamplighter I passed San Diego State and realized that the motel would be in a working-class/business neighborhood. Okay with me. There were a number of restaurants nearby and a couple of supermarkets. Mission Valley, for shopping, was only about 6 miles away on I-8. As I pulled in I noticed that the motel was very neat and clean. All of the employees seemed in motion doing something, and several of them were cleaning. We came over on a red-eye and arrived at about noon. I met Len, one of the managers, and he promptly checked my family in early. The room was good-sized, very clean, the furniture and fixtures looked new. Most impressive was that the bathroom was sparkling and there was a Delta massaging shower head that I had seen in a 4-star hotel in the bath/shower--a very nice touch. Better yet, the water flow was strong with lots of hot water--unlike many of the hotels that put those terrible water-saving low-flow shower heads on. A welcome relief to a weary traveler. The beds were very comfortable--better than a lot of hotels costing twice as much. Very important. When I discovered that there was no refrigerator in our room I asked Len about the possibility of getting a room with one. No problem--he had one delivered to our room the next day. The hotel is centrally located. We used it as a jumping off point to visit the Zoo, Wild Animal Park, Legoland (twice), and even Knott's Berry farm. Freeway access is very easy. Hop onto I-8 then you can get to I-15 or the 405 and get anywhere. The best part of the Lamplighter is the staff. Now I know how they got their #2 rating for San Diego area hotels/motels. Dave and Len, the managers, and all of the help were truly nice and friendly. Everyone said hi with a smile and made us feel welcome. Every hour of daylight was used cleaning, fixing, or doing something that made the place nice. Fresh towels on the pool chaises. A nice size pool that was very clean. Immaculate. Breakfast was better than the usual continental fare. It is basic with a couple of nice waffle machines, 3 choices of dry cereals, an assortment of bagels and pastry, fruits, juices, milk, and coffee and it is well-stocked. This definitely saves you time and money in the morning, and they are open until 10:00 a.m., not the usual 9:00 a.m. closing. The staff made great suggestions on places to eat such as the Casa Machado 2 doors away. We had dinner there for 4 out of 6 nights. When you tell them the Lamplighter sent you the service gets even better. The people at the Lamplighter were nicer than staff at a good number of 4-star hotels that I have stayed at. The bottom line is that you could pay a lot more and get a lot less. If Macy's had customer service half as good at the Lamplighter, Nordstroms would be out of business. Aloha from Hawaii.

Plenty of leaflets in the lobby and there is a PC with internet access which was very useful. Not much in terms of restaurants within close walking distance, but a short drive up El Cajon Blvd we found Woodstock's Pizza which became a favourite. There are plenty of shops within short driving distance to stock up with beers and refreshments and we made good use of the fridge in the room. I would classify this as an excellent Motel in the suburbs of San Diego. If you are looking for a 5 star Hotel in the city centre with room service, bell boys and all the trimmings of luxury then this will not fit the bill. It is located close to the main highway so excellent access for trips into Downtown San Diego and the brilliant Zoo. One tip is to park at the Old Town for free and get the Trolley into San Diego where kids travel for free. This trolley route goes onwards to Tijuana and makes for a great day out. It was also very good starting point for our next stop in Anza-Borrego via the excellent DZ Akins deli which was located just before we joined the highway Our family of four had a great stay and would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in the San Diego area.", "Date": "April 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Oswego, OR", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "osuguy10", "ReviewID": "UR15171915", "Content": "My family stayed at this hotel last week and the reviews are correct.

I had booked the room because I wanted to have a room large enough for 2 adults and 3 teenagers. The room has a large kitchen, foldout couch, tv , full bathroom and the adjoing room has 2 queen beds and a tv. After staying several nights in a Hampton Inn , which we paid $151 a night , and then staying here for $143 a night I think that they are charging too much. The pillows are very small and flat but the beds were comfortable. The breakfast area is well staffed but the eating area is very small. Most people were getting something to eat and taking it to their room. The only hot foods were waffles and instant oatmeal. The door to the breakfast room was left open to the outside so I can see it would be easy for insects coming straight into the room. If that door is to remain open then I would suggest adding a screen door. The hotel staff is extremely polite and helpful.

It is not great value for the money; it is simply an inexpensive motel, with nothing special or remarkable to recommend it. It is located on a busy street in a marginal neighborhood. The \"lush landscaping\" of the grounds consists of a few palm trees dotting the parking lot which makes up most of the site, and a patch of grass by the small pool (separated from the parking lot by only an iron fence). We booked a room with a kitchen because it happened to be the best rate available. The room was large in area, but so badly laid out and drearily decorated that it felt cramped and depressing (the kitchen was a total waste of space, especially since it wasn't stocked with cookware or dishes- the cupboards and drawers were completely empty). The furniture was ugly and drab. The room was not well sound-proofed; each time our upstairs neighbors took a step, it sounded like elephants were marching across the ceiling. The bathroom was fortunately very clean, but the polyester-blend bath towels were thin and not very absorbent, and left a flurry of lint everywhere. The complimentary breakfast did feature a good selection of pastries, cereals, waffles, juices and fruit, but the pastries were stale and tasteless and the coffee (in styrofoam cups) was bad. The Lamplighter is by no means a dump or a dive; it was clean, and the one staff member we dealt with on check-in and check-out was polite and efficient.

Impressed by all the positive reviews on tripadvisor, I originally booked for 10 nights. However, before getting there I was a little bit skeptical because I wondered how a relatively inexpensive Best Western hotel could make it to the top five hotels in San Diego, but I was to find out soon enough. Almost everything about this hotel turned out to be awesome. When I arrived, I was upgraded to an upper-floor room with full kitchen, which was pretty spacious and comfortable. Additionally, the room included an iron/ironing board, hair dryer, coffee maker, microwave plus lots of complimentary items - amenities that you usually don't find in hotels in this price range. They also provided dishes, pans, and other kitchen utensils free of charge. Although the hotel is located at El Cajon Blvd, which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a busy street but not a side road either, I didn't notice any disturbing street noise. I also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t experience any problems finding a parking space close to my room. Some people might argue that the hotel is not that close to downtown, but then again it is very close to San Diego State University and other interesting venues, so I found it to be an ideal location for me. Breakfast, which was offered between 6 and 10 a.m., was way better than you would expect it to be at a regular Best Western hotel. The breakfast bar was well-stocked with appealing choices, which included waffles, a nice variety of cereals, fresh fruit and assorted pastries. Complimentary coffee was offered in the lobby throughout the day. Although I have never been in the pool it looked very nice and fresh towels were put out every day. The most important thing for me, however, was that the hotel was absolutely clean and that everyone who worked there always strived to provide prompt and outstanding service. Housekeeping was simply amazing, they would rather replace a towel that had not been used or put an extra piece of soap than forget to replace anything. Last but not least, I have to thank all at Best Western Lamplighter Inn (which includes, but is not limited to Len, the amazing front office manager who goes out of his way to give you a pleasant stay) for their help in facilitating my transition to the US and for making my stay a time to remember. I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to spend hundreds of dollars a night, but also doesn't want to compromise quality for money.

This is THE hotel to choose if you are bringing any pets with you, as the property caters to pets (there is a little pet area at the end of the property, away from the main street). We booked this trip along with a cruise from our well trusted travel agent and he has definitely gained our loyalty after this trip, as the price was right and the value immeasurable.", "Date": "December 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fresno CA", "Title": "\u201cHad a Great Stay!

This was our first trip to San Diego and we weren't quite sure about the neighborhoods, and I must admit I was a bit hesitant given the great deal we received for a room with a kitchen and the extra for our dog. We were not at all disappointed!!!! The rooms were basic, but clean (the most important thing to most!) There was a queen bed and sofa bed so plenty of room for my husband, daughter and me. Our room had a full kitchen, complete with fridge, stove and microwave. Great setup! The complimentary breakfast was plenty to get us started in the morning; toast, cereal, oatmeal, boiled eggs, pastries and fruit were fine although I must admit I wasn't a big fan of the coffee. The pet area was a bit on the small side so we typically would take our dog for a walk in the morning to take care of her business. Many of the reviews reference the small breakfast area. It probably is much more crowded during the summer, but during Thanksgiving week, we had no problems with seating. For our visits to Sea World, the Zoo, Old Town and all the other touristy spots, the drive was roughly 15-20 minutes, more or less depending upon the time of day. It never seemed to take very long and was an easy drive with our GPS. Easy access on/off the freeways. We found parking at the hotel to be no problem. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit, especially if we bring our dog, as there aren't many nice, clean hotels/motels which allow dogs weighing more than 30 lbs (ours weighs 50+) Thanks, BW Lamplighter, for the wonderful stay!!!", "Date": "December 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cbargain break\u201d", "Author": "ashcan", "ReviewID": "UR11267076", "Content": "Chosen after looking at tripadvisor and not disappointed.

The pool was good , mad brits and englishman in at 2000, too cool for the locals but warm for us! Breakfast was basic , not the best we'd had consisting of cereal/toast/doughnuts.

Location is extremely convenient to metro San Diego attractions (less than five miles to San Diego Zoo / Balboa Park). This along with previous reviews is why I selected it. Property is relatively close to SDSU, so area has a college feel. Banks, eateries, supermarkets, drug stores, hospital, gas stations and freeway access points are all close at hand. The L&L Hawaiian BBQ place at the corner (of El Cajon and College) served great take-out fare. I will say that the area is older, and I wouldn't recommend wandering about alone too late in the evening. At check-in, the female desk clerk was pleasant, friendly, and provided great information. Check-out was less involved and less noteworthy. Property is older, but kept well, second level is stair access only, and exterior access room was clean, though the HVAC unit did give off a strange odor at times during operation. I did not sample the breakfast, or pool area, so have no opinion regarding these amenities. Parking stalls fill quickly at night and were quite narrow; I did worry about finding door dings on my new van, but smaller vehicles should manage. If you're looking to be impressed with your room at a higher rate, I recommend the brand new Residence Inn Oceanside, CA where I also stayed during this trip (convenient to Legoland, beaches, pier).

There are two small complaints: moldy bagels (which was fixed promptly) and difficult parking (we always found a spot, but sometimes it was at the other end of the parking lot). The breakfast bar, which is included in the price, is great! We went everymorning to have freshly made bagels.

Luckily I had cutlery and paper plates with me for use on picnics because although the kitchen has a cooker, fridge etc. - there is no equipment i.e. saucepan, plate etc. Our son had a kingsize room which had an ant invasion the morning after we arrived. I informed the desk before breakfast and was told it would be taken care of by housekeeping staff. After breakfast there were even more ants so I went back to reception. The manager apologised, gave our son an upgrade and a reduction in price for the inconvenience. All this was done in a very friendly manner. All in all the motel is very clean and the compimentary breakfast was fine. The pool was the best of all the hotels we stayed at this trip (6 in all) - the water temperature was perfect, it was big enough to swim lengths and a beautiful tree provided shade to sit under.

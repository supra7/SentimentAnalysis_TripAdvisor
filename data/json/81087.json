The Hyatt at Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf proved to be no exception during our recent overnight stay. The lobby was surprisingly small and seemed to be focused on being entirely functional. The decor was commercially bland and I have no recollection of any details that usually define hotel lobbies. Check-in was a breeze and the front desk personnel (as well as the valet we turned our vehicle over to) were friendly and efficient. My request for a check-out time that was 90 minutes later than standard was cheerfully granted. I had also requested a room in a quiet area of the hotel, and we were given one on the top (5th) floor in an area far from the elevators--which was fine, as the location was much quieter and we got a little exercise too! Our room #587 wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overly large, but it did feel spacious and bright with a bank of windows across the far wall. No attractive views as the room overlooked North Point and the large Holiday Inn Express building across the street. Decor was contemporary with interesting, large format graphic art on the walls. Colors were blue-greys and chocolate. The room was clean and fresh looking for the most part, altho\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 there was some worn paint on the desk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s edges and on the doors. The connecting door between our room and the next did allow conversations and TV in the neighboring room to be heard, but at night our room was pleasantly quiet and restful. No traffic sounds were evident. The King bed was quite comfortable. Our room also had a small L-shaped chaise/sofa, small coffee table, a long desk with a nice amount of workspace and multiple power outlets conveniently located above the desk top. (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m always surprised and annoyed that many hotel rooms require you to crawl around searching under furniture and drapes in order to access outlets). We had a 32\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd flat panel Samsung TV, clock radio/mp3/iPod player, and 2-line phone in our room. It was nice to have a larger-than-countersize freestanding refrigerator and a single-cup coffee maker--or any coffee maker for that matter, as so many hotels don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t include them in their rooms. There were 3 table lamps plus a floor lamp, and the lamps on the bedstands provided adequate light to read by (which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case in many hotels and inns). The thermostat-controlled heating, a/c system kept our room comfortable and we were able to just turn it off at night. Clothes hanging space was surprisingly minimal, with a very narrow area to accommodate longer garments and 2 deep drawers in place of a separate dresser or chest. There was an in-room safe, iron and full-size ironing board. The bathroom had marble flooring, counters and shower surround. There was an oversized, walk-in shower (no tub) which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an adjustable showerhead; the water sprayed down thru a grate from ceiling level. There was a fixed glass partition that extended about 60% across the shower area with the remaining area open--and that allowed water from the shower to seep out onto the floor. It was a very odd arrangement. Looked good, but wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t functional! Water pressure in the shower was fine, but in order to achieve a comfortable temperature I needed to turn the lever all the way to the hot side. The toilet worked efficiently. Bathroom counterspace was spacious. The single basin was very shallow but somehow didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow water to splash out--a nice design! There was a full-length mirror and a makeup mirror in addition to the mirrored wall above the counter. Lighting and ventilation were both good. A hairdryer was provided. We took a look at the outdoor pool (lap-type) and whirlpool which are located in a sheltered, somewhat austere courtyard area; checked the water temperature (nice), but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an opportunity to try them. The Hyatt has a wine bar and lounge on premises and a casual restaurant/sports bar (Knuckles). Resembling a chain coffee shop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interior, the restaurant just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look inviting enough to have breakfast at the next morning, so we instead walked a few blocks to the Blue Mermaid which is adjacent to the Argonaut Hotel. The Hyatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location was perfect for us as we planned to walk to Gary Danko for dinner and also walk to the Hyde Street Pier/Maritime Museum and Fort Mason the next morning. It was great to give up our car for the duration of our stay and the valet parking fee of $51 (inc. tax) was reasonable enough for being in San Francisco.

I led a two-day conference at the hotel and the banquet staff were excellent--and the food was very good. My only complaint was that our meeting hall was pretty cramped--but it was quiet. The elevators either stop at the conference level or the hotel lobby level--1/2 floor difference. So you have to pay attendtion to the button you push.

All the really nice hotels are not in the wharf even brands like the top chains their locations down here are lacking, not special, old, dirty etc.. The wharf is not lets spend everyday for a week there place anyway... theres a day or day and half of stuff to do and see there and thats it. then you will driving, cabbing or trolleying around the different areas of the city that are actually more appealing. Taking a bus tour is a good way to get a grasp of where you want to spend time. ok... sorry. To the Hyatt... When i'm traveling and staying at what i think will be a nice hotel i want to have the \"this is nice\" feeling when i walk in the lobby and the room. Anything can happen from there based on luck really. But, if you don't start with that you're in trouble. Pulling up to a small hard to locate, small cove of a drive entry there was no valet in sight. ok.. maybe getting a car, but you should have more than one just because of that. after getting out my own bags, then standing there for about 5 minutes here he comes and looks at me like i am going to go park it myself. So i \"talk him into valeting the car\" then i wrestle my bags(heavy) into the very small lobby(i thought it was the concierge desk). i booked a king standard room, i have someone that would prefer to sleep in the bed with me like normal. Well that was to much to ask and they could only put me in a two bed room(not queens) i'm talking small beds. keep in mind i booked a king. its beautiful view of the brick wall was amazing... the beds were decent to sleep in, by decent i don't mean great. I hindsight its amazing what kind of night sleep you can get in your own bed at night. lol. In the morning i went and looked at the breakfast, knowing how service is so far and decided to skip a 50 dollar breakfast and go get food in the wharf. smart choice plenty to pick from whenever. checking out i was going to stop and complain but said why bother.. so getting off the elevator to get into the lobby and i have two 60 lbs bags, then there is these three steep stairs to actually get on to the lobby floor out right out of the elevator, no ramp.. so i a wrestle the bags up the stairs(ok not ny first time), but the point there are bell hops watching me do it. didn't move a muscle, then when i got to them \" is there anything i can help you with\"? (yes please get fired, is what i thought). then back out to the valet where asking for your car is like asking for then to help you move two states away. same attitude as when i got there. I am always an over tipper even when my better half says to give them a bad tip. I don't believe in no tip, so i gave him 50 cents. I hoped it woke him up a bit, to see is worth. Stay downtown... trolley to the sites and the wharf. A mistake is to think staying there is in the heart of the action or sites its not just one.

He comped us the fee for parking for 2 nights $90.00 ( yes parking is $45 per night) and gave us free internet service, another $10 per night. So a big thank you to the front desk for making things right. The room was clean and the beds were comfy. The room had a fridge, 2 beds, flat screen tv, shower and tub combo, and a ipod clock radio and a safe in the room. The hotel is in a great location and close to many popular things to do in San Fran. i would stay at this hotel again for the right price.

Just remember that you need to feed the meter at 7am. For us this was not a problem as we were jet-lagged and would wake up early anyway. What I really did not like was that I made 2 phone calls to San Jose from the hotel phone. The first one lasted one minute and cost 8 dollars. The second call lasted 2 minutes and was 9 dollars. When we were checking out I saw the calls on the bill and could not believe my eyes. I still find it totally rediculous to be charged 8 dollars for a call of under 1 minute from San Francisco to San Jose. The receptionist told me my calls were \"long distance\" and that she never uses the phone at hotels where she stays. Really?! I couldn't believe the explanation.

First, I would suggest that you look for any special deal that includes parking. Parking in the Fisherman's Wharf area, and downtown SF for that matter, is very expensive. A taxi ride from the airport, SFO, will set you back about $60.00. On occasion, the Hyatt has a Town Car that will take you back to the airport for $65.00, plus tip. The good thing about that is that you can add it as a room charge. If you are only staying one or two days, a car rental may, in fact, be cheaper and give you more flexibility. If you can find a deal with parking, then the rental is the way to go. The Hotel is ideally situated for hanging out at the Wharf. It is not actually on Fisherman's wharf / Jefferson Street, which is, In my opinion, a good thing. It is only 2 blocks off the wharf area, which makes the area less noisy and crowded. Additionally, right behind the hotel is the starting station for the Powell & Mason cable car line, which will take you to Union Square and Market Street, and all the upscale shopping. Coming back from Union square you can take the Powell & Hyde cable car line which will take you, and ends at, the Ghiradelli Square/ Victorian Park area. This is also the west end of the Fisherman's wharf area, so you can walk down Fisherman's wharf and then back to the hotel with ease. An additional note about the cable cars: a single trip costs $6.00, but a day pass costs $14.00. So if you are going to try to take more than just one round trip, or get off and on - like stopping in China town on the way to Union Square, then the day pass is the way to go. When trying to get back from Union Square, I suggest that you go the the starting point of the cable car line at Powell and Market Street. The cable cars tend to be full by the time they get to Union Square and if you are lucky enough to get on one, it will probably be standing on the outside and hanging on. That is a true San Francisco experience and fine for 20 somethings, but not so much fun for seniors or people with shopping bags. The hotel itself is a typical Hyatt. The staff are friendly and efficient. The room are clean and well appointed. The King room we stayed in was roomy and had a desk with plenty of plugs for the computer and charging phones, etc. Note that there is a $9.95 per day WiFi charge.

Firstly, I put the \"privacy\" tag on the door after my first night as I did not need new towels or anything done in the room, however when I got back from the tour I was doing, housekeeping had been in, removed all the towels, moved a lot of my stuff, left the curtains open (which I actually did not realise at first when I walked in the room and I had started to get changed when I realised - luckily no one was in the pool!) and this made me feel very uneasy. I did speak to reception about it, and it was fixed for the next day. Also, I paid cash when I checked in and also paid the $13 a day for internet, but when i tried to use the internet it wouldn;t work. I called reception and the man at reception was telling me I had not left a deposit. I had to explain three times that I had paid cash when I checked in because he kept saying I had to use my credit card. After telling him the third time, he put me on hold and checked it out. He then apologized and said he could see I had paid already and he patched me through to internet support to get me set up.

The hotel's design is is very modern/minimalist, and though it was insignificant to us, some travelers may be put off by the lack of bathroom storage or towel racks. The staff was friendly, helpful, and responsive, always treating us like valued customers. The cost of parking is $45 a night and tax took the amount to over $50. Yeah, our eyes bugged out too, and we'd usually never spend that kind of money on parking...but when we weighed it against the time and expense of other transportation - $25-30 each for a hop-on/hop-off bus, multiple connections on public transit, etc, - we got our car a day early and sprung for one night of parking.

We had asked for a quiet room and selected this hotel because they did not allow pets. It was our first night, and we were very tired from traveling. I called the front desk and was told they would let the manager know. They said dogs were not allowed. After an hour of intermittent barking, I went down to the front desk. They asked if the barking was on tv! It appeared the manager knew nothing about it. The manager then went to the room next door and freaked the dog out. He later called our room and said someone was picking up the dog. We never heard it again! They had made a note about it and asked about the situation when we checked out. We got an old-fashioned, classic-style shower with a bit of mold in the tiles and on the curtain. The only towel racks in the bathroom are in the shower. The toilet paper holder is in a hard to reach position. The toilet seat slides around too much. The door to the bathroom opens out into the room and always seems to be in the way. Leaving a couple dollars on the pillow with a note results in a lot of extra towels/washcloths. Heads up for an awkward turn down service if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expecting it. Our door was slightly open when we came back one evening. Thinking it might be a robber, we cautiously entered only to find a female employee placing chocolates on our pillows. Unless you lock the safe, it will bang each time you close the closet door. There is no place to set your luggage other than on the floor. There are not enough functioning outlets. The desk and nightstand contain decoy outlets that do not work for American electronics. There is only one elevator that stops on the lobby floor. It is not big enough for all the guests and luggage.

They also kicked out all the adults in the hot tub. This is too early. Very comfortable beds & bedding; pillows were a bit too soft. We ate at the restaurant Knuckles once.

Check-in went smoothly and the valet parking was efficient (although at $50/day we thought it should have been). Both rooms were satisfactory, although ours was smaller than we are used to. We had requested a larger double for my daughter and grandson and they had no complaints. My wife was disappointed that our room lacked a tub, something she needs after touring with a bad back. Since the pool/hot tub was on our floor my why decided that would compensate. Early the first morning she went to the pool (outdoors) to do her water aerobic exercises and then soak in the hot tub. The pool was unattended but with the help of a guest she found a towel. There were three young people in the tub who lefty rather hurriedly. When my wife finished her excerises she found the tub filled with what appeared to be soap bubbles so she passed on it. The next morning the bubbles were gone but, a young woman in high heels came in, stripped to a bikini, entered the tub, and appeared to be washing off her make-up. My wife passed on it again. This is not exactly the Hyatt's fault and is a reason some people will not ever go into any public hot tub. A visit to Alcatraz was at the top of my daughter's to do list and she was very disappointed to find all of the tours booked for the period that we were there. As soon as we checked in we went to the concierge to see what she could do. At first she found an opening for Sunday but, later discovered that was a mistake. A few days later my grandson overheard a concierge in Ghiardellii Square day that anyone could get tickets the same day by simply showing up early at the ferry. Apparently everyone in the area knew this except the concierge of the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf. In order to make her trip to the island on Sunday my daughter packed on Saturday night and left us to take care of her luggage and check-out on Sunday. No problem, except after a half-hour wait the bell-man never showed up and I made two trips down by myself. At checkout, when asked about our stay I said that it was just satisfactory for the reasons above. The young woman apologised and removed the parking charges from our bill. This is the first time that I felt the Hyatt lived up to its reputation and a good enough reason to give it another star.

Flat screen TV, stylish furniture, aesthetic bathroom, even an iHome iPod clock radio all contribute to a visual delight, sure to appease the well traveled or weary guest seeking the comforts of a modern home. But when you actually start DOING things in the room, you quickly find it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a case of design for its own sake and not for meeting people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needs or goals. First, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get this out of the way. The TV was a snazzy touch, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn it on once during my four days. In San Francisco, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way too much to do to have time to watch TV. That said, had I wanted to watch TV, I would have been hard-pressed to watch any channel containing the number 7. OK, where to start. How about the iHome clock radio. The clock was set 10 minutes fast, so I thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be able to easily adjust the time. Bad assumption. I scoured every surface of the device more than once and could not find a single control to set the time. Is was not until my last night, when, obsessed with figuring it out, I started to turn a small thumbscrew on the back. As the screw loosened, so did a metal plate underneath it. And then, voila, the plate came off, revealing the controls to set the time. Why? Why hide these BASIC components of a clock? I just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it. More on the clock. I docked my iPhone before bed, noted that it was charging, then went to sleep. In the morning, my iPhone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s power was at 10%. Sometime in the night, it simply stopped charging. Then I noticed an outlet in the base of the nightstand lamp. Great! A feature of the room I can use. But no, the outlet was astonishingly too large for the standard prongs of an iPhone charger. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something with standard prongs kept slipping out of an outlet. So, pretty much the whole nightstand area was a fail, unless you count its ability to keep my phone and glasses off the floor. The bed and pillows themselves were really rather comfortable. But they stack the bed with a pyramid of shams that I prefer to not use. (I mean, who else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heads have been on there, and do they really change the shams?) So, I piled them up on a chic chaise lounge. Next day, housekeeping mounted them again on the bed. So I again piled them on the chaise. Finally it seemed housekeeping got the hint, and for the remainder of the stay kept the sham sculpture on the chaise. Now, we move on to the bathroom, which was beautiful but was a calamity of uselessness. It packs more usability issues per square foot than should be permissible by law. After an evening of traveling to get to the hotel, I had to, uh, empty the bladder. I literally jumped back and yelped when I flushed. It was one of those suction-type toilets that could probably suck down a toddler. The effect was startling. And, grossly, it splashed drops of toilet water all over the place. Ick. From then on, I learned to shut the lid before flushing, lest I get splashed or inadvertently sucked down. And when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re finished sitting on the toilet, it really helps to have taken some yoga classes so that you can reach the toilet paper. The holder is about a foot off the floor, and placed behind the toilet. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a terribly awkward twist, and I was seriously worried about pulling a back muscle. Why put it there, when higher up and on the other side is an unused wooden fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of the vanity? Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talk about brushing your teeth or taking a pill. When I do these things, I prefer using a cup or glass for the water. Yet in this 21st century bathroom, I could not find a cup. I did finally see them in the main living area, seated in front of the $5 bottles of Aquafina. Why put the glasses there? If I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to spend $5 on a bottle, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to drink it from the little thingy they designed on the bottle to fit my mouth. Put the glasses where people are going to need them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c near the bathroom sink. I purposely left my used glass sitting near the sink. When housekeeping came, they removed that glass and gave me a clean one \u00e2\u20ac\u201c near the bottled waters. Eventually I tried a trick and left my toothbrush in the glass. Housekeeping left that one alone, but still replaced the missing part of the glass couple near the bottled water. Water glasses The shower was unfortunately not exempt from being almost unusable. First thing I did was try to grab the glass shower door knob so that I could slide the door to the left and reach the shower controls. But oh, how the door did not budge. Then I paid closer attention and noticed that the door was not really a door, but a glass panel that was affixed to the ceiling and the base. The door sliding knob was really just something to hang a towel on. But metal knob on glass door\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an affordance I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m used to everywhere else in the world. It makes the door slide back and forth. So\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I had to get into the shower in order to turn on the shower. This might not be as much of a problem if it were a traditional shower where I could run the water in the bottom, get it to the right temperature, and then set the diverter to shower mode. The problem with this fancy shower is that the water sprayed down from a square plate-looking object in the center of the ceiling. So the very instant that the water is turned on, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s raining down on your arm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whether or not you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve managed to instantly find the right temperature. So, for me, that meant getting doused with ice cold water on my arm, then having to either reach through the cold rain or sneak my arm around it to adjust it warmer. By my fourth day, I kind of figured out how to get close to the right temperature in a split second and then withdraw my arm before the water totally got me. Thing is, I shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to learn these kinds of tricks. Then, we run into the problem of the water coming straight down from overhead. It makes cleaning certain body parts that are, say, on the underneath sides of ourselves rather impossible. I found myself performing certain ballet moves or yoga positions to try to get the water to reach the right places. Oh, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great for hair and shoulder washing. But pretty useless for everything else. Square shower sprayer Oh, and because the shower door isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a door at all, water splashes all over the floor and even onto the bathroom door (which is a double pocket door, not one with a knob, and I never could get the two panels to meet in the middle; good thing I was solo). Opening to shower If you use the hotel soap and leave it in the wire soap dish, the next day, it has bluish grill marks on it. If you have wet things \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as I did, having come from a whitewater rafting trip and had two wet swim suits, water socks, water shirt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c forget trying to hang them anywhere, as there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any towel bars (except for one in the shower that they use to hang the bath mat towel). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that shower door knob, plus a twin knob mounted inside the shower door. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. The Hyatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s modern bathroom places all of the towels in cubbies. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure what a family of four would do after swimming in the hotel pool. How would they dry four swim suits? And how about four towels? If the Hyatt wants me to conserve by reusing my towels, shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there be a place to hang them? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at some lesser hotel chains that have a retractable line in the shower that you can pull out to hang your wet things. Remember that outlet that was too large for the prongs of a standard charger? Same thing in the bathroom. One of the two outlets was too large for the prongs of the hair dryer or electric razor cord. Simply bizarre. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure there are other details I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m leaving out, such as their placing the coffee maker not by the source of water but instead hiding it in a dresser drawer that I came to use for my socks. If I think of them, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll fill them in later. Sitting near the TV was a book titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Welcome Home.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Feeling curious, I opened it, thinking it was the guest services directory. Instead, with delicious irony, I discovered it to be a catalog of the all the chic items that you can purchase. If you liked all the useless accoutrements so much during your stay, why not buy them for everyday use at hyattathome.com? I say go for it. Just make sure to hone up your yoga skills ahead of time. Post Script At the bar, I asked the bartender to describe Alaskan Amber. He said \"It's an amber beer.\" Wow, really? The morning I checked out, I called the front desk to request a taxi. They sold me on their limo service for $55 including tip. I went down, printed my boarding pass and waited for the limo. Then, the front desk told me the limo was in an accident, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d need to take a taxi after all. The 20-minute difference (had they just called the cab for me to begin with) nearly caused me to miss my flight.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cConvenient...great event staff...but a few issues\u201d", "Author": "EfficientTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR116217698", "Content": "Had a business conference there for 3 days.

However, I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of a shame that there are also a number of lower quality tat / souvenir shops in the area (fortunately, not the same street as the Hyatt) which detract from the nicer establishments a little. We asked to be moved from the first bedroom we were given as it was next to a fairly busy road \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the last thing we needed as we adjusted to the time difference was traffic noise preventing us from getting to sleep! Our 2nd room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a view but was quiet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c indeed, we switched off the AC and opened a window instead! It took me a couple of days to understand the layout of the hotel but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a like an enormous square-cornered figure of eight. So, if you imagine all the rooms facing out of the 8 are on the roadside, and all facing in are either above the outdoor pool or just a central atrium. SERVICE: 4/5: Reception, concierge, housekeeping and restaurant staff were all cheerful, pleasant and helpful. ROOMS: 3 \u00c2\u00bd /5: Decorated in a contemporary, slightly business-like design, spacious and clean, with AC, TV. (One tiny negative \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we found the bed a bit soft \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fine for the first couple of nights, but after 7 nights, we were pleased to move on!) RESTAURANT: 3/5: We never tried breakfast in the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we had some early starts for tours and tended to go and fetch coffee and muffins from Starbucks (a block away, next to the cable car stop) instead! The Hollywood caf\u00c3\u00a9 over the road does fabulous breakfasts too! Try the fresh fruit and pancakes \u00e2\u20ac\u201cthey were amazing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the plateful kept us going all day! We ate our evening meal twice in the Hyatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant. It was easy to use it on the night we arrived, and also another evening when it was chilly and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to stray far. Food quality was good, but nothing fantastic. THINGS TO DO IN THE LOCALE: Where do I start?! When we started looking at visiting California, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to divide our time, but San Francisco and the surrounding area has so much to see and do! We stayed there 7 nights, but you could easily stay more! We took a bus tour of the city, walked across the Golden Gate bridge, marvelled at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crooked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd street, and took (long!) trips out to Yosemite National Park and Napa valley (to sample the vineyards!). The shopping is amazing around Union Square, the Golden Gate park is huge and lovely, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth spending time at Pier 39 and Chinatown. I also booked a hotel with an outdoor pool because I wanted to make sure that we could relax for an hour or two IF the weather was good enough, and I do think that was a bonus. SUMMARY: There are a number of 3 / 3\u00c2\u00bd * hotels in the area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c eg. Holiday Inn Express, Radisson, Sheraton etc - and the Hyatt is absolutely fine for a base. Like I say, you have plenty within 5-10 minutes walking distance, and you can also hop on a cable car to get to Union Square (for shopping) and the other city-centre sights. Hotels in the city centre don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tend to have outdoor space with a swimming pool, hence my reason for choosing Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the Hyatt scores the highest on Trip Advisor in that area. Rooms in San Francisco are not cheap and this one was fine.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winchester", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay and a fantastic location\u201d", "Author": "DES32", "ReviewID": "UR115525091", "Content": "We stayed here for four nights.

My review is based on the price I paid for the room. If I paid Hyatt's going rate, my review would be somewhat lower. My favorable experience started with the parking valet. He was so nice to let us park our car in front FOR FREE while we checked in and dropped off our bags in our room. We requested 2 beds, but the check in desk offered a rollaway at no additional charge. Our additional bed arrived within minutes, got set up, and he was out of there. We needed ice for our room and I used one of the small waste baskets from the room. We had a few water bottles from Trader Joe's we needed to chill. I get stopped in the hallway by a housekeeper, noticed my wastebasket and offered to get the ice for me because it was completely on the other side of our floor, but I declined it. I order room service and the person on the other end was so courteous to me, he kept addressing me as Mr Smith (not my real last name). When room service arrived with the food, it continued. I ordered the big wedge salad and sweet potato fries. The salad was surprisingly good. I highly recommend it. Every Hyatt employee I encountered was very nice! The room was your basic king standard room and a chaise lounge. Our room was on the second floor which had a view of the roof, other rooms, and the sky. No view, but it was quiet. I thought to myself, who the heck is blowing up fireworks? I found out it was coming from the upstairs room whenever they flushed the toilet! Haha... It took a bit of figuring out, but I finally figured out how to drop the shades to darken the room, open the drapes, and open the window. Haha Ok, the reasoning for dropping it 1 star...the $45 valet parking for registered hotel guests. I actually considered paying the price, but I had a problem with the only option of valet parking. I didn't want anyone parking my car. It's my car. We were in SF coming from Sacramento. So, I used these great Android apps (search for San Francisco parking) to find the best deal on a parking garage in the area and the other app was to determine which blocks had free parking at different times of the day. I paid $15 for an underground parking garage 2 blocks away from about 1pm through 9pm. I found a street parking space in front of the Hyatt from about 10pm until 7am the next day for free. I got lucky finding a street space in a residential neighborhood 2 blocks away from about 7am until 10am - our check out - (no time limits, since it was the 4th of July). Wow...saved $35. The way I see it...I got my cardio workout moving my car around. Oh, and the other con about this place is that it costs $12.95 for unlimited internet. It's $9.95 for 250MB of data. Boo If you want to save some money, there's a Trader Joe's and Safeway nearby. We got our bottled water from TJ's for about .50 cents each.

The staff (front desk, housekeeping, valet) could not have been nicer. They were all all very pleasant and helpful. Managment has done an outstanding job training the staff. Check in was quick and very painless. The overall hotel is very clean and modern. In addition, the room was roomy, clean, and up-to-date (the deesk had various electrical plugs for charging; also an ipod docking station, and very good wi-fi). Probably the best bedding and linen around (I have stayed at lots off hotels around the world and do not make this statement highly). The outstanding bedding and linen provided five nights of sound sleeping. The bathorrm was spacious and well equiped (hair dryer, shampoo, lotion, soap, toothpaste). Also to note, the hotel's bar area is very nice (Tom the bartenderr was very nice and pleasant and could he mix a great Canadian Club Old Fashion). The hotel resturant was great for breakfast (the only meal eaten there). There is also the availibility of printing out airplane boarding passes free of charge and an ATM in the lobby. The pool and immediate area is very nice to (the pool was very warm, which is needed due to unpredicable SF weather). The only suggestion I could possible make is that the hotel needs a movie channel availalbe (AMC or TCM, for example), and a full shower door (to prevent the bathroom floors from getting slippery from the excessive water).

The rooms were always clean with ample toiletries & Coffee/Tea provided daily (if I had one complaint it would be that if you do not request to have your bedding changed daily - to help with the environment (as most hotels do these days) then the bed is not made up as it would be if the bedding was changed, if you do not leave the bedding turned back the bed may not be made or made as neatly as it is on arrival). We had a room on the third floor over looking the Jacuzzi, other members of our party had a room at the far end of the Pool, this was never an issue with privacy or noise, the pool area is open from 7am - 9pm, each room has net curtains and a blind and from the outside you could not see into the rooms (maybe you might see in if all room lights were on and it was late evening but you would pull down the blind if you were in the room). The poll was used a little but the Jacuzzi was often in use and by many guests, a great place to have a chat with people from various countries, we did not think we would use it much but all of our party did, a great relaxer after a day of walking the city.

A Walgreens is a few blocks away where Muni Pass tickets can be purchased for $13 for three days or $26 for 7 days (daily tickets also available, buses & street cars $2 a ride, cable car $5 a ride). Pick up a Muni Pass map for $3.95 and you can get one form of transport combination to any where you want to go with very little walking, which we did after walking some of the main areas on the first day. San Francisco transport is excellent it all runs often and efficiently and a great way to take in the sites and fully experience riding the city buy it hanging off the Cable car or sitting in comfort and taking in the views. Taxis to and from SFO Airport cost approximately $42 plus a tip and takes 20 - 30 minutes (traffic dependant), you can always take the Bart from the airport and then a street car or bus to your hotel, but for a party of four we decided the taxi cost was very good and saved the hassle of dragging bags around.

Whomever slept on the right side, and it was usually me, had to constantly shift for fear of falling off. The bathroom's appearance is quite modern. However, the hotel sacrificed functionality with comfort and possibly common sense. The shower head is in the ceiling. As the shower's \"door\" doesn't move, you have to reach across the shower to turn on the water. Be prepared for blasts of cold water to hit you as you're turning it in. The ceiling is high so anyone under 6 feet can't adjust the head. The design looks nice but as for guest comfort it just doesn't work. Sit once in the lobby and you'll see why the chairs look the way they do. Clearly the hotel does not want guests sitting in the lobby. The chairs have a modern aesthetic appeal for those that like that sort of decorating style but are completely nonfunctional. The concierge must be a mythical creature. No matter how hard we tried, we never managed to see anyone at the desk. While we were there they hosted some sort of event for little girls so we were overrun with them in the pool and jacuzzi.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boynton Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable stay and great location\u201d", "Author": "zoebella", "ReviewID": "UR106864385", "Content": "We had a wonderful weekend stay at this Hyatt.

We requested a king bed but it hadn't been guaranteed and they weren't able to provide this, but the room was big and spacious, including the bathroom. They have coin operated laundry machines on each floor ($1.50 washer, $2 drier), they sell tide powder in the vending machine - it was great to be able to use this service. I swam in the pool once and the pool area was a lovely sun trap. They provide beach towels and the jacuzzi was very nice. We ate in the restaurant at 8pm on the Tuesday night - the food and drinks were fine but the service wasn't great - it was pretty busy but we ordered 2 cocktails which arrived 10 mins apart and my salad didn't have the chicken on it which I ordered - so I had to wait another 10 mins whilst my husband ate his meal - it didn't make for a relaxing dinner really. The waiter seemed more concerned with presenting an image of being very professional but actually could have paid more attention to getting our order correct. We took a town car booked through concierge to sfo airport for a flat rate of $55 including tip - it is $45 for a taxi so this was well worth it. The area around the hotel is great, 10 mins to north beach, couple of blocks to the wharf, 15 mins (uphill!) to coit tower.

Had a nice room with 2 queen beds, and very spacious bathroom. The only disappointment was that this was the 5th hotel we stayed at on our US trip, and it was the only one without a fridge, although there was an ice machine just down the hall. The pool and hot tub were in a sheltered courtyard area, and they needed to be as it could be quite windy. Fitness room was well equipped. When I asked about internet access, I was told it was $9.95 per day, unless I was a Hyatt Gold Passport holder. It was free to apply, so I signed up and got free internet access for the whole stay. Parking was very expensive, we arrived at about 8pm and were taking the rental car back the next morning, but it would have cost $52 to park there overnight, so I parked a block away for $25. Didn't really need a car for the rest of the stay, we used one of the many hop on, hop off open top buses that stop at all the major points of interest. A 2 day pass was about $30 each, and because we bought our passes after 2.30, we got the rest of that day, and the next 2 days included. Also got the cable car one day, but very crowded, and it wasn't running for the whole route due to road repairs. Lots of restaurants within easy walking distance, ranging from fast food to fine dining. There's a nice breakfast place right across the road, but it gets very busy, and you may have to wait for a table, ot there's a Denny's in the Holiday Inn just around the corner. On returning to the airport at the end of our stay, we had 3 options, a shuttle bus that stops at other hotels for about $17 per person, a hotel' limo' for $55, or a taxi.

We eventually chose the Hyatt because it was somewhat cheaper and ticked many of the boxes in terms of Modern Decor, and we specifically called and requested the corner deluxe room due to its size, and it was about GBP 300 cheaper for the 3 nights than the other hotel. Upon arrival and check-in we were advised our corner room was not available but they have downgraded us to a smaller room taken $50 off for each night. I told them it is unacceptable because we had spent weeks if not months choosing and preparing for our room choice. I also mentioned that one normally gets UPGRADED when the hotel cannot fulfill our booking. (There were conferences being held there which may have not helped our situation) We grudgingly went up to see the downgraded room. We decided to take the room as the room was still fine in exchange for breakfast on all 3 days, the $150 off and a bottle of wine. That aside we took our things up and made peace with the new abode. The room was relatively large (called an oversized room), Modern, spacious, had an entire wall of windows which was great. The bathroom was clean and big and luxury with a massive walk-in shower. I guess a bath would have been nice - but we just used the hot tub downstairs instead. We did find some men's toenail clippings that had been missed when the room was cleaned up before our arrival - but they sent someone to sort it out. The room had a flat screen tv with cable channels, a massive kingsize bed, coffee machine and they had moved a portable refrigerator up for us and there was an ipod dock alarm clock.- Nice touch! The room was quiet and faced onto the pool and hot tub. Biggest hotel complaint is the lack of free wifi. Ended up costing an additional $30 and only one of us could use it at a time. Breakfast at Knuckles was great - loads to chose from from scrambled eggs, to pancakes, to potatoes to cereal - I had the guy make me an omelet which was divine. Our package included two full day transport passes/muni passport which meant you could ride the bus and cable cars as much as you wish - very useful.

Good restaurants are the Plant Organic restaurant on Pier 3 (take a cab - like 6 quid or walk for 20 mins) and also the Boudin on the actual wharf was great.

It is about a block and a half from the wharf so you can EASILY walk it in less than 5 minutes and far enough that you don't get any wharf noises or smells! I feel like this is the nicest hotel I could get for the low price of $149/night. Yes, it stinks that they charge $45/night to park here ($51.30 w/tax) but even at $200/night I couldn't find a nicer hotel especially with this great location! I drove all over the area looking for alternate overnight parking. There is a shopping center across the side street but they have signs that they'll tow for non customers and the parking meters all around hotel (and town) are 1 hour maximum and $3 per hour! It just costs money to park in SanFran! The staff was very friendly and accommodating. It was my daughter's 21st birthday so they sent up a bottle of wine and a lovely bowl of fruit. We also requested a mini refrigerator and it was delivered happily and quickly with no extra charge! The rooms were very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The shower had great pressure and I had no complaints. The hotel has been renovated, however, the hallways are dark and show signs of age. (That is just nit-picky.) The hotel is clean and nice and a great value. Also, the free wireless internet is a plus and was not taken for granted. So many hotels still charge and we had great service! We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant but did notice there was a Denny's across the street. Also across the side street is World Market where we got bottled water, liquor, snacks, candles, etc and next door to that is Barnes and Noble with a Starbucks and a Starbucks across the street from that!!

The bathroom set up is quite odd, lots of space, but it seems not to have been well thought out as there is a lot of wasted space, and no towel rack (where are you supposed to hang up the damp hand towel?) The bathroom door is a sliding one, that doesn't really seal, why they couldn't have put in an actual hung door on hinges baffles me as it's not for lack of space that they had to squeeze in a sliding one.

Location can't be beat, walking distance to everything touristy, a World Market is right across the street where we picked up wine, cheese and chocolate for dining in our room. The fridge in the room is a plus too. Why though in a deluxe room do they nickel and dime you for 9.95 for 24 hours of wi-fi? One other irritating thing was that our 2nd card key never worked the whole stay, even though the front desk tried over and over to get us a functioning one (four different cards).

The good service that I have experienced in other cities continued here with the friendly bell hop. Efficient Check-in and we had a reward certificate for complimentary bevarage (was sceptical about what this would be). When presented at check-in was surprised to be shown a list of drinks and food and could choose one from each list, we went with some Soda and fresh baked cookies. We had a call from Room Service just after 5pm to say that they were baking the cookies and will be along soon! Never really use in room dining but was impressed with the update. Room wise, we were in a deluxe corner room on the 5th floor, with a view of the gas station and cable car turnaround. We walked around the hotel to get to the cable car, and I don't think there are any real 'views' from any outer rooms I guess it might be nice to have a view of the pool but we only have 4 nights so were not overly fussed about this. The room also included a large refrigerator (as requested). If you want a refrigerator in your room, do remember to request this through the Hyatt E-concierge before you arrive (no extra charge), as I do not think that they are included in the rooms as standard. Furnishings very good, a few scuffs on the walls and the window blinds could do with replacing but nothing major. Coin operated washer/dryers are included in each floor (remember to have plenty of quarters if you think these will be required), quite handy as we were moving on to another city after this stay and felt a lot more comfortable with this than a local laundromat (some of which did not look too inviting). Breakfast was included in the package, otherwise would not have bothered (not worth $18 per person for buffet) although adequate, not of the quality have experienced in other similar Hyatt properties in the USA. Breakfast is taken in Knuckles Bar / Diner which is attached the the hotel and is not really big enough when the hotel is busy, but we were staying over Labor Day weekend. However, Knuckles is very good value for food and drinks during the day. You can walk to Fishermans Wharf in about 10 minutes, and then on to Pier 39 for all the tourist things including the sea lions and then the Alcatraz boats leave from Pier 33 (remember to book this in advance of your trip, we went on a Saturday and the next available tour to buy that day was the following Tuesday)! Great tip for a sightseeing tour - Gray Line operate a 2 hour tour in an open top double decker motorised cable car. It is only $20 and takes in all the usual sights. The tour leaves from Pier 39 hourly between 10am and 5pm. The driver is also the guide and the driver for our tour was hilarious!

The room was for a Hyatt quite small and the furniture modern but simple. Careful with the bathroom - shower only. Asking for a room close to the gym was given one right next to the pool where kids are making solid noise most of the day. What was quite nice is the flat screen TV although it had 40 programs and choice was still poor in terms of languages and especially movie channels. Guess they wanted to sell the pay TV. Poor was the fact that I was participating in a Conference with free internet but then no one advised this fact and I ended up paying twice. The internet was however good in speed and compared to Europe almost reasonable with US $ 9.99. Room service was ok, quite fast, although expensive, but that's SFO , portions are solid, only annoying factor was the service. A five star hotel should have 24 h room service, this one announces one thing in the menu and delivers answering machines. Again not really 5 star. Breakfast buffet is over charged for the choice offered. Again one wants to up-sell other breakfast options at solid prices. Staff is pushy on tip although you need 3 people to get your breakfast, one to seat you, one to set or clear the table and one to place your order. If you mix that up you're referred to the other one so sitting down and getting served can be a challenge, especially if you come early and the team is not complete... ON more challenge is the fact that some of the restaurant staff speaks very basic English only. The conference room was without daylight, but for plenty of PP presentations tat is ok. AC was a nightmare. Wireless service again ok. Breakfast and lunch were basic but tasty, only downside to it was the train station like service. Hygiene in various areas could be better, room carpet had stains, coffee mugs with lip stick and other spots or coffee left overs. Didn't use the pool as it like a larger bathtub, but the gym is quite ok equipped. Overall I would probably not come back but stay in one of the many similar located competitor hotels. Calling concierge, front office results frequently that you're put on hold as they are with guests and you're not even given the chance to ask a quick question as you're just dumped into the line. The third call finally was answered in a very friendly way and I could inquire about the check out time that was not to be found in the room.. An extended check out of 30 min later than usual was granted . For a rent a car you're sent next door to the Sheraton or other offices. Parking prices are a joke, $ 45 plus tax per day.

There are three Hyatts in San Francisco. We stayed away from the Hyatt Regency SF because it is too business oriented. We stayed for three nights at a rate of $119 per night + tax with a $25 food and beverage credit (which we used at their Knuckles restaurant) and a 1500 bonus Hyatt points. We are very happy we stayed at Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf because it is within walking distance to some of our favorite restaurants and attractions such as restaurant Gary Danko, The House, Slanted Door restaurant, Alcatraz landing, and Pier 39. The rooms are clean, the bed is very comfortable and I like the many electrical outlets right at the desk for charging our electronics. The valet parking at $45 per night is pricey but we saved parking fees elsewhere because most of the places we went to were within walking distance. During peak check-in hours, we feel the staff was a bit overwhelmed including lines at the concierge desk and our luggage not being delivered in a proper and timely manner. In our room, the safety deposit box is located too high in the closet so it is hard to see to make sure you didn't leave any of your personal items behind. The rain shower head is annoying when it is not an addition to a standard shower head...and the doorless walk-in shower looks cool but not practical as the glass panel is not long enough to contain water spills. The flat screen TV is nice but a bit too far if you are sitting on the bed. If you wish to take a nap during the afternoon and you have a street facing room, don't be surprised if you hear tour bus guides narrating on a loud speaker. Overall, despite the above negatives, we will stay here again because of the comfortable bed, cleaniness and the good location.

We asked if there was another option and the woman checking us in pointed us to a garage (just one block away) that was $32 per day - still a lot, but we were glad to save some money. We unloaded the car in the valet area and then parked it ourselves. It looked like there were some other lots in the area that might have been cheaper (if you don't care about in/ out privlages) but we needed the car later that night so we decided to just park it in this garage.

Pros: The biggest thing is the location. It's just a block or so from a lot of the touristy attractions, which are a little cheezy but still a lot of fun. It's also a relatively short walk away from a lot of the cool San Francisco sights as well. They also have a really friendly and helpful staff. The concierge in particular was awesome and gave me perfect directions that saved me a lot of time and hassle. Also, they have the most comfortable bed I ever slept in and the rooms were really spacious and clean. But perhaps the biggest pro for me personally was the great deal I got. Granted, I went in a totally non-typical time of the year in the middle of December, but I felt like I got a heck of a bargain by only paying around $110 a night. Cons: They really could use an indoor pool. San Francisco is pretty cool most of the year, so having one outside doesn't make a whole lot of sense. They should also really look into finding a way of making the rooms quieter. The location and hotel was pretty quiet in general, but some rowdy younger kids woke me up a few times at night. I'm glad those kids were having fun, and realize that the hotel can't really do much about that. But they could look into insulating the door jams a bit better to prevent this. But for me personally the biggest con is that there are really no frills. Well, there are, but at a high price. It doesn't make sense to me that you pay LESS a night at a nice place like the Hampton Inn and get things like free wifi and free breakfast. Paying a bit more at a place like a Hyatt and not getting those kind of things sort of stinks. But those cons aren't that big of a deal.

We had breakfast across the road at the Hollywood Cafe, based on recommendations on this site and were not disappointed. Our 5th floor room was well appointed,clean and comfortable with a good supply of hanging and drawer space. We had ordered a fridge for the room (from a pre arrival email sent by Hyatt) which was on site on our arrival. We also made good use of the guest laundry (wash $1.50 dry $ 2.00).

The staff is extraordinarily pleasant. We ended up upgrading our room to an Oversize King option so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak for the regular rooms. The location is fantastic; you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re within easy walking distance to Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf if you go down the hill and Ghirardelli Square if you go along the street. There are other sights you could try walking to but I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend it and the #47 bus goes right by the front and that will take you to most of the more distant places you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to check out. Parking is insanely expensive but San Francisco is a unique case when it comes to parking, you can park for about $32 per day if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re willing to walk 2 blocks from a nearby parking garage at the Walgreen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s which is actually a significant savings over what the Hyatt wants to charge. They do love to charge you for everything. Internet either on TV or WiFi (but not both!) is an extra $10 per day. The TV Internet is dodgy, the wireless keyboard needs a perfect line of sight to work and even then you better hunt and peck because anything faster won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. Frankly I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather have something wired to the desk that works than a fancy wireless keyboard I could try to use in bed that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. And the controls are far from intuitive, read the menus carefully before proceeding. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little outrageous when you think any Motel 6 charges $3 for WiFi per day and at a Travelodge it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s usually free but with the money you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying to stay at a Hyatt it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more expensive than most other places. I suppose their regular guests can afford it and the business people can write it off anyways. They have the $5 bottles of water but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine with the vending machines and Walgreen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearby and pretty standard. They do provide free whitening toothpaste though which I thought was a nice touch, and plenty of towels and pillows all around. The TV was nice and well placed. The room came with a coffee maker but the coffee it produced wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth the time, two sips and the rest you want to send down the drain. The desk/TV stand was very handy and had electrical outlets coming out its ears in very convenient locations which we appreciated. The phone by the bed however had so much static on the line it was incredibly hard to hear who you were calling. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was fantastic. The bathroom was very modern and stylish which was nice but the door wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really a door so much as a sliding wood panel as if you were stepping into a closet and it was a heavy wood with no proper handle so you really had to thrown your back into moving that thing and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a lock which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a concern for us but may be for others. The bathroom was large; there was no bath in our room but rather a very modern-looking shower where water essentially cascades out of the ceiling. It sounds great but the pressure isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the greatest and since you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really adjust the head coverage is splotchy. Overall we were really impressed however the room did lack one thing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there was actually very little information about the hotel itself. It mentioned some services and numbers you could call which was grand but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have, for example, the hours of the pool. Nor did it state if local calls were free, which they almost always are but after the price of their internet access I began to wonder. It had a room service menu and some limited information about their restaurant but after 11pm it all pretty much shuts down. What good is room service that stops before midnight? Usually room service is a godsend when you get back late at 3am or something and want a good meal.

All facilities in the room were top rate even down to the iPod clock radio. Front desk, valet and bell desk staff all outstanding - extremely helpful and friendly. Service does make a difference and virtually without exception everyone went out of the way to ensure we were having a great time. The guy on concierge needs to lighten up a bit however. The pool and spa are only about 3' deep and small but fine to cool off in if it's warm!

Selection for buffet breakfast was maybe a bit limited but of high quality. There's a Safeway 2 blocks away. If the cable car stop is busy (always late afternoon/early evening) take a cab for around $10 to Macy's and catch the cable car back to the hotel.

(We stayed on California St for the rest of our trip, which was walkable for both F.Wharf and U.Square.) The staff was very professional. Breakfast in Knuckles (which is nice room, with a trendy-ish bar; there's also cool wooden beams on the ceiling) is table-service or buffet at 18dollars for fairly good food. The front desk and concierge area is nicely decorated. The pool is fine and the area gets plenty of sun, but the pool water dried out our skin more than usual! (not sure what's going on with that.) The fitness centre is very good: treadmills, bikes and cross-trainers (all with TVs); weights, drinking water, sanitising wipes, cold towels, dry towels, earphones. The layout of the hotel is extremely confusing: you'll find yourself getting lost along the maze of green (read: 'puke-green' walls and brown carpets) hallways to find your room. In fact, the decor on all floors (except the lobby) is absolutely depressing (seriously!!) and there's no natural, and very dull artificial, light in the hallways. The decor in the rooms is not much better - they're a sad grey, with brown carpet. Let's just say, you won't look forward to coming home to your room. Toilet and shower, but no bath; the toilet doors are a bit weird and don't fully close; there's also no fan, so you may need to de-fog the mirror with your hair dryer. You'll also hear everything in the toilet from the room! Nice flatscreen TV, 2 phones and a safe. Comfy bed. If you've your laptop, internet access is 9.99 for 24 hours of a pretty speedy wireless connection through a T-Mobile hotspot (so you could use an existing T-mobile account on your credit card, or charge it to your room). There's 2 PCs in the lobby but web access is something like 6 dollars for 15 mins!!! However, they do offer free access to the websites of all airlines leaving SFO, so that you can check-in online and print your boarding pass. It's also possible (but difficult) to print documents for free from your memory stick (but you need to be a bit wiley, and I think I wasnt supposed to be able to do it....) Vending machines, and a washing machine & dryer, on each floor; however, the venders were a bit fussy, some were out of order and you'll need dollar bills (they wont accept higher denoms). Overall, its not a terrible place but management needs to work on cheering up the accommodation. They've tried to be trendy- and some of it works - but I would really sack whomever did the hallways and the rooms!

The conference facilities and services such as food were very good and as far as I know the people who planned it were very pleased with the hotel. Two very minor complaints... We felt the breakfast buffet at $18 a piece was pretty pricey considering it was basic breakfast foods like scrambled eggs and bacon with nothing really fancy or unusual. But it was very good and it is, after all, Fisherman's Wharf and food there is expensive. Also, we wish we had had two chairs in our room so we could relax and look out the window, even though it was to the front of the hotel and not much of a view. But it's fun to people watch.

The next morning I went to the front desk and the women was very pleasant and helpful she brought up our account and said they would be able to move us that day, she told me just to pack up and leave the bags in the room and they would move us while we were out for the day.

There is a safeway (supermarket) two blocks away, go out of the hotel and turn right go straight for a block and a half and there will be a parking garage on your right and the entrance to the supermarket is inside that garage, we made many trips here since our first breakfast at Denny's cost us over $50 we decided we would try to cut back with breakfast and some lunches and eat dinner out, and if you take a minute to fill out the paperwork for a safeway card you can save alot more. One day we bought rolls and lunchmeat for sandwiches but I forgot about plastic wrap and/or foil so I went downstairs in the morning and asked a woman that was putting away the complimentary coffee if there was anything I could use for this and she was helpful enough to go into the kitchen and get me some foil. Everytime I asked anyone for anything they were more than willing to assist me. I would definately recommend this hotel, the alarm clocks are I-homes and my son had no problem charging his I-touch on it. Besides the high price for parking that everyone has mentioned, which did not bother us since we just got a 7 day muni pass and rented a car when we needed it, which was only to go out of the city. The only complaint I could possibly agree with is the internet fee $10 per day seems high,I was under the impression that you could log onto their computers for 15 minutes at a time for free but that is not the case those 15 min will cost you $6.95. I'm just glad I did all my research ahead of time and we didn't really need the net, we were on vacation after all. you are able to sign on and check bags and print boarding passes for free which was nice. The muni pass is great the trolleys are normally $5 one way although they are busy on the weekends during the week we used them frequently. The F-line is also cool to ride but we also used the buses alot they can get you anywhere in the city you want to go. If you plan to visit Coit tower there is a bus that takes you up to it, this is one bus worth taking we did not know about it until we got to the top of the many, many stairs that you must climb to get up there, definately take the bus and then for a small fee ride the elevator to the top of the tower for some great views all around the city.

Location wise it is a block or so from the waterfront and a good 15 minute walk down to Fisherman's Wharf. However, the plus side is that it is out of the noisy yahooing crowds and we were never disturbed at night. The cable car stop (Powell-Mason line) was a block away and the nearest supermarkets were a couple of blocks away (go out of the hotel and turn right, take the 1st left onto Taylor and then left onto Bay. At the end of the block is a grocery store and then a Safeway and Walgreens about half a block along again). The room itself was really nice, large and had obviously been refurbished not long ago. Colours are blues, browns and greys so very contemporary. We had a huge bed with lovely linen and loads of pillows. There was also a couch in the room and a very large flat screen tv. We asked for a fridge to be in the room and there was a small one sitting on the floor - not sure why this has to be asked for I thought they were standard but obviously not anymore. There was heaps of storage room in drawers and cupboards. Only issue you might have if you were there on business is that the desk also doubles as the tv stand which didn't seem to leave a lot of room. There was a coffee maker thingie in the room with takeway cups which seemed to be handy (I don't drink much coffee so didn't try) The bathroom was large and the only complaint I would have is that the shower had a long glass screen but no door so water tended to get out onto the floor. The room was serviced well everyday. We had a drink one night in the bar which was fine although a little on the pricey side but then this is San Francisco. We didn't eat there but the food that was being delivered to the tables looked great. We ate breakfast across the road at both of the little cafes. Both served excellent food however, the one on the left seemed to do a variety of coffees rather than the standard filtered coffee but the one on the right had an additional fruit side that was wonderful so depends on what you want.

Nice flat screen TV. Friendly staff, especially the valet who served us courteously and with a smile every day. Great location, two blocks to touristy places and views on the wharf, one of those high tech public restrooms people flock to see as well as the Powell & Mason trolley turnaround that will connect you to the two other trolley lines. There's a Starbucks on the same corner. As the desk clerk said \"There aren't a lot of views in a 5 story hotel. We are built on landfill so you can't get much higher without being in danger of earthquake damage\". That being said, we took a room with a street view on the 4th floor and watched tourists and locals bustle, heard the dinging of the trolley which could be seen from our window, and had a decent view of Coit Tower to the left, and hillside homes to the right. Now the cons: Only a so-so lunch at the hotel restaurant Knuckles (we had a $25 credit there, otherwise we would have hit the wharf for fresh seafood - good sweet potato fries but the tortilla soup was lacking and the crab cake sandwich was fishy and dry. Our waitress was very nice.) Parking is $45 per night. Ouch, but that rate is pretty standard. Tip - some hotels will throw in the parking as a special offer. This place could use some updating. Single pane windows made for a noisy evening with emergency vehicles passing by but things quieted down enough to sleep before it got too late. We always knew when our neighbors were coming and going and watching television. The hallways are poorly lit and painted in some back in the day shade of green. The decor is in blue-grey tones with chocolate accents. It might have been modern in the early 90s, but now it just feels cold and dreary. It wasn't very clean and the lighting was poor. The clock was broken. The a/c intake cover was falling off. All in all, San Francisco is such an incredible city that the hotel stay was secondary. I wish we would have tried the Hilton next door because I know we could have done better. Give Sabella and LaTorre a try for a casual historical dining experience on the wharf.

Anyway, the first suite we had was a very large corner unit with huge window. We loved it until I tried to take a bath. Huh? What? No tub. Yup. Imagine that. To top it off, it has one of those \"European\" showerheads which shoots water from the ceiling directly onto your head. (By the way, I've been to 7 European countries and not once did I see this type of showerhead.) Moreover, the shower has no doors, just a glass half wall. And the seal on that wall isn't great, so water was leaking onto the water on the other side. And the door (sliding style) to the bathroom was so heavy, I had trouble using it. I called the front desk and asked to be moved to another suite with a tub, only to be told that all the deluxe suites have the European showers. Hm! Well, I hated it enough to take a smaller room. In hind sight, I should have insisted on a rate reduction. And yes, I should have just booked on priceline. We ate at the restaurant for breakfast twice, and the food was so so.

Lighting was plentiful, though the elderly might have some difficulty in manipulating the small turn switches on the lamps. The bathroom towels, shampoo soap etc were all of a high standard. The only thing I wasn't too keen on were the carpets: dark brown and highly patterned. The hotel is located within easy walking distance of the attractions of Fishermans Wharf, street car terminus, shops etc. I also walked a couple of times to Union Square, an interesting 28 minute journey via Chinatown. All the staff I encountered at the hotel were delightful. I will definitely stay there again when I am in San Francisco.

I was not sure what to expect since there are so many mixed reviews. I booked through Priceline and got an exceptional rate. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say enough about how friendly the staff is at this hotel. I called about a half an hour after booking to try and see if we could get a room with 2 queen beds. The young lady I spoke with in reservations was more than accommodating and had a super fun personality. Since it is my usual experience that most hotels won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t guarantee anything until you actually check in, I was surprised they would do this for us. Check \u00e2\u20ac\u201cin was a breeze. Under 5 minutes. Even though the gal at the desk was on the phone and had another employee waiting to speak with her. It was multi-tasking at its finest. She saw that I had our paperwork in hand so she waived me over and started the process while finishing her phone call. Once she hung up she politely asked us for one minute while she finished her conversation with her fellow employee (she finished up with him in 30 seconds). My usual experience is that if the person at check-in is on the phone or otherwise occupied, they make you stand there FOREVER while they finish the task at hand. Once she turned her full attention to us, she was funny and engaging. They did not even charge us the extra person fee (there were 3 of us and we only booked for 2). We felt very welcome and that our business was appreciated. This hotel is a great location. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a short walking distance to the bus, cable cars, etc. Our room was just OK. It was a little worn but I attribute that to it being a smoking room. The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t order room service or any extras so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on it. We ate Knuckles (the hotel restaurant) for dinner. They recently remodeled and changed their menu (used to be a sports bar). It was excellent. It's the best service I have ever experienced. Our waiter really went out of his way to make sure we enjoyed our meal. Again, he had a super fun personality and made us feel like our business was appreciated. At the end of our meal, the manager stopped by our table to inquire how we were enjoying our stay/meal and to thank us for staying with them. I used to travel for work. I have stayed in hotels all over the country and, all I can say is, WOW! That has never happened to me before. Check- Out was a breeze too. Under 5 minutes we were in a Taxi on our way to the airport. Every single employee we encountered during our short stay was friendly, polite and had a sunny disposition. I think you would be hard pressed to find a cranky person working there. It was well worth the money and I would definitely stay here again.

On the night of arrival, we paid for the $32 a night parking since it was late but every night after that, we were able to find off-street parking for free. You just need to make sure you read the signs since some streets have street cleaning and no parking is allowed at certain times. You also will need to get up by 7 to take the car or else you will need to feed the meter. The room itself was great: roomy, clean and recently renovated.

It is a modern hotel, looks quite smart and well situated near Fishermans Wharf in San Fran. Initially we were well pleased but once we settled in we became aware of one or two problems which people need to be aware of. Firstly the hotel claim to offer tea and coffee making facilities. True, they do offer it but you have to pay 10 dollars each time you use the facility as you can only use their coffee packets etc. Once made up you have to drink it or it becomes strong and horrid so it is an expensive mug of coffee. Also, the dining room is quite nice but dreadfully noisy particularly on match nights as it becomes packed with people watching the games. There is no other facility to eat other than room service. One would have thought a hotel this size could have offered a place to have a peaceful dinner. The internet service offered was the most expensive of all the hotels costing us almost 30 dollars a day. Ouch! The Holiday Inn across the road from us was advertising free internet access. If only we had known we could have saved a lot of money. We were given a room which had an adjoining door. Beware if they give you one. Our next door guests decided to put the T.V. on and make noisy phone calls at 4am. Sleep was impossible. When I complained the hotel staff offered us another room but as we only had one night left if didnt seem worth moving all our gear so we stayed put. Big mistake! There was a repeat performance. Finally, we checked out by using the hotel T.V. check out which promised to e mail the receipt. We couldn't open the receipt on our laptop and despite the fact that I e mailed and told the hotel this we never received a reply so to this day we don't know the full details of our account.

The hotel seems to have been recently refurbished, but the bathroom and light fixings looked as if they'd seen better days. The shower looked modern, with the water coming from a nozzle in the ceiling, but wasn't that fantastic in practice. The bed was huge, but the mattress could probably do with being replaced.

Our 2 essential criteria for our SF hotel were a pool and a great location. The Hyatt has both. After 3 days in SF, I asked my 6 yr old what he liked best about SF. His immediate response, \"the hot tub.\" Having a pool is really a huge plus for my kids, otherwise I would have booked a nice B&B. Our other 'must' was excellent location for sightseeing, not shopping. Hyatt hits a home run there, too. Right near Fisherman's Wharf and lots of public transportation. The location was superb. The hotel was very nice in all regards, although there was not a free breakfast. Usually we ate at the Hollywood Cafe across the street - not cheap but large portions so you could share, and the food was excellent and fresh. The Hyatt concierge was pretty helpful. We could have booked excursions through the hotel before we got there, but I think it was better that we did it separately (also, before we arrived - that was very helpful). I don't think the hotel's recommendations were that great. Use TripAdvisor to find the best things to do and the best tour operators. We ate in the hotel's restaurant, Knuckles, one night. Nothing to write home about. There's a new Thai restaurant (something Moon? Pearl?) just a block closer to Fisherman's Wharf, decor was like a cafeteria but the food was very good and relatively a bargain. SF ain't cheap! Two nights we ate at an Italian restaurant two blocks to the right as you exit the hotel, on the same side of the street. It was quite good, not cheap but won't kill you. The Holiday Inn Express across the street looked a bit cheesy compared to the Hyatt, but it's actually rated a bit higher, sounds like it has free breakfast and I think it has a pool, too.

Smooth check-in, very nice welcome. Our room was on 2nd floor and overlooked an interior courtyard - so very quiet. The room was spacious and the beds were fantastic! Lots of pillows - high quality. The a/c was an older system and a bit loud coming on/off. Bathroom could use towel rails and fan and the new sinks really didn't have the best drainage. Loved the citrus-lavender toiletries. Also appreciated the single cup Starbucks coffee in-room. We didn't use the internet service. Reception people and porters were extremely pleasant and accommodating - always welcoming back from our day and asking if they could help us plan our morning. We consulted the concierge one evening and found this man a tad short and unaccommodating - not at all representative of the majority of staff. We ate at \"Knuckles\" one evening; average sports bar - nothing to write home about. The hotel was a great location for our wknd. It was far enough away from the main tourist route and smell of the wharf area. There is a great cafe across the street \"Hollywood Cafe\" for bkfst.

We never came home to a room that hadn't been cleaned yet. Tips: Walgreen's is nearby in case you forgot anything. If you rent a car from Avis 1.5 blocks away - they let you park in the garage for free so you don't have to pay the $40/ day at hotel. But San Francisco has great public transportation so just buy the multi day pass at airport and utilize it. Denny's is 1 block away for breakfast - the Hollywood cafe was just so-so and they charge 3.50 for an orange juice.

They said they were fully booked and this was the only room available. Apparently though, this worked to our advantage because the hotel has a two bed to a room policy. This meant that if we had a two queen bed room, we could not have had a rollaway bed, but a king bed room comes with a sleeper/ couch which isn't classified as a bed so we got a rollaway bed as well. We stayed in seven hotels in total during our vacation in California but this was by far the most comfortable.

The problem was that the shower head was set at a height of about 5' 5'' and my husband is 5' 11'' .

When we finally did get the room, after an extremely long walk throught the crazy long hallway, we were impressed with the moderness of it. However, after inspecting it further, we hated it. The window was facing the bright lights of a 24 hour gas station and did not even have black out blinds to keep the light from coming in. Secondly, there was no bathtub and the sink was shallow - no bath for the baby? The shower did not have a covering so the water would splash out to the floor. Also, there was no shower head as the water come out from the ceiling right above your head - straight down. Since it was late, we decided to deal with it in the morning. MY wife went down the next morning. We were told that all King Room were the same - only shower. Our only choice was getting a double bed room since all the Suites were spoken for. After debating this over with the wife, we reluctantly agreed. The guy did give us breakfast vouchers for our entire stay but the breakfast sucked!!! We ate their twice in spririt of saving money.

Here's a idea, bathrooms are a tool for your stay they need to provide a function and when it's over designed for visual appeal it looses the function. A two inch deep sink does one thing... it splashes water, most of it on you. As for the shower it has a recessed shower head in the ceiling, I am 5 10\" and can adjust it my friend is 5 5\" and she had to get on her tip toes ,someone who is 5 3\" or shorter better bring there tooth brush into the shower and poke at it if they want to adjust it. It is also in front of the of the shower handles and the shower door does not slide. This means you have to turn the water on standing under it for a nice blast of cold water until you can dive out of the way or until it's warm enough to get back under. Some other things might help this hotel get the 4 or 5 rating the would like and that is don't let the city or whoever position a giant dumpster in front of your hotel.

I suspect the rate we booked might have been a mistake as it soon disappeared online, and that the hotel were trying to get away with giving us a standard room because of this. Anyway, this was no problem and we were swiftly moved to a Deluxe (Corner) room. The room is lovely and large, with huge windows on two sides overlooking Coit Tower in one direction and towards Nob Hill in the other. The room was decorated in soothing grey/blues and neutral tones, and was truly a relaxing and pleasant place to be and wake up every morning. The bed was large and comfortable and the room was equipped with a soft seating area in one corner, a table with four chairs and a huge desk area - nothing had been overlooked. The entrance lobby was large enough to accommodate an extra bed for our 4 year old which worked great as it felt like she had an area separate to ours. The table and chairs was a fantastic bonus, as we were able to comfortably enjoy take-outs when getting over jetlag and not feeling like eating out. The bathrrom was large with a floor to ceiling window (which let in lots of light but it was rather disconcerting to sit on the loo overlooking the buildings opposite!!). Unfortunately our room did not have a bath, just a large walk in shower. We did not notice this until after the bell boy had left us, and did not have the heart to complain again, due in no small part to the room being so fantastic in every other way. The breakfast included was good with plenty of choice of cereal and dried fruits, yoghurts, toast, muffins etc and a small selection of cooked items. We had to pay extra for our small daughter but this amounted to probably $12 a day including tip, so we didn't mind too much as we were getting a good deal overall. We didn't eat in the restaurant/sports bar, but it looked busy and buzzing when we passed. The pool area is nice, although in April the heated pool was not heated enough to compensate for the rather chilly air, but no matter.

Everything was perfect, including a very comfortable bed with silky sheets, and a large and very convenient bath room. We enjoyed the generous and tasty well-served breakfast. But the four star issue is definitevely the Hyatt's Customer Service : all the staff is very professionnal, efficient and always smiling when taking into account your slightiest desires. A special mention is to be dedicated to the Concierge, who gave us a great choice of personalized information service which was highly relevant in enriching all our stay in San Francisco (concerning public transport, restaurants, places of interest, kind of different shopping areas, local uses, etc...). This young Lady Concierge was even able to persevere in brilliantly solving a complex problem of furniture-bought shipping to Europe. Last but not the least, the hotel location is perfect : in a quiet area, but very close to cable cars lines, street cars terminal, bus stops, and rental car agencies. A great thank you to all Hyatt staff : you were a major issue when enjoying our fascinating stay in SF ! Next year we shall return, but no need for a boring survey: we know perfectly where to go (and return)!", "Date": "October 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devonport, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "hollyfairy", "ReviewID": "UR10044175", "Content": "This was our 2nd hotel in San Francisco and once again - disappointing (especially as all the other accomodation on our Californian/Nevada trip was far better and cheaper).

We had a room on the inside so our view was only of the roof, but at least it was quiet that way. A few complaints though (unfortunately). 1. There were only fluorescent lights in the room. Hate hate hate, fluorescent lights. While I'm all for going green and conserving energy, would it really be too much of an imposition to put an incandescent somewhere in the room?!? 2. Knuckles, the hotel restaraunt/sports bar. Food, good. Service so-so. Price, way too much. Both times we ate there we waited quite a while to be served. And I realize that in a hotel restaraunt you pay for convenience but what I paid for breakfast was outrageous (over $50 for 2 people).

If you are looking for a convenient location, clean, quiet room for a family -- this was great. We had 2 cable car stops within less than a 5 minute walk. We used them to go to Union Square, Lombard Street, Chinatown and the Cable Car Museum. We could walk to Ghiradelli Square, the Cannery, the Wharf, and Pier 39. We also could walk to our rental car pickup (Enterprise) and the F line (street car) easily. We used the F to get to the pier for the Alcatraz cruise and to go to the Ferry Building/Farmer's Market . We were able to take a city bus to the Marina easily. We also used the bus to go to Golden Gate Park (although it was a bit of a haul). We were only a block away from the firetruck tour -- which by the way, was the absolute best part of the trip!! I can't recommend it enough! My main point is that the Hyatt at the Wharf's location is great for families who are heading to San Francisco to sightsee. We debated as to whether we should stay in the Union Square or the Wharf area. The Wharf is definitely the way to go for sightseeing families with kids. The rooms were clean and the hotel was quiet. We did use the pool twice, but briefly -- it was chilly. The pool really shouldn't be a factor when choosing a hotel in San Francisco. There is so much to see and do. We got the Rise and Shine rate which included a full breakfast buffet (very nice) voucher for 2 people each morning. We actually used 4 of the vouchers for 2 of the mornings and paid the extra $9 for one child. That way we didn't feel obligated for all of us to eat there every morning. While the breakfast buffet was great, the dinner at the hotel restaurant was not the best -- and they charged for refills of the kids' lemonades. We had friends stay at the Argonaut at the same time. They said it was nice and it was only a block or two from us, so they had the same convenient location. I would probably try the Argonaut if I went again.

Not a location I'd normally choose, but had a free night from Hyatt and it was the only Hyatt hotel I could get into in the Bay Area. The hotel ended up being sold out by the time I arrived, but I received the room type I requested. I asked for a quiet room and was told by the friendly front desk clerk that the hotel is \"a very quiet hotel.\" I've heard that story before, but it really was true. Normally I'd like a view, but as this hotel is only 5 stories high, most of the street-facing rooms look into hotels that are across the street. And the streets around the hotel are pretty busy with traffic, vehicular and pedestrian. My room was on the second floor overlooking a \"courtyard,\" which is just the roof of the hotel. It's pretty claustrophobic, but I just wanted a good night's sleep and I got one. Although the hotel was full, I didn't hear a sound all night. And my room was an adjoining room. The place is built like a bunker, and is incredibly well insulated. I got a newly remodeled room that was very stylish (something you'd see on \"Top Design\" when they designed hotel rooms) in a blue/brown motif. The only part of the room not redone was the old white bathroom tile surrounding the tub. That looked bad. The rest looked great. (I've stayed at the Grand Hyatt on Union Square in the past, but their rooms are in such dire need of a makeover, I'm trying to avoid the place until they spend some money making them look a little less like, well, 1987). My experience with all the employees was terrific... everyone was exceptionally courteous. Didn't have breakfast at the hotel, but there are many places to eat nearby. I got an Egg McMuffin and ate it sitting on a bench overlooking the bay. Highly recommend it. The only downside of my stay? Parking is a rip-off at $43 a night (including tax). Nearby lots charged at least $30 overnight, but you do get valet service at the hotel. Had to wait about 25 minutes for my car when I checked out, but the valets were really working hard to fetch cars (everyone was leaving at the same time), so it wasn't their fault. All in all, a surprisingly good stay at a very nicely redone hotel (some public areas still sport the old decor, which is rather incongruous with the new design). I'm not sure I love the neighborhood (wildly tourist-y in a slighty seedy way) or would come back for another stay for that very reason, but it's an excellent choice if you want to be 3 blocks away from Fisherman's Wharf.", "Date": "April 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "sbrumage", "ReviewID": "UR7237353", "Content": "The Hyatt was a great hotel.

What I found was unhelpful and, aside from a few exceptions, uninterested front desk personnel, an indeed very modern but dirty room, and an ambiance that caters not to tourists but solely to the convention/conference crowd. Got a fourth floor room with a malfunctioning A/C. It took three calls to the front desk and seemingly endless waiting for an engineer to fix the electrical problem and a completely clogged filter to be cleaned. The room looked like it had not been used in a while. Dust, bar glasses not quite clean, you name it, it just didn't fit the Hyatt image. The windows opened though, and it was nice to get some fresh air while waiting for the engineer to show. TV (Samsung Flatpanel LCD) had lots of channels and very informative documentary on San Fran. Parking valet (when he was around) was very helpful and relatively quick. Breakfast was the worst I have had in a long time. Room rate ($259 a night) included full american breakfast and parking. You do the math, but if I can get fresh danishes at Safeway across the street (practically) why is it so hard for the Hyatt to deliver same to the breakfast buffet? No yoghurt, one kind of hot cereal in a utilitarian, aluminum heating (not serving) unit, one kind of juice (couldn't tell it was actually OJ, so I didn't bother tasting), three kinds of fruit cut up in large pieces in three separate serving trays next to the hot food so it actually looked like more than it was. The scrambled eggs were surprisingly fresh, but the bagels, muffins and danishes were at least a day old (no kidding). Would have had to pay full price for everything else on the menu but the Two Eggs Any Style (the most expensive item) and I didn't trust the kitchen enough to incur the additional expense, so the buffet was a no-brainer.

We arrived at the hotel from the airport at around 1:00. Even though check-in wasn't until much later, they gave us our room right away, and were unpacked and off sightseeing by 2:00. I felt like we had a whole day ahead of us. The hotel is very nice. The rooms are small, but no smaller than a New York City hotel.

After a 2 day stay we were out about $300", "Date": "May 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mill Valley, California", "Title": "\u201cThere are better hotels out there.\u201d", "Author": "noirjet", "ReviewID": "UR4731815", "Content": "The pluses: -The hotel is in a good location if you want to stay in the Fisherman's Wharf and be close to Northbeach/Chinatown. -Excellent beds. If you need a lot of rest and not interested in being out, this is a great hotel for it. But, then again, why pay Fisherman's Wharf prices, when you can stay somewhere else with much better rates? -The rooms have recently been upgraded with very comfortable plush beds, flat screen TVs, and new fixtures. -There's a decent size lap pool and jacuzzi. -There's also a work out room and a laundry room. The negatives: -Absolutely no view. I had one of the better views on the 5th floor. I paid extra ($20/day) to upgrade so that I can view the Coit tower. When I got to the room, I realized that although I can indeed see the tower, there's a much better view of the Petco, 76, and Cost Plus Market! Their store lights prevented me from leaving my window open to see the better view in the distance. -The wireless internet is NOT free! This is SF folks! We have the most amount of free wireless in the US. Tip: I managed to use the wireless connection from the Radisson nearby for free. - Although this is supposed to be an upgraded room, the dresser bulb is missing and there's a bulb out in the bathroom. There is also no mini bar and no real desk to work in. - There are never enough towels and they are not nice towels! - The hotel guest information book is outdated and incomplete. We ordered room service and half of the menu items were no longer offered and the prices are wrong. No information in it on where amenities were (ie. pool, check out time, etc.) - If you do decide to stay here, you'll be tempted to order room service. Don't! The food is not very good and is over priced, not to mention does not come as it is described on the menu. For example, the Continental breakfast for $10.95 that comes with a basket of danishes, actually has two very very small danish (same size as a sweetener package), plus a 2 cup pot of coffee and glass of orange juice. To top it off, we were charged the new price of $16.95 plus the $2.50 delivery and the 18% service charge. The corned beef hash tasted like it came out of a can, and the baby back ribs had no BBQ sauce (as described on the menu). I've ordered room service in every hotel I've ever stayed at and understand that the prices are always exurberant, but I am more often than not satisfied with the food. Not at this Hyatt! - The elevator is located in one section and is not in the center! Some people are lucky enough to be located near it, but for most, it's going to be long trek. - Parking is $36 a night regardless if you're a guest or not. (TIP: There are free parking spaces at the end of Beach street for 4 hours maximum and near the Argonaut for max 2 hours) Overall, it's not the worse hotel you can be in.

If this was one of the best, I dread to think what some of the others are like. In hindsight, it was a mistake to stay at Fisherman's Wharf anyway. Myself and my husband spent part of our honeymoon in San Francisco three years ago but stayed near Union Square. At the time, we seemed to be travelling down to Fisherman's Wharf a lot for Alcatraz, Pier 39 etc so it made sense just to stay down there this time. In fact, we ended up spending nearly all of our time away from there! I don't know what has happened in three years, but it seemed to feel more unsafe, more seedy, more tacky and there were certainly more beggars down there. We could hardly walk out of our hotel without getting hassled by someone, and therein lies the first problem of Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf. As for the hotel itself, that too, was extremely disappointing. The lobby was beautiful but unfortunately, not maintained well. The carpeting was filthy and all of the public areas just felt like they needed a good clean. There was a strange, musty smell that hung in the air too. I'm not a prima donna in any way and I've stayed in plenty of lower class hotels that were clean and well maintained, but this hotel just screamed 'unloved' and it is clearly ageing before its time. Our room I would call fairly basic (and certainly not 4*) but at least that was clean and I guess we spent more time in the room than public areas so it was more important for the room to be clean. However, it shouldn't have to be an either/or situation. The decor made the room feel dingy and dated even though it probably wasn't done THAT long ago. The bed was very comfortable though, and we made good use of the numerous cable channels on offer. There wasn't a coffee maker in the room but the hotel did offer complimentary coffee at a station down the corridor which was handy. We ate breakfast at the hotel's only on-site restaurant, \"Knuckles\" for convenience more than anything else. The food was ok, nothing special though. We felt it was overpriced for what it was. The staff overall were trying their best but were mainly young and inexperienced. They also weren't very forthcoming with a smile or cheery hello. On the whole, we found our whole experience at Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf very disappointing and it's for certain that if we return to San Francisco, we'll be staying neither there, or at the Fisherman's Wharf area in general.", "Date": "December 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgia", "Title": "\u201cJust Ho-Hum\u201d", "Author": "amtedrow", "ReviewID": "UR4053348", "Content": "I stayed at the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf for two nights for a conference and paid a discounted rate of $169. The staff were very friendly and efficient, but the hotel was a little on the small side and not what I expected of a 4-star rating. My room was adequate, but not particularly clean or interesting. The conference spaces felt cramped. If I had paid full price, I would have been extremely disappointed. The location is great for visiting Fisherman's Wharf. It is in walking distance of seafood restaurants, the sea lions, the ferry to Alcatraz, Ghirardelli Square, and the cable car turnaround. But once you've seen those things, there isn't much to explore.

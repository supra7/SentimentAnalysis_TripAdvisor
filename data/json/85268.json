Tons of restaurants and other golf courses made the trip to Orlando anything but a kids vacation.

We saw the great Arnold Palmer practice on the range which was amazing to see and met him at our meals. It was a wonderful trip and close to Disney aswell.

The only overstated element is the amount of portraiture of ARNIE on the walls! The American breakfast is outstanding as are all the entrees in the restaurant.

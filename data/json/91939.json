Unfortunately, this seems to be the party hotel for the locals. There was a bachelor party or something involving girls coming and going all night in the room next to me and unfortunately they went to bed about the time I had to be out. The walls are paper thin...I could seriously hear their conversations through the pillows and the wall. It felt a little sketchy. I also had to choose what to leave plugged in so I could charge my cell phone and use it as my alarm...which meant the phone was unplugged and I didn't want to fumble with it to call the front desk at 2 am. Why is it so hard to get outlets by the bed at hotels?!?! Anyway,the people at check in were very nice and the decor is fun and trendy and the pool area looks like fun in the summer, but I don't care how cheap it is, I will never stay there on business again. It is nice that it doesn't have a casino and the hotel itself is a bit quieter than any of the places on the strip, but at least even the noisiest hotels on the strip have soundproofing so the rooms are quiet. I might stay here for a cheap weekend getaway for fun, but I think I would prefer an older outdated place on the strip for the same price if it meant I could get a little sleep.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cWedding Weekend\u201d", "Author": "NJGIANTSFAN", "ReviewID": "UR126607641", "Content": "Booked this hotel for our wedding weekend as it was a hotel off the strip and did not have a casino.

Very Nice. we experienced no issues as other folks have stated with loud pool music at night nor did airplane noise keep us up. Hotel has a very small but cozy bar and a small and cozy restaurant. We did have lunch and the food was good and very reasonable in price. The hotel is a little ways away from the strip and will take 15 or so minutes to walk to. Otherwise a cab is about 8 bucks. If you dont want to go that far, Hard Rock across the street has casino,restaurant and spa. The hotel does have a policy against outside food or drink but the policy is not really enforced as it seemed most guests had at least drinks in their room.

If you want the service and amenities associated with $135 per night hotel, you would be better off spending your money elsewhere. The rooms in this hotel are not put together well and the manager \"Lana\" does nothing to accommodate. Shaw, the other manager is much better. The general staff on the other hand is pleasant, however uninformed. The hotel advertises iPod docks, elevated soaking tubs, refrigerators upon request, custom beds, and room service among other amenities. The duvet cover is made of two sheets folded over on each other, which is peculiar considering the bed itself only has a sheet on the mattress but not one to cover up with. There are not iPod docks in every room as advertised, the room service came in to go boxes with plastic silverware and unbuttered toast (none in the box either) after elevating the prices, charging an automatic 20% gratuity and $3 deliver charge. The ice that comes out of the ice machine (not located in every building or floor) has black specks of mold in it. The first room I was in had broken furniture and no tub (as requested) so I moved. The second room had no nightstand, so I used the chair. I requested an iPod dock several times upon check in and did not receive it. I got one the next day from the general manager Shaw, only to be informed by the other manager \"Lana\" that now another guest isn't going to have an iPod dock because they had to give it to me. My husband had to request batteries for the remote on the heater and the \"no longer give out refrigerators\", so it was suggested we put ice in our sink. The good things about this place are that the valet staff (all of them), bartenders (mike and mark), security staff, housekeepers (Briunna and Shirley) and servers are great! The restaurant has good food (from what I ordered), the pillowsgood are soft, and the pool has a few relaxing hammocks to lay in. After speaking with Shaw I felt confident that my stay would improve and be worth it so I extended for another night. That was a mistake on my part. Had I paid $60-75 a night I would have nothing to complain about, but charging $135 a night OFF THE STRIP and coming upto this short is unacceptable. If the management would hire more employees and spend the money to keep up the property as advertised I would not hesitate to spend $135 a night in the future.

Sure, it's not on the strip, but I'm past the point where I need to be in the middle of all that madness. When you're in super high heels, even walking across the street is a daunting task. So if you're going to cab it anyway, you might as well save some money and stay at Rumor. First of all, I love how short the taxi ride is from McCarran here. It's like $13 including tip, and I think my cab driver still took me slightly out of the way. The bad news is, it's really close to the airport. The air traffic noise can be deafening. That is probably my biggest complaint. My next biggest complaint is that not all of the rooms come with the huge soaker tubs that are highlighted on their website.

One thing I will note, is that while the sinks are the stylish bowl-type with fancy hardware, the water pressure is nothing short of AGGRESSIVE and will leave you with a wet floor if you turn it on too fast.

This time, we decided to stay here one night of our three night stay and finally give it a try. I was not expecting a lot because there had been some reviews about the rooms not being clean, and generally, it not being a great stay. This was not the case. Upon check in, we were greeted pleasantly by the desk attendant - we checked in after 4 - the stated check in time - but had called much earlier to see if we could check in earlier due to my meltdown over another hotel having only scalding water and not being able to shower. They said no problem - which immediately made the day better. Our room was clean and large, the bed was very comfortable, and in general, I found it a very nice surprise. I want the pillows from this hotel. they were amazing. I slept like a baby. My boyfriend did not. Unfortunately, there was a very very loud birthday party going on in the room next door to us, and despite being asked multiple times to quiet down, my boyfriend still put in a call after 2 to complain - eventually, they quieted down and went to sleep. I kind of wanted to try the restaurant Addiction, but since there was no menu or hours, and the hotel lobby was very quiet on a Sunday night, we opted to go across the street to the Hard Rock's Pink Taco - which was good for a late night bite, but I'm still curious about Addiction. The tub was great, I stopped at LUSH at Mandalay Bay and got a bubble bar, you can rotate the TV, so it was very relaxing. We had opted to stay on Freemont street the previous two nights, as we like a hotel down there and aren't huge on the strip. However, this was WAY bigger, and the room was nicer. Overall, we agreed we will give RUMOR another try next time - and maybe the balcony room that we request won't be facing the street.

We didn't care much about the bed neither, it was too soft and provided no support. -Room Service: We ordered breakfast from 'Addiction'. The food was average.

I will say that the rooms were good despite the bad view of the parking lot. One thing to watch out for is the bathtub. I saw the website and was excited to take a soak in the tub but when I read the small print on the site it said only in select rooms. Apparently they don't have very many, it's really just for show. Now where I would give this place a ZERO is service. Instead of describing it to you. I'm going to just give you the experiences I had at Rumors and you be the judge. (CHECK IN ) When I first arrived I got to the hotel early. I entered and was greeted at the front desk. I explained I wanted to make sure I had the bathtub in my room. She said \"sure, we will be able to accommodate you but check in is not until 4pm. The room you requested is not ready\" Now I will give a pass on this because I came earlier then the check in time, but the place was dead. No one was in the lobby. The staff were just talking on cellphones or to one another. I couldn't have seen more than 5 guest my entire stay. Either way I let it go and waited. (ROOM SERVICE) One of the great things about staying in a hotel is room service. After hearing how good the food was I ordered some. They tack on all these additional fee's including 20 percent gratuity and $3 service fee in the bill but lots of places do that. Yet you would think with all these fee's your food would come on a plate. Well I guess the hotel did not want to spend the money. The meal is delivered doggy style. (heheheh) Get your heads out the gutter. I mean in a doggy box and to top it off my cocktail came in a plastic cup complete with straw. I'm sorry but can we say \"ghetto\". It's not Mcdonald's it's room service that I'm paying out the butt for. So although the food was good. It really felt weird eating from a box with plastic forks and knives. Despite this I was feeling lazy in the morning so ordered breakfast in the room. When I called from my cell phone because the hotel phone was not working. I was told the restaurant is too busy and to call back. So came down a few hours later for breakfast at the restaurant what was the point of ordering in now. (RESTAURANT ADDICTION) So when I arrived it was empty except for me and staff. I was greeted by a nice guy in the front. He brought me to my seat and took my order. I couldn't help but notice the staff. You see the staff eats at the resturant too. I acutally saw a guy who was the hotel manager talking to his boss having breakfast at the restaurant. Now what was so funny was they were so loud I could hear the conversation. From lady ordering a diet coke. To them bad mouthing one of the employee's and talking about the internal work related gossip. It was nice watching it for entertainment value but I couldn't help but think how unprofessional. Yet then this took the cake. I see one of the employees coming across the dining room with lunch she heated up to kiss her boyfriend. I think this is what lunch rooms are for not the front lobby of a hotel. I couldn't help but think of my job and I'm on vactaion (heheheh). When the food came I was very happy, it was yummmy. I wish I wasn't so distracted by all the unproffesional staff who decided to takeover the lobby and resturant. Tacky is all I can say. (Room Service 3rd chance) Again as I said I love room service and the food was good. So ordered again for a night snack. Now that I knew I was getting a doggy box my expectations were lower. Well when I ordered the cocktail that was on the room service menu in the room. The guy told me we don't deliver drinks to your room. When I told him \" the guy before did\" he said \" Well ok .......\" If something is a rule the management needs to stick to it. If you dont deliver drinks to the room remove the drink menu from your rooms. It's not rocket science it's just common since. He came up shortly after with a plastic cup my mojitio in it. Couldn't help but laugh. Hey I knew how crappy room service was and ordered again. So couldn't help but laugh as I took another soak in the tub I desperately wanted. The question I ask is the funky decor a replacement for giving good service So over all if you are spending like $39-$69 this place is alright for the price, at least its not Circus or Hooters (LOL) That was the price on Orbitiz. Yet if you pay the $100- $200 on the Rumors site you will feel extremely disapointed and it would be a rip off. Stay some place with a more professional staff for that price. The decor makes the place seem all hip and cool but the service reminds you how tacky the place really is. Not to mention the $11 resort fee. Yeah this place has allot of hidden fee's.

Cost was just over $300 total as they were running a third night free special. Our room was upstairs facing the back of the property. While the website offers a clear depiction of the rooms layout, it does not show the wear and some short comings of the accommodations. Starting with room location, don't assume you will have a view. Ours was of a low income apartment complex and dumpster out back. Understanding you can upgrade to a view of the courtyard, it was not important to us and we did not elect to do so. The furnishings and carpet are starting to show wear but the room seemed clean throughout our stay. Even with the size of this room, it is seriously lacking in storage. The closet is half size of what you typically get in 3-4 star hotels and there is next to zero other storage. One night stand with two small drawers and and small desk with another two small drawers. We were forced to stack three suitcases in the corner of the living area and live from those. The bathroom has one sink and very little counter space. The rooms towel storage occupies the small shelf you do have and there are no towel bars anywhere in the bath. Rain shower was nice but a little light on pressure but acceptable. Each room had separate wall mounted climate control but the mild temperatures did not require it's use so we cannot speak to their effectiveness. King bed comfortable as was the padded chair and sofa in the living area. Wet bar area was sufficient for a few bottles and mixers. Hotel location is not in the best part of Las Vegas. Short taxi ride from strip. Walking to CVS a few blocks away, you can expect to encounter some homeless and less than desirable characters that likely live in the surrounding apartments. We are frequent city travelers and not bothered by these elements but did become considered when a homeless person entered the hotel and appeared at the ultra hip lounge next to us while we are sipping drinks. The bartender waited a few minutes and then called security. He happened to be outside flirting with some recent arrivals and finally made his way over to escort the gentleman out. When we inquired about security at the hotel, we were told the \"he\" )singular) roams the property all night. Seems a little under stated considering the hotel size and location. Convenience to walk across to the Hard Rock is great. The amenities there are typical Vegas so you have the best of both worlds. Restaurant at the hotel has GREAT food. We have room service for breakfast - Breakfast sliders, Butterfinger pancakes and breakfast potatoes were all amazing! We did not experience any service related issues but spent little time at the hotel. Many reviews site noise issues and there is no question the layout supports those concerns. Hotel was very quiet during our stay but at occupancy, bring the ear plugs or be ready to party. Although initially disappointed with the short comings upon arrival, the hotel grew on us - hence the 4 star rating. If coming back for a group or takeover, we would stay again but otherwise will more likley move on to other Vegas hotels.

I watched him on the Food Network and I know his high-flying character would go over so well in that atmosphere. By the way Vic, the Sliders and Mac cheese sticks were awesome. Second comment to the hotel, take the bar menu off the website if your not going to serve those drinks. I was so looking forward to that peach Sangria. We did stay on a Thurs night so I can\u2019t comment on the late night music at the pool. I can say that I love what they did with the remodel of the rooms. Money was well spent to make them as inviting as possible. It is now our go to spot when we see a concert at the The Joint. In fact, Incubus is this Sat night and it would save us a taxi ride home.

We checked in on a Monday and left the following Monday. Our 2 room suite was a \"Super 8\" or \"Motel 6\" type set-up, probably the worst room on the premises since we overlooked the valet stand right outside of our windows. They need to install some draperies other than black out curtains or at the least darken the window glass, we found it so annoying -total blackout or our entire room visible to every car that entered the drive. The lighting is horrible -one light in the front room only wall lamps in the bedroom and the bulbs were 40watt or less. Phone in our room never worked, we were short one remote for the TV. The A/C worked great -I like it penguin cold. The room isn't set up for storage of clothes -the closet is barely bigger than a large gym locker and there is no dresser other than the 2 side drawers of a makeup table/vanity in the bedroom- although you can't use it for doing makeup because the TV is mounted right above it. Bathroom vanity space is nearly non-existent and the \"bowl sink\" they have installed on the counter is too high for anyone under 5'6\"; also it created a tsunami wave out the far side if you turned the water flow on too high. The room was also not efficient for doing any work. No desk, no real table to work upon and poor lighting. I made do with my laptop on the little round table and extra chairs for laying out my work, but not a great setup. Housekeeping was lazy. They took our opened bar of soap everyday, but didn't replace it with a fresh one every time, towels were the same -they would take them whether we hung them up or left them on the floor and then would leave half the amount --sorry but they should know 2 women use a lot of towels. We left beer bottles on the table and they stayed there for 3 days in exactly the same spot, I truly don't think they did much more than make the beds -but they were actively cleaning in all of the public areas. Overall, the place appears clean, but I don't feel the quality of our room justified the price we paid for it. Now, for the staff. Wonderful! Ben at \"Addictions\" was fabulous, professional and provided service like you were on a cruise ship. We loved the food. This portion of the hotel is an absolute gem, relaxing indoor or outdoor dining. Valet service also excellent. Those guys were polite and friendly even though it was over 110 degrees every day.

There are a good many reasons....however, I realized that this place is perfect for a certain type of guest and I am not that guest. I like properties that are professionally run top to bottom and this place is not. Allen, the GM, does his best but you can tell his hands are pretty much tied by the owner....The owner of this hotel wants it to be a loud, bustling, glamorous place where, God-willing a celebrity will accidentally overdoses and bring it into the spotlight. He wants it to be the scaled down version (only in size, not bass) of the neighboring Hard Rock Hotel with its Rehab party. This is NEVER going to happen. This property is owned by The Siegel Group. These guys own second rate hotels and shopping malls. They have another \"up-scale\" property in Vegas called, \"The Artisan\" that was previously a Travel Lodge. The rest are pretty budget..Gold Spike, Siegel Suites. The Good: Young, lively, fairly attentive staff (see the UGLY below tho). Average clean rooms. Good beds, edgy furnishings. Better than average hotel food in their restaurant. This place is really trying to be something. Sadly, I suspect it's trying to be the wrong thing given the property. The F&B manager and the GM really try. They do. I suspect the owner is the problem with this property. The Bad: I stayed here 6 nights: Saturday through Thursday and with the exception of one night there was unbelievably loud music playing at the pool...often until 1 or 2 am. The bass is so over the top that in our room we could feel the bass beat in our chests. I like loud music and I like a lot of bass but this was absolutely ridiculous. You could not sit in your room and have a conversation without yelling. But hey...it's Las Vegas so maybe you're not supposed to be in your room at 1am anyway. Sadly, we were there working so sleep was a must. If you like to sleep anytime after midnight...I'd pass on this place. Pass...no matter what Mr. Oakley, the GM, says in his response to this and other comments about the noise. Remember, when the pool is in season this place wants to be Rehab. BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. Got it? Also, the rooms need a little more attention to detail. For example no towel racks, soap dishes, refrigerators in the rooms. Also, don't get too excited about the soaking tubs in some of the rooms. They basically painted over cultured marble tubs so the tub itself is pretty marred and does not look too great. No jets. Just you, your current best friends and some hot water. On the positive side, the ridiculous bass beat did make the water vibrate a bit. The Ugly: The staff here will lie right to your face. However, you cannot blame them. They are helpless when it comes to the music, etc. They will tell you it's going to end by 10pm...it went until 2am. The game seems to be to tell you what you want to hear because they have been here before and they know it's going to be a battle if they tell you the truth. If you're 21 years old or like to act like you are on occasion, then by all means stay here. It's perfect for that. If you want a place to stay in Las Vegas that offers some fun options but can also be a great place to recover from a night out on the town...do not stay here. The noise alone will make sleeping a problem unless you plan on sleeping from 2am to noon.

Gently correcting our unreasonable demands and with leisurely ease and elegant hand gestures she parried and deflected our frantic ninja style assault of credit cards and large wads of greasy cash as we battled each other and her to see who would be paying for this adventure. Our check in settled to a uneasy but sustainable Balkanized truce we where led like brain damaged patients to our room , I noticed that there was a huge silver metal pig in one corner and a black featureless wasp like feminine creature sat unmoving in a plush chair eternally poised to sip a nonexistent cocktail, I glimpsed a dinner room its candle operas spooling and tumbling in rivulets of melted wax and black coffin like chairs looking like something Edward scissor hands would envision, I turned and noticed a small white porcelain monkey gargoyle jiving me with hand signals. The DJ , all high school gothic and high cheekbones with long bangs smiled at me and waved his silver finger rings at me. I gave him the thumbs up and a Turkish military salute. I had to stop and think , had I taken blotter acid accidently again? Our room was a dazzling wonderful train wreck of silver purple and white leather. Clean towels as far the eye could see and giant baroque mod prim patterns. Big basin sinks and hypoallergenic white linen. Free Champaign and giant white bathtub, The d\u00e9cor could be a 80,s porno or a goth nightmare before Xmas or cutting edge gay LA chic, interpretation would depend on your age, education and level of inebriation. I found all three acceptable, stripped to my boxers and drank the bottle of FREE Champaign with copious amounts of ice and cranberries juice.

I was in a rush to check out (having spent several days there on business) and forgot to clean out one of the drawers I had used, which had some expensive clothing items in it. I realized my mistake when I got home four hours later, and immediately called the hotel. I was told that they would go and check my room and call me back. They didn't. I called back the next morning to ask if someone could please check my room or housekeeping so I could get my clothes back. I was told that my room still had not been cleaned yet, but I would be contacted. I was, once again, not called back, so a few hours later I called again. THEN I was told that housekeeping had not found anything left in my room, which I know for a fact is false. I know exactly what I left behind and where. Now, I know that it is my fault for leaving personal items behind, and that Rumor is not responsible for that. However, it is clear that someone in their housekeeping staff is untrustworthy and a thief. So, if you're planning on staying here, make sure you lock up your valuables, and you might even want to not unpack your clothes, but keep them locked in your suitcase. Since they have employed an untrustworthy person who is doing this when people accidentally leave things behind, it's likely this person will start taking things when people are still staying there.

If \"boutique hotel\" means that a property has a unique set of features that reflect its purpose and identity, then Rumor is a perfect example of the genre. The most distinctive feature of Rumor compared to the rest of Las Vegas properties is that it has no casino. Not even a little mini-casino. So if you really like the sound of a thousand people randomly ringing doorbells every time you walk from your room to the hotel exit, then Rumor is not for you, since there are no slot machines. The bar has some video poker action, but that's it for gambling. A related feature is that there is no indoor smoking, and indeed there are substantial financial penalties that will show up on your hotel bill if you smoke in the non-smoking areas. But the best feature of Rumor is the pool area. Rumor is arranged as a series of low buildings around a huge central courtyard area. One half of that area is dedicated to the large pool, hot tub, cabanas with televisions and couches, loungers, and occasionally open wet bar. The other half is dedicated to a large lawn surrounded by palm trees (with hammocks!) and a sound stage. If you think this sounds like a total party setup, you're right. There aren't parties all the time, but far more often than not there will be music outside, a DJ in the lobby, and revelers from Miami models to LA rockers to Jersey Shore refugees taking in the sun, the music, and the cocktails. Rumor is all about the pool scene, which means that the clientele are generally not American midwesterners on vacation with their families. Rather, you will mostly see younger people whose level of fitness is not simply measured by whether or not they can see their toes. It also means that Rumor is basically a party hub for the Las Vegas area, so you can't swing your suitcase around without hitting a DJ. Dance music is loud, especially if you are not at the party, and even more so if you weren't invited. But the dance music is just part of Rumor, and if you want a completely silent room, ask yourself why you chose Las Vegas rather than, say, a tent in the bottom of a canyon in Utah. If you want to minimize the noise, ask for a junior suite with skyline view, near the front entrance. Basically these rooms are the most insulated from the various party areas (lobby, pool, etc). The staff at Rumor are super friendly and helpful. However, they work a bit differently than at many hotels (particularly in the restaurant area). Rumor employees are always moving around helping people. They are not sitting around flipping through a magazine at the hostess stand. So, for example, if you want help at the restaurant (Addiction, which I review separately), walk in and sit down at the bar-height area or at a dining table, and someone will immediately help you. This may seem a little strange if you're expecting someone to be waiting nearby all the time, but it does not mean bad service. In fact Rumor has some of the best service I've seen at a property, which is all the more impressive because the property is managing parties, talent, different dining areas, safety, and registration all at once. A special note about room service: Rumor offers room service from Addiction (the hotel restaurant), including breakfast. In perhaps my favorite detail at Rumor, food and beverages are delivered without using trays. Instead, food and drink are packaged and carried neatly in containers and a tote bag. Having stayed at hundreds of properties around the world with decent room service, this is one of the few I've ever encountered that didn't leave behind a stupid tray that requires you to call for pickup to keep it from stinking up the room or cluttering the hallway. Simple genius, and much appreciated. Finally, there are some drawbacks to Rumor, mostly related to its distance from the strip. The valet service is helpful and prompt, and useful if you have your own vehicle. But if you're not planning ahead, getting a taxi is sometimes a pain. On at least two occasions I actually walked across the street to Hard Rock's taxi stand rather than wait at Rumor. But this is not a big issue. A bigger issue that is not a problem for me, but important to know if you are considering Rumor, is that it is not really a property for children. While they undoubtedly would learn a lot about the variety of people in the world, the property is much more of a playground for adults than for kids. On the other hand, if your dogs are your kids, you're in luck, because Rumor is super dog-friendly, up to and including the semi-chaotic \"Yappy Hour\" held occasionally in the lawn area for dogs and their people (yes, there is music for that, too). So, yes on dogs, no on children. Plan accordingly. But if you're traveling without kids, and you're at least fit enough to see your toes, plan to stay at Rumor when you're in Las Vegas.

Another tenant decided to create their own parking space; therefore, I couldn't get into to my car w/ out pain (I'm disabled and I had to crawl from the passenger seat to to driver's seat to get into my car. Yes, that was explained to Brittne). When I brought this up Brittne, she was rude, snappy, rolled her eyes at me and basically said oh well, I can't do anything about you being blocked in, the room situation or extend your check. She never apologized. I'm ok about my few dollars not being worthy to them... Never again.

We went for a combined business/ pleasure trip (my husband was there for business and I went along to relax).

When we arrived on a Tuesday- we thought we had found the perfect boutique hotel in Vegas. Great rooms with free wifi, a gorgeous open courtyard and pool area, and very accessible restaurant/ bar. The staff wax nice but not super on top of it- we had to call several times to have any requests responded to and they often gave us wrong info. The problems started on Thursday when I prepared for \"happy hour\". Basically, they invite people to bring there dogs (great idea) but then had a DJ playing the WORST kind of Vegas club music w speakers and volume as if she was playing for an audience of 600,000 at Madison square garden. I mean COME ON??!!!! the dogs were all going crazy and you literally couldn't have a conversation. I tried to escape back to my room, but the volume of the music was so freaking loud that the room was shaking. My dog hid under the bed, and I couldn't even hear someone on the other end of a phonecall or hear the tv at full volume over the horrible music. I had to wait it out and was miserable dnd angry. Little fix I know the onslaught would continue throughout HHS entire weekend. They hac this horrible Dj there the rest of the time, same volume. When we complained, they first kept lyi v about low long the Dj was playing, and then they said ghat they were a south beach style \"party hotel\" and were catering to the party crowd. I wish they'd take there heads out of their $$!#%'s and realize that they have no party criwd there and would get more business if they would correct this one horrible mistake. Honestly, the entire to E we were there, there wax never mire than like 5 sketchy lo-rent locals at their \"pool party\". It's not like there is a big demand for their bad parties. It I'd SUCH a shame bc if they would alter their marketing/ business plan a little and re-identify as a boutique of spa hotel this hotel would be awesome and I would recommend to everyone.

We even encouraged 2 other couples to stay with us at the hotel. So we were all set to enjoy the summer at Rumor. After our first stay we were told that we would gain an upgrade on our next trip if we wrote a review. We did so and after booking our hotel we inquired about this over the phone. Unfortunately nobody ever told us we had to make our reservation through the Rumor website. This is the 1st idea that we had that our 2nd trip wouldn't be as nice. With this aside we were still looking forward to staying at the Rumor again. Upon arrival at the hotel we were blown away. It was a weekend reserved for a private party at the pool for Matinee. We had no idea this was happening the weekend we were staying at the hotel. There was no mention on their website or anything. We are all super-duper gay friendly (Matinee is a LGBT organization) but we were looking forward to using the pool and come to find out we were informed that we would have to pay extra to use the pool. As a guest it should be free but this was not the case. We even had to pay the resort fee at the end of the weekend. We made no fuss of this upon check out as we knew the staff was overwhelmed from the whole weekend. Two days before arriving, our friend told us about the pool being closed for a private party (she had called for a quote on a cabana and the hotel informed her at this time that the pool had been rented out. We made multiple phone calls to the manager and left numerous phone messages but never heard back. Upon arrival the disorganization continued. Our room went uncleaned the second day despite vacating our room at 11 am and making sure that the \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign was removed from our door. We requested clean sheets several times but to no avail. We even said we would make the bed ourselves after being informed that the housekeeping had left for the day\u2026still no clean sheets. Then the ice machine buzzer started screaming at us which was very audible from our room. We alerted the front desk to this annoying disturbance but it went on screaming for hours until out of desperation one of the guests in a nearby room had the brilliant idea of just unplugging it. Peace at last. It may seem like we are picky and hard to please but we are very easy going people. We still had fun in Vegas despite all of these events. We had fun with our neighbors (or \u201cgay\u201dbors lol) and did our best to cope with 10 hours of straight techno that was so loud our walls and windows shook. We knew it was futile to complain about the volume of the music or try to get a room not directly on the pool. We get it ok\u2026massive pool party\u2026loud music\u2026can\u2019t change our room location\u2026.can\u2019t use the pool\u2026.but dropping the ball on cleaning our room? Staff was so busy that they were unable to return a phone call or small service requests should not be ignored if you want loyal customers instead of just a great place to party. During these events more staff should be brought it. The rooms are still nice and the regular staff is cool but the management needs to think about long term loyal repeat clients versus making a ton of money by privatizing an amenity that your regular hotel guests should also be entitled to. We should have been offered free entrance to the event but since we didn\u2019t book the room through Matinee we would\u2019ve had to pay 35.00 per person to get in. Staff arranged for regular guests to use the pool of a neighboring property but we decided just to bite the bullet and pay to get into the Hard Rock Hotel\u2019s pool which is just across the street.

He owned up to not meeting some basic expectations and cut us a deal on our rate, which was very fair.

In theory, its a great idea. In reality though, this place has a long way to go before it can really be considered a good alternative to the traditional Strip hotels, or even the Hard Rock right across the street. The rooms look interesting, although some would consider them a bit over done (looks like Z Gallerie threw up in there). The tub in the bedroom surrounded by mirrors is cool... But couldn't the hotel provide at least ONE tiny little bottle of bubble bath? Same goes for shampoo and conditioner- no where to be found. There is a space in the 'living' area that looks like it is made perfectly for a small refrigerator... But there isn't one in any of the rooms. The lack of mini fridge is a bit disappointing. I get it- we're supposed to go downstairs and buy our drinks/water from the bar but you know what? Sometimes if I wake up in the middle of the night and want a cold water, it'd be nice to just have a fridge so I don't have to drag myself all the way downstairs. I could go on about the rooms- the TVs were small and useless (but who comes to Vegas to watch TV anyway- must have been what they were thinking). The wallpaper was funky, but looked like it was put up by someone who was at least 3 feet too short for the job and didn't have access to a ladder - the stuff was literally coming off the walls at the corners. Everything just feels like it was done on the cheap here. Somewhat stylish- but cheap. Room service was hit and miss... The Waldorf salad was great. The sliders (both chicken and steak) were awful. The guy answering the phone for room service was very rude. I placed my order, then called again a few minutes later to add a fruit plate to the order. \"Yeah what's up?\" was how he answered the phone, then proceeded to act like he was doing me a big frickin' favor by adding a lousy fruit plate to my order that I had just placed a few minutes earlier. Message to that guy - learn how to talk on the phone buddy, especially when you're talking to the people who are indirectly paying your salary. The biggest issue I had was with the music. It started promptly at 1030am and was turned up so loud that I could feel the bass in my stomach as I was laying in bed (not hungover). Sort of like an unwanted wake up call. When you get down to the pool the surroundings are nice enough, they have cabanas and day beds but my god... That music literally drove me insane. It's one thing to be in a party atmosphere, its another to have your ear drums blown out by bad techno music. If you spend the entire day at the pool and in your room, you will find yourself driven to the brink of insanity by the nonstop bass unless you just get plastered and pass out or leave the hotel. I've been to just about every day club in Las Vegas ranging from Wet Republic to Marquee to Tao Beach and have never had my ears assaulted in such an awful way. Am I being nit-picky? Maybe. The thing is, this place is being marketed as a good alternative to staying at the bigger, more expensive Strip hotels. For it to be that alternative, it needs to be EXCEPTIONAL in every way. The service needs to be stepped up. The rooms need mini fridges and general touch ups on the decor. And for God's sake, turn down the damn music.

As far as the staff is concerned, they are the absolute top of the heap as far as customer service goes. I have never felt so taken care of as I have at the Rumor. Every little thing was taken care of, most of the time without me nor my companion needing to say anything. There were very few things that were not terrific about our stay, the paint was quite new in our room and there was a definite fresh paint smell everywhere in the building we were in. Also, I nearly lost a fight with the ultra modern shower controls trying to find the temperature I was comfortable with. Outside of that, an absolute dream and we have already booked our next week there!

I frequent Vegas a lot and usually stay on the Strip or on Fremont Street, and usually in \"no-frills\" casino hotels, as I prefer convenience of the location rather than a fancy room. But after seeing a story on the hotel last year, I thought I'd try something different. The hotel is quite trendy and caters to a younger audience. When we got in at noon on Saturday, the music at the pool was blaring full blast. We could hear the bass in our room, which was towards the end of the resort. Surprisingly, the pool was closed and the place fairly quiet during the evening hours. The hotel is still trying to find its groove among the young party-goers. It didn't seem too packed, either by the pool during the day, nor the bar late at night. And this was a holiday weekend! We stayed in a Deluxe Simple Suite with two queen beds. The rooms were stylishly designed in purple and white. The beds and pillows were heavenly! The couch in the living room area wasn't all that comfortable, so I mostly spent time in their comfy beds. There is indeed an adult channel (Channel 69) available, which was amusing, as most of it seemed to be dated from the 80s or 90s. It was also nice to not have to walk through the labyrinth of a casino to get back to our room at night. Small gripes would be that upon arrival we had no TV remote for the bedroom or living room, and when we tried to call the front desk, we discovered the phone didn't work. Thankfully, it didn't take too long for maintenance to rectify our issues. Also, the ice machine located in our building never worked during our entire stay, and we didn't feel motivated to go searching another building for a one that functioned. Valet was hard to track down upon our arrival, and when we were ready to grab a taxi and hit the strip, they were too busy with incoming guests. We ended up walking to the Hard Rock across the street, which was no big deal. I had read that there used to be a no food/drink policy for the rooms, but this has since been lifted. All in all, it was a fun to try out, but it probably won't be my \"go-to\" choice, as I prefer the convenience of staying right on the Strip or on Fremont Street. I may look into it again if I ever have a specific need to see a concert at the Hard Rock, or if the price is right for my travel dates.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cThe Greatest Wedding we could ask for. Rumor Staff = Family\u201d", "Author": "TonyL78", "ReviewID": "UR110181914", "Content": "First off, if I could give RUMOR 10 STARS I would. My Fiance and I were looking for a place to hold out Big Day (Wedding) and we were searching places in our home town of Boston when we finally agreed it would make better sense to hold our wedding in Vegas, since most of our friends now reside in California and Las Vegas. Having nearly 20 long vacations in Las Vegas personally (my best friend/best man resides there), I had a good idea of which venues to look at. Then, a curveball happened. We came across Rumor Boutique online. Judging by the website this had everything we were looking for. It is hip, hot, and close to the strip. My best man made a stop by and said it was awesome. Then, our wedding photographer called us from Vegas, while doing another photo shoot in Vegas and did a recon mission himself. He called us at 3 am EST and said we were going to LOVE RUMOR. So far so good. Little did I expect when we got there just how much RUMOR WOULD BLOW US AWAY. Let me start by saying that the communication of the Events Director Susan Hall and the wedding coordinator Joni Mitchel was on another level. Being 3,000 miles away and coordinating your wedding can make a stressful situation worse, however this was not the case. The immediate and thorough communication that these two amazing woman maintained with us during the entire process was the equivalent to speaking to them in person. OUTSTANDING is the only word that comes to mind. It gets better. My first day there, I bumped into this strapping young lad of a Food and Beverage Director by the name of Benjamin Ortiz. We immediately connected on multiple levels due to the fact that Ben is originally from Queens. Several Yankees and Red Sox jabs later and it's safe to say that not only did BEN ORTIZ and KATIE CALVERT help make our Wediing the GREATEST DAY OF OUR LIVES, but they also became family to us. You see that is what separates Rumor from any other wedding venue that I or any of our friends or family have attended before. THEY CARE. THEY MAKE SURE THAT YOU NOT ONLY GET WHAT YOU WANT, BUT THEY MAKE YOU NEVER WANT TO LEAVE. fROM THE CLEANING CREW, TO THE OWNERS, they all know who you are and genuinely care and love their jobs. It is the most professional AND most relaxed environment any of us have ever been to. My God! I forgot the FOOD! To die for. The rehearsal dinner we had a gathering of close to 20 people and many of our friends and family are already married. They said it was by far THE GREATEST MEAL THEY HAD EVER HAD AT A WEDDING. The Chef and staff comes out to also make sure that everything is to your liking. Carey the bartender is the man. No if ands or buts. One of the best bartenders in Vegas. Jonathon from security is the MAN! Heart of Gold. BOTTOM LINE. The entire wedding party is already rebooking for next May to return to Rumor. We are going to turn it into an annual tradition for our group of 40 to return to Rumor and there is a reason for that. RUMOR = HOME To Susan, Joni, Carey, John, Katie and BEN. You just added 40 people to your family, and if you visit us, you have a family in Boston waiting to see you. GO TO RUMOR AND THANK ME LATER.

The front-desk person on the phone couldn't answer any of my questions and really didn\u2019t seem interested in helping me upgrade to a better room. There was no wait to check in, but we had problems with our first room. We had requested a \"patio' and were given a 2nd story room. Our phone didn't work. We returned to the lobby and were assigned a new room on the first floor. A bottle of wine was waiting for the birthday boy in the reserved room, which was a really nice gesture. We had to sign a waiver that no outside food or drink was to be brought in yet 20 minutes later guests were being taken to their room by staff with the luggage cart filled with a cooler and bags of food. I asked about the policy and was told by management that they couldn't really enforce it. There is no fridge in the room so we had to improvise with the \"ice in the sink\" bottle chiller method. We had no tub in our room - just a \"rain\" (more accurately \"mist\") shower with weak water pressure. The water-closet door was hung askew and wouldn\u2019t latch closed. We requested an iron, an ironing board, additional hangers and additional towels (to accommodate the 4-guest occupancy that we had reserved and paid for) and these were delivered to us. I was never able to connect to WiFi from the room or from the lobby. On the plus side, the beds and linens were comfortable. Service varied. One morning we sat ourselves for breakfast and walked out about 15 minutes later as we had been ignored by staff. There were a couple of people seated at the bar and that was it. The bartender wouldn't acknowledge us nor would any other staff walking past. Other times Ben made sure we were well taken care of in the restaurant. The valets were friendly and it was easy to walk out and get a cab. It was a cold, windy November weekend that we were there so we couldn't enjoy the pool. We nicknamed Rumor the \"coke and poke\".

Restaurant food and service were enthusiastic and mostly good, if a little uneven (they're still a new crew, so I won't hold that against them). TIP: A club vibe is helped along by house music piped into the common restaurant/pool area. If you want to head to bed before 11pm, bring earplugs or request a room without that view. The only downside is the location -- far enough from the Strip, Monorail and Convention Center that a taxi ride is usually more realistic than walking. But given the reasonable room rates and calm in the middle of Vegas' usual overstimulation, that's a tradeoff I'm happy to make.

After we left, we found ourselves wishing we had booked Rumor for our entire stay. We arrived around 1:00, so ended up having lunch at Addiction and then lounging in the hammocks until check in. There was a little wait at check in, but otherwise went smoothly. Our room was clean and comfortable, with an elevated soaking tub and a rain shower. The hotel is in the flight path for the airport, so there is a lot of air traffic, but we couldn't hear it in our room. Bed was large and comfortable. Decor throughout the property was posh and modern. The pool was under construction while we were there, which was a bummer, and I wish we would have known that in advance. The front desk did say we could show our room keys at the hotel across the street for access to their pool during our stay, although we didn't take advantage of that option. The pool area looks like it will be fabulous when it's completed. We did some relaxing in the hammocks in the courtyard a few times, which was nice in lieu of the pool. It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the Strip (straight up E Harmon), or about an $7-8 cab ride if you don't feel like walking. What really made our experience great was our interactions with the staff. I need to eat gluten free (no wheat or wheat flour, rye, barley), which makes eating while travelling nightmarish. Many restaurants aren't familiar with what that means, or don't understand the importance of avoiding cross contamination during prep and cooking. From our first meal at Rumor's restaurant, Addiction, Ben Ortiz assured me he understood and would notify the chef and staff of my needs. From that meal on, they went out of their way to make sure what I was eating was safe for me. They let me know what dishes were 'safe' for me to eat as they were, and which dishes could be modified so that they would be ok. We ended up eating most of our meals at Addiction during our stay, because it was the only place we encountered during our trip that I knew they really understood and were looking out for me and my health. Having worked in the food industry in the past, I know it can be a pain in the @ss to accomodate someone with a food allergy or intolerance. They really went above and beyond for me, and I can't tell you how much I appreciated the peace of mind knowing that I could eat a meal without fear of getting sick. (Also, my husband and I both thought the food was all great, and reasonably priced.) In addition to Ben, Victor and Katie also made our experience more pleasurable, with Victor also watching out for my gluten-free needs, and both Victor and Katie recommending some delicious cocktails for us throughout our stay. The personal advantage of staying in a boutique hotel was magnified by our interactions with these three, in particular. We did notice a few hiccups throughout our stay that seemed to be related to new staffing, but overall, we thought Rumor was a great value and we would definitely stay there again the next time we are in Vegas.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chino, California", "Title": "\u201cThis is an upscale version of Motel 6 with ZGalleri decor.\u201d", "Author": "Daisy4yoo", "ReviewID": "UR103064738", "Content": "This is not your regular Vegas hotel.

I booked through Expedia.com, a website that I have booked through at least 20+ times with no problems. We didn't arrive in Vegas until 7.00pm, so were hoping the check in process would be short and sweet, and we could get out on the town. Good thing I hadn't made any reservations for dinner or a show that night, as the check in process was not a breeze, to say the least. First of all when we arrived at the hotel, there was no valet person in sight, and we couldn't seem to find any self parking either. We ended up finding a parking space in a spot with a \"DO NOT PARK,....YOU MIGHT BE TOWED\" sign. My boyfriend stayed in the car so that we didn't get towed, and I went to check in. When I got inside I was really impressed by the decor and atmosphere of the lobby. When I went to the front desk, and since there was no line, I was helped immediately, yet unfortunately they didn't have a reservation for me in their system. I had my confirmation from Expedia, and showed it to the front desk woman (who was very nice), the manager (Michael, who was also very nice) realized there was an issue, and left for about 20 minutes to try and resolve the problem. I had specifically mentioned to the lady that we had booked a deluxe room, and they could tell that I was getting frustrated, so they offered to put me up in the hotel next door, however if I had wanted to stay there, then I would have booked there in the first place! I asked about parking, and was told that they only had valet that weekend since they were so busy. Finally we were allowed to check in to a room, however upon entering the room, it was obvious that this was not a deluxe room, I was already on the verge of tears after all of the hassle we had gone through. Also we looked out our window at a horrible view of an empty parking lot. If they were really that busy that they had to do valet parking, then why was this lot so empty? I contacted the manager directly from my cell phone, as he gave me his business card. He was with another guest when I called, but I was told he would call me right back on the room phone. He did call me right back, but unfortunately the room phone did not work, so I couldn't answer his call. He did come to the room, and offered us $70 in food vouchers for the restaurant, and we stayed in the room. When we arrived at the restaurant there was nobody in sight, we stood there for a while, and were about to leave when a lady peaked out of the kitchen, and asked if she could help us, we asked if they were even open, she said yes. A few minutes later the hostess came out. The food at the restaurant was mediocre. Skip the appetizers, we had the tuna and the chicken satay, both were not the best, I had the burger, which I order medium, but came rare. I am not picky about this sort of thing, so ate it anyhow, it was okay. My boyfriend ordered the pork, I wish I would have too. Other than the sauce, which was over caramelized, it was delicious. Room was nice, you can tell this place has a lot of potential, but there is a lot of work to do.

Also this was the first time I have ever experienced having to agree that we would not bring in any food or drink from outside the property into our room. Valet took our luggage to our room and when we entered, it was clear it had not been cleaned as the bed was not made. The smell in the hallways was musty..... We were then upgraded to another room although I couldn't really see a difference. In this room the toilet paper holder had been pulled out of the wall and sitting on the flush. We left and went to the strip. We also noted that portions of the pool area appeared tobe under construction and not available for use. A few hours later we received a call from our friends who also checked in and found their room dirty with dirty towels laying on the floor. One customer was upset about the pool availability and was told they could go across the street to the Hard Rock and use their facility. Nice - not! So at this point we decided if this is any indication of our stay we needed to move to another hotel. When we got back to the hotel to discuss with the front desk there were at least 4 other people sharing very similar experiences either room not clean or room was not what was reserved.

We didn't experience any noise issues, but those who might be sensitive to noise should consider requesting a room on the other side of the pool from the lobby. We ate at the restaurant and enjoyed our food (we weren't blown away, but it was good), but found the dining room deserted almost the entire time. The bad part: Cleanliness and housekeeping were abysmal. We arrived around 7:00 pm and there were still housekeeping carts blocking the hallway, multiple ugly storage closets were left standing wide open with no one around, there was trash piled outside courtyard rooms that no one bothered to pick up, and we found garbage in the hallway outside of our room. (The front desk sent someone to pick up the garbage at our request.) Inside the room, we found towels on the couch (luckily they were clean), the carpeting was in need of vacuuming (doesn't the staff notice that dust is highly visible on dark carpet?), the tub area had a long-standing layer of dust that discouraged me from even using it, and the closet door was left wide open. I seriously doubt that they did anything more than change the sheets and put the remote control on the bedside table when they \"cleaned\" the room. Further, the phone didn't work unless the handset was seated in the cradle just so to charge. When the phone finally charged and we called for breakfast rooms service, our three attempts to place our order went unanswered. Finally we just went down to the restaurant in person because we assumed it was busy and found that there was only ONE table with diners.

From the outside you might be enticed by their so called \"posh\" look. But once you finally get to your room, that is if you get to it, it is probably not what you are going to expect like the experience I had! My wife and I booked a two night stay here through Hotels.com because they advertised pretty well and the pictures didn't look too shaby at all. But we shure were fooled! When we arrived it turned out check in time wasn't till 3pm and they were understaffed apparently because the bell boy/girl was doing her job and tending their ridiculous bar! Anyways, when we got to our room it was literally not cleaned; the house keeping girl was (who looked like she was 16 years of age) still cleaning up our room! This made my wife and I real disappointed. I am usually against discrimination but for this review I have to say that when I go to a hotel I expect to see housekeeping \"ladies\" (between her late 30's/40's) with experience not housekeeping girls who are barely 18 years of age! But going back to the room situation, we went back down to the front desk to get a new room. Once we mentioned to the front desk dude that are room wasn't even ready he put on this phony look of shock, which he probably wouldn't of displayed if there wasn't a line waiting to check in! So he told us he was sorry and gave us a new room which was supposed to be an \"upgrade\" from his words, trying to make us feel better. Though yet again, disapointment was on its way. The only real \"upgrade\" that we got in the new room is that we didn't find housekeeping in it! It was pretty much the same room as the first with just a slightly larger bed and only one dirty towel left in it! We tried our hardest to make the most of what we got for our money but in the end we still got ripped off on our $120 stay for two nights. So don't be fooled about this joke of a hotel.

I really wish we wouldn\u2019t have given them a chance! When we arrived, they were nice enough to upgrade us to a room facing the courtyard. Sweet! We were just going to drop off our stuff, then head out for the day. When we got to the room, there were no tissues, toilet paper, and no robes like we were told were included in the resort fee. So a call to the front desk, saying we were just leaving and if they could leave them in the room for us would be great. No big deal. We return to change for dinner 3 hours later, and nothing was done. Annoying, but still no big deal. Another call to the desk and a promise to send it up right away. We left for dinner for the night thinking all was set. When we returned for the night much later, still nothing. I headed to the desk to ask in person, and they assured me it would be sent up right away. Eventually it arrived, but it took 3 requests for things that should have already been in the room! We decided to meet some friends at the bar for a night cap. There was some sort of party going on in the restaurant/bar/lobby area which was fine, we would take our drinks outside next to the fire pit and enjoy the outside seating area. I approached the bar, and was ignored for a few minutes even though there are 2 bartenders working and the bar is fairly small. A guy pushed his way in front of me and shouted his drink order to the bartender, and he quickly made his drink while still ignoring me. When I gave the guy a frustrated look, he told me not to give him attitude, because his friends had rented out the whole bar, and I should be lucky enough to be allowed to hang out with them. The bartender heard this and just laughed and laughed, while still ignoring my attempts to order a few drinks. We left, headed over to the Hard Rock and tried to forget about Rumor. We returned around 2am to find neighbors smoking pot on their balcony and carrying on pretty loudly. The walls in this place are paper thin; you can literally hear quiet, normal conversations as if they are taking place in your room. We wouldn\u2019t mind the noise at midnight, but at 4am, we were over it. Attempting to call the front desk was useless, as the phone in the room doesn\u2019t work. I called from my cell phone, and after 5 minutes of back and forth with the operator, she finally understood that I was actually a guest IN the hotel. When their security finally arrived, instead of knocking on their door, he shouted at them from the courtyard. Seriously? They talked for a good 10 minutes. Finally the music turned down, and we were able to get a few hours of sleep while on a contact high from our neighbors pot wafting into our room. When we woke up we packed and left. I wanted to discuss some of these issues with the front desk, but I handed over my keys and received \u201cDoyouneedacopyofyourrecipt?No? NEXT!\u201d The rooms are cool, and the price is right, but don\u2019t rely on service or amenities. The noise from the planes is LOUD as well.

So I lucked up coming across this hotel on the internet. It was the colors that caught my eye. But boy was I in for a surprise when I got here... when we walked in, the chic look and swank boutique style was quite impressive. It was bold it was edgy, it was different. The actual 5 stars are really dedicated to the management and staff. From the valet to the front desk we were greeted with a smile and an \"un-rehersed\" good afternoon and welcome. Everything came natural. I cannot say enough good things about Matthew K. the GM. He is the posterchild for customer service at its best! There was no accommodation he could not meet, and never once were we treated like guests in his presence...he treated us like FAMILY. Everytime he saw us he made it his business to stop and talk to us, ask if we needed anything, gave us suggestions on where to go and what to do. He really made this trip extra special for me and from the bottom of my heart I want to give a big THANK YOU for everything. You are one in a million and every establishment should have a Matthew K. There were other stars as well like our breakfast buddy Jama, the wonderful chef Derrick that came out to greet us AND gave me a recipe that my kids will love. My all time favorite bar stars Carey and Brian who knew exactly what we wanted and were great at what they do(thanks for the fresh strawberry daiquiri..no mix needed! @Carey) We tested this hotel at every level from front desk to security to housekeeping to room service to the restaurant and bar and everyone passed with flying colors. For those of you complaining about the hotel I think you should check your reservations again because that CANNOT be the same place that I stayed. And if it is, I would say give them another chance!

I stayed here for ten days with my 3 dogs while recovering from surgery, and it was one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had.\u00a0 Unless you bring a pet, you would never know you're in a pet friendly hotel -the rooms are as clean and fresh as can be and everything is so comfortable you almost feel at home in the deluxe suites.\u00a0 If you are traveling with a pet, I dare you to find another posh spot that is so comfortable and accomodating for you and your furry friends! First of all, my pooches are NOT the most popular breeds in relations to people - most Chihuahua's and miniature pinschers end up in the pounds! Mine can be skittish at times, especially around men, but they were greeted by Matthew the magnetic dog-loving General Manager, and given such a warm greeting that I was scared they were going to run home with him instead of staying with me! When it comes to pet-lovers, Matthew is in the top 1%, so you can be sure you're in the right hands at Rumor! The dog run with fake fire hydrant is a hoot and the boys loved going in there and doing their business several times a day. Never did I ever feel I was an inconvenience on any of the staff or guests for having dogs. I - and I'm sure they as well! - can't wait to go back and stay at Rumor!\u00a0 There are really so many wonderful things to say about this place in comparison to the casino hotel experience, it makes reviewing the hotel difficult in less than 1000 words! The Valet guys are MAGNIFICIENT & Dog lovers as well! There's no reason to park your car yourself because Kyle & friends have their pulse on everything you need. Also, its so much easier to just get out of the front door of the hotel than your large casinos - and THAT is a breath of fresh air!\u00a0 The $50 a day refundable incidental charge is actually laughable. I thought it was unnecessarily laughable in the beginning, then laughable when I left because I think I spent more money on the food and hanging out with Ben - the restaurant manager - than I did on the room! The food & dining experience alone deserve their own separate review - no joke. I actually live in vegas and since I had all of my girlfriends visiting me and dining with me, they are constantly bugging me to go back on a daily basis because the \"mac Styx\" (basically xxxtra large cheese stick-looking things that are filled with yummy penne mac & cheese!) have become a severe addiction for all of us! Hmmmm....maybe THATS why thats the name of the restaurant! Hahaha! The TAPATIZERS are all \"to die for\", but if you want the honest truth about anything on the menu, just ask Ben Ortiz and he will set you and your friends up with one of the greatest dining experiences you can have in vegas! They have happy hour specials on TAPATIZERS, but I would have gladly GLADLY paid twice the price instead of half! Yes, people!, they are THAT GOOD! Try the \"Short & Sweet\" and the \"Waldorf Salad\" is amazing, too! I ate one every day! Breakfast is ridiculous. I don't eat eggs, but Rumor can change all of that - even in me! Their \"scramble\" is amazing and don't even mention the breakfast sliders - a culinary feat like no other!!! Basically, just go see Ben & you'll see for yourself! I'm making \"Addiction\" @ rumor my favorite new vegas eatery! Now I would like to comment on some other reviews at this point - ones that I'd read before I stayed at rumor. Basically, this is not your grandma's hotel - well, it can be, if you have an awesome Hip Granny. Of course there is music and there is noise - hello People! You came to vegas for peace and quiet? Give me a break. Who actually does that, truthfully, anyway. The place is new, clean, the beds are comfortable & they have down pillows! Matthew is very attentive and eager to cater to your every whim! I felt like I was in a more intimate version of a two-story \"Four Seasons\" when it came to service and hospitality! The staff really believe in what they are representing and the energy in this place is clean and wholesome - unlike MANY of the casinos you can stay in in vegas. Basically, for me, there will never be another option but Rumor & since I know they are accommodating to parties and weddings, I think I'll be having a birthday party there soon!

I think this hotel has potential but we didn't have a very good stay with them. My husband and I booked this hotel, not having ever heard of it. Up front the hotel looks great. Small, easy to get around and it looks just as fun and modern as the pictures. First off there was a huge party going on in the lobby, which was fine no big deal other than it was really loud and we could here it in our building ( 3 buildings away). We got to our room and it was dirty. The floors were NOT vacumned the floor in the bathroom hadn't been swept, there was something smeared on the door to the bathroom and cigarrette ashes in the ash tray outside still. And there were ashes in the drawers. Our phone didn't work at all so I had to call the number from my own phone in the morning and ask for housekeeping to come clean. Well we were gone all that day and came back to a still dirty room. So I went and talked to the front desk, who was very nice and had housekeeping go up and clean. And I talked to the GM who compensated us for the hassel. So my husband and I waited outside till we saw the housekeeper come back. And we went up and the floors were still a mess, we didn't have anything taken care of but our bed made with new sheets and new towels put in the bathroom. It was really frustrating. Luckily that was our last night and we decided we would take care of it in the morning when we checked out. We ate at Addiction (the restaurant) that morning and the food was great presented beautifully and very filling. Then we proceeded to check out and found out there was a $35 charge for \"Resort Fees\" for access to the pool and internet, the valet service they provide and a bunch of other stuff that we were told was free upfront when we got there - which was aggrivating to not know that beforehand. All in all I am really disappointed with this hotel. I think they have a lot going for them but are lacking in some areas as well. The valet parking was nice to have, Addiction the restaurant was great, the rooms were put together nicely and the bathroom was fun and modern with a bowl sink and a rain shower head. The staff was very friendly and helpful. And the bed and pillows were really comfortable. Housekeeping was terrible.. worst I've ever seen in all my traveling, the hidden fees were frustrating and the hotel is right by the airport which is noisy since the planes come in right over head.

Other than that, my experience was not so pleasant at this place. First, let me unveil some hidden policies for you since you won't find them out until you check in. (No, it's not even in the reservation confirmation email) 1. $50 refundable deposit per night - this was not mentioned in the reservation email I received. I wasn't sure if this is for the guests with dogs or everyone else. 2. No outside food and drink - I had to initial my name next to this policy. I was really put off by this policy. I traveled with my dogs. I wouldn't leave them in the room by themselves and I can't bring food and drinks into the hotel? Even though the hotel has a restaurant but what if I am on a special diet? My husband and I had to eat in the car because of this stupid policy. I am sure Westin (also allows dogs) wouldn't mind us eating in the room. 3. $11 a night resort fee - again.. this was not mentioned and I wasn't sure what this was for. I guess to clean up the mess after the guests' dogs make a mess? 4. The room you requested may not b available - this is quite common with other hotels. However, I didn't understand why it is available all of sudden after we insisted to have the room we requested. Besides these hidden policies, my last night there was horrible. They set up a restaurant bar area near the front desk which is 3 rooms down the hallway from where we stayed. During our last night, they had a D.J and a party going all the way to 1 AM. The music was so loud and I couldn't sleep in my room. When I called the front desk, he told me that I could move to a quieter location with bellman's help. It was almost midnight so my choices were either packing up now or suck it up? I have never encountered this type of service in a hotel. I don't know if I checked into a hotel or a night club.

The pool area is really nice, with a pool and spa, comfy lounger beds, and staff on hand to take drinks orders etc. The biggest issue we had was the music. The bar and pool area are right in the centre of the complex, and the hotel pumps dance music out from morning to night. It's impossible to get away from. If you have a hangover and want an afternoon nap, or want a quiet night in after a big party night, you're not going to get it. The music didn't stop til 11pm - ok, understandable for Fri and Sat but not a Sunday when we needed a night off. I had earplugs but the music was so loud they didn't help one bit. Because of the music I have to say I wouldn't stay here again, despite the rest of the experience being pretty good.

I had the pleasure of meeting Rob the GM not your typical GM he was friendly yes that's right friendly, he sat down and spoke with us for a while he mingled with guest and I even saw him clear dishes off a table. With that attitude alone you should check the place out. Our room was nicely decorated with a upscale modern decor. When I opened the curtains one morning I honestly forgot I was in Vegas it reminded me so much of the Caribbean; sand, grass, palm trees and hammocks. It was great! We had dinner at the restaurant Chef Vic is crazy amazing with his food. You have to try the short ribs with candied yams, sliders, sticky chicky, fried Mac and cheese. Not only is the food amazing the service Chef Vic and Paul gave was phenomenal. We have found our new local get away. Congrats to the entire Rumor family.

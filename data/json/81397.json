My room on the second floor was just off the elevators. I was concerned about noise but did not hear a thing. The room was twice the size of my home's master bedroom with a walk-in closet larger than some NYC apartments. The king bed was extremely comfortable, the desk substantial, and the bathroom well-stocked with beautifully fragranced Le Labo toiletries. Check-in was easy and the staff were polite, adding my President's Club number after the planner forgot to include it, ensuring I would get free phone and wireless, and access to the health club. Housekeeping was immaculate. A buffet for the 500 people attending our meeting featured a wide variety of well-prepared \"Around the World\" foods and drinks. The meeting room was comfortable, including the temperature, which in many hotels is either too hot or too cold. Had I known portions at the Tonga Room, a throwback to the old tiki bar and restaurant days, were so large, I would not have ordered an appetizer. The food was good. The Tonga Room was loaded with tourists who took photos during the quarter-hour indoor rainstorms, and the band in the floating thatch-hut stage was quite good, as was the food. The breakfast buffet in the Laurel Court Restaurant and Bar was pricey, but worth it, with ample offerings including omelets, pancakes, french toast, a variety of pastries, fruit smoothies, yogurt parfaits with granola, and excellent juices and coffee. Service was very efficient without being intrusive. What keeps me from giving the hotel a five \"star\" rating? Two channels on the flat screen digital TV did not come in at all or were pixelated and unwatchable. I'm not talking about the Golf Channel -- it was the San Francisco ABC and NBC network affiliates. I also could not access the wireless service at all and used my aircard, which brought up another issue. Probably due to the city's hills, Verizon and AT&T service are not the best at the hotel. Being a pre-tech property, it was difficult to conveniently plug in my phone, laptop and iPad, though housekeeping would have no problem plugging in a vacuum, as the receptacles were all inches off the floor, but not near the desk. It took a significant amount of time for the hot water to make it to the second floor, but once it got there, the shower was marvelous. Spa treatments were limited to facials, a couple of back and body scrubs, waxing, and sports, Swedish and deep tissue massages. I hoped for more variety in the massages. Yes, that last point is probably nitpicking. Would I stay here again? Most definitely. There are two cable car lines serving the hotel, and if you're ambitious, you can walk downhill a little over a mile to Fisherman's Wharf and a little further to Ghiradelli Square. Take the cable car back (for $6). I'm glad my company chose the Fairmont for its meeting. My only regret is that I only spent two nights there. One tip: take the shuttle back to the airport. At $14, it was a bargain compared to the $55 it cost for my cab ride into the city.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morristown, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous Hotel and Great Service\u201d", "Author": "Jene74", "ReviewID": "UR126873329", "Content": "We recently stayed here for a conference and the hotel was absolutely beautiful!

We were planning a special weekend to celebrate an anniversary, and after a recent visit to SF where I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that we should stay in the SoMa and Union Square areas. The Fairmont San Francisco is only a few blocks away, but feels a world apart. The stunning building is a beauty to see, especially lit up at night! Walking into the majestic lobby felt special every time we returned to the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c lots of history was made here! There was no line for check-in, and it was friendly and efficient \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were off to our room within minutes. We stayed in the Tower Building, a short walk from the lobby but home to some of the best views in the hotel, as it extends more than 20 floors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much higher than the historic building. If you have the option for a discounted upgrade during booking or check-in, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely worth it to upgrade to this tower since the views are extraordinary from atop the hill \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much better than anything I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve experienced at the Westin, W, or St. Regis during previous stays in the city. I used one of my Fairmont upgrade certificates for this stay. The rooms have great bathrooms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we like the new Rose toiletries that Fairmont has switched to. The living areas are traditional and well-furnished - representative of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153casual luxury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that Fairmont is known for. The bed was extremely comfortable. The fitness centre is well equipped with modern equipment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a steam and sauna. I would have liked for it to be open past 7pm on the weekends, but we had evening plans anyways! Signing up for free with Fairmont\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Presidents Club program gets you free Internet and the option of getting a reebok gym outfit to use during your stay. We had a great breakfast at Laurel Court on Sunday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was reasonably priced at $30 and I was happy that they had gluten free options! If you feel like an adventure, go down to Market Street to Dottie's True Blue Cafe - where we went on Saturday. I'd agree that it's the best breakfast in San Francisco, but it's a pretty sketchy area - we were harassed by at least 5 people walking down the street. We arrived by 8am to avoid a 1+ hour wait. The Tongo room in the basement looked like a really unique place to dine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a chance to make it down there. For a special dinner, head 2 blocks away to Keiko a Nob Hill \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of the best meals of my life and very reasonable for the quality of food you will get ($85 for 7 course tasting menu) A lot of people mentioned the parking costs, so I planned to return my rental after dropping off luggage, but Avis nearby didn't allow after-hours rentals. If you have a rental car and arrive too late to return it before the morning, there is garage just one block up California which is $34 for 12 hours.

The front desk gentleman and the bell service were very polite and helpful with our needs and questions. We were booked in the Tiburon Suite which was amazing! The room was huge with a corner view of the city, we could see the bay bridge as well as the Golden Gate from the 20th floor. The room came equipped with a telescope so you could read even the street signs far below and plan our route to Chinatown.

The towels were great, the robes were great, the bed was comfy. Their were 2 air temp control buttons in the room, 1 for the living room and 1 for the bedroom. There was a mini bar which we did not use but no fridge to add our own items. If needed, I'm sure the hotel would have brought us one.

The check-in clerk was friendly, however, recommended a very touristy restaurant, after we specifically asked for a non-tourist place to celebrate our special occasion. We then asked 2 concierges to help us with restaurant reservations. They were not helpful at all considering this is supposed to be a world class hotel. One was new and had no experience, the other wasn't interested in helping us nor did he seem to know much about SF restaurants. We were shocked at the lack of service provided. We ended up doing everything on our own and even got in to a restaurant that both concierges said we'd never get in. The guest room itself was small, stuffy, and smelled bad. The bathtub had hair in it. We went to the Tonga Bar however, didn't stay. We just wanted to have a glass of champagne and it was too crowded and noisy. Our brunch the next morning for 5 was good and the service at Laurel Court was also good.

This visit I wanted to spoil myself and splurge on a nice weekend at a grand San Francisco hotel. At 106 year old, The Fairmont is the Grande Dame of San Francisco and was the obvious choice. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappointed! I reserved a main bldg 2 room suite for a 3 day weekend get away, Feb 24-27. I found the rates reasonable for what you got and the location, for a suite I paid $390 + 55 tax per night. The hotel upgraded me to a Tower Suite on the 23rd floor. The views were incredible. No hotel in San Francisco can come close to views from The Fairmont Tower. Period. Views of The Golden Gate, Alcatraz, Coit Tower, The TransAmerica Pyramid, the Bay Bridge and the entire skyline. Sunrises and sunsets are amazing. Each room has a telescope to see the sights. From my suite I could even see what people were drinking at The Top of The Mark. The suite was huge, beautifully decorated with a gorgeous marble bath. Everything in the room was in perfect order. I was able to check in early at noon and check out 2 hours late with no problem. Geoffrey, at the front desk was fantastic. The entire staff was friendly and eager to help. The lobby is incredible and the roof gardens are a sanctuary in the city. Every morning, I ate the breakfast buffet in the Laurel Court Restaurant. The food was very good with a lot of variety. The omelet chef even remembered what I liked after the first day. All my local friends joined me at the hotel for breakfast. At $30, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bargain and convenient. I doubt you could find brunch for less. Plus I never ate lunch because of my big breakfast. I also had room service twice for a late supper; the food was fast and tasty. The cost was no more than going out to eat and so much easier when your tired. I also took advantage of the spa and had a great massage. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice to spoil yourself. If you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been to SF, it is expensive. Everything is. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need a car, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring one. Parking is not cheap. However the in/out valet parking at The Fairmont is cheaper than other Nob Hill hotels. The in/out privilege means you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay extra to actually use your car. You can rent a car for a day trip at the hotel or off Union Square for less than the price to park one. Cabs are generally available and reasonable but they can be hard catch away from the hotel district and slow to come when you call. You can reserved a Town Car though several services (like Quicksilver or Ubercar) for not much more than a cab and you have a guaranteed ride in style. Also get a Munipass so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay $6 each time you ride the cable cars. You can catch all 3 cable car lines at The Fairmont, the only place in town they all cross. Take the California Cable Car down to the Ferry Building (the view is incredible) to shop and the catch the F line trolley to Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf or to the Castro. Location is so important when you travel; The Fairmont is close to everything. The Fairmont is beautiful grand hotel from a different time where the staff takes pride in this grand icon of San Francisco and the privilege of working there.

I must say however if you do come to San Francisco, check out the Tonga Room if nostalgia is your thing...but you don't have to torture yourself by staying here. The checkout is the usual minibar charges for things you didn't have, because you touched the silly cheap refridgerator. Also you have to get your own ice down the hall, like Motel 6.

This is a 3 star hotel, and never should be considered if you care about service, food, and a good nights sleep.

Paid approximately $300 per night NOT including daily parking fee....I'll get to that. Overall it was a pleasant enough stay. The location was great. The lobby was beautiful. My check in was fast and easy. We got there very early and feared we wouldn't be able to check in for a few hours but they let us get our room at 11am. I think this exception was made bc I signed up for the \"President Members\" program or whatever it's called before my trip (it's free -do it if you are planning on staying at a Fairmont Hotel). My room wasn't as big as I thought it would be but according to seasoned San Fran travelers the Fairmont has some of the bigger rooms in the city. Even so, felt a tad cramped but this wasn't a big deal. Grief #1 - we had dinner reservations in town first night and needed a cab to take us there. Got down to lobby 20 minutes prior to reservation. It took the doorman exactly 20 minutes to get us a cab. A lined approximately 16 people deep formed (and I was close to the front of this line) and the Fairmont staff failed to get additional doormen or staff to assist the mounting line in getting their transportation. For a hotel with this type of service reputation I would assume management would act to triage the situation such as this. Sadly, nothing was fixed and the lone doorman was left fighting to get guests cars from the parking lot, greet arriving and returning guests as well as trying to flag down Taxis all at the same time. Needless to say we were late for our dinner but gladly our reservation was still honored. Grief # 2 - my wife and I went to the Laurel Court bar for a pre dinner drink the second evening. Making sure we didn't make the same mistake as last time, we arrived in the lobby a full hour prior to our dinner reservations. Well, wouldn't you know it took about 15 minutes to even place our drink order. Mind you there were only 5 other patrons in the bar....total. Next, after we got our drinks it took another 20 minutes for our waiter to even check on us. By now we had to get our check. Thankfully the check arrived quickly. I guess they wanted us out of there rather than serve us. I would have had another drink had the waiters cared to check on us. But I guess they were pretty busy chatting to each other behind and around the bar instead. Oh well. Grief # 3 - this one I can't really complain about but I am including it here for your education. It will cost you about $60 per day including taxes. Thankfully I had done my research first but had I not it would be safe to say I would have been a bit upset. This parking fee is a tiny little footnote that is hard to discover when booking a room here at the Fairmont. All in all I would say that while nobody at The Fairmont was mean, quite the contrary actually, I would classify some aspects of the operation as unprofessional. You can have a winning personality and a never ending smile but when you fail to take care of a paying customer it's still unprofessional. My only staff compliment goes to the parking garage attendants who were extremely professional and helpful at every moment. I found myself calling upon them for my car and going straight down to the garage instead of the front because my car was always waiting and they always had great recommendations and were very helpful and prompt. Kudos to whomever manages that part of your hotel operation. Otherwise, I received service overall comparable to a Holiday Inn. Wish I had paid Holiday Inn prices. Im not a traveler who complains about costs otherwise inwould have added Greif # 4 to $80 breakfast pricetag for 2 at Laurel Court restuarant at the Fairmont (i get over it bc it's an \"upscale\" hotel). But i do expect a certain level of professionalism to accompany the costs rather than just everyone being so nice.

Meant to be a luxurious end to our stay, but it was the biggest disappointment of the trip. Not outright bad, just a big disappointment. Firstly, we were greeted by a very rude valet parker. I prefer to self-park, not just a cost thing, but I still have all my faculties, so am capable of parking my car myself, plus I prefer the convenience of self-parking - come and go as you please. At the Fairmont, it's valet parking only, at the cost of $62 per day (the most expensive in the neighbourhood). At least they don't charge extra for the greeting we received from the valet - the rudeness comes for free! When we checked in, they didn't have the room we expected. When we had booked 6 months earlier and enquired about a family room, we were told to book a twin, which would have 2 queen beds, so would be OK if our 2 daughters were happy to share a queen bed. When we arrived, the receptionist said that not all twins had 2 queens, some had much narrower beds and this was all they could offer us. We requested a more suitable room, but we waited so long with no word that we gave up and headed out to explore Union Square (we only had limited time in San Francisco). By the time we came back that evening, it was too late to move rooms, so we accepted the solution of a rollaway bed for one of our daughters and stayed in the same room. Big mistake, as the guy in the adjoining room kept us up all night. The following morning, I spoke to the old guy at the concierge desk (reception was busy with checkouts), who promised to sort things out while we were out sightseeing - by arranging another room and/or speaking to the noisy neighbour - but when we returned that evening, nothing had happened, the front desk was completely unaware of our complaint. We persuaded them to arrange another room for us but, when we walked in to the room, there was a lady already there, just beginning to unpack her luggage! So back to square one. Throughout this, the front desk manager was determined not to give us a room that was in any way better than what we already had, which was why our options were so limited. It was only when I started to cause a scene - as my frustrations finally boiled over - that she at last found us a suitable room, this time in the tower. The room was ba lot smaller than our previous room, but much less tired, with 2 queen beds and with no noisy neighbours. So after more than a day of frustration, we at last had the level of room we thought we'd booked. At this point, the front desk manager suddenly became friendly and offered us something by way of apology, such as a bottle of wine. This wasn't really our priority, but she told us to think about it and let her know. The next day, we returned from our Alcatraz trip (and climb up Nob Hill) in need of refreshment. Therefore, instead of an expensive bottle of wine, we just asked reception for a pot of tea and a couple of cookies for our daughters. The manager from the previous day was not around and had not told her colleagues about the offer of apology, so the guy on the front desk was reluctant to help us. When he did eventually agree to send a pot of tea to our room, it took over an hour, because he forgot to tell the room service people. So any goodwill that this small gesture of apology should have generated was lost. We have stayed at many 5-star hotels and the staff usually make us feel like kings. Here, they made us feel like dirt, so we began to understand the 'Snob Hill' jokes of the tour guides. None of our complaints were treated seriously until I lost my cool, and I shouldn't have to do that on holiday. Nothing was ever passed from one member of staff to another, the communication was just dreadful. I would recommend sending the staff to some of the top Asian hotels, then they would really know the meaning of customer service. Now for the positives: (i) great location, if you like walking, it's 30 minutes to Fisherman's Wharf (at least with children), around 15 minutes to Union Square and convenient for the Hyde-Powell cable car; (ii) great views if you're in the right rooms; (iii) tower rooms a bit newer than the older wing; (iv) even if the rest of the hotel is tired, the lobby is very nice, especially at Christmas time.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gothenburg, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cnice surroundings but annoying fan system\u201d", "Author": "KarlOA", "ReviewID": "UR123683078", "Content": "Stayed in the Calcuta suite - beautiful but the noise from the internal fan system was extremely annoying.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "AZ", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely wonderful stay in a suite\u201d", "Author": "TravelingWren", "ReviewID": "UR123668223", "Content": "We had the two bedroom Sutro Suite for a celebration of two birthdays - mother and son - 80 and 60.

Well the good views of the bay are specific to the room you choose, (see room recommendation) I would recommend this Tower signature suite as it is a good size and had a fabulous bay view. Things to consider with the Fairmont are that is not ultra luxurious in terms of modern terms but is more of a grand dame, and has lots old world charm. I have read that some people say the large hallways are spooky but I think it gives the hotel all it's charm and if you realise this at the time of booking you cannot go wrong with this hotel. Housekeeping was great noticed no problems during our stay. We valet parked our car which is expensive at $50 a day but that is consistent with other hotels in San Fran, that said the valet staff were excellent and very helpful. We were still on UK time zones so I did coffee runs each morning to the onsite illy coffee store which is great and very convenient. Is located on on a very steep hill which is very pleasant to walk down but going up could be a problem for some. Has a tram stop right outside the coffee shop at the one corner of the building which is very convenient and should negate the need to walk up the hill as the trams are really great.

We stopped at the room to change clothes and left for dim-sum. I cant remember the name of the restaurant, but left stuffed to the gills and very impressed by the outta the way place that did offer dimsum and drinks right on the edge of Chinatown. As a matter of fact the Concierge(the very experienced one with the gold keys) was phenomenal. He was never short on great suggestions for dimsum, french pastries early in the morning or just an umbrella for my long walk through to Pacific Heights! The hotel was still decked out from the Christmas week with the Gingerbread house and entrance to the restaurant was gorgeous as was the rest of the hotel. Additionally, and even more fun was watching the house staff deconstruct the candy and cookie house on New Years Day! It was akin to watching construction and heavy equipment. Just chilled in the lobby and that was nice for quite a while. We also decided to be treated like queens on New Years Day and decided to get room service. The service was great and the food was too! Room walls were surprisingly thin so we got an earful of someone elses romantic evening, but otherwise hotel is gorgeously decked out for the holidays and as Presidents club members they rolled out the red carpet!

I'd read many other reviews about guests being woken up or kept awake in the middle of night due to the homeless yelling, people partying and getting drunk, traffic, etc. which got me a bit worried. Not so at the Fairmont! Nob Hill is a beautiful area and the Fairmont is a large and very grand old historical landmark hotel. What amazed me during my nights there was the total silence....I truly slept like a baby!....I'd also add that the incredibly comfortable beds, sheets, and pillows made it doubly wonderful! I stayed in a Tower room can say that they keep the place very clean and well maintained. I never had time to check out the gym, but I heard it was off site, which is a bit of a negative for me. I don't think there's a pool either. What I liked is it's location....far enough from the hustle and bustle, but close enough to walk to Union Sq. or Chinatown. I actually enjoyed the walk, but trekking back up the pretty steep hill may be a bit of an exercise for some. Then again, the trolley is right outside and there are plenty of cabs waiting, so it's very convenient. Talking about the trolley....this may be the first thing you hear in the early morning that may wake you up, but it's not that bad. Be careful of the little cafe (Cento?) located on the Powell St. side of the hotel. Yummy pastries, teas, and coffees.....thank goodness for the steep hills you can work it all off later!

Just a couple problems.. We did notice that an electrical outlet cover was broken and half of the plastic was missing. Just a little eyesore and so simple to replace but no big deal.

I've booked this hotel as part of a package (flight + hotel) from British Airways. First of all, location is not the best unless you have a car or use a lot of taxis. It's an elegant area, and yes, it's at walking distance from Union Square, and even The Embarcadero, but once you add the hills, it's not that easy, going up is almost impossible. The building is magnificent, and the lobby is greatly and classically decorated, maybe a bit too much for me, I prefer a more modern and minimalist approach. The corridors are seemed a bit creepy to me, so high and wide, dimly lighted and almost always deserted. Our room was on the third floor, facing the front of the building. Too noisy at the early evenings, with all the traffic and the whistling. We arrived around 7pm and we were desperate to have some rest after a 10 hours flight and 8 hours difference from London (it was like 1am to us), which proved difficult with all that noise. No double glazing on the windows. The room was big, but poorly decorated in my opinion, the high ceiling and the wallpaper colour plus the old-style furniture, gave a old, depressing tone. There was also a big closet including safe and iron, that was a plus. The bathroom was also big, with a smallish tub, but the shower system was kid of weird, and not in the best state. Water took a long time to drain, and the tub would be partially filled while showering. Water pressure and temperature was excellent. I found an old towel and some hairs right next to the tub. Another problem was noise coming from the bathroom next door, we could hear the toilet or the shower as if we were there, and that is really annoying if your neighbour takes a shower at 6am. In room wireless internet was fast and reliable, and free if you are a member of their club, so I recommend everyone to enroll before staying so you can have internet access for free. Even though we hadn't much contact with staff (check-in and out was a breeze), they were very attentive and friendly, although when we asked for an extra blanket we had to wait for about an hour for it.

We drove to SF from San Diego, so it had been a long trip and Fairmont was our final destination. Before coming to the hotel, we dropped a rental car at the SF airport and took a cab to the hotel. When we arrived and got out of the car, we were told byb the concierge that he will get our bags from the cab and would bring them to our room. In half an hour or so the concierge brought our bags, and half an hour later I noticed that two bags were missing. One bag had our evening outfits (dress, suit, shirts, etc), and the other bag had all toileteries. We immediately ran downstairs and informed the concierge that we were missing two bags and he said that they will need to watch a video tape to find out what cab company we used and to identify a cab. We sat in the lobby for an hour hoping that they will find our bags, but noone came to us. We asked a for a manager, but he was unaware of our situation, so we had to repeat what happened. Each time we asked about a status of our lost bags, they were not aware, as if Fairmont staff doesn't communicate to each other. It was already late evening, no bags, we were tired, and the hotel staff didn't even offer us ANY toiletries - we had no tooth brush, no tooth paste, soaps, flosses, perfumes - all was gone. Only after I approached a concierge (1000's time) and almost broke in tears he brought some toothbrushes and toothpastes. Whatever... Note: NOONE yet apologized to us, nor anyone was updating us of their search results. The next morning we had a planned trip to Alcatraz - imagine that we were in a terrible mood. By that time we already told the staff approximate name of the cab that brought us, but they kept telling us that they were investigating. Apparenttly, the video tape was blurry so they could not see clearly the cab number (what is the purpose of such video tape then??). However, at least they could see how many pieces of luggage were taken out of the cab trunk - which proved that we weren't lying. But their favorite version was that we forgot the bags in a rental car. I clearly remebered checking that we didn;t leave anything behind when we dropped a car in the airport. We tried to reach that cab company but without success, as it was just hard to find a person to talk to at the cab company. In the early afternoon we didn't hear back from them yet (!!) and my husband called and insisted on speaking with a head of Fairmont security. He told him about everything (again). Security guy said that he would look into it. When we came back into the hotel - around 2-3 pm, noone told us anything again, I bumbed into a concierge who left our bags in the cab - not even a sight of apology - \"I understand mam...We are doing doing everythiong we can...\". Happy end: when I finally decided to go shopping for a dress, because we were going to a wedding next day, and got in a cab, I got a phone call from security informing me that they found these bags. When I picked them up I was told that a cab brought them back (apparently hotel had nothing to do with finding these bags). I was sooo happy to get my staff back that I didn't even say anything, but later we realized that NOONE apologized or offered anything complimentary (at least a free drink - as a token of apology) to us. NEVER again I would stay in this hotel. If anything like this happens, you feel humuliated because you almost have to beg for their attention, everything is \"high road\". I understand that staff happens, but it is just soo hard to deal with people who does not accept their responsibilities. It also tought me a lesson that we should not trust anyone with my things!

The hotel is old, but in a good way. You can feel the history of the place. The room we had looked out over the bay and the North Beach area which was stunning at sunset and sunrise. I would imagine some people would find the rooms a bit dated, but the hotel is over a hundred years old so we felt it just added to the overall vibe of the place. Our room had everything we needed, the bed was extremely comfortable and the shower was superb. The lobby and main hotel bar is stunning and probably hasn't changed since the hotel was built. The bar is a really great place to sit and have a quiet drink at night and there is the Tonga Room bar/restaurant in the basement which is a bit tacky but good fun. This was our first trip to San Fransico but we thought the location was ideal. Its a nice straight walk downhill to Fishermans Wharf and a similar downhill walk to the Union Square area. The walk back up to the hotel is obviously a bit more of a challenge but the Fairmont sits on a street which is serviced by the trolley's and you can easily get a cab so it wasn't a problem.

We were also able to check in super early (11:00 AM) before heading to the Giants game which was great as we did not have to rush back or leave bags in the car, etc. One important item to note about this room and why I have given it four stars is when we booked the room we booked a King bed suite as we are very tall and apparently there are only queen beds in all of the balcony suites. Super important detail depending on your travel companion or height. That was the only drawback (and the hills) of the hotel. This is an old hotel so you should be aware of that when booking. That lends to the charm and everything is updated anyhow. The bathrooms are clean but small. The location is great as we walked to Union Square and the the edge of Chinatown.

What more can you say about a place that's already regarded with so much fondness and affection? From the moment you enter the fabled marble halls until the time that you check out, you will have a Hotel experience like no other, anywhere in the world. This is luxury with a massive big \"L\". We've been very fortunate in that every year we've had a room in the Fairmont Tower which allows you the most spectacular of views over the Bay - every morning as you pull back the drapes, feast uyour eyes on the panorama of the Golden Gate Bridge, Russian Hill, admire the Coit tower, and the two-tiered Bay Bridge, and don't miss (how could you?) the small jewel floating in an azure sea, the island that is Alcatraz. There is no view like this anywhere else in the world. The bedrooms are spacious, clean and like the whole hotel, very well maintained. The restaurant and bar area which sit adjacent to the massive reception halls have been revamped and redecorated over the past twelve months and are comfortable and relaxing. The Fairmont breakfast is a must - don't miss out. All kinds of berries and other fruit by the bowlful, toasts, croissants, bagels and breads of every description, smoked Maryland bacon, to go with freshly cooked eggs cooked by your personal chef on demand. Even the grapefruit juice gets 11 out of 10! Overnight valet parking is expensive but it's essential and the staff there are efficient and very helpful. You're at the top of California and Mason, and the SF trams tinkle their way up and down the hill all day (a single fare is $6) and you never have to wait long for a ride. You can walk down to Union Square in ten minutes, but get the tram back up! Shopping stores abound - Sax, Macy's, Bloomingdales, Apple, Levi, Nike, Tiffany and many, many more - they are all just minutes from the Hotel. We can't wait to come back 2012 - San Francisco is our favourite city in the world, and the Fairmont Hotel is one of the very good reasons for that!", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "sydney", "Title": "\u201cgreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "jenny23454", "ReviewID": "UR119464940", "Content": "This was a lovely place to stay the service was good in all areas the staff at reception concierge room service and housekeepingwere all outstanding.

It is seems like they are doing you a favor by answering a question or serving you a drink. The conceirge might as well not be there. So unhelpful and always recommending what is right around the corner and complete tourist traps. I used the wonderful apps on my i-phone to find much better places than what was recommended by the hotel's conceirge team. All in all, this is an overpriced hotel that is way past its glory.

I stayed in a 4th floor room - icky icky ick. I have stayed in a fair amount of older hotels, boutique hotels too but this hotel's dingy rooms are just that - dingy. The Bad: The wallpaper was coming off the walls, not just in the bathroom, but the bedroom too.The vent in the bathroom doesn't work - perhaps part of the problem with the peeling wall paper.Peeling wallpaper though seems like no big deal when compared with the lack of general cleaning.There were marks on the walls and door of my bathroom, many dirty marks, and I really don't like to think of what these may have been because it is too easy to answer this and get more upset. Aside from these marks, which easily could have been cleaned with a rag and some cleaning product - there is the overall dinge. By dinge I am talking about the thick dust layer (we all know what dusts consists of) on everything: a dark, puffy gray film covering floor boards, lamps, doors, corners (don't look at corners), desks - you know all the stuff that is normally cleaned in a hotel. Apparently this hotel hasn't trained their staff to do these things.It is like they just change the sheets and the toilet paper rolls. No real cleaning. Speaking of the toilet paper roll...I had to take the roll off the holder and put it on the sink. The location they have they toilet paper holder in was extremely odd and unless you are a contortionist, you aren't going to be able to reach your TP. And make sure you bring your slippers or flip flops - the floors aren't that clean either. If you plan on ironing, know that your clothes are going to smell moldy after doing so. Not only are the ironing boards dirty, but the iron itself isn't emptied of its water by the staff, so it just hangs out in the iron and gets stagnant and moldy smelling. Also, they have a sign that says they are environmentally conscious so in order to get your towels washed you need to leave them on the floor.Well, I had the DND sign on my door, no towels on my floor (after all,I had only been there for 2 days I didn't need my sheets or towels changed) and they came into my room and changed the sheets and towels. So much for either sign! Lastly, how many lamps can be put in one small room, if you stay here you will find out! Of course, two of the lamps were broken. Really two broken lamps. I guess with all the other lamps they didn't think they should fix them. Again the housekeeping really needs better training. The view was also very bad - view of ducts and pipes - ask for a street view or tower room. The food was okay, but for the price, go to one of the many great restaurants in the area. I would only eat in the hotel if you couldn't get out.Also the little coffee shop at the bottom of the hotel, on Powell, it not so good.I am from PDX so may be a bit of a coffee snob. Positives: Although, not my style the lobby was nice, the function rooms were nice and the staff all were nice and helpful. I really liked the location of this hotel and rather enjoyed walking up and down the hills. Although if you aren't up for the hills, you can take the street car or a taxi easy enough. China town and high end shopping are close by. I walked to Coit tower, the Fisherman's Warf, the financial district, crooked Lombard St, North Beach. SFMOMA - all over! And if after walking all day you enjoy sleeping in a cozy, squishy, expensive bed, this hotel has them. The robes are nice too, as it the selection of television stations. They offer free newspapers and umbrella borrows if you get caught w/o one on a rainy day. The gym is good but costs $15/day unless you belong to the president's club.

As a first advice, if they offer you \"the beautiful Malaya suite\", do not take it! Because you pay for the balcony, but you don't get one. The so called \"balcony\" is covered to 85% in glass, so it's more like a winter garden. As you can see from the outside of the hotel, this balcony is the only one that's limited in that way. But this didn't even make the doctor write this review. He was even willing to not complain about the muffy old room that was quite dusty and should have been remodeled over a century ago... No, what was really embarrassing, was the winter garden/balcony itself. First of all, the balcony had not been cleaned for quite a while and just due to this fact, it was no joy to be out there. The armchairs on the balcony where full of old stains and even mold! So if you wanted to sit down, a muffy, dirty, moldy armchair was set up to your comfort (as you can see on the pictures I uploaded). When I went down to the front desk, to complain only about the armchairs, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get an apology, but I was ordered to go back to the suite and wait for housekeeping to bring new chairs. After 45 minutes of waiting, I went down again and asked how long housekeeping would need to bring up new chairs, because I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to spend the whole evening sitting in the suite. Shortly I was told that they told housekeeping to speed up. Again I waited for over 30 minutes, until housekeeping called just to tell me, that they have no new chairs or any other alternative. So for the third time I went down to the front desk and I was offered\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 nothing. Instead, I was told to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153take it or leave it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So I decided to check out immediately, without even staying a night at the Fairmont. As the pinnacle of bad service, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer me help by the bell desk, so I had to carry my luggage all by myself down into the garage. I do not know, what you expect, when you check in at a grand hotel, but this was the lousiest service I ever experienced. What embarrasses me the most is the thing that the personal didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be surprised by the fact, that they have moldy chairs and an unsatisfied customer. Overall they just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care. I even contacted Lucas Schumacher (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the one who asks for contact when you write a review like this on tripadvisor) and that was no good either. He apologized, of course, and offered to make the San Francisco Fairmont management contact me, but guess what, they never did. I take that as the last proof that they really do not care about the customers they have and strongly advise you, not to book at a Fairmont hotel if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to enjoy proper service.

As a treat to ourselves we also stayed the night, in room 434 (old tower). Hotel snobs and Four Seasons aficionados will not be impressed by the rooms. Although we had a nice view towards the Financial District, the window, bedroom and bathroom are small by modern standards. The weather was considerably warmer than usual for SF and the air conditioning was not completely up to par to keep the room comfortable. The bathroom has pretty standard amenities and was small for a hotel at this price point. I wouldn't say the room was sparkling clean. The closet furnishings were dusty and some of the furniture was pretty beat up in places. The bed, however, was very comfortable, and we had no complaints about noise. Most of the sheets seemed pretty new except for a very shabby worn out bottom sheet. With all this being said, the grandeur of the public spaces...the lobby, restaurants, ballrooms, etc. is where this hotel shines. There are always people dressed up--coming and going to some special event that really adds an exclamation point to your own experience here. This is a great hotel to use as a rally point for a group in town for a special event or an anniversary. The upkeep of this property must be nightmarish and I'm sure that's where a lot of your nightly rate goes. The valet (20 minutes to get car), check in (15 minutes with only 2 in front of us) , room service (50 minutes for a 1AM pizza), and breakfast buffet (20 minutes waiting with only 1 party ahead of us) were slow for the price. You can really feel the \"union\" nature of the staff here. They've been here forever and pretty much perform only to their own personalities. At the same time sometimes I tire of the painted smiles other properties insist on. The breakfast buffet at $30 was better than I expected.

Upon arrival at the Fairmont we were greeted by William one of the Valet attendents. He couldn't have been more helpful. Our check in was quick and efficient. We even got an instant upgrade (Presidents Club you know) from a room in the original hotel to a larger room in the tower. The room couldn't have been nicer with two exceptions. No robes (the ladies like the robes) and placement next to the elevators was not so great. Maybe we would have been better off in our smaller room in the main building. Since we were there to party what's a little whooshing sound coming from the elevator shaft. Breakfast on Saturday was very nice. $68.00 for two people. Don't you just love hotel food prices! Scrambled eggs and toast and of course coffee was extra. I don't blame the Fairmont as all the big city hotels do the same thing. It's just the principal. No inroom coffee was a bit bothersome as my wife really needs her coffee in the morning as do I. They have a small coffee house outside the hotel and down a hill called Cafe Cento. Fair prices and decent breads and rolls. That's where we had breakfast on our second morning at the Fairmont. Saturday evening we went to see Beach Blanket Babylon a decades old show held in the North Beach area. Lots of fun. We thought we would take a cab but were pleased when the hotel offered to drive us in the hotel car. Nice touch! Sunday came to fast and it was time to checkout which we did with ease.

The next morning we inquired at the front desk about our gift bag and were told they did not know where it was. We understand that things like this can happen and were not upset, but we were surprised that the only response was a smile and a \"sorry\". At such a nice establishment, when the error was clearly theirs, we thought it might have been nice to offer us a box of complimentary snacks...instead, we were charged the standard $12 per box of nuts when we found ourselves getting hungry in our room. The gift bag contained snacks and bottles of water which was obviously the wedding party's way of helping to avoid such extra costs. Overall, our experience was nice, but the lack of consideration given in this matter left us with a slightly sour taste in our mouths (and a hungry belly!!!)", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Yellowstone, Montana", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay\u201d", "Author": "Amber J", "ReviewID": "UR117711175", "Content": "Had a great stay at the fairmont but beware the charge to park your car is 70/day.

They were kind enough to upgrade our room to a Signature Tower King, with sweeping views of the bay. This was not a huge upgrade, just the next step above what we already paid for. While it was only the 5th floor, the view was indeed magnificent with a large picture window. We had unobstructed views od Coit Tower, Fisherman's Wharf, Alcatraz, and beyond. Then the fog rolled in, giving us a view of gray. But, we can't fault the Fairmont for that. Plus, as the night wore on, some of the fog lifted and we could take in the city lights. Even only 5 floors up, we were far enough away from street noise for the most part. We could hear the clanging of the cable car bells (they run on both California and Mason Streets, so two sides of the hotel get the effect). But, they do not run that often, and we like the sound of the cable cars. We could not hear the grinding of the cables or the screeching of the brakes, so that was good! The room was spacious even though it was not a suite, and we liked the decor. Too bad there was no telescope in the room and the window was soert of dirty. The bed was comfy and we were able to connect my iPad to the LCD TV to watch Netflix movies. We were disappointed to find we were given a handicap room (no we didn't ask for one), which in this hotel means no bathtub and no shower stall. Yep, this was the full \"roll in\" shower with a seat accessible by wheel chair. Sort of like a hospital shower, made fancy with marble tiles. Not my idea of romance, but by the time we discovered it, we were unpacked and relaxing. Otherwise, I would have asked for a different room. I had read other reviews, so I knew to look out for this, but the mini-bar goodies are \"wired\" to be automatically charged to your room as soon as you pick them up. So no looky-loos on the snacks and drinks. They have them set up on a little teeter totter thing that senses the change in weight, and there literally is a wire coming from the pad to behind the TV. The one out in the open even has a little teddy bear in a box, I guess to attract any kids you may have brought along. There is another in the top drawer of the armoire with more snacks. You'd thing there'd be a warning sign on this attractive nusiance, but no. There must have been a price list somewhere, but I did not dig around for it. I didn't even open the fridge to see what was in there. I would think at the rates they charge, they could just have housekeeping keep tabs. Room service was expensive, as expected, but they add 20% gratuity, plus $5 service charge (as opposed to the more typical 15-18%). That said, we had room service for breakfast ($54 for two), and we were pleased with our meal. We had one order each of strawberries, mangoes and banana bread (house made), and a full pot of coffee. There were two large slices of the banana bread, plenty for two people. Sure, we paid more than we would in the Laurel Court restaurant downstairs, but we got to enjoy our million dollar view with our breakfast this way. We had dinner in the Tonga Room, early before the band began because we wanted to be able to talk during dinner. Rather than ordering entrees, we each had seared opa salads, shared an appetizer platter, and a side of fried \"shaka\" rice. We were given a volcano dessert complimentary for our anniversary. We had read that the food was not very good, but we enjoyed what we ordered very much. We loved the kitchy feel and the fake thunderstorms. The decor was well thout out and not at all tacky. Better than Trader Vic's I think. We got a poolside seat, so when it rained, we actually felt a cooling breeze from the falling water. If you cannot suspend your disbelief to enjoy the fun, I guess you are a snob or depressed. Whatever. The location was very nice, even with the very steep hills (the better to walk off those spring rolls!). We arrived by Bart from the East Bay, getting off at the Embarcadero Station. The Powell Station is closer, but they say the hill is steeper. We had lunch in the Financial District before walking up through Chinatown and on up Nob Hill. Since we were staying only one night, we only needed a small overnight bag each. So, overall, we thought the SF Fairmont was classy, historic, and memorable.

I did not see any that would be much competition, so if you want the \"best\" in SF, my guess is that it would be this hotel. We had a garden view and the view was not great but it was not bad either. The biggest disappointment is that we never got to experience the \"thunderstorm\" of the bar! If you don't know what I am talking about, the bar there is supposedly great--with fake rain and thunderstorms, etc. It was closed (I think for private events--?) the 3 nights we stayed. I was not happy about that. However, there are other bars in the hotel that are nice. The breakfast buffet is $$$, but it is pretty good. A very famous celebrity was staying there at the same time we were, and during my birthday breakfast I realized he was sitting right next to us, so that was kind of fun. The bath faucet was broken so they comped some of our drinks on our bill, and that was nice of the mgt to do. Also, they had the most amazing mirror that I ended up tracking down and buying for my house (you know one of those wall mirrors that lights up), so I will always love FM SF for that! The bed was comfy and the lobby, as you can see in all the photos, is over the top amazing. BTW, funny story: Our cab driver drove us through Tenderloin to get there from the airport, and I was so scared! I think he was doing a drive by drug deal b/c he called someone on the phone and then threw something out the window to a guy. SF is funny that way; you have this magnificent hotel but if you wonder too far away, you get caught in the scariest neighborhood I have ever seen in my life! We went to the symphony, which was nice and of course I love Golden Gate Park. I did not experience any amazing food in SF, which is too bad. Oh, there is a rental car company in the lobby, which is really helpful! I did not give the hotel 5 stars just because of the bar being closed (I was really looking forward to that!) and the broken faucet (oh and the first room they put us in smelled like smoke, so the door person opened a different room for us.

The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas, with a HUGE tree and a full-size gingerbread house! People were coming into the foyer from the street, just to have their photo taken beside the tree. There was a feeling of being part of an olde worlde setting, in plush, beautiful surroundings, where service was given with effortless ease.

It was pretty close to a perfect hotel for us. It was built by the Fair sisters (their actual name) around 1900, using their father's silver-mining money, and is the first of the Fairmont chain. It survived the great earthquake of 1904, largely because it was built on solid rock, so you can sleep easy in your bed! It has a classic exterior and interior, and was beautifully restored by the famous California architect Julia Morgan (who also designed the Hearst Castle, San Simeon). The lobby is one of the greatest in the world, and worth a look even if you don't stay there, built of solid honey-coloured marble (real not faux). The breakfast room/bar has been restored back to its gorgeous original state, although the stained-glass domes no longer let in external light. There are several delightful 1930s murals illustrating circus acts in the Circus Room (an old bar I think). There is a large roof garden with palm trees etc from which one can see Fisherman's Wharf and Alcatraz. They have their own bee colony! There is a Polynesian-style bar which is a famous SF nightspot and has been around a long time (more than 60 years I think). Many presidents and other dignitaries have stayed at the hotel, and some of these occasions are shown in a photo gallery. The original charter of the League of Nations was signed here. The hotel is probably the highest structure in San Francisco, on what is called \"Nob Hill\", yet it is only 2 blocks to Chinatown, and a 20 minute walk to Union Square or the Ferry Terminal. Two cable car lines and several bus lines stop within a block of the hotel. We went to some fabulous restaurants, not too far away, of which the top three were 1.Masa's, 2.Michael Mina and 3.Jardiniere (the latter being conveniently close to the Opera House). The Slanted Door (modern Vietnamese fusion) in the Ferry Building also gets honourable mention (and is much less expensive). We breakfasted in the hotel every day: although it is a tad expensive, we thought the fine food and service and the relaxed setting were well worth it, and they don't mind if you linger and read a paper or do a crossword.

Where we had stayed in a small boutique hotel the first time, our graduation to the top of the hill (Knob HIll) was absolutely outstanding. This is the original Fairmont. Elegant, rococo, sophisticated. The hallways are lined with the pictorial history of the hotel, and we got a slight shiver from the romance and the passion of a great hotel with millions of stories to tell. The rooms are equally charming. The front desk and concierge smooth and polished. We knew nothing of the Tonga Room when we arrived. In fact, just going for a walk around the block, we chanced upon a side door near the rear of the hotel. Peeked in. A south seas motif, with a large pool of blue water in the middle. It reminded us of the Polynesian Room at the old Ports of Call in Toronto in the 60's crossed with the Tiki Room at Disneyland. It promised a bit of fun, and likely tourist food to boot. Wrong on one front. It WAS fun, the place was packed, and the food was marvellous. And at 9 pm, the reflecting pool (for that's what we thought it was) came alive with music and a band floated along it on some kind of barge. As it turns out, the Tonga Room is the old basement swimming pool area which, in the 50's, had a cafe added around it, so that bathers could stay poolside and enjoy a bite and a drink. This was such a successful idea that the restaurant was expanded and the pool became a thematic centrepiece instead of a place to swim. The Tonga Room is actually famous, and maps of San Fran show it - without mentioning the name Fairmont. Although it's atop Knob Hill, and the streets in every direction are steeply downhill, the rear of the hotel is on Powell Street, and you can catch a cable car right there to go either downtown or to the wharf area. In the third direction you can get a cable car on California to take you to the Pier 1 area on the Embarcadero. If you're inclined (or 'disinclined') you can walk along Powell down to the wharf area and it's all downhill all the way to the water and an Irish Coffee at Buena Vista.

My expectations were probably higher than they should have been but I still had a good stay and would do it again. My pros and cons this trip: The lobby didn't inspire me. The restaurant and bar behind the lobby was generic. The concierge desk is constantly busy, expect to wait up to ten minutes for assistance most times of the day and then get limited results. The door man at the entrance to the hotel will provide the same information you need with some real insider detail--so tip accordingly. Overall, the staff, while busy (there's always a crowd in the lobby) remained professional and courteous. Room: My room was large enough, but surprisingly sparse with standard furniture that really didn't do justice to the hotel's reputation. I had to do some work at the desk in the room and it was shoved into a cramped corner next to the bed. On the plus side, personally important criteria were met: The bed was super comfortable, and the location was surprisingly quiet even with a room over the main entrance. Housekeeping was very good. For the business/conference traveler: The business center was lame--you are asked to pay for computer use even to print an airline boarding pass. Wireless internet in your room has to be paid for, of course, but if you join the Fairmont membership program (free) the service is complimentary. Also, the wireless was quite fast. Side note: The Tonga Room and Hurricane Bar is to be found a few floors under the lobby. I checked it out for a cocktail. It's like Disney's Tiki Room attraction for adults. It's kind of tacky, the food is supposed to be fair, and my Mai-Tai probably ripped a hole in my esophagus--it may have been mixed with rubbing alcohol. In other words, I liked this place a lot and hope it stays around for many years. Summary: If you plan to spend top money on a property in San Francisco, you may be let down a bit by the Fairmont. However, it's still a very good option for a short stay, say two to three days. It's also a good base for a family vacation, and it beats the tourist madness around the Wharf.

Example: If you are working from your desk, the chair is horrible and not meant for spending much time there at all. The hotel as some noise from the other rooms. Although that didn't really matter to us, we felt that we should speak low and not make too much noise after 11 since we knew the other rooms could hear. The service at the property is okay. We did have some challenges that one of the room service people opened the door before we had a chance to dress and he only knocked once and then didn't wait. One of the managers called the room. I would say that the entire experience was average. We stayed there because we had some upgrade certificates and it was a good deal. Even considering that, we would not take this option again. The hotel was absolutely dead and didn't seem like a place to be. The service was rushed and mediocre at best and not what you would expect from a Fairmont.

I have stayed there over several occasions from the time I was a child and the Swig family owned the hotel in the 60\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Mr. Swig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s penthouse apartment was something to see. No doubt the hotel went through many changes in style and ownership but over the last few years it seems the current ownership group is really working hard to keep the Fairmont worthy of its Four Diamond status perhaps eyeing a 5. The Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons have 5 star rankings but nothing in San Francisco can approach the Fairmont for views, location, history or solid authentic elegance. The Ritz Carlton is a converted girl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s school with very limited views. The Four Seasons is in a less desireable part of town, and the minute you leave to go outside get ready for panhadlers galore. The Fairmont has always been what it is today-a top caliber first class hotel in one of San Francisco's best neighborhoods. It is as much a part of the fabric of San Francisco as the cable cars but still genuinely elegant. I arrived for my last stay at about 1 pm-a bit early for check-in. No problems there. I give Geoffrey at the Front Desk high praise for his welcoming and professional manner in check in, and in making sure I was happy with my room. This time I stayed on the 6th floor overlooking the hotel gardens with a spectacular view of the downtown skyline, Chinatown and the San Francisco Bay. The room, a Fairmont King, was in excellent condition with a nicely sized bath and a great working desk by the window. The wired internet was excellent-the wireless was a little slower though technical support was also very good. The room was white glove clean. Join The Fairmont President's club (free) and you will get Internet for free. The breakfast buffet in the Laurel Court Dining Room is well worth the price-service and the caliber of food actually makes it a bargain. The Tonga Room had an incredible $10 per person happy hour spread that one could have actually made a dinner out of. I entertained guests there before we went to Coi in North Beach and they really loved the atmosphere. After dinner we went back and really enjoyed the band. I think the doorman and bell staff were a little uneven in terms of friendliness and service, and the bar service at the Laurel Court Bar was abysmal. The bartender in his 20\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was so occupied with 2 ladies at the bar for the hour we were there that I had to go to the Front Desk to get a manager to take our drink order after 15 minutes of waiting and not even being acknowledged. On the other hand, the crabby older Asian woman in the gift shop had her own kind of charm, but a smile would have helped. No doubt there are going to be some missteps here and there (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen it at the Ritz Carlton too) but I think if the hotel were to work on one thing it would be the consistently delivery of service with a smile and an engaging manner as we experienced checking in and at breakfast. The California Street cable car was down for repair though the Powell line that goes from Union Square to Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf is running fine. If you go to Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf , Scoma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seems to have gone downhill in food quality but Gary Danko is excellent. What I love about the Fairmont is its feeling of being home in a place where you will have a very comfortable sleep, great access to all parts of the City and being so near yet so far from Union Square and Chinatown. I have stayed in both the Tower and the original hotel. The tower rooms give a spectacular view of Coit Tower, Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge. The original hotel rooms that face Powell and Mason street give wonderful views of downtown and Nob Hill including the Pacific Union Club and Grace Cathedral. I stayed in a 4th floor room facing California once several years ago and did not like the noise or the view of the Mark Hopkins hotel garage. I would stay in a courtyard room if all you wanted was a lot of sleep-especially after an international trip. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll add that in my experience if you are not happy with something ask for a manager or someone above them who can resolve the problem I have never had an experience at any Fairmont where management did not want to do everything reasonably possible to make a guest happy, including finding another room. No doubt, if you want elegance, comfort, location and a wonderful place to work out and walk/run, look no further.

It was also nice to stay in a place full of history and charm too! Made the experience that much more enjoyable! The place was decorated so beautifully, especially the lobby area.

It was by far the best view I have ever seen! Just beauitful! The room was just perfect with a large bath-tub inside the bathroom also. The room was very large and very nicely decorated. We just loved it! I am so happy to have stayed here on our trip, especially for our anniversary! They really went out of their way to make it a wonderful trip for us! We also had drinks one night at the hotel restaurant, The Tonga Room and it was really neat! Its a tropical themed restaurant and bar that has a tropical rain-storm every 15 minutes or so. We shared a drink made for two- the mai tai which was really good. The atmosphere was really nice there!

I would like to preface this by saying we have stayed in some of the finest hotels in the world including the Burj Al Arab, Waldorf NY and Goring etc. and so although we all know that hotels can be flawed in many ways, our expectation was reasonably (and not surprisingly) quite high, given the reputation of the hotel chain and the hotel itself. After a loooong flight from Sydney we arrived very tired but really looking forward to our first stay in San Francisco and at the much vaunted Fairmont. On arrival at the hotel we unloaded the bags and a bell hop arranged to take them to the room, this seemed to be very matter of fact and not that welcoming. I went to check in and was met by a lady who gave me the impression that I was definitely an interruption to whatever she was doing. There was little in the way of interaction and virually no eye contact. It was done swiftly and with almost indecent haste and I was handed a room card. I had to ask if that was it as there was no suggestion of \"the lift is over there...\" or \"would you like us to hold a dinner reservation for you?\" etc. So we went up to our room and I have to say that is was the smallest room we have ever had in a hotel the US. The bed was a standard double bed and there was no coffee or tea making facilities in the room .When the bell hop bought our luggage up I asked if we could have some coffee making facilities. I was told that they do not put them in the room as a matter of course but they would arrange to send some up. Needless to say it never arrived! In the restaurant there was little distinction between a continental breakfast and the full buffett, which was $30 dollars plus tax and compulsary 15% tip each - this made breakfast $75. Therefore $27 for a bowl of cereal and a slice of toast (which is all my wife usually has) seemed a littel excessive. The buffet breakfast was incredibly poor value for money as, although there was an egg station, where you could have them any style, all the other hot food was kept in trays with hot water troughs underneath to keep them warm - it didn't! The biggest plus here was the Maitre D who was very friendly and welcomed us warmly. The general waiting staff just didn't seem interested and we had to ask several times for things as they kept fogetting or bought the wrong tea etc. When the restaurant was busy (we had to wait twice for breakfast for at least 20 minutes) which wasn't an issue itself but once in there it was clear that they could not handle pressure of any kind as they all ran around frowning and looked frazzled. There was one young lady who served us drinks and food in the lounge for 2 evenings and she was excellent and actually put her more senior colleagues to shame in terms of service and attention. Checking out was met with the same indifference - it was as thoguh we'd never been there. And apart from calling us a cab the door staff were no help at all as I loaded the car myself with the help of the taxi driver.

I had stayed once before at the Fairmont, a standard room for a good rate on a Groupon deal. We live in San Francisco, and having a yummy night or two away as tourists in our own town is a real treat. This time, on our second Groupon stay, when I made the online reservation I checked the option to e-upgrade. I was happy to learn that we were in fact upgraded, but I was thrilled when the bellman opened the door to our corner suite on the 16th floor (the Sutro Suite) and I entered our spacious perch high above the hustle and bustle of the city - with a 260 degree view. I'd never seen San Francisco look so appealing, and I've been living here for more than 30 years! More than a fancy hotel getaway, our two nights at the Fairmont were sanctuary. The lobby is opulent, the Laurel Cafe for breakfast/ brunch is luxuriously quiet and divine. The staff is professional yet friendly. Because we live nearby we took a discreet cooler in with us with our own snacks and libations. The mini-bars at the Fairmont are of the annoying sort where sensors ensure that you get charged for just touching something. The beds and linens both are worth the price of admission. Each time I stay there I fantasize about buying the exact same set up for our home. Being in bed at the Fairmont makes this particular princess very very happy. We had a wonderful time taking photos of our beautiful city, night and day, and celebrated our best Valentine's Day ever. We looked into staying in the same room for July 4th for what would be an AMAZING view of fireworks, but alas, the rack rate was about 3x what we were paying with our Groupon and e-upgrade. I have to admit, the decor is not my style, but it IS the style of the hotel, and we just pretended we were on the set of Mad Men, or in Nancy Reagan's parlor. Parking is very pricey (like 60$ or more a night), and they charge 15$ a day for WiFi. I found that excessive.

I used the gym on two occassions, it had some free weights, some CV equipment and some mechanical weights. There are two jogging routes around the city, reception provide maps, I think they were 2.5miles and 5 miles but I would only recommend regular runners to do these since the last mile or so is up hill (as you would expect) and pretty exhausting.

Below is the email that I sent to the Fairmont: I would like to start by saying that I am a big fan of Fairmont hotels and have spent many business trips / vacations staying at your properties. There are so many things that I love and enjoy about staying with you. The service is amazing, properties are beautiful and so comfortable it almost feels like home. Recently, when planning my travels to the San Francisco area I was pleased to see that there in fact was a Fairmont. So, the decision was easy. I had a need for a suite with a separate room . When I checked in on Friday, Jan 14th I have to say it was not the experience that I am accustomed too. It took forever to get checked in and the woman at the front desk was not welcoming in the least! When I asked about the room that I had originally book ( ns suite in old building) if it had a nice view she said \"no\" but did not offer any suggestions. I asked if I could get a different room with a better view and she said that she would check. After again waiting a long time she said they did have a suite in the tower available but there would be a price difference. I asked if she could check on my corporate rate for the room and she said that it would be $100 more a night (I wish that she would have given me the total for the room including all the taxes too) it might have been helpful? but this sounded good so we proceeded. She then offered me a roll away bed for the room because my daughter would be staying there too. I thought that this was thoughtful and thanked her for thinking about it . She did not however mention that it would be an additional $35 a night ( In the past I have NEVER been charged for this ). She did not point out any of the ammenities of the hotel (the coffee shop, business center, Tonga) or offer any additional assistance. In my opinion she was not a great first impression on the hotel. When we got to the room ( Sutter Suite) the view was fantastic and for this I was glad for the upgrade! The room was clean and decorated in the special Fairmont style that I love. Although, the room had no extra blankets, pillows or a robe for my 7yr old daughter that I had requested this upon making the reservations. The TV had issues remote barely work and channels would flicker... no big deal since we planned on enjoying the city anyway. After returning from dinner on the first night we came back to a beautiful bottle of wine and cheese platter on the table with a note. I thought how thoughtful of them to send this up .... Wait it was not for us and was intended for another guest. I found this out after I read the card that was left... Oops! everyone makes mistake I completely understand this so I call the front desk to let them know. They inform me that I will need to talk to room service to let them know. .. \"ok\"? Although she did say that they will probably just tell me to keep it . I explained the situation to room service and apologized for opening the card. They said nothing.... no apology for delivering to wrong room just that they would be right up and asked \"if I had eaten any of it..??\" When we were in the lobby of the hotel during the duration of our stay (which was so beautiful and has such a wonderful history) I was surprised that the staff did not ask us if they could help with anything or greet us. Usually we are being inundated with cheerful, helpful staff looking to make your stay more enjoyable. That was not the case here! I do have to say that the concierge \"Tommy\" was fantastic!! Helpful, cheerful and had just the right suggestions for us on what to do or where to go! He is a real GEM ! In closing I must say that I do not mind spending a little more to stay in a wonderful hotel! Especially, The Fairmont for the predictability of the service,quality and experience that is there from property to property. But, I was gravely disappointed by my experience at your Fairmont in San Francisco! And when I return to San Francisco for business/ vacation I will not be staying here!

The room was perfect, and we actually took pictures of the bathroom because we've been trying to describe to our contractor what we're looking for. The views of the bridge and the bay are not to be surpassed anywhere. Though most of the service was very good, we were a bit disappointed at check in.

They were always willing to please, but I felt for this amount of money we should not have needed to request again.

We had read many of the other reviews on the hotel before traveling so we had some idea of the potential pitfalls to avoid. I'll list the pros and cons: Pros: Great location - the hotel sits on the intersection of all the major cable car routes, so that's a big plus. The hills are steep to walk, but not that bad with good tennis shoes. Room view - from our room, we could see the entire bay, alcatraz, and the golden gate bridge. Fantastic. Staff - very prompt response times and extremely helpful. If it wasn't for the staff, my rating would be far lower. Cons: Hotel Renovations: no where on the reservations did it mention that the hotel was undergoing renovations. We were woken up each morning around 7:30am to the sounds of hammering and scraping. Check into this before booking! Nickle and Dime Charges - we knew about the \"automatically charging refreshments\" in the fridge and drawers, so we requested they be removed when we first arrived. Sure enough, our preliminary bill had hundreds of dollars in charges on it that needed to be manually removed because \"they can't override their own automatic sensors\", even though the hotel staff is the ones who removed the products. Highly recommend you do the same and request a guest fridge as check in. Note that you can buy 12 bottles of water from Walgreens right down the street (use the cable car) for the same price as one bottle of water in your room. Honestly, for a $450/night suite, this is just plain silly. This is the ONLY hotel that I've seen that doesn't provide as least some light refreshments for free in a suite. Room Maintenance - TV signals were hit or miss due to faulty connections (after one attempt at repairs by the hotel engineer, we gave up), shower drains were slow (fixed by hotel staff). These types of things should be taken care of before guests arrive. Furniture - the beds are pretty hard, so if you like soft beds, you are out of luck. The rest of the furniture seems run down and fits in well with the antique theme (although I'd swear some of it is old enough to be an antique).

The hotel is centrally located at the top of Nob Hill - at the intersection of both cable car lines. This provides a fantastic jumping off point to see all that this wonderful city has to offer! Be aware though - it's a STEEP hill to walk up, and aside from the cable cars - there aren't a lot of other Muni options nearby. As the cable car is more of a tourist attraction, you can expect long lineups and full cable cars going by the Fairmont pretty much all of the time. Taxi's are a good option in the evening - for dinner reservations or bar hopping, but we were stuck waiting in a line about 20 deep of annoying, arrogant consumer attorneys and their \"hired\" companions!! As far as the hotel goes - the hotel is absolutely stunning, especially the lobby! I particularly enjoyed the antique mail chute, and the way the hallways reminded me of scenes from \"The Shining\". They have a great tiki restaurant/lounge called \"Tonga\" in the basement of the hotel (around the old swimming pool which is now a lagoon). They have a very popular happy hour on Thursday and Friday nights which is VERY affordable, and the fake thunderstorms that occur every twenty minutes or so is kitschy but cool. There was a real thunderstorm going on outside when we were there! The long-term plan is for this restaurant to close in a couple years - given how popular this restaurant appears to be (and how incredibly fun it is), I'd say that this would be a fatal error on the part of the hotel management and ownership! The rooms are well-appointed, with warm, comfortable finishes and furnishings. We had booked an Interior Queen in the main building, and were upgraded to an Exterior King with Bay view on arrival. We had a lovely view of Alcatraz and Telegraph Hill. Krystle at the front desk was extremely professional, very outgoing and friendly - and clearly loved her job and the city she lives in. Charlotte at the Concierge desk was also very helpful when looking for dining suggestions. My only cons for the hotel were the lack of pool or jacuzzi, a few operational things that weren't in place in our room (burnt out lightbulbs, slow-draining tub, etc), and the location of the elevators (which is to be expected in such an old hotel).

It sits atop of Nob Hill which means there are great views of the city and the bay, but definitely not near the hustle and bustle of SF and you'll pretty much need to take a cab wherever you go. The food at Laurel Court left much to be desired. However, there is something to be said for the enormous marble pillars, fabulous crown molding, detail oriented wall paper, and what looks like original crystal chandeliers. The newly redone Swigg Suite Penthouse has a mind-blowing view of the Transamerica building and the bay (although most people probably wouldn't be able to step foot unless they ponied up a hefty amount). Like I said, the hotel is historic, code for old. It was a little musty when I arrived, although the smell seemed to disappear or I just got used to it as time went on. Maybe because I arrived on a very rainy day? There was no coffee bar, or water available in the room and the room service prices are exorbitant (and the food is mediocre at best)! There was no turn down service. The walls are thin, I could hear the guy in the room next to me blowing his nose (plus his yappy lil' dog) and I'm sure he could hear my very low volume TV in the am. The saving grace is the great attitude by the staff. Everywhere I went, the staff was friendly and even greeted me and made polite conversation with me in the hallways and elevators.

I really pumped myself up for it and picked The Fairmont as my top choice specifically. I felt that the location was perfect for a first timer, and being such a well known hotel, that I would be treated special and well taken care of. That just wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case. The room was smaller than I had expected, but we had a decent view and I really hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planned on spending much time there anyway. The hotel lobby was gorgeous, the lounges and gift shops as well. However, I felt EXTREMELY unwelcome. I guess being under 30 with a spouse covered in tattoos, you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect that six figures would be my salary. We were either treated as though we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist, or like children. I went to one of the boutiques on 3 separate occasions and although myself and the girl working at that time were the only ones in the room, I was not acknowledged once. I stood at the concierge desk a handful of times on the way out of the hotel with questions and again, no assistance. The two times I was assisted, the concierge gave me incorrect information about how exactly one uses the cable cars, and when I was too exhausted to go find somewhere to eat, I was referred to have Chinese delivered from (what the Concierge described as his 'top recommendation from China Town') a place that sloppily brought me leaking bags of food to my room. When I asked someone about delaying my checkout time by an hour, I was told to call the day OF checkout to see if it could be pushed back. Which seems to defeat the purpose of a later leisurely checkout. Plumbing was clearly an issue when each time I went to brush my teeth, the sink was clogged and quickly filled with water. A man was given the wrong room number at one point and spent 10 minutes outside my door try to pry himself into my room. There was a gap in the seal of the door so the light from the hallway shined through all night. We went down to the Tonga room and ended up walking away after no one ever came to seat us. I called one evening to have a cab ready to take us to the Symphony because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had experiences with some cabs in other cities not taking credit cards. I was told it would be no problem and there would be one waiting at a specific time. After watching the bellmen hop around assisting everyone coming in and leaving the hotel but us, I stood at the end of the street to flag down my own. Which is not a problem, however if that was going to be the case I shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been told otherwise. Ordering room service one night was a complete waste of the overpriced menu food I could have prepared myself; with the exception of the chocolate cake which I must say was phenomenal. I do wish it had been more clear and literally mentioned to me about the room service charge per person with gratuity included when I placed the order. Maybe that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s naive of me and you're thinking I should have read the fine print, but again this was my first time traveling to any other city besides the state I live in and I expected to be taken care of. Which I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel is too much to ask. Although these were not a necessity to me, I also found it odd that such a higher end facility would not already have wifi and parking included; when even many 3 star hotels do. Just because one makes enough money doesn't mean they should be taken advantage of and sucked dry. I was just really let down with the ever so mediocre experience when I was expecting to have a happily memorable stay there, a fabulous place to call my own which I could continue to stay each returning trip, and a definite place to refer to those close to me.

I love the history of the hotel and how it dates back to the early 1900s. However, with a name like \"Fairmont\", you'd expect classy service to go with what I understand is their flagship hotel. I was completely wrong. I read on one of the reviews that the place is just \"ok\". I would have to agree 100% Although the place is impressive, you are not getting the service to go along with this. During recent visits to San Francisco, I've stayed at the Ritz Carlton, The Omni, St. Francis, and Mandarin. Of these four, the two that stood out the most and far exceeded expectations were The Ritz Carlton and The Omni. Ritz is Ritz, what more can you say. As for the Omni, it's a smaller hotel, but their guest service ranks right at the top. Rooms are equally as well kept and clean as the Ritz Carlton, and the food is very good. I stayed at the Fairmont with several relatives and friends while in town. It was nice to be at the top of Nob Hill, something different for a change. However, I had an incident in the room where the wires seemed to be dangling from underneath the desk. I could clearly see it was not connected. The wires were on my lap while using the desk, that's how low. I called front desk and asked if someone could take care of this. They said someone will be up there shortly, within 30 min. I waited and waited. I gave it an hour thinking maybe they're backed up or something. I called again. This time the guy on the phone said \"I show no request for the wires...\" What?!!! Not too pleased with this, I said, \"can you just have someone come up here to at least fastened this properly, so it doesn't always hang down onto my lap?\" Okay, so I waited after he said \"I'll send engineering right away.\" I waited... and waited. I finally called downstairs and asked for the Manager. I got the front desk manager. Funny, he sounded just like the guy I spoke to 30 min. earlier. Hmm. So the manager apologizes and says, \"did they fix your toilet?\" What?!!!! In the end, I once again explained the situation, only this time, I told him, sorry, but I'm just going to tape this or something because it's annoying with the wires hanging down. When I checked out, I thought, \"this is such a nice hotel, but boy do they lack the overall service a hotel like this should provide.\" If it's for a night where you don't mind spending the money and don't care if you need the staff for anything, I'd say go ahead and stay there for the experience of this hotel. But if there's anything beyond staying at a place with a bed, I'd highly recommend the Ritz Carlton or the Omni. Both just down the street. I was very surprised with the Fairmont's Management.

Cons: Location isn't great if you're interested in exploring the city; doors in the main building are REALLY loud when they close, so avoid it if you're a light sleeper; but the real problem is this hotel's service: it's is poor, particularly given the Fairmont reputation and price. 1) My husband joined the President's Club to take advantage of free internet service in the rooms. Personally, I don't think a hotel of this quality should be charging $14/day for the internet. But my husband had trouble accessing it (probably because he was new to the President's Club). When we checked out, instead of taking his PC number and taking the charges off the bill, the woman at the front desk spent 15 minutes telling him that he didn't log in correctly. Finally, she took the charges off. 2) Upon check out, we called the bell desk for help with our bags. We weren't leaving San Francisco until that evening, so we wanted to store them at the hotel. The bellman told me that we could just leave them in the room... he would be right up to get them. Guess what? When we returned that evening, the bellman on duty (not the one from the morning) couldn't find them. Turns out that they were sitting in our vacated room ALL DAY. And to add insult to injury, the bellman took my husband over to the front desk and explained that we had never checked out properly or this wouldn't have happened. Since we spent 15 minutes with the first rude front desk person to get a new receipt, we pointed out how that was incorrect. And again, instead of just apologizing, the bellman and the front desk employee went on and on about how we shouldn't have left without a claim ticket. Certainly not superior (and in my mind, not even acceptable) service for a top tier hotel. Thank goodness my husband's employer was paying for the room.", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montpellier, France", "Title": "\u201cIs overrated\u201d", "Author": "roswell_co", "ReviewID": "UR74496549", "Content": "We stayed there for four nights and were somewhat disappointed: Refrigerator was out of service, glasses were not washed and two days later disappeared without being replaced; not very sound proof (banging of doors in the morning and loud radio/TV in the evening).

This one did not disappoint. It has a real sense of history, as if it's a part of SF's own heritage. Lobby is just superb, and a tourist attraction in its own right. We had a room in the tower (20th floor) with great views south towards downtown and Union Sq and right across the road to the \"Top of the Mark\" bar atop the Mark Hopkins Hotel. Location could not be faulted, in one of San Fran's quieter districts, but only a few blocks from bustling Union Square. Our room (Deluxe, with 2 queen beds) was beautifully appointed, clean, and spacious (there were 3 of us). Staff were friendly and courteous. In particular Tom Wolf was a great concierge (and the original one in USA..!!) and got us great seats at the AT&T stadium. Breakfast in the Laurel restaurant was fantastic, but very expensive, so we ended up getting take-outs from the Cafe Cento (also part of the Fairmont) for most days. The bar had a lovely ambiance, very welcoming, never over full though always full of life, with very comfortable chairs and settees - a great place to unwind after a gruelling day's sightseeing down (and up!) San Fran's hills. Otherwise, only downside was 1) that there were no coffee/tea-making facilities in our room (first time I have ever stayed at a hotel in USA/Canada without such facilities....which I always use), 2) there were no arm chairs or settees in the room (have always had these in previous Fairmont deluxe rooms), and 3) the Nob Hill location is superb, but lacks the abundant choice of restaurants in other parts of the city (though Chinatown is only 3 blocks away).

We walked all over the city wth our young baby, and thoroughly enjoyed coming up the hill at the end of the night The staff for the most part were fantastic. We did have an issue on the Saturday night, as a function occurring in the Crown Room created the feeling of being in a night club. I phoned and spoke with an operator who put me through to the manager. She did not offer to do anything for us, and said she would have engineering look into it, which in fairness to her, is all I asked. We had no interest in moving as my baby was asleep, and we were exhausted anyways. Fell asleep despite the noise. All other staff including concierge for questions were fantastic. Most of the complaints I have read can be alleviated by a few easy steps: Join the Presidents Club, it is simple and easy, and best of all, free Your WI FI is freee in your room, you can access the gym for free, and they will even provide you with gym clothes to work out. It was on my way to the gym early in the morning that I noticed coffe and tea at the concierge desk. I believe this is provided before the restaurants etc open, but not sure. When it wasn't there I brought up coffe from Cafe Centro, which is much cheaper than the ridiculous room service prices Overall, if you understand you will be in a hotel that is over a hundred years old, and will be a bit noisy etc, and don't mind walking a bit uphill, and you join the PC, you will enjoy your stay.

First, since most people only write about the hotel, I want to write something about the city for those of you who are also first time visitors. The airport is large, and very busy, but there are a lot of cabs to the hotels, it was $40 each way. The location of the hotel is pretty good, however, if I were to go back I would like to stay in the Union Square at the Drake or JW Marriott, or the Fisherman's Wharf at the Hyatt. You are about a 5 minute walk to Union square, but believe me it is a walk, the hills are so steep here that we preferred to take a taxi. The Trolleys are located right behind the hotel. We took the trolley to the Fisherman's Wharf, it is $5.00 each person, but it is a hassle, they only stop at certain locations, and there is never enough room. We just took a taxi again for $10.00. So if you are staying at this hotel to be close to the trolleys (like I did) I recommend another hotel closer to the hot spots. Room: We had an exterior room, the hotel was sold out when we were there due to the 4th. The rooms are average size, very comfy king bed, small bath, nice view from window of the Bay Bridge. We signed up for the presidents club online so we were able to use the internet there for free which was great. Cleaning staff was amazing, we even had turn down service nightly. When we checked in we noticed our mini fridge was empty, so I called immediately to let the staff know, hopefully we are not charged for anything, I am still waiting for my monthly statement. Weather: Pack accordingly, it was all fog, and a high of 60 degrees! I am glad I brought long pants, and sweaters! Napa Valley: We rented a car for the day and headed to Napa Valley, it was 85 degrees there and only 45 minutes away. We traveled through Muir woods (very cool) and across golden gate bridge. I recommend going to V.Sattui if you like sweet wines, I bought a Moscato there that was to die for! On the way home we took the Oakland way, there are a lot of restaurants there, and then we went over the Bay Bridge home. Union Square: So many stores and restaurants, but very very expensive. Everything in San Francisco is expensive, we spent over $1000 for 2 of us in 3 days. Also there are a lot of people living on the streets in union square begging for money, I wouldn't have felt safe unless I had my boyfriend there with me, this was not something I am used to. Fisherman's Wharf: You must go to Pier 39 to see Alcatraz and the seals! PS. Do not eat at Joes Crab Shack, it was gross. Height and Ashbury Street: It is about a $20 taxi ride there, and it is full of young hippies, but the stores are amazing, I bought some really cute tops there. Alamo Square: This is where the Full House home is! But besides that nothing else, its right by height and ashbury street and an expensive ride for a picture (probably a good idea to see if you have a car) Car Rental: We rented the car to see Napa, we got it from enterprise on Mason st in Union Square, we waited about 2 hrs for our car so they upgraded us to a Mercedes which was nice. Parking at the hotel was $50, and since we only had the car for 1 night and we left the next morning we dropped it off at 9pm with the valets at the hotel next to enterprise for $30, everything worked out great. Overall, I would probably stick with Napa Valley, it is much warmer, and not as many street people everywhere, I felt a lot safer there. I am glad I was able to travel to San Francisco but I would probably just visit there instead of stay there.

We loved our stay there, with only a few minor exceptions. When I originally started planning our trip to SF I checked rates for the Fairmont and found it to be too expensive, so I booked another room upscale hotel in the city. The week before our trip I checked rates again and found a great rate on the hotels website. With a AAA discount I was able to get a room in the main building for $153 a night, but opted for a larger, standard room in the tower for $171. I thought that was a great rate. At check in DH decided to upgrade us to a premiere tower room for $50 more a night. It was worth the money, as we were on the 20th floor with a view of the entire city. The room was lovely and the bed was amazingly comfortable. The bathroom was large, with a large shower and separate soaking tub. The only down side was that there was very little counter space. The service was amazing. We used the concierge desk several times for making reservations as well as various suggestions for travel around the area and shopping. They were always very helpful. Also, upon checking in, we noticed there was only one bathrobe, so we called and asked if we were supposed to have two. Within five minutes there was someone at our door with a second robe. Also we had drinks in the Tonga Room, and it was great. Only a few complaints. As others mentioned, there is no coffee maker in the room, or coffee conveniently available. A pot of coffee from room service was $20 plus all the service chages, gratuities etc. In the morning, while dressing, I would just like a cup of coffee to help me get going. I don't want t spend that kind of money and I don't want to get dressed to have to go looking for coffee. Also, I joined the Presidents Club in order to get free internet otherwise it was $13.95 a day. In the desk, there was a wireless router, but the signal was so low I could never connect to it. There was also an ethernet cable/connection, but it would not work either. I found a 24 hour help desk number and contacted them. They walked me through what I needed to do, but it never worked. He suggested that I might need a new ethernet cable and said he would contact the front desk and have a new one sent up right away. We waited for a long time, but no one ever came. I finally found one of my own in the bottom of my computer bag, and was able to connect with it. We were never able to connect wirelessly. I do not recommend the Sunday breakfast buffet. We decided to try it, even though $30 each seemed a bit high. We figured it would be wonderful. While it was okay, it was definitely not worth the money. The buffet did have lots of good fresh fruits, and some nice baked goods, but the main dishes were just not great and had a small selection. The selections of hot dishes were eggs benedict, French toast, oatmeal, potatoes, bacon and sausage The French toast was dry and stale, and the eggs benedict, looked pretty dried out as well. We opted for the omelette station instead. The omlette was okay, but not something I would have again. They did offer Belgian waffes as well, but we did not try them. The breakfast price included coffe and juice, and we ordered nothing extra, but by the time the bill came, with all of the surcharges added on, including a 15% breakfast surcharge (What?) it was $75.75 for 2 people. Really outrageous for a mediocre breakfast.

In planning a trip to San Francisco, we considered the Four Seasons, InterContinental Mark Hopkins, and the Fairmont San Francisco. Because we have had such satisfactory results with the Fairmont chain, we decided that it would be great to stay in the original Fairmont hotel. We stayed there for four nights in early June. The Fairmont San Francisco has a wonderful history and is a grand, elegant place. The lobby is spectacular and clearly is among the \"great\" classic lobbies of the finer hotels around the world. The service we received from the hotel staff was excellent. We had a king-bed room in the older part of the hotel which was spacious and comfortable. My wife and I are both President's Club members so we were able to get complimentary Wi-Fi service in our room. However, we were frustrated by the lack of an in-room coffee service. We inquired and were told there was coffee service in the lobby from 6:00 - 8:00 am. Well, thanks a lot! (Almost all high-quality hotels now provide in-room coffee service.) The room-service Continental breakfasts were excellent, but an expensive way to have a pot of coffee in your room. Most of our disappointment with this hotel was in the restaurants. We found the food in the Laurel Court to be quite good but thought the service was stiff and pretentious. On our last evening we made the mistake of going to the Tonga Room, which was an unpleasant experience. This was in part our mistake for not checking the reviews of the Tonga Room much more closely. The Tonga Room provides an unusual atmosphere (but not as good as the early Trader Vic's Polynesian restaurants), good drinks, a mediocre band, insipid, almost inedible food, and terrible service.

In the spirit of other classic hotels of the world, The Fairmont lobby will take your breath away. The anticipation of entering our top floor suite was as great as the disappointment when the door opened and a musty, dusty, moldy odor of ancient carpeting, furniture and draperies combined with a hint of the plumbing backing up, made our toes curl. Before we could express our dismay, the bellman had already gone without even waiting or asking for a tip. It's like he knew that we were going to hate the room. We called down to the front desk only to be told that the only room in the hotel available, was an inside standard rooms. No view and only a queen bed. (Only suites have king beds.) The standard rooms are very small. Probably, the reason for no king beds. The bathroom was only big enough to physically contain the camode, sink and tub. But, the standard room was more updated. The bad thing was that our room was right next to the housekeeping supply closet. So, in the middle of the night, when someone wants some towels or something, we were awakened. Even after several complaints to the front desk, the staff made no attempt to be quiet during the night. For the money, this place is a complete ripoff. I can stay at a hotel with a nicer, larger room for half the price. If you do not care what things cost, you won't mind the inflated cost of the room or $30 per person for the breakfast buffet, plus 15% gratuity that THEY ADD to the check (for a buffet). The service from the staff was actually OK, with the exception of the doorman. When we were leaving, he watched me struggle with our luggage down the stairs while he was chit chatting with another employee. As I got the bags to the cab, he finally came over and asked if we needed any assistance. I said well, not anymore. He did not like that and basically advised me (with extra attitude) that I should have waited at the top of the stairs until he arrived to help. I said I had a flight to catch and he should go and finish his conversation with his freind.

Upon arrival, the front desk staff was welcoming and friendly. Check-in was quick (due in part to being a President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Club member and having a separate reception line.) I was shown to my room (Main Building - Balcony Suite.) The sitting area furniture looked quite worn and the bedroom was very small. I was excited to see the balcony, but directly underneath was a large noisy generator which would have made sitting outside unpleasant. None of these would have affected my stay much, however I asked for a room change because my non-smoking room reeked of cigarettes. When I called the front desk, I talked to a very helpful employee who had my room changed immediately. He gave me my choice of 2 rooms and I told him to put me in the one where he would want to stay as a guest. His pick was absolute perfection! I was shown to the Calcutta Suite in the Main Building; what an amazing space! The bedroom had a king bed, television, marble bathroom and sitting area. Connected by a short hallway, was a 2nd room with a dining table for 6, couch and armchairs, television, a desk, and a second full bathroom! Being a corner room, natural light streamed in through the windows. I felt like I was in a luxury apartment and not a hotel room. I was grateful that although only 3 floors up, the room was silent. This is rare, but absolute bliss when staying in the heart of a city! Additionally, the views were stunning. (Being on top of Nob Hill means that even the lower floor rooms have amazing views.) During my conference breaks, I'd sit at the desk or on the huge windowsill in the room, and soak up the city sights. When visiting, I took advantage of the fitness center and attended a morning yoga class which was so soothing after a day of traveling. I highly recommend it! Fairmont rooms are consistently beautiful, clean, and comfortable, however it was the staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gracious attitude and quick problem solving that makes them stand out from the competition.

It was only food for three adults and a child. And even at that price I could have been okay with it, except that we were all still hungry after eating. There were no coffee makers and coffee in the room, so you are forced to make other arrangements. Had it not been for my cousin getting married there, I wouldn't have ever gone there, especially with a family.

The bed was very comfortable and the room itself impeccibly clean. The location is unbeatable, where the two cable car lines meet on top of Nob Hill. The cons were minor, but going to mention them here: 1) When hubby went to check in the day of the wedding, they did not have the room I reserved nearly a year in advance. However, since we were not going to be in our room until later, they managed to put us in the Buckingham Suite - no complaints there. 2) We ordered room service for breakfast and when it arrived, the drinks were warm. Despite being in iced containers, the milk and orange juice were both warm from having been under the tray. Not drinkable. Also, we didn't order orange juice, but they included it anyway. Yes, I could have sent it back or asked them to send new drinks, but it was too much hassle. 3) The fireplaces don't actually work. A bit disappointing but hardly a huge deal. Overall, we were very happy to stay there. Hopefully we'll be able to get the same suite on our honeymoon.

It is also the only place with free guest wifi, so I did enjoy the lobby, but felt nickled & dimed that the rooms didn't have free wifi too. Located on the top of the Nob Hill area, the hotel has a trolley stop-off, and is a strenuous but bracing hike up from market street. It is an easy walk to Chinatown, and 15 minutes walk to SOMA and the SFMOMA. The main hiccups in service were when my wife was ignored at the entrance driveway because a VIP car had arrived. I commented to her that this was exactly the difference in service between 4 and 5 stars - that 5 star hotels treat all guests well all the time. The second hiccup was a slightly discourteous employee, and finally a noticeable drop in staff responsiveness when underdressed. Overall the Fairmont is still 4 stars.

If travelling with children; this would not be my top choice -- stay at the waterfront! The Argonaut is a terrific, fun, hotel with kids, and there will be far more to entertain them. Likewise, for a young adult, there is nothing hip or cool about the Fairmont. But for the business or adult traveller, the location is central for business and restaurants and quietly above the fray -- no cheap t-shirt shops on Nob Hill! And the Fairmont is truly a beautiful historic building. The best thing about the hotel per se, are the views -- so book a tower room (this is admittedly not the old part of the hotel, but you can still hang out in the historic marble lobby). Another decent choice are rooms in the front of the hotel overlooking the roof garden, which is lovely. By all means avoid the interior rooms - there is no point in staying here at all if you are looking out at grey interior walls!

The photos of the Fairmont standing alone amidst the desolation of the earthquake were especially moving.

If you look online and use coupons judiciously, you can get some really good rates. Otherwise the price would be prohibitive. This time we got a very good rate online, used a suite upgrade coupon, and a dining coupon (both leftover from our wedding). The hotel is so beautiful. Very grand, opulent, with gold and crystal and beautiful fabrics everywhere. However, we didn't like the labyrinth-layout. You can easily get lost wandering the halls. The function rooms seem to be cut off from the hotel, and although there is a very unusual tiki-room restaurant downstairs, you'd never know it was there unless you stumble upon it. At the Fairmont (in another city) where we got married, the function rooms are right off the lobby, so our wedding could really take advantage of the beautiful space. At the SF Fairmont, we felt like we had to walk through tunnels to get to some function rooms, not the best layout to have a party. Our suite was very beautiful, HUGE, and comfortable. It is larger than some SF apartments. The furnishings at a Fairmont really lift it well above the average business hotel. Our bed was super comfortable, and the bathroom all marble with lots of towels, soaps, and things to make our stay more convenient. The suite was too big for us though. If one of us sat in the sitting room, and the other in the bedroom, we'd practically have to call each other on the phone to say something. We stayed in a suite because it was free. Otherwise, a regular room would probably suffice. The suite would be good for a wedding or a party, if you plan to have a lot of people over to your room to sit and relax. Room Service breakfast was delicious, and arrived very quickly (under 15 minutes from the call). We used a dining coupon for it, but after tax, surcharges, and tip, the price of the breakfast was more than double our coupon. In future, we'll just eat elsewhere. My only complaint is that there were no slippers in the room, and the white fluffy bathrobe hanging in the bathroom was no longer fluffy, but stiff and crackly--a sign that it's been hanging there (hopefully unused) for a few previous guests. Note to the Fairmont--even if your guests don't use the bathrobe, please change it every time the guest checks out! The hotel is at a top of a hill, so be sure to wear THICK layers if you go out at night, because the wind might literally sweep you away. The trolley picks up right outside the hotel to the center of town, but it doesn't seem to run on time often. All in all, a grand hotel, highly recommended.

The Fairmont SFO is no exception. A very nice property and generally courteous and professional service. Location is great. It's right on top of Nob Hill, so the view is quite spectacular. I was in the Tower, and my room had a harbour view, which means I could see Alcatraz from my room. At night the lights of the city below are quite enticing. I was in SFO for business in the Union Square area, which is only a quarter of a mile from the hotel. But because the hotel is up on the hill, it's away from the noise and crowds below. I consider the location of the Fairmont to be ideal -- close enough to things but a place to escape to after. But it's on a hill. A steep one to boot. I like walking, but still going up gets tough especially if you do it two or three times a day. Of course you can also do the cable car, or take a cab. But I thought the walk would do me good after all the nice good in the city. The room is spacious. It's called a deluxe room in the Tower. Marble bathroom. Separate shower and tub. Miller Harris toliteries as usual. Bathrobes, etc. Large Flat screen TV, though reception is a bit iffy. No stereo equipment, other than an IPOD docking station/alarm clock. No coffee/tea making equipment in the room -- this is disappointment, since I have always enjoyed a cup of their nice Fairmont selection of teas in my rooms. Electronic safe in room, which is very nice. A/C works, if not extremely powerful, it is effective enough. Good closet space, though if you have a lot of overcoats etc it may become a bit cramped. Room in very good condition. I encountered none of the worn out conditions that some other reviewers mentioned. As is, my room, at least, does not even need a reno job. It's nice enough for a Fairmont. Breakfast in the Laurel Court. It's included in my rate. Very wide selection of foods for breakfast buffet. $28 per person.

We had a room on the second floor (though I requested higher floor) with a king bed and a view of the financial district. Our bed was comfy and the room felt pretty spacious. Bathroom was nice with Miller Harris toiletries! There may have been A/C in the room, but we could not tell if it was working. Fortunately, it was not too hot in SanFran while we were there...if we wanted to open our windows to the breeze (which, surprisingly, we could do on the second floor--no screens or bars!), we also had to listen to the trolley bells until about midnight as well as traffic. Beware that the valet parking costs $50 a night! With taxes, it came to about $64/night--absolutely outrageous! We normally don't have a car with us in the city, as we prefer to take taxis and walk everywhere, but we had been traveling south of the city before this and decided to just keep the car until going back to the airport. In other words, we paid $64/night to park our car and still paid to take taxis to dinner, etc. Do yourself a favor if you're staying within the city proper--don't rent a car! If you decide to venture out of the city for a day, rent a car from one of the \"city\" locations and return it the same afternoon. If you do have to drive in, the garage around the corner charges the same, so don't even bother looking elsewhere, you are a captive audience. Also, we noticed that the staff (and even the concierge) did not seem to have very strong opinions about the best places to dine or go for nightlife. We had done some preliminary research on Zagat and Citysearch, so had a fair idea of what we wanted, but when we had had enough fine dining and we were looking for a good \"local's\" perspective on a place to grab a good burger and a decent draft beer, they looked at us like we were aliens. For the pleasure of staying in a great location (be prepared for the \"hike\" back up the hill from anywhere you go--the way out is easy, the way back is EXERCISE!) with elegant surroundings, if you can get a good price in pricey SanFran, the Fairmont is a good deal (we got a corporate rate) and a memorable property.

Fairmont Miramar, 2. Inn of the Spanish Garden, 3. Intercontinental The Clement, 4. Napa Valley Lodge). First off, the Fairmont holds arguably one of the better locations in the city, right atop Nob Hill - great unless you have to walk up this hill a few times. So my first suggestion is to get a 3-day (or however many days your staying) pass for all transit and use it! It will save your feet. Two major cable car lines go right past the hotel. The hotel is certianly one of the most historic in San Fran, and the walls inside are fairly tastefully plastered with lots of memorabilia to remind you of this. The lobby is quite spectacular, with tons of marble and seating, all very old world style. Staff were wonderful with one notable exception - Rick. Rick was completely unhelpful both times I had the misfortune of trying to seek assistance at the front desk. Just avoid him and you will be fine! We initially had a room on the 14th floor, and the staff was happy to move us up to the top floor (23) the next day - so we had a spectacular view of the bay, including Alcatraz and the bridge. The Tower room was very nice, well kept with spacious bathroom completely swathed in marble. Seperate tub and glass shower - all the amenities you would expect. Beds exceptionally comfortable, staff all great (except Rick) and great location made for a memorable stay. Since I have a corporate rate, and also Fairmont President Club status was able to get an upgrade at a great price. Highly recommend the Fairmont President Club - one of the best in the industry in my humble opinion - and only 5 stays to get Gold status! This is nothing for business travellers. Would definitely stay here again. Only downside is, as with most large hotels, the price of food onsite is outrageous. I used my $50 food certificate for breakfast on the last day, and that did not even cover the full cost!! I have no problem paying $200- $300 for a great dinner at a top scale restaurent, but the idea of paying $60 for breakfast just spins me around. You can get a perfectly good breakfast sandwich, with large latte at Starbucks for $6.50. Nothing justifes 10x that. Wonderful historic hotel, great location (despite the climb to get there), great staff (except Rick), wonderful room and bath - no problem recommending this hotel. It should be higher on the list - in Top 15 I would think. Wish I had the time and money to hit the otgher 30 San Francisco hotels if they are all BETTER than the Fairmont - that would be something.

We were in the Main Building and I would have loved the views from the new tower, but what it lacked in views it made up in style, comfort and amenities. Just wandering the hotel, you get this great feeling of oppulance, history, and wealth. I heard some weird fact that every US President from FDR that has visited SF has always stayed in the Fairmont. I can certainly see why. The lobby is not trendy, or sexy, but it is grand and full of the finest marble. There must be 15 different little couch areas to just to sit with a drink or wait for someone. Please promise me you will visit the in-house TONGA ROOM bar and restaurant, at least for a drink. It's quite a scene! Great place to have a Mai Tai before you head out. There is this feature where they make it rain and a band plays on a moving boat. I felt like I was really in Tahiti. (even though I had never been) Also worth a drink is the Top of the Mark Bar and Lounge right across the street in the Intercontinental hotel. One minute I had amazing views of all of SF, and the next minute we were encompassed in fog. Do like I did and sign up for the President's Club for free, before you check inn. It will get you free internet, gym usage, and a daily paper. You can do it at the Fairmont website. My only problem and it's not the hotels fault, is those darn hills! Some say it adds character to the city; I simply find it annoying. I'm 28 and in decent shape and I was huffing and puffing when returning from a dinner of bar around the area. They are more like little mountains. I felt like I was a Sherpa at time's with my wifes bags from shopping. I was a little skeptical because I kept hearing this hotel was \"old\" and \"outdated,\" but all areas we looked at, including our room, showed no signs of wear-and-tear. We had a late flight (10pm) and the bell desk was happy to hold our bags until about 8pm. In fact, he also got us a Fairmont House Car / Luxury Sedan to take us to the airport, rather than a regular cab for the same price. Overall a great hotel.

I can tell you that I we have booked this hotel again for our trip back to San Fran over Christmas. PS - I did forget one thing. The hotel has two areas for rooms.

The only draw back is you do not have a view. You only look out over the garden area or onto the street. The Tower side - These rooms are not as large (they are approx 450 - 500sq ft not including the very large bathroom) The views are either of downtown looking onto Union Square OR directly facing the bay.

After my stay, some expections were met, others weren't. The Fairmont is a real 5 stars hotel in many things but some aspects let the expernece fall down. The building is nearly at the top of Nob Hill, offering wonderful sights on San Francisco. At my arrival immediataly 2 members of the staff were ready to open taxi's doors and take the luggage out of the car; they gave me a card in order to take my suitcases back after the check-in. The lobby is not huge but spectacular, one of the best I ever seen: floor and colums full of marble, beautifiul ceiling and carpets. Due to a misunderstanding between the hotel and my travel agency, my booking (2 queen size beds room) were transormed into a king size bed room. Because there weren't other 2 queen beds room available, I was upgraded to a larger room with a partail view of tha bay in which they placed a rollaway bed. The check-in was anyway fast, then a bell-boy immediatelky took our luggage to the room. Lifts and corridors are nothing special compared to the lobby; the size of the room was quiet good (about 30 sq. mt): there were a very comfortable king size bed in the middle, an LCD flat screen (37\" or 40\"), some lamps and 2 armchairs. There were a small marble bathroom (product's bathroom were Miller Harris) and a big closet. The room (located in the old palace) was full of contradictions: beutiful lamps but and old armchair, marble bathroom but an old bathtub, a beautiful bed and an LCD TV but old and not very clean curtains. And this was the feeling I had during my whole stay. Every morning they left in front of my door a copy of the US Today. On one day of my stay, SF authorities had planned to simulate a huge nuclear attack in SF's downtown. The evening before, hotel staff informed me about this event with a very detailed letter describing this training (in the letter there was even the street that would had been closed). A nice and useful touch. Staff confirmed their skill when I informed a guy about a stain on the rollaway bed's sheet. I wrongly thought he was a member of the housekeeping but I didn't need to call housekeeping to let the sheet change: this guy (probably a hotel's supplier) informed directly hotel staff. The hotel offers two great restaurant options: the famous Tonga Room and a restaurant adjiacent to the lobby that, as the latter, has amazing walls, furniture and ceiling. Since electronic check-out wasn't available on my departure date, I checked out at the front desk and they took me off the rollaway bed costs (90$). Another nice touch I really appreciated. I think one of the basic 5 stars hotel guests' expectation after paying a lot of money for a room is not to find a hotel where everyone seem to be ready to charge everything (another example of this king is the minibar that was not, luckily, an electronic one. At the check-out I was happy to hear again after a long time the question \"did you take something from the minibar?\"). And finally here are the issues I found that don't allow me to describe my Fairmont experience like a five stars one: 1. my room wasn't absolutely soundproofed. Always, especially in the early morning, I could hear from my bed many terrrible and very noisy door's slams. This was REALLY ANNOYING and out of standars for a luxury hotel. 2. something looked old and not being subjected to the recent restructuring: one the left carpet of the lobby there was a big rip, like on a sheet of my bed. And, as I wrote before, corridors, lifts and moquette were not in line with the beauty of the lobby. All in all, the Fairmont SF has all the features in order to be an amazing hotel: beautiful building and common areas, and a very skilled staff. They just need to bring to higher levels all the details I described.

We stayed in room 675, which is the older main building, not the tower. The room we booked was a queen sized bed, interior courtyard view. There is no view to speak of - you're looking at the room across from you. That was fine and I knew that when I booked the least expensive room. Check-in went smoothly and they were able to accomodate our early arrival time of 11 am. The room itself was gorgeous and fairly large. The bathroom is a bit small, but nicely appointed in marble and the shower pressure is excellent. Great walk-in closet. Has the usual overpriced minibar and the dresser was kind of small if you were staying for more than 3-4 days, but the closet space more than made up for it. Very clean. The beds are the BEST I have ever experienced at any hotel (sorry Ritz Carlton!) and were so comfortable that falling asleep was effortless. While falling asleep was effortless, actually STAYING asleep provided to be the greater challenge. The walls in the main building are paper thin and the couple in the room next to us on our first night there was having the most major of arguments, complete with things being thrown around the room and profanities abounding. We called security at midnight and things did seem to calm for awhile, but picked up again with the same behavior. We could hear everything. Granted, these people were completely inconsiderate, but even when the tenants changed the following day, we could still hear talking - so just beware that while the rooms are indeed beautiful, your conversation and activities are not completely your own. The lobby is indeed palatial and deserving of its place in grand hotel history. Complimentary coffee was offered in the morning. We did not eat at all in the Laurel Court, although it did look quite nice. The other hiccup in our Fairmont stay was the Tonga Room - the lower floor bar complete with fake rain, thunder and lightning. We went on Friday night for happy hour, since we had read multiple times that this is the best happy hour in the city. What a joke. The buffet is a waste at 9.95, nasty frozen egg rolls and overfried chicken wontons with salty noodles on the side. Don't even bother. We were definitely disappointed in the Tonga Room.

Everyone else talks about service and the lobby so I'll keep my review to this - don't stay here if you can't manage walking up hills. The Fairmont website claims to be close to the BART station, which isn't exactly a lie, but the map doesn't show hills. The Fairmont is at the top of one. A steep one. Luckily, we braved the streets and traffic and drove our bags to the hotel before dropping the car off at the airport after having been to Napa. Frankly we wouldn't have made the hills, up or down, with our luggage. Even without heavy bags, the hills do put you off coming and going more than once a day, unless you are either driving or are prepared to pay for taxis everywhere. If nothing else, to say you stayed at the Fairmont San Francisco is a real buzz so you forgive the hills and the fraying decor (as did John McCain who stayed there 2 days before us), and you're guaranteed to always find you hotel in SF/USA guide books - it's a city landmark.", "Date": "August 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cClassic Hotel with Style and Charm\u201d", "Author": "perfectlyfrank", "ReviewID": "UR18650857", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Fairmont for two nights, 7/26 and 7/27 and we were quite impressed with the grand lobby.

The bathroon was spacious, and the tub had great water pressure for producing an excellent bubblebath (did I mention it was deep?) There were sliding doors to block off the sitting area from the sleeping area, which was nice, and also separate temperature controls.

The Powell St. line took us on one end to Fisherman's Wharf, and the other to Market Street, taking you through Union Square. The California Street line took us down to the Ferry Building at the Embarcadero. While I wouldn't use cable cars as a primary means of transport (make sure you either buy a 1 day or at least a 3 day MUNI passport), being on a cable car is much more enjoyable than walking the steep hills of SF.

If there are things to complain about: $50 a night for parking, and then 14% occupancy tax is charged to make the total nightly cost $57.

The downsides: * $50/day charge to park your car in their garagea (though I must admit, they were very gracious the day we were leaving -- they let us keep our car in their garage and said they would not charge us for an extra day if we returned a bit late from our sight seeing.) * Room service - food quality was a huge disappointment and the prices were so inflated, it was almost laughable.

My wife and I decided to stay here on the last 3 days of our honeymoon (after staying in Napa for 4 days), and we couldn't have been more impressed and happy with our experience. I had read quite a few reviews that complained about the bellhops not being helpful, but as soon as we pulled up, we were treated very well, and received very helpful service by them. They unloaded our bags, and took our car to the garage, then sent someone up to our room to drop off our baggage after we checked in. There was a little complication with the signature bay view room that we had booked initially, because they apparently had overbooked a bit, and it wasn't available. They promptly corrected that issue (even though they never actually stated that it was an issue) but putting us up in their show room on the 16th floor of the tower. We were impressed with the overall beauty of the outside and in of the hotel itself, but the room took our breath away. I doubt that there are many other views from a room in San Francisco that could beat this one. It was breathtaking. The bathroom was large and amazing also, and we were also impressed with the comfortable bed, and the champagne and chocolate covered strawberrys that awaited us upon our arrival. With the exception of the lady at the check in counter being a bit snooty about me using my debit card at the desk, the staff and valet people were very friendly and helpful the entire time. My only warning about this hotel is the location. That's not because it's not a good location, because it is, but if you plan on walking anywhere, I hope you're in good shape. I thought that people were exaggerating when they talked about this in the past reviews, but they weren't, because this hotel is on the top of a steep hill, and can be quite a workout for those who don't workout very often.

And it's safe to say this was a solid choice in a fine location that more than exceeded my expectations. Why it was hovering around the 70's on the Trip Advisor rankings when I booked is a complete mystery, though I see it's improved since then. I booked a no frills Fairmont room and knew going in it would be in the older, historic wing of the hotel which was fine with me as I wanted to spend my time sightseeing and experiencing the city not watching TV in my hotel room. Upon arriving from my airport shuttle before noon I wondered whether I would get my room early and was pleased to find it was ready for me, a nice bonus where I could drop off my bags and hit the ground running. Room #583 is a large and well appointed room that overlooked the almost zero view interior of the building, a view not even worth taking a digital picture of so didn't. The king bed featured the standard super comfy bedding and high quality duvet and sheets you expect from a luxury hotel chain and set off an understated, elegant room that hinted at it's age but didn't show it. And what I mean was being over a century old you could tell the building was designed in another era with high vaulted ceilings, very large walk-in closets and a very deep tub but a more recent update had brought the fixtures and furniture up to more modern standards so I never felt it was too \"antique\". The mini-bar was hidden in a nice cabinet that the flat screen LCD TV sat on top of while the bathroom featured a nice blend of marble and tile. But the highlight of the room to me was an unique hanging main light sort of mini-chandelier that again was both modern but with a traditional sense at the same time. The pictures I'll include show it probably better than I've explained it. The rest of the room was as well appointed and I liked the cloest which had more than the typical 3 hangers you seem to only be permitted at a few hotels I've been in lately. And while the bathroom was a little smaller than I expected it did offer a very deep tub that was good for soaking the tired legs in after hiking around, or more correctly up & down, the hills of San Francisco. The Fairmont sits atop Nob Hill and never having been to the city I had no idea how steep the hills actually are so getting a workout just sightseeing left me with zero energy to even try the hotel's gym facilities so I'm afraid I can't comment on those, although being a luxury business hotel I'm sure they are up to at the very least an acceptable minimum standard. The soaring ceilings in the lobby serve to leave a very lasting impression when you first enter by the main doors off Mason Street and seem in a way to dwarf the check-in, bell, concierge and Fairmont President's Club desks. The friendly reception was very polite and helpfull and that was the impression I received in all of my interactions with the staff. On my last day I had a very late flight out of San Francisco International, around 10pm, and asked the night before checking out whether I could get a late check out or whether there was anywhere to store my bags and the main desk agent called over the bell captain to answer my questions which seemed a small gesture but was miles better than simply telling me to walk over there myself. I should mention while speaking of the lobby that both guests and those attending one of many seminars or events at the hotel occupy the many sofa and chairs and most were quite well dressed which made me at times feel a tad underdessed. I did forget to write a few emails until after checking out but thought I'd still inquire whether I could pay cash for some time on one of their PC's and was told yes at what worked out to be $1/minute. Needless to say I wrote two very short emails and went on my way. I didn't think to ask if this was the price for walk-ins and whether the price for guests was different, though I was upfront at the business centre about having checked out only 15 minutes earlier. One small gripe that arose during my stay was at times the walls could be a bit thin and I thanked my lucky stars the guests on either side of my room were fairly quiet. Once or twice I could easily overhear one side of a business conversation that went on for 5 min. with what sounded like a bad connection as the gentleman in the next room was speaking quite loudly. I can see how with the wronf guest next door it could become a problem and it surprised me a little as I would've expected a big, older luxury hotel to be much more soundproofed than today's equivalents. But overall the stay more than exceeded my expectations and I'm glad I got to experience this memorable hotel in what has become a fast favorite world city of mine.

Not only did they extend our stay, they upgraded us to a high floor in the Tower with a king size bed(not queen as in the package) and a city and bay view.

Tips: The main hotel is old and noisy - stay in the Tower if at all possible. It's connected to the lobby in the original hotel by a corridor. If you rent a car, return it every night to avoid the hotel parking charge of $45.00. It's only a $5.00 cab ride to get back to the hotel from the Hertz garage. Avoid the Tonga Room at all costs. The hokey Mai Tai (in a plastic coconut) tasted like cough syrup and the dinners were comparable to a Chinese restaurant in a strip mall. It was so highly touted by the hotel we thought it would be historic and wonderful. They neglected to inform their guests that they were also replicating a1950's menu. Visit Grace Episcopal Cathedral which is around the corner from the hotel. Their philosophy is the same as Glide Memorial's. It's a beautiful church rebuilt after the 1906 earthquake and welcomes all people offering \"sanctuary to everyone.\" Don't miss the chapel to the right that offers solace to aids victims and their families.

My order arrived in good time, however the salad was rather disappointing as the salad dressing was quite overpowering. Disappointing, but not the end of the world. Being a hungry traveler, I was happy to have the salad nonetheless and finished it in short order. My room was clean and housekeeping did a fine job throughout my stay. The bed was fine and was stocked with plenty of comfortable pillows. The downside to the room, however, was (and this is my pet peeve) opening the doors to the lovely entertainment center and finding a rather smallish $199 Zenith tube television. This is 2007 guys, it's time to lose the Wal-Mart special and bring in the flat panel television. Again, disappointing, but not the end of the world. I did not use the hotel health club facilities or any of the other hotel dining options during my stay. The locaton of the hotel is a real plus, especially if you plan to travel using the cable cars, as I did. I bought a three-day MUNI pass at the airport for $18 and had unlimited access during my stay. Two cable car lines intersect at the corner California and Powell streets, right at the hotel. The hotel and my other destinations were on or near the cable car lines so this worked well for me. Even after the fairly recent renovation of the hotel, the Fairmont still seemed a little tired around the edges to me. As with the Mark Hopkins next door, there is a fine line between historic and just plain old. These two hotels both border closely to side of old and at times cross the line. Although my room at the Fairmont was larger than rooms I've had at the Mark Hopkins, my primary decision factor between the two would be price. All things considered, I saw no tangible advantage to one over the other. All in all, a generally positive stay at the Fairmont but I would consider returning only if I was able to get an comparatively attractive room rate.", "Date": "October 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central Valley California", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel rocks!\u201d", "Author": "My3sonsMom", "ReviewID": "UR10037047", "Content": "My boss took our whole staff for a conference and we LOVED this hotel....exactly what you would envision for San Fran...right in the heart of everything.....ornate and romantic...almost straight out of a movie.

The room was large with a King-sized bed and high quality furnishings. One bedside table had obviously been damaged and the top needed to be refinished. However, in the scope of things, this was a minor point. The bathroom was large with a separate tub and glass-enclosed shower. There was only a single sink. When checking in, there was a long line. However, as a member of the Fairmont President's Club, we went to that desk and complete check-in promptly. The lobby and common areas are breathtaking. It was fun to read the historic posters and photos lining the hallways. We did not dine in any of the restaurants, but we did have a fruity drink in the Tonga room and listened to the live band floating on the stage. It was fun in a corny sort of way. The location at the top of Nob Hill is fairly convenient. We walked most places and took a cable car when we returned to climb the hill. The valet parking is incredibly expensive at $51.30 per night, but a necessary evil in the city. We also were disappointed there was no coffee maker and just couldn't bring ourselves to pay nearly $20 for a pot of room service coffee !! Overall, it was a very nice hotel.

I'm actually writing this from the hotel, where I'm attending a conference. For $250/night, I would expect a room with a coffeemaker at the least, and enough space to move around without bumping into things. Although the closet is huge, the bathroom is very tiny with literally no counter space. The bedroom is like an obstacle course, with the TV positioned to the side of the bed, forcing you to view it by craning your neck to the left. The only window in the room looks across at an inner courtyard of the hotel where the ventilation system is located (i.e., not in the least bit scenic, and the drapes have to be kept closed most of the time since it faces other rooms.) The woman at the front desk during check-in asked whether I preferred a high or low floor and then put me on the second floor. I also asked to be located away from the elevator so she put me directly across from one. (All I can figure is that she was having a very bad day, but she made a horrible first impression for the hotel. She wasn't in the least bit pleasant.) The toiletries in the bathroom were good quality but It seemed that toilet paper was being rationed as I had to ask for an extra roll. I also didn't receive my copy of the Sunday Times on Sunday. Normally this kind of stuff would be overlooked by me, but it all started adding up to a not entirely pleasant stay. The bed comfort was acceptable but not the best. The hotel is within walking distance to Union Square, but keep in mind that it's uphill the whole way back if you walk. The prices in the hotel (from the mini-bar to room service to the restaurants) are all high, so it's worthwhile to check out the groceries and cafes nearby. Since I'm a President's Club member, the fitness center and internet were free of charge, so those were positives. The hotel is very ornate and interesting from a historical perspective and everything is well kept. From what I've heard, I'd ask for a room in the tower vs. in the main building where I stayed.

Booked the 'Centennial Package' by contacting the hotel directly. The rate was $359.50 per night but included a $100 food & beverage credit, a commemorative hard-cover book highlighting the property's 100-year history, a bottle of champagne & two commemorative toasting glasses. With tax, the 2 night stay was $815.31. The Hotel We stayed on the 19th floor of the recently constructed 'tower'. The view from the room was very nice. The room was not overly large although the bathroom was quite large and nicely appointed with a separate toilet area, separate tub & separate shower. The hotel is very clean with very comfortable beds, nice sheets & pillows. The Fairmont is a beautiful property with a classicly elegant lobby. Check in was extremely smooth. Check out was somewhat delayed as the clerk had trouble applying the $100 food & beverage credit from our package but eventually got it right. The roof top garden was nice (we enjoyed our champagne on the roof). The dining room was nice but pricey (breakfast was $51). Service was fine. We never made it to the Tonga Room but it looked like fun. Parking is pricey ($50 for 24 hours) so we decided to park around the corner for $27 per 24 hours - you're in a major metropolitan area so expect to pay for parking. Rates will be lower on weekends. The Concierge We were celebrating our 10-year anniversary and were looking for a restaurant with a view. We asked for a reservation at \"Top of the Mark\" right across the street at the Intercontinental but the concierge suggested Julius' Castle. The cab ride was an uneventful $5.80 from the hotel but on the way home, the restaurant mentioned cabs were a problem. They called us a Town Car and mentioned it would be $15. Upon arriving on the Fairmont, the driver insisted on $20 - quite a \"Mark-up\" over the original cab fare and the 'free' walk across to \"Top of the Mark\". Restaurant is average with a decent wine list. The outstanding dish was the Osso Bucco. The Steak au Poivre was fair (I've had better). Overall, happy we were assisted with a last-minute reservation on our anniversary and the restaurant served its purpose. The next night we inquired about a close-by restaurant for sushi and the concierge reluctantly suggested one within walking distance. The fare was fine and it met our needs. Location Great, great, great location. Walking distance to 3 trolley lines. Close to everything. Very nice area (I never realized how HILLY San Francisco is but it was fun). Value Great hotel but expect to pay big city prices... having come from NY, I wasn't blown away by the price - this is typically what you'll pay for a hotel of this caliber in a large US city. Insider Tips If you're exploring the city, buy the full day transit pass ($11 or so) but worth it. Its fun to ride the trolleys and buses around the city. We kept our car rental in the city despite the high parking fees. We were happy to be able to drive to Golden Gate Park, up to Twin Peaks, etc. Cabs are not cheap so we were glad we had the car to explore outside the reaches of the transit system.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also had the pleasure of being at the St Francis, Four Season and Ritz Carlton, The best service in town. The quintessential SF hotel is the Fairmont.

Rent a car at Hertz but drop it back off before they close to save about $50. Their desk is in the lobby. This is a full service hotel. Exercise facilty is good. I called the hotel directly after using the hotel's online reservations. We asked for our main building suite with patio.(I highly recommend the patioed suites as they are perfect for lounging and breakfast.) I even verified a few days before if we could get the same suite (Karachi) that I normally like. We arrive and unfortunately the exact suite we wanted was taken. The Hotel was sold out starting Friday and they upgraded us to the Buckingham Suite. This is a very nice suite that is gracious enough to entertain easily 20+. We only entertained a total of 7, easily handled and the room service was superb, on par with Ritz Carlton or 4S. The rooms in the tower are very nice with KILLER views in the higher rooms, but I like the charm of the main building suites. Some of the front corner suites are nice for a family, e.g. two baths and a side room is available. DO NOT stay here if you are pinching pennies. This is a Big Dog hotel with Big Boy prices.

Our room on the 21st floor in the new tower had generous proportions, and the bathroom was big with a separate (big) shower cubicle next to the bath. The room had an extremely comfortable super king sized bed, and the most comfortable pillows I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever rested my head on (lots of hotel pillows tend to be too thick, whereas the Fairmont\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were just right). We had what would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been a lovely view of the city and parts of the bay (but not of Alcatraz or the Golden Gate, which you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to pay a premium for), had the windows been clean. The view was still lovely, just not particularly clear. All the hotel staff (apart from some of the bar staff, who seemed a bit disrespectful and slow) we encountered were friendly and courteous, without being \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin-your-face\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. To me, the epitome of high class service is just that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c second to none, but discreet. The hotel is in a good, safe location on Nob Hill, which is close enough for a short walk to Union Square, but away from the worst hustle and bustle, and best of all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c away from the tramps. It is possible to walk to most sights from the hotel, although you need to be fit (or willing to put in the work and ensuing pain of walking up and down the hills of SF). I spent, on average, about 4-5 hours a day walking, concentrating on 2 sights a day. Granted, I wore the wrong kind of shoes the first couple of days, but my legs (already reasonably fit from cycling) were in serious pain for the whole of the week spent in SF. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been mentioned before, but is worth mentioning again, as many seem to have missed it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c join the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPresident\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 before you arrive! It costs nothing, but gives you free internet access for your laptop, free local calls, free use of the gym and many other benefits. Negatives and alternatives: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 It was hard to get a table for breakfast. This was not a big deal for us though, as there are plenty of diners down the road for cheaper breakfasts (yes, it involves walking down the very steep hill for a few blocks, and then all the way back up again, but you might need that anyway after the stodgy American breakfasts served). \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The service tended to be a bit slow in the bar. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The walls are a little bit on the thin side, although I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve experienced much worse in other places. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Not sure if this is common in hotels generally, but our floors were never cleaned (not that big a deal to us, but this is not a cheap hotel. I only noticed it in this one because I dropped some popcorn on the floor early on in our visit, and these were never removed, which then made me notice the rest of the dirt on the floors that remained throughout our stay. No biggie though.). It was also hard to enjoy the view, or see what the weather was really like, as the windows were very dirty on the outside. They also ought to clean the peephole in the door, as it was difficult to see who was there because the glass was so grimy. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The parking fee of almost $50/night is extortionate. There are cheaper options, however \u00e2\u20ac\u201c depending on how much time you plan to have your car parked. All parking lots in the area tend to be very expensive, but if you plan to use your car for half of the day, then a better option is to go to one of the parking lots nearby that charges per 12 hours rather than like the Fairmont\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, per 24 hours. If, like my husband, you sometimes have long days of meetings, and come back after 7 in the evening and leave by 9 in the morning, you can park for free on the street (you may need to circle the adjacent blocks for a while for this though). Overall, I loved this hotel, despite its foibles that, in some cases, can actually be seen as rather charming.

No coffee in room and no swimming pool. Not really a kid friendly hotel either, mostly business execs and older crowd. Overall good experience but not my kind of place to hang out with a child.

The meeting rooms are very ornate and seem perfect for a convention\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needs. It seems the meeting staff is very much on top of things\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere were several meetings being held during the course of our visit and from what I could observe, it seemed that the clients were in good hands. The room was fairly small, but comfortably furnished with nice linens and towels. The marble bathroom had a tub and separate shower making it accessible for my mother who would not have been able to negotiate a tub. For business travelers, room features included a spacious work desk, a multi-line telephone with voice-mail and High Speed Internet Access. There was a Web TV keyboard for those without a laptop. Valet parking is a bit expensive--$49 a night, but parking in SF is expensive in general, as is the case in any big city. The valet attendants were very friendly and professional. We rented a wheelchair for my mother and the Fairmont gave me a great recommendation. This company delivered and picked up the wheelchair, making it very convenient for us. It was $69 for the three days we were there. Across the street is the Mark Hopkins Hotel, which houses Top of the Mark, a great spot for a drink with excellent views of San Francisco. The hotel is in a spot where each of the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cable cars meet. North Beach and Chinatown are within a short walk, Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf and Union Square are a cable car ride away. The hotel lobby had a complimentary coffee cart set up each morning. In addition there was a coffee shop one level below the lobby where one could buy coffee and pastries.

We booked the room on a travel web site, as they offered the best price. I am usually reluctant to book at a travel web discount site, as usually these rooms are the worst in the house (my experience, I could be wrong).

Room Service: fast, nice presentation, and very good food. Tonga Room: We felt we had to experience this restaurant/happy hour. Sorry we did. Skip it. Not great, just a so so hotel bar. We do not regret going to the Tonga Room for happy hour, but our time could have been spent better. Location. The location is wonderful. The cable car lines, meet at the hotel, so it is easy to get around. The views from there are great. It is so easy to get anywhere. Union Square and Chinatown are just down the hill (walkable). Fisherman's Wharf is a short cable car ride away. The only downsides of the hotel are the Bellmen and no coffee maker in room. The Bellmen were non-existent. We arrived by cab (dressed nicely -- touristy --), and no one asked if we wanted help with our bags. We checked in the desk clerk rang the bellman to help us with our bags, and no one came. We would come in from \"touring\" and no one would open a door for us. We would leave for the morning, and no one asked if we wanted a cab hailed. We dress appropriately, we tip nicely.

Our room that we first got was HUGE, with an enormous walk in closet (a dressing room 100 years ago, no doubt). But it was on the 3rd floor at the front of the hotel, with a roof directly outside the window. Since we wanted to leave the window open, this was not secure.

I would strongly suggest that if you are going to spend the money for a nice hotel like this, then upgrade to the signature room. We got one for a great price compared to the listed price by calling the hotel directly. The view from the huge picture window of our 18th floor room was incredible - from the entire GG Bridge to the left, to Alcatraz straight ahead, to the bay and the Transamerica tower to our right, to the city below. The bathroom was beautiful tile, clean as a whistle, and the separate shower in particular was the best I've ever had in a hotel, instant hot water and great water pressure. The rest of the room was average but spotless. You can definitely hear traffic below, the windows aren't soundproof, it was minimal, but the view made it seem like the penthouse. We only ate in the hotel restaurant twice, both for the breakfast that came with our room and their buffet was outstanding. There were also apparently quite a few conferences taking place at the hotel during this time, but it never seemed crowded. The lobby is beautiful and comfortable with plenty of places to sit. The hotel staff that we dealt with were all very friendly, not one problem. The hotel's location was perfect, especially if you want to ride the cable cars a lot. Buy yourself a pass (which unfortunately for some reason they don't sell at the Fairmont considering its location). And a note to an earlier review: when getting off of the cable car behind the hotel, you don't need to walk up the big hill to enter through the hotel front door; simply enter through the parking garage in the rear, follow the walkway to the elevator, saves a lot of walking. Catch any of the 3 cable car routes right behind the hotel and it's easy to get to many places. Thers's also plenty to see just walking around Nob Hill - beautiful apartment buildings, a nice park, or walk the labyrinth at the cathedral a few streets over.

We were a bit early but were given our room immediately on the 8th floor. I asked for a higher floor and without hesitation was given a georgeous room on the 19th floor. Within minutes our luggage arrive. Not an easy feat since it was Labor Day weekend and the hotel was hopping!! It was our anniversary and when we came back from lunch there was a bottle of champagne as well as strawberry covered chocolates. Keep in mind that we booked directly from the hotel at the last minute and being a President's Club member our $203..00 dollar a night room (including breakfast) was just over the top. If you are a Presidents Club member...check out their last minute deals. I felt guilty for paying the amount that we paid. The service was excellent from the valet, to the check in process, the housekeeper (each day we left $10.00 for housekeeping and they left us alot of extras for our room.) We even had turndown service. The Laurel Court Restaurant was just okay...not horrible, but just okay for the prices that they charge. We had our first mornings breakfast in the restaurant and they had a buffet. They were so busy but the service was once again excellent. The next morning we had room service and it was once again just okay. They charge $3.50 per person extra, plus a 19% service plus something else which I can not remember at this moment. It was still worth it to us!! They don't tell you that they have complimentary coffee at the concierge until 8AM but that is nice to know if you are like me and need my coffee before I can get our of bed. The gym was fine nothing great but with all the walking that we did in San Francisco it suited it purpose.

The hotel is right on the cable car line, we however, did not use. We walked every where! Never imagined so many hills and the steepness of the hills! Whew! The lobby was extremely grand. My husband and I made use of it to relax many times during our stay. Our rooms were in the old part of the hotel. We had outside rooms which gave us a window with a view. We could see the Mark Hopkins front entrance from our window. Some of the inside rooms overlook rooftop airconditioners. The room itself was very large and had the feel of a bedroom suite. It was larger than our room at home! There was a HUGE dressing room(closet) and a well appointed bathroom. I am have a problem with cleanliness of hotel rooms, especially bathrooms, this was very clean. No mold or musty smell. The paint on some of the woodwork could have been scraped and repainted but the hotel is 100 years old! The staff was helpful and freindly but the concierge didn't know where there were local ,close sushi places. For this info we asked a front desk person and she steared us to a great place a few blocks away. Mama's was a hit for breakfast. Don't miss this one, but bring cash. No credit card or checks and expect to wait in line outside. Over all I would say the Fairmont is worth every penny. We called the hotel directly and got a summer special which turned out to be cheaper than many of the lower chained hotels in the area.

First of all, in the process of researching and booking this hotel, I discovered that the deals were found working directly with someone at the hotel, not the 1-800 number or the internet. We got to the hotel early; bellman was very helpful in storing our luggage while we took a 3 hour run/hike of the city. Upon returning to the hotel to collapse into our room, we were instantly switched to another room since ours was not ready. The receptionist was very polite and we noted her attention to our fatigued condition as she alerted housekeeping of their timing problem. Our upgraded room in the tower was perfectly situated with views of the city, Alcatraz and Golden Gate Bridge. Beautiful marble bathroom and comfortable bed completed the arrangements. We loved the bountiful buffet breakfast, especially since our schedule did not allow much time to have a relaxing lunch. Our hostess even located us in the dining room somehow one particular morning to take a phone call from home when our cells were not working. Also the waiter took time to give us some unsolicited advice on the wine country which he could tell we needed by our maps and puzzled faces. The concierges also bent over backwards to be accomodating, making reservations and putting up with our countless tourist questions. I also remember leaving a note for the housekeeper for an extra trash bag. She read my mind and left 2 appropriate laundry bags next to the trash bag just in case. When I asked our bellhop where the ice machine was, he responded by getting it for us. These are some of the the little things that surprising stand out in my mind more than one month later. Only 2 minor gliches: We could not get our internet access to work even after joining the Presidents Club and receiving the code. We did ask for help at the desk and did not get very far. We experienced an overage charge for a breakfast delivered in our room which I considered tacky since our bed and breakfast package credit was for $70 per day, and orders were very simple. However, after expressing this on a survey I received, the guest services manager called me to sincerely apologize for the inconvienences and expressed the intention to get the overage taken off our credit card.

The food was tremendous. Get the appetizer sampler plate. Really good! One issue is that if you stay for any length of time, buy a multiday cable car pass as it is a steep walk down the hill several blocks to the nearest shopping at Union Square, which we both do recommend. If you ride the cable car all the way down to Market Street it puts you right in front of the mall. The stores are huge and lots of selection. We ate ate at the Nob Hill Cafe, which was good for lunch and weekend brunch. The cab fare from the Airport is $40 which I recommend from a convenience standpoint, but if you know when you want to go back to the airport, arrange for the airporter through the concierge desk, it's only $15 per person and they make only one stop between the Fairmont and the Airport, at least when we rode it.

He was also able to get us a table for eight at Boulevard on short notice, which was amazing. The gym is also excellent, and the lobby bar is well-staffed and has a good selection of wines by the glass. I had only 2 complaints. First, the Fairmont charges for use of their gym and for high-speed internet. It turns out that you can get these for free if you fill out a little form and join the \"Fairmont Club,\" which costs nothing. However, no one tells you this--you have to figure it out for yourself. This is ridiculous. It is a fairly expensive hotel, and should simply provide these things for free. Second, the restaurant is ridiculously inefficient at breakfast, a major faux pas when serving business travelers with flights to catch.

The lobby and conference rooms were beautiful. Although the staff was not the best I've experienced they were more than polite, professional, and eager to help. I thought my room was very clean and quite frankly I've never seen hotel room carpet that clean! Nice bathrooms, with awesome water pressure, hot water, and robes to borrow. Beautiful view from window, and the window opened to allow fresh cool air in. I had a king size bed w/4 fluffy feather pillows. I thought the bed was very comfortable and slept quite well. The rooms were very quiet: no noise from the outside except for the occasional clang of the cable car(which I believe stops running around midnight) but really could barely hear it anyway, no noise from A/C, pipes, or other rooms. The only bad thing I can say about the hotel is any hallway conversations seem to carry and are extremely!!! audible, I could hear the housekeeping crew each morning and each night I could hear rude people having conversations in the hall and unfortunately it did wake me up. I don't know if it was the shape of the hallways, poorly insulated interior walls or thin room doors but it was loud, although once the talkers made it into their rooms I fell right back to sleep. I can't speak specifically about the restaurants at the hotel but all food was catered by the hotel for the conference and was quite good, especially horsdervs/buffets at evening receptions. Went to the Tonga Room one evening for drinks; good drinks although the atmosphere was a little cheesy and Disneyesque. I just think in this city and in this hotel a bar that is a little more chic and trendy would be better suited. It just didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the hotel. The hotel is literally at the top of Nob Hill with very steep walks back up the hill, but I'm young and healthy and didn't mind the walk. Cable car is convenient if unable to stand the walk.

One thing is clear--this is not a Ritz Cartlon or even a W. The Fairmont seeks to rely on the grandeur of the lobby and ignores service that is present at high end hotels. The old hotel has gone down hill. Examples: At check in we had to wait fifteen minutes to get a room while only two receptionists were working (the desk could accomodate at least four receptionists. No bath robes were placed in our room--we had to ask twice for them to bring them. The maid service failed to provide us new cocktail glasses and left the melted ice in the bucket for us to clean out four three days in a row. When I asked about the business center (to print boarding passes) the desk was rude and simply said it is not open on Sundays--no alternatives were offered. When I called for a turn down service (which is encouraged by a note on the bed left by the maid service) the desk acted annoyed and confused at the request. The hotel bar is the Tonga Room which is more like an adult Rainforest Cafe--gross. The cost to valet the car is $45 a night--the cost would not be so bad if it did not take 20 minutes each time I wanted the car. I could go on and on. If you want service or a four star environment--stay at the Ritz which is close by--a distinct difference between the two properties. Do not stay at the Fairmont unless you get a great deal--$160 or so.

A cable car stop is conveniently located adjacent to the hotel, for those who may not be up for the steep climbs leading to and from the Fairmont. Our 18th floor Tower room was very spacious (unusual for SF), stylishly (but simply) decorated, had luxurious bed linens and fluffy bathrobes, an elegant marble bath with separate shower and tub and was meticulously clean. But, the real story with this hotel is the incredible view. We enjoyed a panoramic view of the Bay from the Golden Gate Bridge across to the Bay Bridge. Alcatraz Island was in plain view. We nixed a trip up Coit Tower to view the city because there was no way it could be more amazing than what we had right in our own hotel room. We enjoyed the spectacular Independence Day Fireworks over the Bay right from our hotel room! It was an experience we won't soon forget and are actually considering making this an annual 4th of July trip.

We paid $279/night, which we thought was quite reasonable for a busy holiday weekend and for such an extraordinary view. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tonga Room Lounge is kitschy but fun. We enjoyed a mammoth (and strong!) cocktail for two while experiencing the Bar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s signature theme park-like thunderstorms (think the Venetian Hotel in Vegas or the Rainforest Cafe.) We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat any meals at the Fairmont, opting instead to try out some local restaurants. We heard from other guests however, that the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Laurel Court Restaurant was lovely and the food divine. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s common areas are decorated most elaborately with gilded gold, ornate furniture and gorgeous flower arrangements.

Our only gripe with the Fairmont San Francisco lies with its inconsistent customer service. While upon our arrival, the bellman and front desk staff were very gracious and courteous, we had an encounter with another employee that I can only describe as mildly offensive. Later in our stay, however, the service was very prompt when we requested champagne glasses (for use during the 4th of July Fireworks show!) We also were disappointed in the Concierge who appeared as though we were bothering him when we asked for restaurant recommendations. He then proceeded to direct us to restaurants that turned out to be closed (we specifically asked him if they would be open on a Sunday evening and he assured us they would). Luckily, San Francisco is home to so many fabulous restaurants that we easily found our way to a lovely meal. The disappointment we felt in some aspects of the service was quickly forgotten when we looked out our window to an amazing view of San Francisco. Regarding things to do while you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in San Francisco, we highly recommend the Museum of Modern Art, Alcatraz (of course), Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf, Ghirardelli Square and a trip down Lombard Street (or UP if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ambitious!)

It was like the floor hadn't been mopped in some time and previous people had missed the spot. Yuck! This really creeped me out! The large picture in our room had slime and marks on it. There were spots on the bathroom cabinets and sheets. The request for laundry service slips showed previous laundry requests with the person's name clearly legible.

The room was clean and well apponted although it alawys amazes me when hotel charges nearly 300 bucks a night and doesn't have a cofee maker in the room. Nonetheless, the Fairmont is elegant and compares well with world class hotels anywhere in the world. As someone else mentioned, the bars are quite excellent and especially the Tonga room where there is an interior rainfall, good music and lots of space to dance. We only found 2 negatives: first, was the cost of parking which was 50 bucks for overnight. The second was the concierge desk.

Yes, its saloons were opulent and really wonderful but there were many bad things, especially thinking of the incredible price you can pay for such kind of hotel. First, the service was incredibly awful and you would expect something wonderful in that level of hotel. We were completely astonished by the afternoon tea we had: the price was quite high but more importantly, we asked for one bottle of champagne (of course very high price) and the smell and the taste were really awful. We then asked the waiter to change the bottle and he could not even understand what we were saying and he had to call the manager to do that! (in every little osteria in Italy you would immediately get a new bottle without any comments!). The rooms were elegant but we really thought that the hotel did not deserve the price.

Very high ceilings, luxurious draperies and bedspread, excellent and efficient room service..... Diversity of restaurants on site. The lobby area is so beautiful that, even if you do not stay at the hotel, you should stop by just to see it. There are two areas in which the Fairmont does not fair quite so well: The hotel has a newer tower--with lovely but much more standard-type rooms--and therefore the Fairmont is a large hotel in which you feel like if you suddenly evaporated into thin air, nobody would notice. Second, the concierge desk is not particularly well-informed.....Better to use the internet or some guidebooks to help you figure out where to go and what to do with your time. I've been to SF many times.....The Argonaut is fun if you have kids, but for an ultimate, classy, luxe San Fran experience, stay at this Grand Dame. If you really want to live, stay in one of the suites in the old section of the hotel. I should add: if you are looking for an incredible view, you don't get it from the old wing of the hotel. But you can walk out the grand front entrance and you feel so fine....And you look to your right and there is the bay.", "Date": "May 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "redditch, england", "Title": "\u201cold school hotel\u201d", "Author": "abualison1157", "ReviewID": "UR3348526", "Content": "we had a great time at the fairmont, we decided to upgrade to the tower room over looking alcatraz and what a veiw it cost $60 per night extra. the bed was comfortable queen size triple sheeting, turn down service had to be requested by ringing house keeping.

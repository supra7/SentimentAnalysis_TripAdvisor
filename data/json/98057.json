On our way to visit family in Clarksville and Soffolk, VA we stopped here going and returning home. As I had already booked all of our stops before we left CA and had only chosen by motel brand, I was not prepared for what we got upon arrival. I was tired from driving from Albequerque NM and was ready to relax when to my horror we were greeted form a scene from motel hell. People hanging out drinking and loud music, what appeared to be open drug sales and only God knows what else. We felt very unsafe there and carried everything from uor car to our room to keep it safe. The area felt totally unsafe. Everywhere we looked there appeared to be thugs waiting for an opportunity... They had security but we still felt unsafe as he seemed to be too friendly with the residents there. We have stayed at several other Studio 6 and Motel 6 before in our travels and have always had a pleasent experience. It was only at this one did we ever have a problem. The desk clerk did tell us that she would place us on the \"good side of the property\" I am very grateful for this site where I can research lodgings before I go there. I would not stay here again even if the room were free and I was paid to stay here. No price is enough for our peace of mind!!!

I did not not notice any bugs or living creatures other than myself. I inspected the mattress. The mattress was worn; however, it appeared to free of insects. I chose not to complain because by the looks of the place, all of the rooms would have been in the same shape. At times it was noisy. The hotel staff was friendly. They have security guards during the evenings and nights. I've stayed in worse places that were cheaper (in Central America). The pool looked older, but well maintained. It is very close to the airport. The \"TV\" selection was not bad. I watched lots of HBO! This hotel is cheap and therefore perfect for the single guy or guys traveling together on a road trip.

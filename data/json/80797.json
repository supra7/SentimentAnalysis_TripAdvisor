What a great choice it turned out to be. Its basically 5min walk max to Moscone on the same road. So a big tick to start. If your attending there this place would have to be on your list. If your not attending a conference the location is still A grade, right in the thick of things in union square, the best part of it as well, everything you need be it food, entertainment or transport is right outside your door and given its so busy, its quite safe, some other places I have stayed seem to get a bit shady outside at night, because this is the thick of the action you feel a lot safer. I caught the train in from the airport , the station is about 1mins walk from the hotel, couldnt be easier. Pricing was very reasonable, they had a strange deal for weekly deals running (7 nights) which made it very cheap in comparison to other rooms and about 1/3 cheaper to book for 7 nights than 5. So we just booked the week and a couple of colleagues who only wanted to stay for 5 just left early. Once checked in which was a pretty easy process got up to the room, it was a good size, reasonably modern and well appointed, well worth the money. My room faced an interior courtyard of some sort which meant there was no noise from outside whatsoever there was also no view but would much rather have it that way. I was staying with some colleagues who were on level 3, I was on level 4, they commented that having to walk through the resturant area to get to there rooms especially when functions were on was a bit of a pain, and it was noisy in terms of slamming doors etc, I didnt have this problem in general, except for one night as there is a smaller conference type room mixed in with the normal rooms where a function was being held, sounds proofing was about 90% so it was ok . I would think about asking for a room not on level 3 if you have the chance. What little I made of the services, were helpful and prompt, they provided a car back to the airport and it worked out a lot cheaper than a taxi. The offer a few little touches such as the water in the lobby and free internet if you are kimpton member ( which i was not but you can sign up there and then) which make it a very pleasant place to stay. All and all I had never heard of the hotel or kimpton before this trip, and when back in a few months will definitely be seeing if I can get a room again .", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilson, Wyoming", "Title": "\u201cHotel Palomar has earned a fan!!\u201d", "Author": "Lambert4", "ReviewID": "UR127270919", "Content": "Before the recession, we stayed at The Ritz or Four Seasons...I like great hotels.

Hotel Palomar had a high ranking and good reviews ,so I booked it and I am so happy I did. My husband has me do all our travel arrangements and then praises me when thngs turn out well . What he didn't know until this last trip is that all the credit goes to Tripadvisor. I finally had to confess how i make the selections when he was raving about the location and the service of this hotel. First the location is right in the middle of Union Square shopping, and still close enough to walk to Nob hill or the warf. The turn around for the streetcars is a block away. Lots of restaurants and jazz clubs within walking distance. What really makes the hotel is the service. When we arrived we were a little stressed because of the traffic driving into Union square. As soon as I talked to the doorman and asked if we could leave our rental car out front for a moment we started to feel calmness. Everyone was just so warm and helpful. The staff at the front desk are all amazing and they think of ways to help you. The hotel offers a wine reception every night which is a nice touch, and there you see the same staff that works at the front desk, of course they remember you and chat and make you feel right at home. Our girl Lauren even suggested to meet with us after she was done serving at the wine reception to advise us on where to go for the evenings dinner and entertainment. Everyone seems to genuinely like their job. The rooms are very nice and clean , nice to be able to people watch from the window, although could hear some traffic noise.

The greatest bonus is its convenient location for visiting San Franciso. Its located atop an Old Navy Store which you can look into through its glass roofs from some rooms. Many attractions in downtown San Francisco are in walking distance, the metro and the tram have stops in front of the hotel. Our spacious room was clean and the bathroon was also spacious and modern. The bed was very big and comfortable to sleep in all of which led us to enjoy our stay. The staff at the reception was very freindly and helpful when we asked for the way upon arrival. The only negative aspect was the \"free breakfast\" which we were given vouchers for when we arrived. To make it short it was a great disappointment. It was served in a fabulously designed room (which is also used as a lounge/bar in the evening) which was crowded with the hungry breakfast crowd and then there was only one guy who was supposed to serve the breakfast. The only help he got was a young girl who seemdd overwhelmed with the situation. We had to wait very, very long for the simplest coffee which was for free. The Danish which followed was a joke as a breakfast serving. We had breakfast in town on the next morning. As Kimpton prides itself to be a designer hotel brand they should definitely rethink this breakfast concept. I think most travellers are willing to pay for a nice, good breakfast.

My previous experiences involved extremely friendly and helpful staff members. The friendly people I encountered at this particular Klimpton hotel were the doormen, the valet, and the maid. It would probably help the overall feel of the hotel if the personalities of the doormen could be transferred to the front desk personnel. It's not that the front desk persons I dealt with during my stay were mean; they were ambivalent and there to earn a paycheck (like dealing with the DMV). Upon arriving at the front desk to check in (around 9:00 PM), I quietly waited to see if the clerk would look up from her handheld screen. I probably should have been vocal, but I was not in a hurry and was a bit intrigued by her fixation on whatever message it held. When she looked up, I have absolutely no idea what she said, but I assumed it was some sort of greeting. All I really got from her monotone monologue was that the bar on the 5th floor opened at midnight and that I had to use the free drink coupons then. Luckily the key pouch had my room number on it. The room itself has the same amazing sheets and bed as my other Klimpton stays. This decor of the room is better described as a business hotel than as a boutique hotel. Everything was clean, but worn (especially the carpet). It's basically a Marriott caliber room with Motel 6 carpet and a heavenly bed. The leopard skin and zebra skin robes in the closet that felt like they were several years old sum up the ambiance of the room. It's in a great location in terms of being able to walk to anything (BART, Chinatown, North Beach, the Moscone Center, and so on). I think it's overpriced for what you get, and if you are looking to be in that area at a lower price, you can find a few places close by. As instructed by the front desk clerk, I waited until just before midnight for the bar to open only to get there at 11:58 and learn they were closing. The waitress couldn't have been happy by the timing of my arrival, but was professional and offered a compromise of getting an easy to pour drink. I appreciate that she was willing to stay a little past the end of her shift to accommodate the fallout of my not getting valid information from the front desk clerk. The bar and restaurant are very well appointed and stylish. I think a heads up that parking was going to cost $51.30 a night would have been nice. That's not a typo either, we're talking $51.30 to store a car for fourteen hours on a weekend. I definitely got the feel that this hotel was all about the money. Dropping $289 + tax for a room and $51 for parking should have gotten me much more in terms of style.

We were in a corner suite which was a bit oddly shaped with colours that were not warm or otherwise appealing. People have mentionned the noise of Market Street but while we were conscious of traffic particularly if an ambulance or police car went by with siren on, it was not at all obtrusive.

We were here to celebrate someone's birthday, and I meant to make it a wonderful experience to that special person. After reading thru lots of good reviews about this hotel on trip advisor, I decided to give it a try. Since this is a \"Four star, Luxury Boutique\" hotel, I had high expectations on it; unfortunately, it met none. Let me start with our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153series of unfortunate events\" - Arrived at 1.45pm, early for check-in time, but the front desk prompted us that our room is ready! I asked for upgrade but she said the hotel was fully committed. Regardless, we were happy and excited to check in early. As we arrived to our room, we found the room service lady was still in there, but we didn't mind. I then asked for her help turning on the AC, she did but not without struggling with it. Again, we did not mind. Then, as I walked the lady out & tried to close the door, we discovered that the door was stuck and wouldn't close. She said she would go for help. Ten minutes later, I called front desk for status and only then we had someone came. Eager to explore the city, we left our room while the gentleman was fixing the door. He assured us for the safety of our luggage and that the door would be fixed right away. -We got back to the hotel 5 hours later and found the door was fixed, but then we noticed that the water in our bath tub drained very very slow (at least 20 minutes for draining from a shower). Too tired from our long walk, we decided not to bother and went to bed. Our room is a deluxe double double which turns out to be quite small. It has 2 queen beds, 1 small table with only 2 chairs and so only 2 of us can seat while others had to stand. The beds are average but the pillows are very soft. I asked for a non-pet and quite room, and was given a non-pet and next to Market Street. We can hear lots of noise from the street: fire trucks, bus, ambulance....We could barely sleep during our entire stay. -The next morning, I went downstairs and reported the bathroom issue with the front desk. As soon as I got back to our room, someone showed up and got it fixed. We were offered a complementary movie for our not so good experience. While I appreciate the prompt response from the staff, I wished the room was fully checked before our arrival. -Next, while putting our stuff in the closet, I found 2 broken hangers, one of which I was able to fix. I left the other broken one on the ground, hoping someone would notice that and would replace it. When I got back to the hotel later that day, the broken hanger was still there, nicely hanging on the rack and was still broken. -Then we found a problem with the flush switch in out toilet. It stayed that way for the rest of our stay. In addition to the mentioned events, I have few positive and negative notes. I'll start with the negatives and then end on a positive one: -The hotel has no lobby and the lounge on fifth floor is tiny and dark (it has dim ceiling lights and no windows) -They play loud music early in the morning in the lounge, so loud that we could hear the music from our room on the same floor. In fact, the music woke me up one day. -The hotel advertises for a \"Business center\" where guests can use computer and internet without charge, but the room is closed during our entire 4 days stay. I was advised to use another computer near the lounge but there's a charge for everything I do on it. -When I booked, one of the listed amenities is Aveda bath products, but I found none during our stay there. There's shampoo, conditioner and lotion, but they are not Aveda. I felt I was cheated. -Bathroom has just a slide door and there's no fan. After the shower, we would have to wait for a while for the mist on the mirror to clear out. -The bathroom is right next to the bed and so all of us pretty much had to sleep or wake up at the same time. -As other reviewers noted, the wine reception only lasts from 5-6pm. While it is nice, we could never make it back to the hotel during this hour. -The fridge is tiny, but we managed. On a positive Note -Location: few minutes walk from BART station, cable car, F-line trains, Westfield mall, Union Square...About 15-20 minute walk to ChinaTown, North beach. I took the F-line to FishermanWharf -My son had a gold fish for his pet and there is a beautiful chocolate lab that greets us when we check in. -The staff is super nice and friendly. They are the only reasons for my positive feelings about this hotel. -The hotel is overall clean. Although the hotel doesn't have a lobby, they offer water flavored with various fruits near the check-in desk -Kimpton In Touch member can get free wifi and $10 mini bar treats. All in all....I think I would prefer to stay at the nearby Marriott next time.

But this time there were some issues that other travelers might want to know about. First, avoid the 9th floor rooms if you are a light sleeper. There is a constant drone from the duct work or some such thing. After a poor night's sleep, we asked the front desk if anything could be done. He said he would send an engineer right away to rectify the problem. Well, the problem was clearly unrectifiable -- but the desk clerk didn't seem to know that. So after more discussion, we eventually were moved to the 7th floor and no more drone. Which brings up a second issue. The staff are very young and very inexperienced. Maybe the summer interns? I am sure they mean well and are very friendly and welcoming. But they don't seem to know much about their own hotel and its services -- much less the city of San Francisco. After asking direction from one of the front desk people, I realized I knew more about how to get where we were going than he did. Nobody mentioned that there was coffee available on the 5th floor -- learned that from reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. When we checked out, the clerk stuffed our receipt into an envelope without ever asking me to review. When I did pull it out at the airport, I found she had overcharged my credit card and left us with a credit balance. Why? Totally inexplicable. It necessitated a phone call to the hotel to get it straightened out. So, yes, this is a lovely hotel in a very convenient location. Just avoid the 9th floor, be sure to check your receipt before leaving the hotel and don't expect much help from the front desk staff -- you'll do just fine.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bedford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgreat place for seeing San Fran\u201d", "Author": "Mav1244", "ReviewID": "UR117170418", "Content": "it was not our first choice of hotel in SF but we are so glad we stayed here.

Everything about this hotel was fabulous! We upgraded to a suite for very little extra and it was huge, clean and luxurious. It completely made the trip feel like a getaway. Bed was super comfortable. We loved being on the 5th floor steps away from the nightly wine reception. The goldfish bowl was such a nice touch. It served as a nightlight for the kids and they even named him Goldie. The location could not have been better. Steps away from BART, Cable Car stop, bustop, Westfield Mall, Walgreens, restaurants, great stores for shopping. But since it was off a side street, we were far enough away from the chaos of the main Market Street area. The free coffee in AM, fruity water all day, yummy iced tea 2-4, then wine reception at night were such a nice bonus. This saved us so much money in buying coffee, water and drinks for the 4 of us. It was nice to be able to sign up for the Kimpton In Touch club. This gave us free wireless internet which we used daily and a mini bar credit which also came in handy. The service at Hotel Palomar could not have been better. We were there on our 12th anniversary trip w/our kids and we had actually come to San Francisco 12 years ago for our honeymoon. They treated us to Proseco (not sure how they knew this was my favorite!) & chocolate in our suite, then snacks and movies for the boys. Rachel at the front desk went above and beyond to be helpful and make us feel special here. She greeted us by name and got to know our boys. I must say though that I noticed many other guests being called by name which is a nice touch. The entire front desk staff was so nice, friendly and helpful. It's hard to say what I liked best since I liked so much about Hotel Palomar. But something I have not already mentioned is I liked not having to wait - for anything. Elevators were fast, was always someone at front desk ready to help us in seconds, asked for things from housekeeping and it came immediately. Bell service came immediately. This is very different from what we would have experienced at a larger chain type hotel. I think the kids favorite thing was the house dog Maverick. What a treat to have him hang out at the front desk and visit with him everyday. The only negative we experienced was in the hotel restaurant for breakfast. We decided to try it and take advantage of the Kids Eat Free promotion. It ended up being understaffed that day and the service was both slow and bad. After expressing concern we were treated much nicer but the main issue still came down to not enough people working and one person trying to do it all.

We were staying in SF for just a day and a night to have a mother/daughter night. The hotel inquired about the purpose of our stay. When they found out we were trying to spend some time together, they went out of their way to provide us with wonderful amenities. Not only did they upgrade our room, but they left us a personal note welcoming us and assuring us that they would provide anything we needed. When we got to the hotel, they immediately assisted with both our baggage and the car. We were checked in quickly- greeted by names and welcomed by wonderful staff and a beautiful dog. We immediately felt as though we were being pampered, nurtured and cared for- in a lovely hotel- by people who cared. Everyone seemed to know our name and everyone wanted to make sure that we were enjoying ourselves, that the room was set up to our liking and that we were able to get to the places we wanted to go. The suite that they put us in was wonderful. Not only did it look great - but it was pristinely clean, bright and cheery. The bathroom was impeccably clean and the products they provided were spa quality. Because I joined their 'in touch program', they knew I liked extra towels and a particular type of pillow. All of those items were waiting for us. Shopping was first on our agenda and we were a half block away from some of San Francisco's best shopping. When we returned, we had a tray of fresh fruit and cheese and bread waiting for us. Additionally, the hotel offers a hosted wine hour. We went down to the bar and were immediately offered a choice of lovely wines. Of course, it started pouring that evening. The hotel had umbrellas if we needed them and immediately hastened to assist us in getting a cab. They had recommendations for great dining and when we came in from our meal, made sure that that was satisfactory as well. Later, my daughter wanted desert from room service. The room service was delivered quickly and efficiently and she thought it was delicious. I had a bit of work to do and I was able to get on the internet quickly as well. The internet is offered free for guests- a very nice perk. We hated to leave the next day as we felt we were saying goodbye to friends. Checkout was as easy and efficient as check in. I look forward to my next stay in San Francisco. I will always be on the lookout for Hotel Palomar in general and will definitely return to the hotel in SF- despite the fact that there are hundreds of other choices. I think the hotel is wonderful choice for everyone- be it someone on a business trip- the location is perfect or someone on a leisure trip- as it's central location- near SF's esteemed cable cars and shopping is right at your fingertips.

The decor was contemporary without being trendy, and the suite was cleaner than any hotel room than I've previously stayed in. My room overlooked a beautiful rooftop garden. The free morning coffee bar is a nice touch for anyone who quickly needs to catch transportation. The best part about the hotel is the friendliness of the staff and their willingness to help me. For instance, I had packages that were postmarked that I didn't have time to take to the P.O., and the front desk handled the mailing for me. I've never left any feedback of this sort, but the combination of the Palomar's beautiful rooms, cleanliness, great staff and location lead me to say it is THE BEST choice in S.F.!

I stayed in a sister property in December (see my review of Hotel Palomar, Washington, DC) and fell in love with the service and attention to a guest's needs. If I have learned anything from staying at this hotel, it is their attention to meeting your every need, but the key is that they are not mind-readers and you need to speak up if any single thing is not to your liking. Don't like a meal? They will make it right or comp you. Unhappy with amenities? They will fix things. Really, Palomar goes out of the way to make sure your stay is perfect and that you receive attention from individuals who are decision-makers. It really is like Sax 5th Avenue, not Macys. Arrival: Instantaneous check in with the room available I had requested: Zen garden for quiet. Flavored waters to quench your thirst. Room: Beautifully appointed, spacious. Massive king bed with the feather pillows I had requested. Complimentary Internet with quick log-in because I am an InTouch member. (Join: it's free and there are little perks for members.) Choice of 3 newspapers every day and I could have all three. I had requested a complimentary goldfish \"friend\" in his own tank, which I had also requested in DC when my children were with me. Food: I did not try room service on this occasion, but did dine at 5th Floor for dinner. Nothing short of spectacular, truly. My server really knew wines and did perfect pairings with my choices. The layers of flavors in the fresh asparagus salad and then in the ravioli were complex and sublime. That said, I strongly suggest the hotel upgrade breakfast service. Very costly for offerings that were mediocre. Overall: On weekdays, there is a wine hour with complimentary white or red. Nice touch, but DC hotel did offer champagne, too. Should have asked! Hotel is pet-friendly but I emphasize that the place has no \"doggy\" smell nor have I even seen many in 2 stays at 2 different properties. (1 friendly lap pooch on this trip was it. I understand there may be a floor reserved for people with pets, but not certain.) Because I was attending a conference, I think my rate was better than most, but I recommend you watch for their specials or call them directly to see if you can get a better price.

Unfortunately, I did not notice the meeting room until after I had all my stuff unpacked. Over the course of my stay the noise coming from the various meetings taking place was bothersome.

I was in room 507 which was quite near the bar and restaurant but again, noise levels were fine, particularly as those services were not open late. The room had 2 double beds and was very spacious with 2 huge windows overlooking 4th street with plenty of light. Beds were extremely comfy and the temp in the room was just right. I joined Kimpton and had free internet and a $10 mini bar voucher. Little touches make the place perfect including the wine hour and coffee and tea in the morning, and the decor which is very stylish. Sadly i didn't meet Maverick the doggie as he had been naughty. The staff were excellent. I come to SF quite often and would love to stay in the Palomar again.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "United States", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and excellent service\u201d", "Author": "myahunters", "ReviewID": "UR86634570", "Content": "This hotel is in a great location - between two BART stops - and has excellent service.

I spent 5 nights in San Fran for a conference at the Moscone Center, and other events at a nearby chain hotel that is the largest in San Francisco. While the latter is good (I've stayed there in the past,) the Palomar provided a better experience and value all around at a somewhat lower price. It is a short walk to the Moscone Center, and is centrally located to other short-walk attractions like Union Square and the Chinatown gate. It is very near a stop for the tram/streetcar and other mass transit options (and frankly, across the street from that major chain hotel where all the taxis seem to line up.) The San Fran Museum of Modern Art is a short walk. The Ferry Building is at the end of Market Street, either by tram or a good walk if you are in the mood. The spacious 2-bed room #720 was great for our purposes (I invited my sister during the stay.) The decor was sleek-modern but warm and comfortable. While overlooking busy Market Street and up towards Union Square, this room was very quiet except for the occaisional ambulance or fire truck -- and even those noises were subdued; we could have slept through it. Looking out over the life of a city is something we enjoy as long as it is quiet enough. This hotel does sound-proofing very well, even when it seemed like it was pretty full. Still, there was a nice-enough courtyard if you want more buffer with an inner-facing room. The beds were soooo comfortable, with a selection of pillows and bolsters for sleeping, reading, etc. There are perfect-weight, not-too-warm duvets and top sheets with quality linens. A/C worked quietly and perfectly. Good-size closet and drawer space. All of the usual-or-better amenities in a good business class hotel are there -- iron & board, mini bar that had room to store a few things besides the stocked items, safe (roomy but not large enough for my laptop,) good laundry service, high-quality towels, Aveda toiletries, large desk/work surface, good flat-screen TV and options, etc. There are a few extra-nice things: wonderful robes, an umbrella if it rains, complimentary quality newspapers like the New York Times and Wall Street Journal as well as the local SF paper, etc. Complimentary internet access (although you may have to register as a member of \"the club\" -- free -- I forget.) My incredibly minor, nit-picky gripe: the clock radio does not have a light-up dial, so it was hard to tell the time if you woke up at night. There was no in-room coffee maker, but excellent coffee/tea is served in the lounge 6 - 9 a.m. FREE wine is served 5-6 in the same area, but you could take it up to your room. It was nice to have this there when dressing for dinner or you just want to put your feet up, although the lounge is sociable, modern-sleek and comfortable. 'No stingy attitude by the wine server, either. Chilled waters in urns in the lobby provide refreshment throughout the day/evening. Spotless, friendly housekeeping. Exellent, helpful staff throughout, but Matt at the door deserves special attention for his helpfulness and advice. I had a wake-up call every morning that arrived right on time -- with a REAL PERSON at the other end!!! MUST MENTION the excellent restaurant, Fifth Floor. We dined well at many restaurants in San Fran, but this was a highlight of an American menu with French preparations. Small plates and mains provide a lot of variety and while note cheap, well-priced for this level of quality and menu. While not a large menu, the variety is good and there is lots to like. There were a few complimentary amuse-gouts surpises, too. Nice cheese selection of note. I understand that there may be a new chef in November, but we'd be happy with the one currently on duty. The waitstaff and hostess were friendly, polished professionals. I'd go back in a minute, even if I wasn't staying at this hotel. Also: the bar area is very comfortable with the bar and tables, and you can get dinner there, too, if you'd prefer not to be at a table in the restaurant. I've done this before when I was on my own and the restaurant was booked (which is how I learned about this hotel.) There is also a chocolate labrador dog at reception every day, 8-5, which reinforces the hotel's support of animal rescue and care. No business center to speak of, but the service at the desk makes up for it, e.g. will print boarding passes complimentary, ship things, etc. How much do I love this hotel? IT belongs to the Kimpton hotel group. I will now check the Kimpton directory when I travel to other cities, and hope that it meets the standards set by the Palomar.

From my several trips to and from the US and to San Francisco, my return this year to this hotel would have been a homecoming... NOT! What used to be the Hotel Palomar noted for being a boutique luxury hotel was terribly terribly all wrong. Perhaps it had something to do with a travel agent in the Philippines using another travel agent in the US, booking this hotel for me. I was charged $380 per night for a King Deluxe and breakfast was $35 per head. I eventually found out that continental breakfast was only $14.50 and that if I had booked through the internet, it would have just been $1 breakfast for two. For the last 5 years I had never booked my trips through the travel agency but corporate policies which are still living in the dinosaur ages dictate that we need to go through a travel agent for auditing purposes. Nevertheless, let me say that the King Deluxe was a letdown. There was no water available in the room (you had to buy it at the nearest Walgreens) and the place looked very desolate. The ambience overlooking the awkward looking Zen garden looked sad and pathetic. There was no view. While the room was kept clean by the cleaning lady, there needs to be a makeover and the carpets need to get changed as it smelled musky and moldy. The bathroom was small and the shower curtains (who still uses shower curtains?!?!) were smelly. This was another place in the room that needed a major makeover. Finally was the food. For $14.50 for a continental breakfast, one could get a more decent meal in the next door Westfield Mall for the same price! Talk about having a muffin, some fruits, a croissant, a cup of coffee or fruit juice for this price? There wasn't even yoghurt to go. Geez!! The fitness center was really tiny and you probably are better off jogging in your room than in the tiny place they called Fitness Center. Of course, coming from Sofitel Los Angeles last July and comparing what Sofitel offered and the price I paid for Hotel Palomar was a no brainer. I expect to get what I paid for and if this is what this hotel offers at this price, this must be really the signs of the times in the US...that they are in recession and will stay this way for a decade more with no more cash to upgrade their hotels and provide people with rooms worth their money.

It's not a true luxury hotel, so don't go there expecting something extraordinary; if you're content with a basic, comfortable room, you can find many at a lower rate. But at the Palomar, my room was definitely larger than average. Although I don't spend a lot of time in my hotel rooms, over a period of several days a small room can feel cramped. The bed was fine, the decor was understated and classy. Everything was clean. Flat screen TV with DVD player, mp3-player clock radio, mini bar, bathrobes and umbrella in the closet along with an iron, selection of good newspapers. The bathroom was average--nothing remarkable, but no problems with the shower or anything else (not always the case in my experience; sometimes showers are cramped, or the shower head is too low, or the water turns hot and cold by itself). I was on the seventh floor, and although the windows were covered by plate plexiglass, which dampened exterior noise from the busy street below, I could hear an occasional honk or dumpster routine in the middle of the night. But it was relatively quiet; I've been to many hotels in the area at which dumpsters being emptied in the middle of the night have made sleep impossible; not so here. It has a free wine hour in the evening. The location--around the corner from Market Street--is a matter of personal preference. It's a short walk to Union Square, but there are many hotels a few blocks closer. I always use the BART, so I liked having the station a minute from the hotel, instead of ten minutes. I was particularly impressed by the service. Each and every one of the people I dealt with at the front desk was extremely helpful as well as friendly. I got a good recommendation for a breakfast place nearby, and the staff person called to make sure it was serving before I walked over. I had a problem with my check at the hotel bar (under separate management) and the hotel took care of it without any hassle at all. I The doorman always wished me a nice day and asked if I wanted transportation, but he was never pushy. The room was cleaned unobtrusively. These are all things we should expect, but just don't always happen, so when everything works, I think it's worth mentioning. A few details: The hotel is pet friendly.

I had booked 3 nights for my business trip, tried to extend another 2 nights but they couldn't give me the same rate. I had to book the extra 2 nights elsewhere to get a good rate. Upon check in I gave the secret word and was told that they were full so the word could not get me upgraded. They offered nothing in exchange for that. I said that since I have another reservation could they try for that second part of my trip? Yes, it was available then. So, 3 days we stayed in the regular King room (835), which was nice. A little small, but the hotel is boutique-ish so it's expected. Due to being a member, we also got a coupon to \"raid the minibar\" for $10. We tried to eat dinner at Fifth Floor (restaurant) but it was way too crowded and noisy (swanky party, I guess). I loved the coffee/tea in the morning and the wine tasting from 5-6. Nice perk. The fitness room is a joke. There is one treadmill, one elliptical, one bike, and a stretching unit. People were getting frustrated waiting for equipment each day. That really should be made into a larger area with more equipment. Then we checked out of the courtyard view King (courtyard overlooks the inside of Old Navy LOL), and into our upgrade #826. It was about 2 ft larger and had a chair. LOL It overlooked Market St. but wasn't much noisier than the courtyard room.

I paid $225 avg. per night for a king deluxe room. I'm not sure what made it \"deluxe\"... The room was small, the bathroom was small and it opened up practically right onto the bed. ROOM: small, noisy air system, fewer amenities (chairs, etc.) than I am used to (I'ved stayed with Kimpton in Boston and Chicago previously) and for some odd reason my room vibrated (I thought it was an earthquake when we first got there). BATHROOM: The toilet ran--we had to keep jiggling the handle to stop it. The shower drained extremely slowly so I had water up to my ankles by the time my shower was done (gross). It was so small it had a pocket door (a regular door would hit the toilet, or on the other side, the bed)--which was particularly disturbing since it doesn't seal very well and the door is literally 2 feet from the bed (no bathroom privacy!) MORNING/AFTERNOON FREEBIES: If freebies are your thing, you'll be happy that you might get some. But the morning coffee was not staffed and there was not hot coffee for me two out of three days (other supplies were also out). STAFF: When you have their attention they are extremely friendly and kind, but in the end I found they were just yes-ing me and truly provided no real value. 1-I asked for something to be sent to my room and I was told it was on its way. It never came and I never heard from them again about it. 2-after complaining about our room, they said they could switch us to one with more space. We packed up ourselves and 3-yr old and went to the new room--with a bigger bathroom, but LESS space in the living area, even fewer chairs and one half window that was up so high I couldn't see out of it! Clearly they were just trying to move me along and didn't think about what I was saying when they switched us... I called the front desk and asked for the original room back and was told no problem, that the key would still work. But after lugging everyone and everything back it did not and we had to run for new keys... 3-Upon check out I was given our final bill charged to my credit card and it was wrong. The woman stared at me dumbfounded when I explained it was significantly higher than it should have been. I searched through my phone to find the proof of the rate I should have received and finally was issued a refund of $231 (if I paid $231 more for this room I would have checked out after the first night).

The mattress pad was strapped on but it was much too small for the king size bad. Honestly, it was also paper thin. As brought up by one of the reviews, I had expected more. If not a pillow top (which is what I would expect given this is considered a luxury boutique hotel), at least a pad that covers up the mattress. Even more disconcerting was that when house keeping (very cordial and helpful - bless their hearts) came to help remedy the situation, they could not locate a pad that would fit a king size bed. What made it all ok was that the two house keeping staff were very accommodating with my request to pad the mattress with several sheets, which by the way helped to create a nice comfortable padding.

We drove our car in. Overnight parking is $45+tax. The valet was repeatedly absent when we drove up to the hotel; we waited minutes for him to arrive. Checking out of the hotel, we called down to the valet, but when we showed up at the garage, I had to ask for the keys and load my bags. The valet wasn't busy, just ignoring me. The previous night, when we were leaving the hotel for dinner looking to get a cab, the doorman sat on the sofa inside the lobby watching us stand in the rain, trying to hail a cab. Honestly, this is the worst service I've ever had from a \"luxury\" hotel. We were in SF for a 4 day getaway weekend, and the lousiness of this hotel was a downer.

I travel to Berkeley from Los Angeles frequently on business and usually stay in the Monaco, Prescott or Triton--all Kimpton hotels--in SF. This time I joined my husband, who had been on business, for the weekend. I had once stayed in the Palomar in L.A., which is an outstanding hotel, and I had a special promotional deal, so I decided to book the Palomar. I met my husband on Friday evening at the hotel. We went out to dinner nearby and thought we would go to the bar to talk for about an hour at around 10:15. We were told that the manager had decided to close the bar early because the restaurant did not have much business, so it was the last call, but there was a mini bar in our room. That was not the point. Rather surprising for a supposedly full service hotel. This would never happen at the other Kimpton hotels I've stayed in. The room was certainly comfortable and adequate, though the bathroom was small. There was no \"do not disturb\" sign for the door. At 8:30AM the next morning the minibar person came knocking and woke us up. We asked for a sign to be put in our room when we left the hotel later on. When got back the sign was put on the door so housekeeping had not made it up by 6PM! It really was odd that the person did not have the common sense to realize that putting the sign on the door would produce this result. It took two hours to get housekeeping to come, by which time we left for dinner.( Earlier that day I asked the front desk make us a dinner reservation at nearby Fringale. They said they would. An hour later I came down to find they forgot, but they eventually made it.) A complimentary half bottle of wine was left as an apology for all this, which was nice and was appreciated as a gesture, but the poor service started again the next morning--Sunday. Housekeeping came by at 8AM on Monday and started banging doors and talking loudly, so we could not sleep. I then discovered that housekeeping had not left a shower cap or soap the previous day. When we checked out, the front desk gave us someone else's bill, misspelled my husband's name and had charged us for parking. (We had no car.)It took three tries before an accurate bill was produced. What was really appalling was the lack of professionalism on the part of the staff. They were without apology and sort of shrugged their shoulders indifferently. Many seem as if they are young kids with little training. The hotel's location is great, but I would not stay here again. If you want excellent and courteous service, try in this order for a Kimpton in SF: Monaco, Prescott, Triton, and the Monaco has a lovely restaurant and nice bar. Both of them will be open if you arrive late. In short, who needs to be treated badly and woken up early when you are trying to have a relaxing, romantic weekend away!", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cVery happy honeymooners\u201d", "Author": "Virginifer", "ReviewID": "UR55131108", "Content": "We were on the tail end of our honeymoon and booked into the Palomar.

I've stayed at the Palomar numerous times over the years and I was pleasantly surprised that they remembered (I figured that I was just another digit in their database). And the way they remembered: The last stay, I was greeted with a complimentary plate of chocolate-dipped strawberries and a \"Welcome Back!\" card which was a pleasant surprise. As was the one before that where I got a \"munchies basket.\" Very nice touch and makes me want to return, as I have over the years despite my occasional \"deviations\" to try other hotels to serve as comparisons. In all my stays over the years (usually for 9 to 10 days at a time), I've found the door staff extremely helpful, even once accommodating me on storing my luggage with them even after I had already checked out, attended another weeklong conference in Palo Alto and then returned to San Francisco to drop off the rental car but had a long layover until my flight left San Francisco that evening. The front desk staff has always been perfectly obliging and the one time I needed a cot for my room for a temporary guest, it was delivered as ordered, on time and without surcharge. They've also always granted my request to be assigned a non-smoking (I'm very particular about that) room far from the elevators, the ice machine and any vending machines, preferably at the end of the corridor so I don't have to deal with drunk, late-night revelers who like to have conversations at the top of their lungs at 3am in the morning. The free in-room WiFi access has always been up to snuff (I'm a data network engineer/designer) and I have no complaints. The location only two blocks away from the Moscone Center complex is invaluable when one needs to drop off a heavy load of computers before heading out to dinner with colleagues and is close enough even for the quick freshening up before dinner or even a quick nap! I only have two major quibbles. Firstly, that they don't always publish their special rates far enough ahead of time even on their own reservations portal (I'm a Kimpton In-Touch member and I sometimes book two months or more ahead of a stay) and really hate leaving things to the last minute so I end up booking with other hotels because the Palomar's regular rate is astronomical and I always look for their special rates (usually a difference between $400-500/night versus $140-190/night). Secondly, the Fifth Floor restaurant is high end but it also has portions at \"high-end sizes\" (i.e., you need to either be a stick-thin supermodel that eats like a bird or you have to order two complete meals just to not starve to death). The two times I've dined there, I've almost had to whip out a magnifying glass to see the portions. The following are not quibbles but just statements of fact. Sometimes, the rooms I've been assigned have been about the size of a postage stamp but I don't care because I spend 99% of my waking time outside of it anyway and so long as it's quiet (it always is) when I need to sleep or do some work, I'm fine with it. Other times, I've had rooms big enough to accommodate another full-sized bed in there. Without exception, the furniture has always been functional and perfectly comfortable and I love their soaps (unlike at other hotels in the SF area, their's doesn't leave a sticky film on my body after using them). Colors of the rooms and corridors are generally muted but that's also what I want because I want tranquil colors when I'm about to rest, not something jarring and dazzling to wake me up--for that I can always drink coffee! Room staff has always been adequate possibly because I am sufficiently multilingual to speak to many of them in their own language. Being a polyglot helps when you would like that extra touch. I've never ordered room service because I tend to dine out and not want to be limited by the menu offerings.", "Date": "January 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "saved4use", "ReviewID": "UR54069775", "Content": "Found this hotel through Priceline and I had low expectations for it being a boutique hotel.

It turns out that this hotel is part of a chain - Kimpton hotels - and I will seek them out in the future. Here are the details. Strong location for a Moscone meeting - you can be in the exhibit hall in literally 5 minutes. It is a short, nice walk to Union Square and there are hundreds of great restaurants nearby.

The desk chair was really comfortable. Flat screen TV, plenty of channels. Useless alarm clock - time was wrong and could not figure out how to set it. A colleague in a different room and I had a good laugh about the animal print bathrobes. There is a free \"wine reception\" every day at 5.

The bathroom was small (combined tub and shower) but very nice and clean, with little conveniences like a lighted makeup mirror. We also appreciated the morning coffee and tea on the 5th floor, which helped us wake up and get ready for the day before we hit that San Francisco wind (brrr). The location is perfect, because you are in the middle of Union Square (great for shopping, dining, etc.) and convenient to public transportation.

I booked through Travelzoo, so I don't know if that had anything to do with the lack of service I received. There are many amazing pluses about this hotel. It has a great location, the rooms are beautiful, and they have ice cream in the afternoon, and a happy hour. Now for the negatives. We arrived at around 3:00 p.m. and promptly checked in. We had been up since 4 a.m. and were dying to take a nap in the luxurious linens. There happened to be a band playing right outside the window (which is not the hotel's fault) and it was so loud that we could not sleep. Hoping that the front desk had ear plugs, I called down and was met with a lukewarm response. \"Uh, I don't know if we have any, but if we do I will send some up\". So I got up and got dressed and waited for the ear plugs. Thirty minutes later, no ear plugs, and the band was still pounding. I called down again to the desk. \"They are bringing them up right now\". So I stayed dressed for another 30 minutes. No ear plugs. So I finally gave up. I wouldn't mind if they didn't have earplugs, but then they shouldn't repeatedly say that they do and then not send them to the room. My other issue is with the bath. I purposely booked a luxury king with the Fugi soaking tub, because I love to take baths while on vacation. According to their web site: \"four feet deep Fuji Spa tub with a Tub Menu for a personalized bathing experience.\" I thought, \"this is the ultimate tub experience!\". So again I called down to the front desk and mentioned that on their website says that with the luxury king there is a tub menu, and asked what does that include? The young man at the front desk said, \"Uh, look in the orange booklet, it tells you how to use the tub\". I say, \"well, your website mentions a \"tub menu\" with bath products.\" Young man: \"well we might have bath salts here at the front desk, I will send some up.\" I think great, I will have a bath before I leave.\" So guess what they send up? A bar of soap, which I already have in the bathroom. So would I recommend this hotel?

The bathroom was tiny and while it had a newer sink, toilet, and floor tile, it still had the original tub and dingy ceramic tub surround. Worse yet, it lacked an exhaust fan so even the briefest shower turned the bathroom into a sauna. Be prepared to wait if you want to use the exercise equipment.

The reception staff were so friendly and very efficient that straight away our tiredness from travelling slipped away and we soon felt suitably refreshed to go straight out and start exploring San Francisco. The room was very spacious and met/exceeded expectations regarding decor and fitments and the bed was huge and probably the most comfortable that we have slept in.

The design, style and cleanliness of hotel bathrooms are so often a good indication of the general standard of the rest of a given hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we could not fault our bathroom in any way. Free WiFi was much appreciated. The hotel is within 100m of the Powell Street BART station, so, ideal for transport from/to the airport. It is also right next to stops on Market Street for the street cars and almost opposite a cable car stop (across Market Street) which were both great for travelling around the city. We were put off other hotels by reviews that we read which mentioned that they were in or near less desirable areas of the city which raised concerns about safety but we had no problems at all at the Palomar in this respect. The daily wine tasting in the reception area was a nice idea but we were a little disappointed that the person manning the desk, although very pleasant, was not at all knowledgeable about the wine that they were serving other than reading the label on the bottle whether it was a Merlot, Shiraz, Chardonnay etc. Considering California is a major world wine producer it would be have been good to have been told a little more detail about the wines being offered. At all other times when we needed information or assistance we found the reception staff to be extremely knowledgeable and so willing to help make our stay in San Francisco such a pleasant experience. If we had any suggestions for improvement it would be that there could have been tea/coffee making facilities in the room. We booked our stay at the Palomar on Hotels.com and got a very good rate.

Our room was on a lower floor, near the elevators, and did not have much of a view. We would've preferred a better room but I'm sure the low rate we paid had an impact on our placement.

The hotel parks the car in their indoor parking lot located downstairs of the hotel, which is great because we didn't have to worry about the car being in an outdoor lot. Oh, and did I mention the complimentary wine hour!?!! The hotel hosts a complimentary wine hour where they introduce a red wine and white wine for their guests to try!

Last year I booked a room at the Palomar in San Francisco and have since made it my preferred hotel in that city. The SF Palomar is NOT glamorous. It may have been when it first opened but it is now definitely showing its age. The decor is firmly rooted in a mid-1990's aesthetic. Nonetheless, it is well maintained and I still find the lobby (except for the battered sofa) and elevator vestibules to be quite attractive. The rooms could use an update. They are very comfortable but definitely bland. The cream-colored walls really wash-out the rooms and no amount of brightly colored accessories can alleviate the drabness. And that's pretty much the only negative I have for the place. The rooms may be dull in decor--and a bit too snug at times--but the comfort factor is high. The beds and linen encourages one to sleep-in on rainy San Francisco mornings. The bathrooms are non-descript, but they work and I've always had plenty of hot water when I needed it. Housekeeping is gracious (Marina leaves me cute notes) and very efficient. The picture windows in the rooms facing Market Street are well insulated against the noise generated by the pandemonium below. However, those who are particularly sensitive to outside noise may prefer one of the inside rooms; they have an almost tomb-like quality. The location is great. The Pal is right on the corner of Market and 4th, just a very short walk away from the epicenter of the best shopping on the west coast. If you're lucky, you'll get one of the precious few outside rooms. The windows are huge and it's fun watching all the scurrying below; society ladies with Armani bags, protesters, backpackers, Buddhist monks, guys in drag, street performers, investment bankers, and seemingly every other example of humanity all collide together right outside the hotel. Another big plus is that the Powell Street MUNI/BART station is right around the corner from the Palomar's entrance. The Pal is great for museum junkies (like me); the spectacular DeYoung is a MUNI ride away and the Museum of Modern Art is just a ten minute walk from the Pal's doors. The Palomar has an interesting advantage in that it's located next door to the Westfield Mall. During my first few visits to the hotel, the staff would direct me to the Westfield's food court when I asked where I could get a quick bite to eat. I initially scoffed at the idea of getting a meal at a food court but this is no ordinary food court. The Korean BBQ joint is quick, cheap, and so very delicious. Corriander, right next to it, has wonderful Thai food at bargain prices. I truly enjoy grabbing a meal at the Westfield food court and bringing it back to my room to watch a movie (the rooms at the Palomar are equipped with DVD players.) One time I asked one of the front desk people (I shall not name the person) about room service; the person just shook his head and mouthed the words \"You don't want to do that.\" That pretty well sums up the quality of the Palomar's room service. The Pal has a very formal restaurant called the Fifth Floor. It's very good but for a truly awesome meal in an achingly romantic setting ask Stephen, the concierge, to get you reservations at Chez Spencer. Which brings me to the Palomar's most shining asset: the staff. These people are no corporate drones; they are charming, wacky, funny, and vibrant. They are also very competant at what they do. I'm away from home quite a bit and almost always travel by myself; it is such a luxury to walk into a hotel and be welcomed back as an old friend. Overall, if you want up-to-date style go to the W. If you need pampered luxury--and are willing to pay dearly for it--go to the Mandarin Oriental. The Palomar is for those who place comfort above trendy luxury and who appreciate a warm, welcoming staff. And the Pal's location just cannot be beat if you're in SF for shopping, clubbing and/or museum hopping.", "Date": "December 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cSolid but not remarkable\u201d", "Author": "FI_Flyer", "ReviewID": "UR10804726", "Content": "Comfortable room.

We chose the Hotel Palomar based on other TripAdvisor reviews. Good choice. We had two rooms--atrium room was very light and quiet. Street rooms are noisy on lower floors; fine above five or six. Atrium room and bath was exceptionally large; other was small and tight with two beds. Handicapped bathroom was without a walk or roll in shower. However, the excess of grab bars made it useable. The staff ARE very attentive. We especially enjoyed and visited with the Head Bell Man, the doormen and the security men on in the evenings. Because we were there a full week they got to know us, and our comings and goings. They made the best suggestions. Concierge service was adequate, but not very experienced or with first hand knowledge. Often they relied on reports or questions from prior guests all stored in the hotel computer. They did suggest a 12 person van tour of the wine country for us that I also recommend--Pacific Tours. Although the hotel was short-staffed in housekeeping, what ever we asked for at the front desk was promptly received or corrected--too few bath towels for two, more soap, change the hypoallergic pillows, etc. Yes the low flush toilets are noisy...they all are. Yes the lobby is minimal--but there is a lovely quiet sitting area on the fifth floor which we used nightly for business meetings. We could even have a drink or order soup or lite fare during our meetings. My mom sat out there with a friend one day while the room was being made up. Yes, the restaurant is pricey. But it is totally in line with any other top flight restaurant in SF. It is rated THE BEST French restaurant in the city. Nearby is Annabelle's which is reasonable and the food is very good. Note Annabelle's has a restaurant and a bar menu that are totally different. Also nearby in the Westfield Mall is a food court with all types of ethnic and uncommon fare at low or more typical SF prices. In the mornings we used the hotel car service to go to our work location. Ideal with our brief cases and computers, we went door to door at low cost and maximum convenience.

As it turned out, and unbeknowest to me, we were there the same weekend of the Gay Pride Parade. What a hoot! The Parade went right past our hotel and we had a pretty good view of it. However, this wasn't why were in town, so I never did actually go out to see it much. However, my kids did and they loved it! I loved this hotel for it's eco-friendliness, cleanliness, spacious, comfortable, well appointed rooms. The staff was wonderful. Can't say much else though.

It takes half an hour. As you go up the esculator from the Powell Street station you can see the sign for the Palomar. Can't beat that. Half a block walk and you are there. Map it online ahead of time. I was early for my reservation but the staff got me directed to my room. It faced away from the street and over a glass atrium. It was also a bit cramped. I could be in any hotel in the country with this view. I went back to the lobby and asked for a better room. For $20.00 a night more I got a slightly larger room that overlooked Market Street, a main San Franciso street. Granted I did hear some street musicians through the window in the evening but stuff like this stops at around 10 PM. I had three quiet nights of sleep. I can't say enough nice things about the staff. Want an opinion about a restaurant? You can get several. It happens that the historic, reasonably priced John's Grill is only a couple of blocks away. As for the room again. It was clean. No walk-in shower but a nice bath. Nice, light cover for the bed so you can see how clean it is. Kind of weird to have two desk chairs. Great if you are going to have a couple of visitors to your room. Reading lights for bed reading could be better (as with most hotels). Mattress was comfortable as were the pillows.

I don't like this hotel quite as much as another Kimpton Hotel in SF, the Argonaut, but the Palomar's location is superior (unless you want to be at Fisherman's Wharf). The room was quiet in that we didn't hear a peep from neighboring rooms or the hallway. However, at 8pm a band set up across the street, and it was quite audible, even through the double-paned windows. We didn't mind, but if you don't want to hear Jimi Hendrix tunes until 11 pm (plus the occasional siren and other street noise) ask for an interior room. I only have a couple small complaints. 1. The bathroom has a pocket door. These seem to be popular in SF hotels, but I don't like them. 2. The lobby, although attractive, is small.

Just check out where it is located on the map.

The website made it look great and the reviews I had read were very positive. However, despite the reasonable room rates (I paid 179/night), this is just not a hotel I would return to. GENERAL: The problem with Kimpton hotels, in my opinion, is that they are theme hotels rather than true luxury hotels. The theme of the Palomar is \"fancy hotel\". It emulates luxury, but doesn't actually achieve it. LOCATION: The hotel is located very centrally on the corner of Market Street and 4th St. The particular street corner is ridden with somewhat sleazy types, and the building abuts an Old Navy store. LOBBY: I generally enjoy large, open spaces, and the lobby, though well-appointed, was the opposite. ROOMS: TINY!!!!! The very friendly receptionist had even upgraded me to one of the larger rooms, and that was still an extremely small room. The room was nicely appointed but, again, TINY!! The bathroom was so tiny that, sitting on the toilet, my knees nearly touched the cheaply painted-over sliding door that separates the bedroom from the bathroom. The bedding was awful. The pillows were tiny and not firm enough. SERVICE: This is the hotel's one big plus. Everyone from the receptionist to Virgil, the very friendly and knowledgeable concierge, to the bellboys, were professional and courteous. RESTAURANT: The restaurant, Fifth Floor, has received rave reviews on Zagat and elsewhere. It bills itself as a gourmet fine dining restaurant with a star chef. I have eaten in some of the finest restaurants domestically and internationally, and this restaurant just wasn't that great. The service was terrific, but the food, though flavorful and inventive, wasn't worth the $173 price tag (for one person!!). Entrees priced between 40-52 dollars!!! SUMMARY: If you are in dire need of a boutique hotel in San Francisco, go to the W.

I asked for a quiet room, and didn't want one overlooking the street, as I guessed that would be noisy, and also wanted a non-smoking room (I think the whole hotel is non-smoking, but I didn't want a room that someone had smoked in). We were given a room at the back of the hotel, with apologies that it overlooked offices, as that was the quietest. The room was super quiet, once the door was shut we couldn't hear a thing. It was a huge room though. We didn't really watch tv, but if someone did, they might find the tv too far away from the beds, especially for watching a movie. We kind of felt that a lot of the room space was wasted, but it was certainly a large room. The bathroom also was huge. Lovely fittings in the bathroom, and we liked the 'arty' touch throughout the hotel. The location was great. I purposefully wanted something not right on Union Square, as that sounded noisy. I liked this location just south of the square, as it was easy to get to for transportation, stores, a grocery store down the road. We walked everywhere from the hotel. We're good walkers, but still we walked up hills, over to China Town and on to North Beach, across to Nob Hill, and took public transportation to the Haight, etc. No coffee maker in the rooms, but excellent organic coffee in the lobby, so I'd just go down there each morning and bring some up.

We were a family of four with two older teenagers, and I was looking for something that would accomodate varying personalities. My husband is older, hates shopping, favors museums. My daughter wanted to SHOP, SHOP, SHOP! Our son would probably have preferred to have been left home, and I just wanted everyone to be happy. The Palomar seemed tucked back from the traffic on the main road, but it was within easy walking distance of several museums and LOADS of shopping. Chinatown was also within easy walking distance. The staff at the Palomar was SO courteous--always greeting us with a smile, opening doors (It may have helped to have the attractive 20 year old daughter along.) The room was not large, but luxuriously appointed with down comforters, really nice sheets and towels. I thought at one point that I should have booked TWO rooms, but we weren't IN the room that much, and we really didn't mind the rare family closeness. As a matter of fact, when we look back on the trip more than a year later, we talk about the night we stayed in and ordered a movie on the television as one of our favorite times on the trip. We booked one of those tours to Alcatraz, Muir Woods, Sauselito, and the bus stopped right in front of the hotel and picked us up the morning we were going to Muir Woods. We found the location perfect for our needs. My husband and I would wake up early and head out for one of the Starbucks within easy walking distance. Later we'd wake the teenagers and go DO something. Later in the day my husband would rest in the room while I shopped with one or both kids.

The lobby was beautiful, clean and stylish. This was the small intimate setting I was looking for. Although it felt formal, it was not stuffy, and neither was the staff. I was not interested in staying in a monster size hotel only to feel like just a room number. I was also presented with a gift, a Palomar tote bag. This was unexpected and very thoughtful. I booked the room through the hotel's website and they fulfilled my special requests. The room was clean and I approved of the decor. The ceilings were at least 10 feet high, which is a nice touch.

The atmosphere is upscale and hip, it would appeal to anyone who demands the best in service and style, for the business or pleasure travelers alike.

The restaurant was full with holiday party goers and other guests, and we didn't have a reservation. However, the hostess accomodated us with no questions asked and we were seated as soon as we got into the crowded room. I had the chicory salad and sour dough encrusted mackeral, both of which were outstanding, well-prepared, tasty, and beautifully presented. The service in the restaurant was as impeccable as it was at the front desk/room attendants, courteous, prompt and professional. This is some of the best food I have ever had the pleasure of eating in a hotel restaurant. Overall, this hotel is a real find in the City, for its upscale and low-key elegance, wonderful cuisine, and super service. I would come back for the service alone. All the staff, from the valet to the front desk, was deferential and more than happy to accomodate our every wish.

We were so excited to be staying there because of their reputation for customer service and the positive reviews. We booked over the hotel's central reservation line. They gave us a rate which was pricey, but included parking and breakfast. When we checked in they said that I was mistaken and that only parking was included. I tried to clear this up but was told there was no manager on duty and to call the central reservation line (they confrimed a note on my file on their computer system, that my understanding was correct but said they could do nothing to help me, and that I would have to sort it out at the hotel.) So, no one was available either at the hotel or central reservations to help sort this out. In the end, I wrote a note for the day manager. She was unavailable in the morning, but then left a voice message in my room saying that I was wrong. When I talked to her in person, and asked her to check the file, she found that there was indeed a note saying that the breakfast AND parking were included. If anyone at the front desk had bothered to check the notes on the computer reservation, they would have seen this (they refused to do this). However, it was too late, by the time it was sorted out it was well past breakfast. In the end, they offered a discount on a room service charge for the previous night. But, it did not save the siutation. I felt very disrespectfully treated, and ended up in tears. The customer service put a real pall on our stay, and I ended up spending a couple of hours of our precious vacation time trying to get them to honor the commitment their own reservation department had made. Very disappointing. A discount on a room service charge in no way made up for the disrespectful treatment, or their own lack of coordination between the hotel and their own reservations department. Overall: The other staff (concierge, bell and wait staff) were very friendly and helpful. The frontdesk and management were not helpful at all. The hotel itself is unique, but worn around the edges. They allow pets, and there was dog hair on the ottoman in our room. The location is very nice. The view from our room was to an internal courtyard that faced other rooms, we could not open the window to our room. The restaurant for dinner had organic local foods and was wonderful. I agree with the previous reviewer...the pocket bathroom doors to the small rooms allow no privacy. Overall, I was so disappointed with the customer service and rudeness. I would not recommend that anyone stay here. It is a decent property, but when things like this happen and there is no commitment to correcting misunderstandings it makes the whole experience upsetting. Paying this amount of money for a room, we expect far better customer service. Also, we expect that what the promises of the central reservation department will be honored, and not argued about at the front desk.

Everyone, from the bell desk to concierge was friendly, professional, and knowledgable.

I was concerned at first that the noise from the street would be bothersome but it wasn't. At night we didn't hear anything and slept great. The bathroom was very nice, with thoughtful amenities like a magnifying makeup mirror and ample room to put personal belongings. The room was very comfortable and the decor was beautiful, but also fun, with leopard print carpeting. The bed was very comfortable with high quality bed linens. There were four bed pillows, something we really appreciated. A pretty room means nothing to us, though, if the hotel staff isn't what it should be. The staff is great, we felt welcome and pampered from the minute we walked in. I used the concierge (Yeme) several times and she gave us great advice and was so very nice. We also asked directions several times and the bell desk was helpful and accurate. The location is great, and we didn't rent a car while we were there. We walked everywhere, or took public transportation which is easily accessible. A couple of tips that are very important - if you plan to visit Alcatraz, be sure to buy your tickets through blueandgoldfleet[\"\"]ahead of time. There were many people trying to get tickets and they couldn't - sold out. Also, if you want to take a wine tour and plan to use a tour company or limo, it would be best to choose the company ahead of time and make reservations.

This was my first trip to San Francisco and I chose this hotel based on previous reviews. I have to say thank you to all of you who posted your reviews on this hotel because they were right on. This hotel was great. Here are some tips of advice for those of you who are considering this hotel for your stay in San Francisco: I used the advice from a previous review on the parking structure at 5th and Mission and it worked out great. It was only a block from the hotel and half the price ($23 a day) of what it would have been to park at the hotel. For those of you who want to shop, this is the perfect location. Every store you can think of is within walking distance. But, be prepared for the ever changing climate. Although it was very sunny both days, it can be very deceiving. Make sure and bring light sweaters or jackets and comfortable shoes. Cabs can be a little pricey, so be prepared to do a lot of walking. We took the trolley once down to Fisherman's Wharf and that was enough for me. We had to wait for about 25 minutes to get on at Powell and Market St and unless you get a seat, you'll be holding on for dear life. It was fun for the experience though. If you do go to Fisherman's Wharf, I highly recommend Chic's Seafood restaurant. It is on the second level on Pier 39. Our meal was fantastic and reasonably priced. As for the hotel itself: We had a king bed room. It was a bit small, but all we did was sleep there so it didn't matter to us. Our room also did not have a dresser, but for two nights it wasn't a bid deal. Also no coffee maker in the room, but it forced us to get up and out of bed to get fresh coffee in the lobby. Our bed was incredibly comfortable which made up for the compact size. Our room was always very clean and stocked up with fresh towels and Aveda products every day. They even had turn down service which added a nice touch. Even though the hotel is in a busy area, our room faced the courtyard, so we didn't hear any street noise at night.

Positives: - Location is perfect, a few blocks away from Union Square, less than a block away from Sony Metreon and San Francisco Shopping Center. - We are big on Customer Service, so that is the first thing that we noticed when we arrived. Everyone was friendly and very approachable. They always greeted us with a big smile and was willing to help. - During our check in, we were upgraded to a Suite without even asking. Perhaps because we are members of the Kimpton? They also greeted us with a welcome bag which consisted of a bottle of distiled water and an apple. It's not a big thing, but it's a nice gesture. - We have stayed at many different hotels in San Francisco, but we have never encountered hotel rooms so quiet before. We were on the 8th floor and we could not hear the busy streets at all. We were expecting to hear a lot of noises, (I even had my earplugs ready) so this was a nice surprise. Some of the problems we encountered during our stay: - I usually don't use shampoo and conditioners provided by Hotels, but Kimpton usually provides great amentines, so I decided not to bother to bring my own. The shampoo (Aveda) really dried up my hair. Not a big deal really, for I was smacked in the middle of downtown, an easy walk to get my regular shampoo. - The pillows were small. We are used to having either queen/king size pillows on a king size bed, but these pillows provided were the standard pillows. They were so small that they looked out of place on such a large bed. - The bathroom was nice, and the tub was big enough, however, the water in the tub took forever to drain. In fact, the water reached my ankle when I was taking a shower. We let the hotel know about this, but we were encountering the same problems the whole time we were there. The toilet wasn't flushing properly also. We had to flush at least twice or three times each time. Overall, we had a great stay at Palomar, and most likely will return.", "Date": "July 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cA Gem in San Fran!\u201d", "Author": "Ridgesas", "ReviewID": "UR5432265", "Content": "We found this hotel by chance via Expedia and booked it give the positive reviews on TA.

Maybe I'm not quite as \"picky\" as other people, but I found the customer service at the hotel to be excellent, as compared to the 200+ other hotels I've stayed at in the last 12 months. Apparently the hotel was good enough to win the \"Conde Nast\" Traveler's 2005 Gold List of World's Best Places to stay, so I guess I'm not alone in thinking that it's a nice place to stay. Being a \"road warrior\", I'm also an \"Inner Circle Elite Member\", so it's possible I get treated a little better than the average customer, but compared with my treatment at other chains (Intercontinental, Marriott, Starwood), I found the customer service to be more than adequate. Checkin: I arrived early at the hotel (approx 1 PM), and didn't expect to be given a room, but the desk clerk found one for me without a problem. Based on my \"Inner Circle\" status, I asked if I could get upgraded. Again, based on past experiences with equal status at other chains, I was more than prepared to accept a negative response. The desk clerk upgraded me to a jacuzzi suite, no extra charge. She was very friendly, smiling, and welcoming, traits that I unfortunately see a paucity of in the hotel business. Room Service: I believe that room service at most Kimpton hotels is not quite at the same level as larger hotels, because they are boutique hotels, which are smaller in scale by definition than main chain hotels. That said, I think the quality of food I've ordered at Kimptons hotels exceeds their rivals. I did have breakfast at the hotel restaurant, and though expensive, it really was not any more than rival hotels (esp. for San Francisco). Service was fast and good, so no problems there. Room: Clean, with relatively new appearing furniture (again, maybe I'm just not as picky as others - but I do stay in enough hotels to be able to judge quality of room accomodations). The bathroom had a jacuzzi with separate walk-in shower with Aveda toiletries. Overall: Considering I booked the room with a Travelzoo discount of 150 (with $25 discount towards restaurant meal), I would most definitely stay there again. And the friendly, welcoming staff was the icing on the top which is the feature that would lead me to stay there again.

Quirk #1: I do NOT want a bell hop to touch my luggage I do NOT wnat a bell hop to 'push my trolley\" I do NOT want a bell hop to even know my name I am paying for the facilities of the hotel - the trolley is part of these facilities - I should not have a bell hop tell me that I cannot use the bloody trolley. If I say I want to ferry my luggage to my room myself using the trolley then that s my perogotive - LET ME. Quirk #2: I do NOT want a valet to touch my car I accept that I generally have to tolerate this and so, when I do so, and I pay for parking as well as tipping the valet - then, when I call down for my car at 7:30PM then 1) The concierge should answer the phone 2) When I call the front desk and ask for my car they shouldn't tell me \"take a number\" 3) It shouldn't take 25 minutes for them to get my car (NOTE: only one other car was brought in that 25 minutes and the next day - they had it within 5 minutes). Quirk #3: We selected the hotel because it was \"pet friendly\". A pet friendly hotel should allow me to leave my pet in the room if I feel that doing so was safe and I am willing to take the responsibility. There was no indication of the requirement for attending my dog at all times until check in (not quite bait and switch as they don't tell -how- friendly they are). We had to take the dog with us - to our event requiring that we leave her in the car, further requiring that we drive rather than take a taxi, and eliminating the need to go to the drink-and-dance party as remaining 100% sober is the only way to drive. When I travel to europe, to a little burgh along the Rhine then I get better service knowing that there is no service available rather than feeling that the service is available and isn't. When I travel to Singapore to a luxury hotel none of the issues raised above had been near visible - much less than occuring. When I travel to Mobile Alabama I get treated better... In the future I will opt for the motels further away from the location of the event and take three rooms for the price of the luxury hotel be able to walk to the resturaunts for evening meal - leave my dog in the room and pay nothing for parking, need no valet, use the trolley all I want with no bleeding bell hop to tell me that I cannot ferry my own luggage to my room.", "Date": "February 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cI wish I could have stayed longer\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4455870", "Content": "The Hotel Palomar is fabulous.

You can't ask for a better location for a hotel, tons of shopping and restaurants nearby. All the employees were very friendly and accomodating. The room was on the small side but looked great and was clean, the bed was very comfortable. The interior decoration of the hotel is just awesome, really trendy and hip looking.

Lots of great shopping around, the Metreon for a late movie, the SOMA (best brownies at their cafte), and right on the cable car line. 1) Best hotel rate can be found on their web site. We did the great rates deal for $139/nite plus taxes. 2) Request a handicap room, if available at check-in. These are larger rooms. They will fill your request if no one reserves them. Otherwise, a room with a view to the zen court is quite nice and very quiet. 3) Hotel parking is $42 + taxes with in/out priviledges, but if you park down the street at the Metreon public parking lot, it's $22/24 hours with NO in/out priviledges. But in SF, you won't need your car! Everything is accessible by foot, cab, cable car or bus. By the way, the $11/1 day pass for the cable car/metro is worth it. But start early, as the cable car line is always long. The cable car start/ticket booth is across the street from the Palomar. btw, the hotel has a very good driving map of the city showing the one-way streets direction. Very helpful if you're driving down there. 4) If you're driving in the city, you will need a car to get to the Golden Gate bridge view site, so do this first thing when you're driving into the city. Parking is $5/all day at the view site, so I suggest everyone do what we did - pass your all-day parking pass (which you put in your windshield) on to someone else when you're getting ready to leave the parking lot! Some jerk sold me his for half-price (cheap *******!), but you should just pass it on.

This was my first experience at a \"boutique\" hotel. The main thing that attracted me to this hotel was the modern style and attention to detail without the expensive room rates. When I arrived, I was not disappointed. The lobby, though small was minimalistically classy. There was something different about this place.....The check in was fine, and the front desk staff were quite friendly. My room was wonderful. Lots of characteristic swank, very modern, sharp and clean. I was impressed with the CD/radio, the decor, and the AVEDA toilettries which all indicate Kimpton's desire to offer high quality affordably. I had a bit of trouble during my stay - a false alarm and a premature check-out botch. However, The staff were quite apologetic and did what they could to accommodate me. I was moved to a different room and discovered that the decor was essentially the same from room to room. Not surprising, but probably the secret to allowing them to offer what they do. The hotel has a restaurant/lounge that - as it turns out - is frequented by locals moreso than hotel guests (at least so I think). This would be fine, but the fact that the lounge was located on a floor adjacent to guest rooms makes me wonder if this was the wisest form of planning. Still, the noise level rises only around happy hour and is not otherwise a problem. The fitness room is compact but the essentials are there. Business types may frequent this hotel, and this is why I found the fitness room to be used very rarely by hotel guests. The novelty of the hotel may wear off, since it's a lot of surface wow and not too much depth in amenities.

The bath products were Avada so very user friendly and not to mention great product line. The mini bar was well stocked with great products if one chooses to indulge. The maid service was prompt and changed my linins and towels each day. I ate the 5th restaurant which is rated one of the best in the city. Great food with lots of creativity.

In that I love boutique hotels, this was another pleasant surprise in the heart of downtown San Francisco (my fav being the Pan Pacific). These rooms were much larger, and although the bathroom was not as elegant as the Pan, the Fuji bathtub was wonderful - so good for soaking the feet after hitting the streets all day. I filled it to the brim knowing that I was depleting the world of water!! It was very very relaxing. The room was a bit too contemporary for me, but did not detract from my stay. I have two complaints about the room. The way our suite was set up, you couldn't sit on the sofa and look directly at the t.v. You had to lay on the sofa to be head-on with the t.v. Also, there are no coffee making faciliites. In a room that is over $400/night, you would expect to find such a convenience - after all...you get that in the $59/night Best Western! My big gripe with the area, not the hotel, is that you are in downtown San Francisco, and there are few good restaurants around, so it's either order from room service or go to the bistro down the street (and by the way, room service gets its food from the bistro down the street). So if you are going to stay at the Palomar, keep that in mind. You will either have to go to the financial or theater district or go elsewhere. If you DO get to Fisherman's Wharf, eat at Scoma's - they have the best (albeit expensive) seasfood going! I'd stay at the Paloma again, but before I'd go back, I'd stay at the Hotel Monaco - it's sister hotel (both are pet-friendly by the way). BY THE WAY - SKIP THE COURTYARD ROOMS. All you see is 3 other interior walls and you look down through a glass roof into \"Old Navy.\" This is a gripe I almost forgot. We got to the hotel early and stowed our luggage and went to get lunch (see note above about eateries in the area) and do some shopping. We hiked all the way to Chinatown before finding any place for lunch - the hotels in the area do not have coffee shops! Anyway, the front desk told us to be back at 2 pm, and we were, and our room still wasn't ready. The staff said that the people were still checking out. They had us wait in the 5th floor loung, very very dark- no coffee pot, no water, no nothing but couches & lounge chairs. 45 minutes later, I sent my husband to complain. The front desk said the couple had spilled something on the carpet & they were cleaning it up, and did we want an \"interior\" room instead. DO NOT GET AN INTERIOR ROOM (see note above). If we had been given our exterior room, we would have been able to sit there and watch the St. Patrick's Day parade on Sunday. The view stunk. All in all, maybe I won't go back there again.

(I read about this exact problem right here on trip-advisor reviews, so I wasn't surprised). They basically said that the room I got WAS an upgrade, because it was an exterior room, instead of an interior room. This is just ridiculous, because their website, on which they promise the upgrade, makes no mention of this distinction. And besides, the deal we were offered said \"best available room,\" not \"slightly better room.\" When I discussed this problem with Brian Fenwick, the general manager, he was rude and unhelpful (another review on this website makes this same point; take note, Kimpton Group!!). He claimed that the website booking system was incorrect about better rooms being available and that I WAS, in fact, in the best available room. Before speaking with Brian, I had a friend call the front desk and try to book a suite; she was informed that they had several suites available. When I told this to Brian, he said that while the rooms may be available to others for booking, but that they were \"allotted,\" so he was unable to upgrade me. This is nonsense. I'm not sure what is more disturbing: that they wouldn't honor the upgrade, or that Brian would tell a bold-faced lie and say the rooms were unavailable. Besides this unpleasantness, the hotel was fine: a nice big room, service once a day (although they say you should get it twice), and a big clean bathroom.

Our \"ocean view\" was okay but our balcony was small and no room for chairs let alone standing room. Our room was decorated in a 1970's style.

Housekeeping may or may not make it to your room before 5:00 pm. Everyday it's a surprise. The front desk appears to view the guests as an inconvenience. Oh and if you want to park, good luck with that. On average we were about 40 parking spots away from our building. The beach is great. The pool is filled with little children especially the hot tub.

So if it is important to you to get a specific type of room, for example ocean view, then you should not stay here because they do not guarantee you will get that room. We even contacted the hotel in advance to confirm our room was ocean view and when we got there they apologized they didn't have any ocean view available. This happened to other guests in our party as well. The only other negative is each unit is owned individually and therefore you don't know what to expect because some have been updated with amazing upgrades and others are so outdated. We looked at 5 other rooms that our friends had and there was a wide variety of styles. On to the positive, which far outweigh the above complaints. The people who work at this resort are amazing. Some of them have been there for decades. My favorite was Joe... he is so friendly and nice. The cost of this resort is very fair and reasonable.

The room decor was average- nothing special but not a turn off. We had a full kitchen and the room walked out to a beautiful view of the \"quiet pool\". The bed was comfortable and in general the place was very clean. Every morning we walked/ran on the beach walk and had breakfast at the Castaway Cafe restaurant. The food was pretty good and prices very reasonable (very much like the midwest). There is supposed to be a trolley that comes by the hotel on the hour, but we never used it. The hotel is just one mile from Whaler's Village and we walked there every day. From there, you can take a bus into Lahaina, so we never needed a rental car. We only stayed for 5 nights but if our stay would've been much longer I think we would have needed a car. Most of the other guests were over 40. In fact, 60 may have been the median age. The pool was never crowded, it was always nice and quiet, you could always get a lounge chair or a spot in the hot tub and everything was very mellow. This made for an incredibly relaxing vacation.

The best thing about this resort is its beach (gorgeous, less crowded) and the location - in the center of Kannapali Beach and within easy walking distance of all the resorts on the beach and Whaler's Village, and a short drive to Lahanina area. The property grounds are beautiful and we felt that the landscaping was the best we've seen it. The disappointment is with some of the rooms which require updating. We were assigned a lovely room (514 I think) at first, but it had two single beds instead of the king bed we had booked. We were then assigned room 404 which was very small with very dated and dusty/dirty decor and furnishings, and backing onto the parking lot with not much of a balcony. We stayed one night in 404 and were then lucky to get room 114 which was bigger, nicer decor, and with a nice patio area. The main issue with 114 is that the bed was very uncomfortable and the 4 pillows provided were very old, worn out and flat. Also the refridgerator froze everything, the AC unit was very noisy, the sliding door to the patio was very difficult (and noisy) to open and close, and the patio and patio furniture were very dirty. While these are all just little annoyances, we feel that some of the rooms could use a spruce-up. Usually the desk staff are excellent, but this visit we kept encountering the same grouchy desk clerk. We also usually love Castaways restaurant but had one disappointing breakfast so didn't go back this trip. The best thing about Castaways is not necessarily their food, but rather the gorgeous view from the tables located along the beach. All in all, we still love most things about the MKV, but we will pay more next time for what will hopefully be a better maintained room. We stayed in one of the rooms in the Dolphin building the time before (Feb 2011) that backed onto the pool area -- we were going to try and book this same room again directly through the owner, but were concerned about having to sleep for a week on the somewhat uncomfortable \"Murphy\" wall bed located in that room.

Maui is soo beautiful and there is so much to see, that its not necessary to stay in a beachfront hotel-- we only went to the hotel beach twice. The rooms appeared clean- but were not properly cleaned on a daily basis. The sheets were not changed everyday- which I thought was not acceptable. My child ate chocolate and left a stain on her sheets- and it took 2 days for them to actually change it. On 3 consecutive days we had ROACHES in the room- a small roach initially- we thought okay..lets not be one of those tourists that complain all the time. We killed it and it was fine. The next day however, there was a big roach-very disgusting..we caught it, killed it and had the room service remove it. Then on day 3 there was another roach running through the room ( my child screamed like somebody was about to kill her) and that was it for us..we were so disgusted- we had to change the room right away. We were on the first floor initially ( the room was actually very nice- except of the roaches) and we were then upgraded to an ocean view room on the top floor. The room was old and run down compared to our room on the 1st floor- but since it was our last night, we didn't care and just wanted to leave this Hotel. The staff/ receptionists were very helpful and nice- we didn't have to pay the extra hotel fee for the last 4 nights---but that still doesn't change the fact that there were roaches in the room. I would have been more satisfied if I got a refund for the last 4 hotel nights we spent ..all together we were there for 2 weeks. If it wasn't for the roaches, I would recommend this hotel-- but I'm sorry, I can't. And its not needed because when you're in Maui- there is so much to see, so many nice beaches, that it would make more sense to get a very cheap -BUT CLEAN place. And NO- please don't use the excuse that this is tropical and roaches aren't a big deal... I'm sorry but I've been to many many tropical places in this world ( Maledive Islands, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Barbados, Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Aruba....and I can go on and on with my list of places I've visited)-----BUT NEVER ,never , never HAD ROACHES IN MY ROOM! And the hotels I've been to were all between 2-4 stars hotels. I loved Maui-I will definitely come back to this amazing, magical island---but I will not come to this Hotel anymore.

I will break down this review into the following sections: Location, Accommodations, Beach Quality and Price. Location: It does not get any better. Close to Whalers Village, Black Rock, Napili Bay and Front street in Lahaina. In addition, the grounds are situated right on the beach and far enough away from the road to avoid noise. Accommodations: We stayed in the ground floor of the coconut room facing the smaller pool. Great Lanai open to perfectly manicured grass and the pool. The room was recently remodeled and the furniture and fixture were awesome. Love to stay in the emerald building next time. Castaway Cafe is a great restaurant for Breakfast and you are right on the beach and next to the larger pool. Housekeeping was fantastic, the resort was quite but you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel it was deserted. It might have helped that we stayed from Dec 1st-8th which I was told was the slowest time of the year. Beach: If you have kids and want to spend time on the beach and ocean there might not be a better beach. Much of Kaanapali has a slight downhill into the water. Right in front of the resort is some of the least decline that we found in Maui. There is pretty good snorkeling right off the shore and there are great long walks to be had. If you want really good snorkeling you can walk the short distance to Black Rock. Price: Our trip was booked through travelocity as a package and we felt the price was a great deal. We had a room with a King, Hideaway bed (never used) and a kitchen. I thought we had a ton of value for what we paid. Overall, I would not stay at another resort other than this one when we go back to Maui. There are a few tricks to make sure you get a good room but it was easy to do.

We wanted a larger condo-style room with a kitchen, not a standard hotel with nowhere to cook. Our room in the Banyan building was perfect for what we needed. It was a large (1100 square feet) two-story condo with a kitchen, dining room, living room, bedroom loft, and two bathrooms. It was a little awkward that the bedroom loft only had a small bathroom with a toilet and sink attached, and that the main bathroom suite was downstairs. Our unit was outfitted with modern kitchen appliances, two flat-screen TVs, and nice furniture. It was cleaned every day by the staff. The hotel grounds are amazing and are maintained very well. The hotel is right on the beach with easy access. There are two pools, each with a separate jacuzzi. The main pool near the beach is quite large, and has a bridge over it with a waterfall. There can be quite a few children in this pool. The smaller pool next to the Banyan building typically used by adults and quieter than the main pool. The Castaway Cafe is the hotel's restaurant, and is located next to the main pool. The prices vary, but tend to be on the expensive side. Once a week, all pasta is half off. The chefs are great, and even substituted Mahi Mahi for shrimp in a dish because I can not eat shrimp. The staff was very friendly, and treated us like family. We liked the mai tai parties with live music every Wednesday. The staff serves free mai tais, local snacks, and smiles. It seems like some of the negative reviews are from people who do not research hotels before they book. This is not a luxury hotel or resort with every amenity and that charges extremely high room rates. The Kaanapali Villas is a family-oriented complex made of individually owned condos.

The Castaway restaurant at the property is a great place to grab breakfast or lunch. And, Wayne the bartender, was very friendly and always remembered our names. It was like being at \"Cheers\". The restaurant staff was great too. The snorkeling, a short walk down the beach to the right, is the best on the island! There is really no need to take one of those expensive cruises to snorkel. Our condo has all the comforts of home and a sunset view that would take your breath away. The grounds are meticulously maintained and worth a stroll through. Many people from different resorts walk the trail that meanders through the resort. And the torches at night create a romantic and safe atmosphere.

We got in around 11:45pm and after reading on trip advisor someone mentioned to ask the front desk about seeing a few places before choosing our room, the late night guy was awesome, he noticed I had 2 kids and said we definatly didn't want the room we were assigned to as it had steep stairs and with the kids not good. He gave me 3 rooms to look at and we ended up with the one he thought we would. 212 was a fantastic room in the tower so with the elevators super easy access with the stroller, the room was huge! Over 900 sq feet, 1 bedroom big living room and big kitchen a full corner unit with a wrap around deck, I am still shocked how big this place was. All remodeled granite, etc, dishes, pots and pans etc everything was there for you, we were in need of a few bigger pots and some tongs but they ran them right up when we called. The maid was good, she did the beds, vaccumed, floors, towels etc daily and super friendly.The pull out couch was horrible. It was extremly uncomfortable, so if you are travelling with 2 couples and 1 has to get the sofa don't do it, choose and pay extra for the 2 bedroom. We did complain about this but there was a wait list for a foamy so they brought up a blow up mattress which was ok but a bed would of been much better! Also travelling with a 3year old and an 8 month old I would of liked to know there are no tubs here, all renovated places only have showers which can be a problem, if I would of known that I would of probably stayed elsewhere, its hard without a tub. The pools were nice, the kids pool was ideal and handy attached to the adult pool, they could use more kids stuff, like a water park area or swings etc. We found the Westin had a great kids waterpark and a majority of the kids at our hotel made there way over there a few times a day.The air broke in our room but the maintnace man was there immediatly and fixed it quickly, right below us were fantastic bbq's for everyone to use, we used the laundry facility and it was convienant. There is a cafe here which is directly behind the pool, we ate there a few times but found the one man (bald) not friendly at all so we ended up avoiding it because didn't want the attitude and feeling of not wanting us there. Many people commented on this, actual owners of the villas did as well. The other fellow and the blonde were awesome, for a pretty similair price you can walk down to the Westin and they have 3 or 4 very yummy restaurants there and its a great walk on the boardwalk along the Kaanapali beach! Safeway is close and 24hrs, as well there is a little market on th elocation which has some great ice cream my son loved daily and super friendly ladies working there! We didnt book and activities thourgh the ladies there but they did give us maps and helped us along to find the way anywhere we asked, there is a free shuttle to Whalers Village and you are about a 10 minute walk to the Sugar train that has a few stops and ends up in Lahania. The beach is amazing and approx a 3 minute walk here you can rent Cabanas for 20 bucks a day they were nice for the day, snorkles, lifejackets etc can be rented here, really I think this stuff should be free to use. Nothing was left in the room we rented and I had read people who stayed in our room 2 weeks before left chairs, snorkles etc, so rather than me leaving stuff at the end of our trip I gave it away to people arriving. Only problem we had was the day before we were leaving, front desk person \"Rudy\" and his personality matches his name was a grump from the beginning. I asked if we could get and extension on our room as our flight wasnt until 10:45pm so I would like to keep the room until 5:30 or 6 if I could,....absolutly not, knowing after talking to the other front desk fellow the place was only 60% rented/owner occupied at the time as October is the slowest month in Maui, I was like oh ok well can you give me the name of a hotel close to the airport so I can go there, he goes oh you have money and want to pay? I can find you a place here, not once did I mention I would not pay as with kids its easier than finding something to do for 11 hours rather than renting the room longer. He said for 130 I could get another room for 5 hrs whatever I said ok, but because our room was supposidly booked I had to move all my stuff from 212 to another room. Before I checked out I went back to 212, not only at 5:30 was the room not cleaned the maid told us no one was checking in there until tomorrow if the room wasn't cleaned already, so he could of let us stay in there but was a complete grumpy man from the beginning. Other than that would I stay here again, probably, good price, great location, amazing beach, close to the restaurants, great pools!

The lady who answered the phone stated that the cancellation policy states that a person must cancel 72 hours in advance and that they couldn't return any of the money. I told her I didn't know 72 hours in advance that I would be stuck in an airport and asked if I could please speak to the mananger.

I understand that places have policies but sometimes the unforeseen happens and it would have been nice if she offered to fix my reservation up front to save me some stress in an already stressful situation.

The place was kept clean and tidy and all the on site facilities were excellent. Castaway Cafe was a nice little place to grab dinner, especially on pasta nights!!! The sunset view must be the best on the island from here. The beach was perfect, a little way from the busier noisy areas at Black Rock but only by a 5-10 minute walk. Great snorkelling at Airport beachtoo, again only 5-10 minutes away.

But dont mistake that comment to mean this place is shabby in any way, it is absolutely beautiful and you get all of the average amenities and then some. But starting off we arrived to Joe at the front desk and he absolutely, hands down, was the best person to start off our honeymoon check in. He upgraded our room to an ocean view at no charge to us and made sure that we had a bottle of champaigne. We were in the tower room 620. The hotel and room was clean, the grounds were amazingly well maintained, and just lovely. Our room was recently renovated with granite countertops nice furniture and had huge mirrors throughout the entire room that made the place feel much larger than it already was. The kitchen was complete with everything you can think of to feel at home. We woke every morning to bright skies and birds chirping. And the room had an awesome AC so when the nights were hot and muggy (bc that is Hawaii for you) we just turned on the AC and were super comfortable. The grounds were beautiful kept and every night they lit the torches all around the property which was so cool to walk around at night. The beach was perfect. The sand was fine where we were and if you go to the left towards the sheriton the sand becomes more course and you can see the black rock beach and if you go to the right towards the Westin the beach becomes super corally and the snorkeling there is amazing. We just got some snorkel gear and snorkeled there like 4 days it was so great. We saved money doing it that way instead of pay for a cruise ;that takes you out in the middle of the ocean and you have to squint to see anything because you are so far above the coral. In front of the Westin You only have to walk about 10 feet from where the wakes break to see so many different types of fish. There are these black fish that hang around the shore so you can see them just feet from the shore. We even saw two turtles there during our many snorkeling adventures. They have a trolley that goes to the Whalers village but we didnt use it bc we had a car and we only wanted to do whalers village once, why spend time at a mall when you can be doing so many other things. Joe suggested a restaurant called Da Kitchen in Kahului that serves hawaiian food and it was perfect. Great prices for the amount you get. We had dinner for LITTERALLY three meals. $8-$15 PerPerson. Thanks Joe The pool area is beautiful and fun. There is a bridge that crosses over the pool and you can swim under the bridge and there is water the falls continually from the bridge which is fun. There arent too many kids but it is not just for old people like some of the earlier reviews state. My husband and i are 23 and we had a lot of fun and didnt feel out of place at all. We didnt eat at the Castaway but it seemed like it had a steady stream of customers and we heard from other vacationers that the food was great especially the breakfast. We will not hesitate to stay at this location for our future Maui trips or any of the Aston properties on the other islands for that matter.

I had read that it was built in the late sixties and is smaller and less densely built than other places nearby. 3 of the buildings are centered around the main pool and a restaurant and all have partial or complete ocean views (where we stayed). There are several other buildings that are set farther back and do not seem to have any sort of ocean view. These other buildings also have another pool near them. The beach is about 50 feet from the main pool and the grounds are immaculent with plenty of lounge chairs to sit in and watch the ocean. The pool and spa are nice, not too big without any sort of water slides, but everything was very nice and clean, we liked the gas torches that were lit each night. Regarding the title of my review, when booking we saw the pictures of the rooms on the website main page, and they appeared to be very recently remodeled and very modern in design. To be honest is was a significant part of the reason for picking this resort. When we arrived we were surprised to get a room that looked nothing like the photo shown on that page, along with the banner stating 'Newly Renovated'. We thought that meant the facility on a whole was renovated, what they mean is that the lobby was renovated along with a small number of select condos. Despite our surprise of the decor of our unit, we were still very pleased with the facility and our view from our room was beautiful. The condition of the unit was fairly good with some signs of wear (torn wallpaper, older furniture) the kitchen was probably remodeled more recently with granite countertops. We could have asked to be moved, but it was not important enough for us at the time. Each condo is individually owned and will be furnished and maintained at different levels, Aston just facilitates renting them out as far as we could tell. Our 1 bedroom condo was huge, had 2 televisions, a dining room table a large kitchen with all of the appliances (with plates, pots, pans, etc) and a large bathroom. The entrance to the unit was strange, it looked like at one time it was a single 2 bedroom unit converted to 2 separate units.

We came to Maui for a wedding held in Lahaina, and the Aston hotels were recommended as a mid-range hotel chain by the couple. Since we knew we wouldn't be spending a ton of time at the resort, we just wanted something affordable and nice, but not with a ton of resort amenities which you pay for. This particular hotel appealed to us because of its proximity to Lahaina and because it had been recently updated and looked like it had a nice pool and a kitchen in each of the units. We originally booked directly with the hotel, but checked VRBO the week before we were arriving and noticed this unit was available. We contacted the owners who immediately wrote us back and allowed us to rent it for a shorter time period than the normally required 1 week, and they even knocked $20 off the nightly rate since it was short notice, which made the cost of staying in this 1 BR just $25 higher than what we would have paid the hotel for a studio. Great deal! The condo was clean, airy and we appreciated the updated kitchen and bathroom! The kitchen was completely stocked with any kitchen utensils/glassware/etc you would need, though we only ate breakfast here each day. The view was great, I loved that we had a water view, though it was mostly of the pool - you could only somewhat see the ocean behind the pool. But it was pretty none-the-less. Huge patio which we sat on every day once our son went to sleep. (Unite 291) The only problem we had was with the Property Management company that the owners use (Whalers Realty Management). One downside of doing VRBO is that you don't get to call the hotel for pool towels, a crib or high chair. We ended up having to rent these separately from a furniture rental company. This added $15 to our daily costs which we had not anticipated. When I asked the Property Mgt company about needing a crib, she said she would look into but we never heard back from her. When I contacted them again, the man who answered gave me the names of two local companies which we used. When we checked our credit card bill after we left Hawaii, we saw another charge from the Property Mgt company - turned out it was for a Pack n Play that they had ordered for us. They never confirmed this with us, we thought it came with the unit after all. Also, when we inquired about a late checkout (we took a redeye home) they were not helpful and didn't even offer us the option to pay for it. They refunded us the money for the Pack n Play, but I will never rent a VRBO on Maui again if they are the management company.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aiken, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "SCBill", "ReviewID": "UR103471243", "Content": "We stayed at the Kaanapali villas for 10 days and it lived up to the reviews.

What we experienced was a really nice small resort on a perfect strip of beach in West Maui just north of the town of Lahaina. This was our first trip to Maui so we can't compare it to other properties. These are condo units, often rented out on behalf of the owners by the management. Ours had two bedrooms each with en suite, and critically a kitchen. With the price of eating out being about 15-30% higher than a comparable meal in our home state of Minnesota, the availability of the kitchen saved us a fortune on meals, because we were able to make several breakfast, lunches and dinners. Tip: go to Costco in Kahului and stock up - the local Safeway in Lahaina was very overpriced. If you don't make it to Costco, go North on hwy 30 to the Time grocery store (2 lights north of the Villas) - prices are much more reasonable there for groceries than in Lahaina. The resort was small - I didn't count but probably 200 units in a variety of configurations. They had a Mai Tai reception on thursdays, and free coffee very morning. The staff were friendly and helpful. The store onsite like any hotel store was expensive but helpful if you're short on something. The Castaway Cafe by the pool area served great drinks and breakfasts (we did not try lunch or dinner there), and the onsite excursion staff helped us book our key events. We had a specific condo unit on the 1st floor which worked out great - I wasn't worried about the view since we only had to walk 100 yards if that to the pool and beach, but if you want a beach view, there would only be a few units (west looking) to choose from. Overall, we would go back here in a heartbeat, if we could get a good rate. The resort was right on a very nice strip of beach - apparently one of the best beaches in Maui. The water was clear (although no fish to see). If you have younger children, be aware that the beach drops off from paddling depth in the surf to 5-6 feet deep in the space of 2-3 lateral feet from shore, and the backwash from the surf was very strong. Our 10/11 year olds thought it was great fun, but younger kids might not relish being dragged under a wave. And the sand gets in EVERYTHING so be prepared to spend a lot of time in the shower!

This was not our first trip to Maui, and have stayed at other Aston properties. Although the property is on a beautiful stretch of beach, the majority of the rooms do not have the sweeping ocean view. I decided on this trip that an oceanfront room trumps a beachfront property anyday. We were upgraded from a studio garden view to a one-bedroom garden view on the 2nd floor of the Aloha Builing. The view was disappointing, as I saw mostly the entrance to the property--very little gardens. The lanai was quite spacious--but when the guests in the unit next door were also on their lanai, there was a serious lack of privacy--the two lanais were separated by plants. The room we were in was very nice--looked like it had been the recepient of several upgrades. The bathroom had a nice shower, no tub, but was extremely small and very poorly lit. The sink/changing area was very large--some of that unnecessary space would have made a nice bigger bathroom. There was no washer/dryer in the room, which was a negative. I don't want to spend my vacation running to the guest laundry at the back of the property. Parking near the entrance to our building was an issue, as there were maybe 15 spots in the lot, and quite of few of them were for private use. We ended up parking 2 buildings away. There is a resort fee, that included the parking charge and internet access, of $13/day that is not included in the room cost. That is payable when you leave. We arrived at 240 pm, and were told the room would not be ready until 3 pm. Yanked my chain a bit on that--I could see not having it ready hours early, but 20 minutes??? I read some reviews after I returned and was surprised to find that was a trolley to other areas of Kaanapali from the Villas. I was not informed of this, but certainly would have taken advantage of the service, as I walked to Whaler's Village several times. The walks in the property are very slippery when wet--I almost fell twice within 10 minutes after it had rained. There were no caution signs out, however they were placed out later. The woman that checked us in was very pleasant, however, the gentleman that checked us out was a bit on the grumpy side. He didn't leave a good last impression.

First of all when I checked into the hotel I was given room 507 in the Aloha Tower. According to Expedia this room was to have an ocean view and was supposed to be 1200+ SF. The room was not an ocean view in my opinion but was more of a parking lot / lobby view (Just because your high up and can see the water does not make a room an ocean view IMHO, heck I can see NYC from the roof of my house but that doesnt mean my house has a view of the city). Also the room was no where near 1200 SF and the furnishings were quite outdated. Although the room was not as ADVERTISED the overall grounds of the hotel were quite NICE. Excellent park of Kaanapali Beach and probably the most relaxing property on the entire section of Kaanapali. No crowds and beautiful grounds. And even though the room was not as advertised it turned out to be fine for y stay as we were on the beach for the most part anyway. The major problem with this HOTEL is the FRONT DESK STAFF. Two employees stand out in my mind as being very rude. A gentlemen by the name of RUDY was probably the RUDEST person I met in all of HAWAII. Never once said Aloha or Mahalo, acted like any guest was bothering him whenever someone wanted something. While waiting in a long line I watched him basically tell one lady to stop bothering him and ask someone else. And one woman needed a key made because her 21 month old was locked in the room. He slapped the key on the counter and made her walk all the way around the lobby to get it rather than handing it to her. By the time I made it up to the counter to ask for the key to the shower this man had already ruined 3 peoples stay at the property. The other staff member of interest was a man named Joe. Joe was quite arrogant when I came to him with a room issue and seemed to care much more about hotel OWNERS than hotel guests. His arrogance really put a damper on the first day of our stay. I was really surprised at the difference in hotel staff between Waikiki Beach (stayed at the Marriott and this property). Literally some of the rudest staff I have ever encountered throughout all my whole stays ANYWHERE. Now to the TSUNAMI WARNING. Had this TSUNAMI hit Kaanapali hard this hotel would have been destroyed and many would have lost their lives. The hotel had NO IDEA what it was doing during the Tsunami warning. One gentlemen said to leave the hotel and go up the mountain. Another one said to stay put in my room. Shouldnt there be a better plan of action in place. They really didnt know what to do and that made it worse for us visitors to the island. Even though my review is quite critical if this property would clean up the front desk staff I would probably stay there again. I really liked the grounds and the quietness of it.. And all the other staff were fine from Castaways to Maintenance. Its really just the FRONT DESK staff.

The beach is awesome, very little rocks like the rest of Hawaii. We saw numerous whales right from the hotel beach! Whaler's village is a 15 minute walk down the beach, right past Black Rock. The downside to the hotel we felt was the service. First and foremost, the power for the hotel was out for over a day. I know they can't control the weather or the time to fix it, but there was no communication from the hotel staff about the outage. I had to go to the front desk to ask. Also, the outage forced the cancellation of the free Mai-Tai social. I was very much looking forward to this, but it was not rescheduled, simply canceled. During the outage they didn't clean the room or provide fresh linens, either. Finally, during the outage the creatures of the jungle decided to come out to play. We found a huge roach in our shower (which we had to take by iPhone flashlight) and a small dead lizard in our entryway (inside the unit). Yuck. Make sure you take into account the $9 a day resort fee.

Adequate workout room--seven weight machines, three cardio machines. Free parking, free internet. I didn't use the hotel's laundry room. During my stay (late Dec.) most guests were seniors or families--very quiet and peaceful. Be aware that every room pays a mandatory $13-per-day activity fee--I find this practice deceptive but still consider this place a bargain.

This low-scale resort is situated on an amazing stretch of beach on the west side of the island. This beach had everything we could have asked for, from sunrise and sunset walks to snorkeling, swimming, and body surfing (depending on the wave action). And when we wanted something less challenging than the surf, the hotel pool was perfect. Our studio room with a full kitchen was on the second floor of one of the two story buildings overlooking the pool - close enough to allow our teenage girls to spend time in the pool by themselves. The kitchen was a \"must\" for us and it was stocked with all of the essentials for cooking and baking - other than food which we supplied from the Safeway store in Lahaina. Service was absolutely excellent. Sheets for the sofa bed were delivered within minutes of the request, as were towels. Housekeeping left our room spotless every day. Parking was convenient to our room and the mix of condo owners and guests was appreciated. The pool was never swamped and guests never too loud. There were many activities close by, including shopping in Lahaina, golf, horseback riding, ziplining, whale watching tours, surfing, hiking, etc. And for die-hard Starbucks fans, there is a location about 10 minutes down the road (I'll admit to a run or two in our 10 day stay). The location is just minutes from an array of activities to suit different tastes. But somehow, we found ourselves just relaxing in the comfy chairs on the lanai.

If you are looking for multiple on-site restaurants and bars, yoga on the beach, kids clubs, and water sports...maybe this isn't the place for you.

I can not emphasize enough how much of a difference that made. The room was BEAUTIFUL, all newly remodeled with a giant walk in shower and multiple shower heads. There were two LCD large screen TV's, all the lighting dimmable, granite counters, luxorious kitchen and two double sliding doors that opened to a private lanai. We were a 10 second walk from the pool, 15 seconds to the restaurant and a full 30 seconds to get to the beach! No stairs, elevators or hallways. Just open the door and you're there. The beach is wonderful and feels very private. No crowds and lots of familys. Our 14 month old had a great time and I always felt she was very safe. You can rent anything, like paddle boards, snorkel gear, boogie boards, right there on the beach. The staff was quick and helpful as we needed a crib, high chair and a repair to the screen door.

I could go on and on, but I'll leave it with this... on Maui, this is our new \"place to stay\"!

This place is wonderful! I stayed in the Banyan building, which I prefer over a high rise hotel. It is only two stories, had a full kitchen, and a large balcony with a breathtaking view of the pool area and garden. It saves you a lot of money to forgo the ocean view. And you are still very very close to the beach. It was so quiet in this location, because it is a back from the beach and the larger pool. It has a pool and hot tub right there too. It was updated and beautiful. The room had granite counter tops in the kitchen, completely modern and clean like any of the best hotels I have been in. I am very picky about lodging. I like to stay in a place that feels luxurious and this place fit the bill. I felt so comfortable and pampered. And the price was amazing!! Check the hotel website for specials. Also when you check in, ask for an updated room. If you don't like the room they give you, go ask for a different room. We got lucky and the first room we were assigned was a dream! All I was expecting was a one bedroom and we actually got a loft with a bedroom and full bath upstairs, and a small bedroom and full bath down stairs. It was great to each have our own bathroom. All the construction on the lobby was complete by the time I got there, and it looks beautiful. The gift shop was newly opened and had great prices on souvenirs. You can pick up many great trinkets to bring back for gifts, for under 4 dollars; calendars, mini tikis, hair flower clips....we were surprised at how low the prices were. The beach there is beautiful, and the hotel restaurant is right at the edge of the beach, and the food is great. You will be so happy if you stay here. It is a great value, and so perfect! the grounds are immaculate too. It has a very nice relaxed feel, and many tall swaying palm trees to make you really feel like you are in the tropics! We went to the \"Drums of the Pacific\" Lu'au at the Hyatt. I highly recommend this one. And be sure to get a VIP ticket, it costs a little more but you get a front row seat and first in line at the buffet. This lu'au is really well done. Also, don't miss \"Warren and Annabelle's Magic show\" !!! Even if you don't like magic shows, it does not matter-- GO SEE THIS SHOW YOU WILL LOVE IT! This is a really funny and entertaining show, and be sure to get the \"Royal Flush\" package, that includes the most amazing drinks, food and dessert!! you will not be able to eat it all, but you will want to! Please be sure to book your tickets in advance on their website, because it sells out a week in advance, and believe me, you don't want to miss this incredible show! I am still smiling just thinking about it. We also took an afternoon boat to snorkel at Molokini on, \"the Pride of Maui\" and it was so fun. Only a 3.5 hour trip so not too long, which is good for me since I don't like to be on a boat all day. Plus it there were only about 21 of us on a large boat so plenty of room and the food was fresh, grilled burgers, veggie burgers, hot dogs and all you can drink, beer, tropical drinks, you name it ! and the cost was only about 40 dollars. The crew was really nice, and you can rent any equipment you need right on the boat. We thought it was a great deal, we went to Molokini. Saw lots of pretty colorful fish.

The hotel was convenient to everything. They even have a trolley that runs to the shopping center and other hotels. There is also a great walking path that runs along the beach and connects to many of the other hotels.

Everytime we came back from the beach our room was spotless! Dishes were in the washer, beds were made and everything tidy. The pool was perfect. Loved the kiddy pool area for our 14 month old. The hot tub was just right in the evenings. Even though we were told the hotel was filled to capacity it never felt crowded. The beach was BEAUTIFUL. When we compared it to the other side of Kaanapali, it was waaaay less crowded and the water was calmer. NO rocks, just super soft sand. My husband said the snorkeling to the right was better than black rock. Less crowded and calmer water. He also saw more fish. Yes the hotel was under construction, but we were on the 6th floor and didn't see or hear a thing, except for when we had to walk by it on our way out. We requested ahead of time to be as far away from the construction as possible. We were offered a one bedroom in the towers, or a loft style room in the villas. The villas would be wonderfull, except that we wanted the privacy of a 1 bedroom. Defiantely stay in the villas if you don't want to be near the construction. I can't wait to see it when it is all done. Not having an actual lobby didn't affect our trip one bit. Yes, the rooms are a little dated. Our room had glass EVERYTHING, glass coffee table, kitchen table, end tables, not too safe for our 14 month old. We were never in the room so it really wasn't a problem for us. We had a 1 bedroom ocean view unit. The view was amazing and the room had plenty of space. My mom slept on the hide-a-bed and it was quite lumpy, but they all are. The restaraunt, Castaways, was hit or miss. Somethings were great, others not so much. The bartenders seem to ignore you a little bit unless you were a regular. This was our only real complaint. We just had to be more persistent. The prices were pretty decent. One thing that bothered us was that only somethings were available at certain times of the day on the menu. Like Pupus, and other items. They wouldn't make any exceptions. We saw people leave and not order anything due to the inconvenience. Overall a great place! Definately the best bang for your buck! We visited the Hyatt and other pricey gorgeous places. Not worth the price and crowds to us.

The staff of the hotel was very friendly and always asked if we were having a nice stay, was there anything they could get for us, etc. We booked an \"ocean view\" room, which meant in the high rise part of the property, as opposed to the low-rise units. Given that our view was partially obstructed by palm trees, I would have rather have had a low-rise room with a pool view, than be in the high rise, which was louder and generally less attractive than the low rise units. Definitely go for a low-rise unit if you can, even at the expense of the view. After all, when in Hawaii you don't spend a lot of time sitting in your hotel room staring at the view... The hotel has a very nice pool, suitable for all ages and is located on an excellent stretch of beach. From the hotel you can see Molokai, Lanai, and even Oahu in the distance.

MKV assigned our room 3rd floor in tower. I did ask to see 2 others in the Emerald and Banyan buildings but ultimately we decided on this one. It is true that every room varies in amenities and some have not been renovated in a few decades. I saw one such room in the Emerald Building with an ocean view that definitely was not presentable in my opinion and I was surprised they even let us view it. Nonetheless, our 3rd floor room was independently owned but for sale and managed by Aston. Very clean, spacious and beds (even the king pull out sofa) were very comfortable. Lobby construction was nearby but never did we hear noise as most of it is interior work at this point. Only downside was no lanai in the tower rooms except the 1st floor. $13.50 per day resort fee covered parking/gym(which is very small) and internet. This property is located on a perfect, quieter stretch of Kaanapali beach with snorkeling just north that is superb! Walk past the beach park a short distance and there is great sea life to explore. Take the walking path to Duke's Beach House to the north or toward Black Rock to Hula Grill south. Two great places to eat and enjoy. The Castaways was great for breakfast - the banana pancakes are delicious. Sunsets are fantastic from the property - take your camera and drinks for viewing every night from the lawn chairs next to the beach. Splurge on a dinner to remember at Mama's Fish House in Paia - it's a dining experience. Take your car north to Slaughterhouse beach to boogie board - the waves are intense! Several others in and around Napili and Kapalua are great for snorkeling or swimming. Get the Maui Revealed book as a guide. It's a great resource for new adventures. This was our 3rd stay at MKV and we'll be back again. We like the smaller scale (vs the larger hotel properties) and though it is older, it is beautiful with well maintained grounds.

From the moment Gwen and Rudy at the front desk checked us in we knew we were in for a treat. Everyone was so friendly and laid back. We were also given a bottle of champagne for our anniversary trip which was a nice touch. The hotel consists of several small two story buildings and a larger 6 story \"aloha tower\". The smaller buildings were well spread out giving the hotel the feel of an old Hawaii. We stayed in one of the small buildings ...the Banyan Building. Our room was studio 124 and it was beautiful. We had a full well stocked kitchen with new full sized appliances, granite counter tops and maple cabinets. Everything in the bedroom appeared to have been updated from the carpet to the new lcd TV. The bathroom was tiled and had corrian counters. The shower bottom was tiled to look like you were standing on river / beach rocks. Really cool. While we had only a garden view studio, our lanai opened up to a patio and a 10'x20' grassy area partially surrounded by thick shrubs. This was great for a relaxing private morning breakfast. The grounds were immaculate. You could tell that the gardeners took great pride in their work. Every shrub was trimmed and there were rarely ever loose leaves to be seen. The grass between all the units was like a green carpet. It was so thick and felt great on bare feet. The two resort swimming pools though small by Kaanapali standards, were always clean, never felt crowded and there were always plenty of lounge chairs to be had. The grounds also had several gas BBQ stations that we all beautiful high-end BBQs built into granite counters. We utilized these a couple of times to grill steaks and ahi tuna for quiet dinners on the lanai. The restaurant on the grounds was a good value for your dollars. We had a couple of meals there and found that they were best for breakfast. It was really nice to have breakfast just a few short meters from the beach. The resort is also a hub for the Kaanapali trolley which is a free bus (often driven by Rudy from the front desk). This bus will take you to the Whalers village and other nearby resorts and restaurants which is nice if you want to have a few cocktails and leave the rental car behind. My only complaints are as follows: 1. The process for getting beach towels needs to be a bit more streamlined when you first check in. 2. The construction going for for improvements to the aloha tower was loud at times but since we weren't actually in the tower this wasn't that big of a deal for us.

The problem was the staff and the cleanliness of the room. My daughter dropped popcorn on the floor one night and it was still there 4 days after (after 4 cleanings by the cleaning lady). I killed a large cochroach in our room and made a splatter on the bathroom floor. The cochroach splatter was there on the June 21st, 2010 and was still there when we left on June 26th, 2010 (its probably still there). The pool is supposed to open at 8:00 am. On our last day we went to the pool at 8:45 but the pool guy was still cleaning the pool. I nicely asked the pool guy when he would be finished and he gave me a pissed off look and said it would be done when it was done. We have kids so we can't wait around in the heat forever. 20 mins later my wife decided to ask the pool guy and he rudely said to her \"i don't know\" and went back to his work. How could he not know - he cleans the pool everyday. When we told the front desk about the incident, the lady there did not seem to care at all (she did not write anything down or say that she would advise the manager or someone else). On another occassion my wife had to feed our baby and went back to the room. As my wife was entering the room the cleaning lady told her that she was just going to go in and clean up our room. My wife asked the cleaning lady if she could come back. My wife said the cleaning lady gave her a look like she wanted to kill her and turned around without saying anything and walked off. We never had our room cleaned that day. The front desk was very rude also. They have a rack of clean towels right in front of them - I am not sure why because everytime we asked them for towels they acted pissed off and said that guests were not supposed to get towels from the front desk and that that was the job of the cleaning ladies. The only place where the staff was really pleasant on the grounds was at the restaurant on the grounds called Castaways. One more bad thing about the hotel - the gym looks like its someones basement gym - the equipment is old and dirty and they have no dumbells (at least not past 15 pound and they only have one 15 pound dumbell) or barbells.

Huge bathroom lined with mirrors with excellent lighting. Prices were around $140 per night less than the hotel hosting the event I attended. Floors in the Aloha tower from 3rd-6th have rudimentary balconies but you can open the glass doors and put your front legs of the chair out. Still a very lovely sitting area even though you can't actually sit on the balcony. Ask for a quiet room and you won't be put too near the highway which runs next to the ends of the wings of the Aloha Tower. This is a quiet resort, not a party-style place with loud rowdy drunks. Ocean Side rooms have a substantial lanai or patio although they are only 1-2 floors in the two bldgs nearest the ocean (with pool/garden view). The restaurant was nice and service laid back. Sit at the most remote table by the beach outside and watch the wall geckos. Great snorkeling up the beach north (short walk on the beachwalk path) and you can walk though the resort area on the beach walk from this hotel through the south end of kaanapali beach, although it is easy to lose the path as it goes through the Sheraton hotel that is built on the Black Rock. Grounds are pretty and parking was pretty easy. $12.50 resort fee covers parking, phone calls, and internet ($25 per day at the fancier resorts). Staff were very pleasant with one exception and not a terrible one (guy just seems too tired to move from his position leaning on the front counter to accomodate customer requests).

Our travel agent had been before and said the place was good and the location was amazing. But before booking I read about 400 of these reviews and found many good ones but a few really bad ones which made me a little nervous. However we booked and now I am glad we did! Its true what people say, this location is the best. The beach, Kanapali Beach, here is white sand and clear ocean water. Almost never rainy or too windy you can enjoy the hotel property everyday. There is amazing snorkeling to the left on the beach about a 5-10 minute walk. There are three pools on the property and one restaurant which is not cheap but has great food. There is a general store which again not as cheap as going to one of the many ABC stores in town but has almost anything you need if stuck. There is also an amazing activities desk in the lobby which is free. The lady that served us was Dawn, we told her what we wanted to do and she booked it all for us that day, we paid right there and she wrote our a plan for us and then we just showed up for the events we booked; Easy! The room we had was 226 in the Banyan building. This room was clean, fully furnished and newly renovated, with a king bed. and safe. All of the things that we had requested a week prior to arriving. I do recommend doing this as it seemed the only way to avoid being one of those people that had a poor experience. I guess the rooms are privately owned so some are up to date and others are not as well maintained. The room was large and air conditioned and quiet, the bathroom was also large. All tile flooring and no frills decor but really you do not spend much time there and its nice to spend the extra money on adventure, food and shopping. Although if you get a condo which we did you can buy groceries at the Safeway down the road (5 minute drive) and save. Bring a cooler so you can take snacks or lunch out with you. We went to Lahaina most of our days for dinner and a stroll down Front street where you can shop, dine, enjoy ice cream and the view. There is an old courthouse, prison, and Banyan tree in town (all sites to see). There is beach walk access at the hotel that takes you by all the other resorts so you can check out other locations and beaches. The cleaning service take out garbage, makes the bed, and puts in clean towels daily but not much else. There are beach towels that are given to you at your arrival. There is a 20 dollars hold for each towel on your card but it is removed when you return your towel at departure. As well, there is a 12 dollar daily charge that for a week added up to 87 dollars US for us. This charge is to cover your parking, high speed internet access and gym access. A lot of people who wrote reviews were upset about this charge because I think it was a surprise for them at checking out but if you are aware of it now and take it into consideration when booking and adding up your total cost you will avoid this upset. We didn't use internet or the gym so it was basically 12 dollar a night for parking. This location is 45 mins from Airport, 30 mins from Maui Ocean Center, 2 hour drive to top of Haleakala Volcano, 3 drive to Hana (full day for the entire trip including stops) 1 hour drive to Ziplining, 1 hour to Macys and more shopping, 15 minutes to Whalers Village which has high end shopping such as Louis Vuitton etc.,short drive to Lahaina Town and many many beaches.

The location of the hotel was absolutely fantastic. We were less than five minutes from the main portion of Ka'anapali Beach and Whalers' Village, and the beach in front of the hotel is outstanding. It is not nearly as crowded -- you could have 50 feet on either side of you to yourself -- as Ka'anapali, and the water is crystal clear. There are no rocks or other impediments to hinder going in the water like on many Hawaiian beaches, and there is good snorkeling about 50 yards to the right of the main beach access from the hotel. The hotel rents beach chairs and lounge chairs to sit directly on the beach, but we preferred to use the free lounge chairs on the grass that overlooks the beach. It was almost the best of both worlds... no sand to get all over us unless we wanted to walk or go in the water, and a perfect view of the Pacific along with Lana'i and Moloka'i. There is plenty of shade from palm and mesquite trees, as well as late afternoon shade that comes from the buildings. The pool is also close to the beach, although we didn't spend time there. Castaway's Cafe is located by the beach and pool, and while we didn't eat there, the prices on the menu were very reasonable by Maui standards. We did enjoy Happy Hour there ($2 draft beers, $$ off mixed and frozen drinks), and it had a good atmosphere. The staff was extremely kind and helpful at the hotel. The front desk was able to check us in even though we arrived at 10 a.m., and the staff elsewhere was equally as nice. If you are staying at this hotel and arriving on Maui from another island (particularly O'ahu), consider taking an Island Air flight into the Kapalua airport. It is less than 10 minutes from the hotel, and the rest of Kapalua or Ka'anapali for that matter, and flights are only about $20 more. A cab to the hotel was $12, and we were able to take a day of car rental off since there is a free trolley from the hotel to other places in the area. There are plenty of car rental places within an easy half-mile walk of the hotel to pick up from in the morning. The hotel is 10-15 minutes from both Napili, Kapalua and Lahaina, which made it convenient for going either way. It took us about 45-50 minutes to get Kiehi on the South Shore. Ka'anapali Villas also has a small 'general store,' although the prices are very high. We preferred to get some small staples at a nearby grocery store (there are a few in Kahana and Napili to choose from). We did use the coin-operated laundry facility, which was $2.25 for a washer (a large one) and $1 for the dryer. Nice facility with plenty of machines. Also, they have free hi-speed internet in the rooms. We booked this as part of a package, and we couldn't have been happier with the hotel and the value. From walking around some other hotels in the Ka'anapali area, it looked like we got very similar amenities on a nicer part of the beach for a better price. We'll definitely go back.", "Date": "July 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "bc", "Title": "\u201cgreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "arev2", "ReviewID": "UR33708267", "Content": "My Husband myself and daughter stayed for 10 daysat the kaanapali resort.

The staff is friendly and helpful but not intrusive. The grounds are immaculate. Parking is easy and plentiful. On site store is well stocked. On site restraaunt is good and not too expensive ($10 for a burger and fries that will cost about the same at Carl's on Maui). An activities director is available to assist with planning, but you can get better deals shopping around. Beware that the lowest priced deals come with a manditory timeshare presentation. You can horseback ride a few miles away, snorkle on the beach (gear is cheap), or travel north or south a few miles to clear water sandy beaches. The boats to Molikini are 30 minutes away. The \"Quicksilver\" is the absolute best 5-hour trip there. Parasailing is a few miles away. You will not regret doing this one activity if you do nothing else. A good Luau is right next door at the Royal Kaanapali. The room we stayed in was on the 4th floor of the main tower. We had a partial ocean view, but a relaxing view of the quiet gardens below. The pool is big and clean. The spa is small but refreshing. Literally steps from the beach which is sandy and clean. Our room was one bedroom deluxe with a full kitchen. The beds were in a separate room apart form the living/dining area. Clean with plenty of furniture and 2 TV's. The kitchen was fully equipped which allowed us to cook in all week. Free in-room coffee, but Starbucks is just 3 miles away at Cannery Mall. There is also a Safeway there, but we stopped at Costco just outside the airport to stock up on food. If you go to BJ's, one 4-slice pizza will set you back $24 not including a drink. $125 spent at Costco will feed 4 for a week. Cook your own food and save a ton of money for all the fun island activities that are available. Or go to the Hyatt, spend $400-500 a night on your room and enjoy your ocean view. You won't be able to afford anything else.... Cons: This is a timeshare property, so each room is different in size and features. Read the individual descriptions carefully before booking. If there are rooms available, free upgrades are the norm. Just ask. Many owners \"rent directly\" but there are deposits, etc. Booking directly is easier in my opinion. Tips: Rent a car. It is easier to get all over the island and will save you time and money.

Oceanside room (what I booked, and the most expensive option) has no ocean view, and is hundreds of feet from the actual ocean side. Management plays word games with conventional definitions of \"ocean side\" and \"ocean view\". I guess technically anywhere on the island you are \"ocean side\".

There's only one little restaurant that's overpriced. Avoid getting a meal near the closing time of 8:50pm, because the quality is pathetic. At every turn there are reminder notes posted. No shoes inside your room - keep screen doors closed at all times - don't use the bed as a couch - don't move any furniture - no snorkels in the pool - no, no, no, no!

The lady at reception insisted that we take a unit on the top floor of the six story tower building and told us that all units were garden view or ocean view.

Five tramatic minutes later I left empty handed. It's a shame that during these tough economic times some folks still don't get it. The problem here is simply a failure to communicate. The property managers, tour operators, travel agents, and condo owners don't seem to be coordinating their efforts and this causes a lot of confusion for travelers like us.

She suggested the Kaanapali Villas (we wanted Kaanapali over Kihei). I checked out the reviews here and they were up and down...but mostly ok. We booked our 9 night stay in a 1 bedroom \"garden view\" for our March trip. When we arrived, check in was easy, quick and courteous. Our first impression of our room was good - it was clean, spacious, bright. Lots of room to spread out. There were 2 queen beds in the \"bedroom\" and then a pull out sofa in the living room (which was actually quite comfortable). The \"bedroom\" was more like an extension of the living room as there was one of those foldout \"walls' that we just used to divide up the room, but it worked well and there was enough privacy. The kitchen was spotless and new. Well equipped for dishes/cutlery/pots/pans. I felt that it could've been better equipped for condiments, or have the abilty to pre-order these in small amounts. There was salt and pepper, and a small \"starter kit\" for tea/coffee and sugar - but these only had a couple of individual sugar packets, a couple of teabags and a single coffee packet. I dont' mind coffee/tea, but I felt sugar should've been provided, and possibly even things like butter, ketchup etc...things that you don't use very often but still would like/need if you're cooking etc. Our garden view was very nice - and we actually could see the ocean from our room. My other slight disappointment was that our lanai wasn't really a lanai...it wasn't large enough to put our chairs out there and sit. It was basically wide enough to stand on and that was it. Calling it a lanai was a stretch. However, because both the living room and the bedroom had very large sliding glass doors, it basically made the condo have one side completely open, we just slide our chairs so the front legs were on the \"lanai\" and the back legs were on carpet. The location is perfect - low key and away from the huge expensive resorts south of Black Rock, yet right on a perfect beach with great snorkeling *right* there. It was an easy drive down to south of Black Rock, or you could take the complimentary trolley that ran often. You could also walk to south Black Rock by using the paths through the neighbouring resorts (Royal Lahaina, Eldorado and Sheraton). There was also a great beach boardwalk that ran north of the condo. The main pool is wonderful...I understand they just renovated it and it's great. Has a neat bridge over it, with \"waterfalls\" and a nice shallow kids area (that for some reason was cooler than the main pool). The restaurant there - Castaway Cafe - was good. We had 2 dinners there and both meals were pretty good. Not outstanding, but fine. Breakfast was nice, particularly since we ate outside and had a great view of the ocean and whales! The Westin next door (I think it's a timeshare) had a nice little bar and grill that we walked to as well to eat. The grounds were immaculate. Lovely lawns and gardens. Every morning there was staff out cleaning up fallen leaves or flowers. I thought it was lovely, particularly after reading a review or two here saying that it needed some TLC. Not anymore! I found the whole complex great. I would definitely recommend this place to stay...it's low key, good price, good beach/snorkeling, good base for exploring Maui!", "Date": "March 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cHidden treasure\u201d", "Author": "godswill2005", "ReviewID": "UR25194776", "Content": "Hotel is on the best beach in Maui.

I had found this location through trip advisor. Thanks to all of those who helped me with enough information to select this location. Our initial request was for two studio condo's with a garden view. We also had asked for our condo's to be next to one another. I had read a few frightening stories about the rooms and braced myself upon check in. To my surprise we ended getting two rooms in the main bldg (aloha tower) #601 and #602 . We asked the gentlemen at the front desk if we could see the rooms first, before checking in and they were okay with it. The two units appeared to be remodeled. In fact, they were one bedrooms. These rooms could definitely accomodate a party of 6-8 comfortably. Both units were very clean. Someone came to clean the room everyday in the afternoon. There is a nice size pool next to the restaurant Castaway, which has a kid pool (1 1/2 feet of water). Connected to the kid pool is a larger pool, which gets to about 7 feet of water. There is also an adult pool on the other side of the Aloha Tower which is nice, quiet, and private. The beach is very close and very scenic. It's also a short walk from the Westin. We took advantage of the full kitchen, by purchasing groceries from the Safeway. Out of the 5 nights on our stay, we ate breakfast and lunch in our room 4 days. Some items were a bit more expensive than being on the mainland, but we were prepared for this. Safeway is also affiliated with Von's, therefore you can use your Vons card or telephone number to get items at the member rate. We took the free Kaanapali shuttle to Whaler's Village for some shopping and souvenirs. My younger brother took some surfing lessons, and went parasailing. Both experiences were pretty exciting for him. I can't remember the name of the guys or company which provided the surf lessons, but i can find out for those who are interested. Thanks to a work colleauge I found this small private beach, called Baby Beach. A lot of local folks are familiar with this place. The cool thing about this beach is that the water isn't too rough and kids (with adult supervision) can feel comfortable entering the water. FYI this beach isn't just for kids. There were a few families and couples enjoying there time as well. Ask Gwen at the front desk for directions. I would definitely stay at this place again! A couple of things to note. The policy on pool towels may be a bit confusing at first. Just bring them back to front desk at the end of each day, and request new ones. Sometimes service can be a little bit slow, when requesting anything from the front desk. But it's okay, we were never in a rush. Front Street has a lot of shops, and restaurants to visit as well. I was able to order cocktails from Castaway and take them to the pool..just ask for them to be made in a plastic cup.

Sure, it's tropical and bugs are to be expected, but this was my 5th time to the islands and I've never seen a bug problem like this. The room was large but had no view of the ocean although you could see it from the lanai. We went back to the front desk and asked for a room that was in better shape or recently renovated and they gave us a couple options in the tower, but their definition of recent renovations must mean adding a new countertop in the bathroom at most or renovations that took place at least 10 years ago. Seriously. We didn't like these other rooms so they offered to show us a studio condo. We actually liked the one we were shown but didn't want to pay an extra $40/nt. So, we decided last minute to check out other properties nearby and were able to find a great unit at Kaanapali Shores for the same price as the Villas condo and actually was completely renovated, fresh & clean not to mention bug free! The Kaanapali Villas tries hard, has a nice beach and decent pool, but will probably appeal to the budget minded traveler only.", "Date": "June 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cStrong Concerns\u201d", "Author": "mdavis415", "ReviewID": "UR17267736", "Content": "This is a very nice resort.

Because of the pool renovation they wanted to move us to their sister property \"The Shores\" up the road, but we insisted on staying at the Villas because of the proximity to the beach and to the main Kaanapali Beach Walk. I have to admit, the room (a one bedroom) is in dire need of updating. It had 1980's decor. It was comfortable with actually 1 and 1/2 baths. We were only in the room to sleep, so the decor was really no big deal. The beach access is fantastic and the Castaway Cafe is always a favorite (except this trip they had a problem with Pineapple bugs). The pool is almost ready, but we didn't miss it since the beach is where we hang out. We love the beach at MKV, although it is amazing how many more people are on it since now the Westin is next door. Four years ago there was no one on the beach when you looked north. But now with the Westin Villas there are huge crowds up that direction. The MKV seems to be immuned to it, since their property is about 1/10th the size as the Westin. This is one of the reasons why we love MKV so much. There are not hords of people. One disappointment was Christmas dinner, the Villas recommended the Royal Lahania next door. The service was the worst I've ever encountered and for a meal that cost $200 for 4 people, it should have been primo. I don't know if they were short staffed or what. Our server acted like he had never waited on a table in his life... it was pathetic. We should have left. All in all we had a wonderful time at the Villas ( and three days prior at Napili).

The kitchen and bathroom were nicely upgraded (new cabinetry, full-size refrigerator, new oven, stove, and dishwasher), but the bedroom area was a little more modest. Also, the lanai off the room was just big enough to stand on. I had envisioned a larger outdoor patio, which some units have, but ours was small. It really didn't matter, but if that matters to you, you might want to call and request a room with a larger patio. Everything was clean and the staff was wonderful (extremely friendly). The beach in front of the property is by far one of the high points of this hotel. It is gorgeous, and quiet, with some of the best snorkeling reefs in West Maui! They also have a restaurant on the property, \"The Castaway Cafe\" which is located right on the ocean, and was extremely convenient. We ate many meals there (in the restaurant overlooking the ocean, and to-go to our room)... the prices are low and the food was delicious (plus, happy hour $1.50 draft beer!). While we were there, the main pools (on the beach, next to the cafe) were being completely renovated. If we had kids, that would have been a disappointment, since the other pool is not overlooking the ocean (and it's smaller). But, when they are completed, they will be a huge asset to the property. A trolley runs (for free!) from the Villas to surrounding hotels and the nearby Whaler's Village. Lahaina is only a couple miles away, which we loved (took a sunset cruise from there).

We had a wonderful time here. All the buildings, but one, are only two stories so we felt a part of our surroundings. If you are looking for something totally fancy (and very expensive) with 24 hour room service, then this isn't the place for you.

Besides, there is a small store in this hotel, so if you need something quickly, you dont have to drive 3 miles to Safeway or Longs Drugs. Now the bad things. The hotels looks very old. The lobby looks like it is breaking down. The room was better although some stuffs were pretty old like microwave oven. They are also renovating the hotel, so construction work is going on and that's why it also looked even worse. Another thing with the renovation is that for some rooms it might be very noisy if construction work is going on nearby. Check with the front desk. One more thing: wireless internet connection was very weak, actually useless. They changed my room (and also put us in different building) for that, but it improved very little.

If you are looking for more of a laid back area, I would reccommend the Kapalua and Nipili area because there is less resorts in that area and it seems to be a little more secluded from the main tourist net, however, some places may not be directly on the beach; therefore you will have to drive to get to a beach. Also, I would recommend buying groceries from a nearby store and cook some of your meals. We found that saved us a lot of money.

We upgraded for $40 a night but it was so much nicer and wonderfully decorated. Huge bathroom, huge Lanai, full kitchen, comfy bed and pullout sofa. Although there was no ocean view it was very nice and quiet. We looked at a few other rooms and it really is the luck of the draw here. I've posted some pics of the room. We were in Maui from Dec. 13th through the 20th and it was such a great time to go. Highs about 82 degrees but none of the humidity that you get at other times of the year. We both came home with dark tans for Christmas! Hardly anyone in Lahaina...never had to pay for parking once....most of the time we found parking on Front St...very rare. Went to Warren and Annabelle's on Front Street for the 5th time....best show anywhere and you get about 4 to 5 hours worth of entertainment for under $50....you gotta go! The restaurant was closed for the majority of the week when we were there...but the Royal Lahaina next door has a great Eggs Benedict. Try the $1.99 breakfast at Moose McGilicuddy's in Lahaina!", "Date": "January 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kirkland, WA", "Title": "\u201cComfortable and Accomodating!!\u201d", "Author": "LilLover", "ReviewID": "UR6151632", "Content": "My experience with this resort is within driving distance of places you want to visit such as Lahina and Napilli or down to Wailea but Maui is pretty small so really anywhere would be nice however we spent alot of of time at night in Lahina it had all the places to eat and shop and is soo cute right on the Harbor. The room we had was a one bed suite. There was a full kitchen with breakfast bar, living room, dining room, seperate bedroom and huge bathroom with walk in closets and dressing area. We arrived at night and was pleasently surprised by all the tiki torches lite thru out the grounds, it was soo romantic. Location is right on the beach which was amazing as well on the other side of black rock a popular snorkling location. There is a nice restaurant on grounds but again we went to Lahina alot but we do know there are killer Macadam. nut banana pancakes you have to try. If you are going to rent a car parking is free and we were able to get a decent spot every night around 11pm. Most likely if you the economy car you will get a Caliber because everybody had one and couple times we didn't know which one was our silver one:) Know your license plate! On your to do list should be: snorkling in Napili Bay a must! Road to Hana but not with small children its a really long and windy very dangerous at times road there. It was great to see everything and I am glad I did but there really are alot of risks you take driving along the cliffs on a one way road people:) Luckly I was able to buy a shirt that said I survived the road to Hana, you can buy them in Lahaina! Halealalikea *spelling is totally off but the big mt there to see the sunrise aka house of sun!! Maui ocean center, 20 bucks a couple hours there you can see some cool things! Maui's Northshore had some huge waves with some daring surfers Pick up some info at the airport when you get there and you will be set! The hotel even provides alot of good info too! Weather in Oct was 83 average the whole time, it was pretty hot! From here we set of to Waikiki for another 6 nights of fun. Comparing the two, we wish we did Oahu first then Maui.

The studio condo room we had was simple but sufficient. Our room (#144 in Banyon) had a full size fridge, stove, microwave, and coffee pot. There was a king size bed, wicker sofa, coffee table, and round \"dining room\" table useful for writing postcards or eating meals. The staff was efficient and friendly. They don't go out of their way to make you feel like a celebrity, but they all do their jobs very well to ensure you enjoy your vacation. There are two swimming pools, one close to the bar/resteraunt and beach, and one further back near the rear condo rooms. We used neither -- you're in Maui, on Ka'anapali Beach, ENJOY IT!!! The beach was suprisingly not crowded at all. I'd say on average it was one blanket of people every 50 feet or so. On the other side of Black Rock where the Sheraton is, it is WAY more crowded and noisy. We were very thankful the MKV was on the other side! But if you want more action, a little shopping, any watersports, or maybe just some more sightseeing, take a walk over to the Sheraton side. The grounds are very well maintained, everything is very clean (albeit a bit old, the resort was built in the 70's), and the resteraunt did just fine with its breakfast. I marked the lobby with a red dot and the resteraunt with a green dot on the attached map. Parking was all around the resort, and we never had a problem with that, although our room was toward the back of the resort so we took advantage of the further away spots anyway. Also, parking technically is free. It's included in that $9 per day resort fee along with the telephone and whatever else. Even if you have no car, and dont use the phone, you WILL be charged that. The only thing you can knock off is the safe for an extra $2 or so, but you will pay the $9 for sure. The rooms and resort are nice and quiet, we never heard anything through the walls (although it was our honeymoon, so maybe they heard us?!). The previous poster was right about the headboard being noisy if the bed moves a bit, but just jam a towel or shirt behind it and that'll fix the problem. But we were very close to the street and never heard any cars. In fact, we slept great every single night. There has been some conflicting reports about the internet. The real info is this: They have FREE wireless internet which supposedly spans the entire resort. We ran into a little trouble connecting in our room, but were able to use it fine (on the laptop we brought with us) in the lobby and other areas. The fee based internet some people mention is if you use their computers in the library. We obviously didn't do that. On a related note, I HIGHLY recommend bringing a laptop with you. It allows you to plan out some of your trip while you're there, look for resteraunt reviews before going out to eat, and download your digital pictures to the computer every night to clear room for more! The MKV has a free trolly that brings you to Whaler's Village - a great little shopping area. It seems like all of the Ka'anapali Beach area resorts are umbrella'd together with similar signs, trolly service, and roads. MKV is only a 2 minute drive down to Lahaina, a great area for dinners, shows, and shopping. If you drive into there, and dont want to pay for parking, there is a fairly unknown lot that allows free unlimited parking on a small one way street parallel to front st, behind the Lahina Store Grill. It's listed in Maui Revealed, but it's still not as popular as it should be. We only ate in the resteraunt for breakfast once, but it was very nice. The view is pretty terriffic right on the beach, and the food was typical of breakfast anywhere else. We usually ate breakfast in our room, which saved about $25 a day.

Our room was fairly nice, with 2 sliding-glass doors, one on each side of the room, creating a great cross-breeze. The air conditioning was very noisy, but cooled nicely. Our room (#523) was very close to the highway, and there was a lot of traffic noise. Earplugs are a definite recommendation if you want to get some good sleep. The room was nicely sized, with a big dressing area and 2 closets. The headboard was not attached to the bed or the wall, and would constantly bang against the wall. I put a towel behind it to prevent it banging, and had to keep pushing the bed against it to secure it. I found the staff friendly and helpful. Beach towels require a $20 deposit each, but this is returned upon return of the towel. Parking is a definite problem here. There is an almost $10 per night charge for parking, but finding a space close to the hotel is a challenge if you are trying to park after 3 p.m. It is required to have your parking permit in your front window, and even on doing this, we received a written warning from the security guard because he didn't see it! (It was not hanging from the mirror, but off to the side of the front window). Many nights we ended up parking in a back parking lot quite a distance from the room. Parking was such a problem we considered just parking the car in the morning and taking the trolley shuttle to shopping facilities in Lahaina. On-site laundry facilities and gym are nice. The Castaway cafe on the premises is nice, and the staff friendly. Dinner was overpriced and just average quality, but breakfast was a good value. I found the $15 per hour charge for use of the computer/Internet to be ridiculous! Many hotels offer this service for free. The beach is very nice with a nice paved path. There was a refrigerator and coffee maker in the room, as well as an iron and ironing board. Maid service was very good.

We absolutely loved it. We stayed in Maui from the 12th-20th then Kauai from the 20th-26th. Our stay at the Kaanapali Villas was a very good experience. Upon check in I asked if there were any upgrades available for us and the gave us an ocean view condo. Like many reviews before just because it says ocean view it doesn't mean the waves will be crashing into the beach right in front of you. We stayed in room 517 and the room had no lanai. We would have like to have one but we dealt perfectly fine without it. The room itself was in perfect condition. King size bed, couch, dining room table, 2 sinks in the bathroom, large closet and a spacious shower. We even had a full kitchen with a microwave, big refrigerator, oven, coffee maker etc.. Our TV came with a VCR and a DVD player. Maybe we got lucky compared to other people but it seems like your best bet is to get a condo instead of the hotel room itself. Most of the complaints I read were from people staying in the hotel room instead of the condos. We also did not have any problem with the front desk people. When we asked for towels, soap, directions whatever they were always willing to help us. Never did we get a nasty look or no help from anyone. Even the maid service people were nice. But be careful when staying here in a condo. You will not get the normal treatment like you would at a hotel room. They will make your bed, vacuum your room and throw out the trash. They will not change your sheets, and give you extra coffee and toiletries. We had to ask for them and when we did we got them. Parking was also never a problem for us. Most of the time we got one of the prime spots right near the back entrance by the elevators. And if we didn't get one we never had to park in the street or very far from where we went in. We also had wireless internet in our room. We never had to pay for the internet on our laptop. This was very helpful in looking up directions, excursions and checking the weather. If your use to staying in 5 star resorts and expecting world class resort activities then this isn't the place for you. If your looking for something affordable, nice and clean this place is perfect for you. The beach area was right near the hotel itself. The beach was nice and it definitely wasn't as crowded as you will find near the Sheraton and Black Rock. But if you wanna snorkel definitely go to Black Rock. All kinds of fish to see there and it's a nice walk from the hotel to that area. We had more fun there then we did at Molakini. Maybe we went on a bad day but Molakini wasn't worth the money. We saw 3 times more fish at black rock then Molakini. Only saw 1 turtle at turtle town. The castaway cafe had very good food and the service was excellent. We loved being able to eat outside right by the ocean. Of the 6 meals we ate there in a week we never had a bad meal. My wife and I don't really drink so we can't help with the happy hour bar thing. The one complaint that I did have about the hotel would definitely be the resort fee. We paid $9.37 a day for this. They also charged us $2.60 a day for the safe but we didn't use it and they took the charge off for us. We ended up paying $75 in resort fees for 8 nights. They should just include this but they don't. We knew about this charge before we booked it so we can't really complain. Oh, the other thing we would have liked to see would be grills on the premises. A lot of the other resorts had grills that people could use to cook stuff on their own. They have plans to add grills and BBQ areas but it's not done yet. Make sure you return your towels to the front desk. They will charge you $20 per towel if you don't return it. And yes Maui is a tourist island. But we liked the fact we could sit on the beach near our hotel and relax or walk to the Whaler's village or drive to front street to shop and hang out. If your looking for a less tourist place go to Kauai instead. Make sure when reading these reviews you take the good and the bad and equal them out. Some people had good experiences and some have bad ones. I personally would recommend this hotel. Even though we had a very nice room we also didn't spend much time in it. We were in Hawaii to have fun and experience everything we could. The last thing I wanted to do was spend more time in my room then I had to. Why would I spend all that money to stay in the Sheraton or some other really nice hotel when I was never in the room or at the pool? Doesn't make much sense. If you want to stay at your hotel the whole time in Maui then stay at the Sheraton. They had a beautiful pool area and bar right by the beach. But we would rather save money and use that for other tours and meals. We also traveled to Wailea to check that out. I played at the gold course and it was beautiful. I played Kapalua plantation and Kannapali south as well and I thought Wailea was better then both. Kapalua was nice but the weather is not very good and it's very windy. It rains like 240 inches a year in Kapaula and it was always cloudy there. The area of Wailea is gorgeous. If money is no object then stay there. Plenty of expensive shops and very nice beaches. If you can afford the Grand Wailea and you don't mind staying in the resort area the whole time stay there. We plan on going back to Hawaii in a couple of years.

However, skip the happy hours..the drinks are only a $1 less and watered down. Better to hit happy hour at Aloha Mixed plate on Front Street.

The room that we stayed in - one of the condo villa rooms - was a complete disappointment. The carpet was old and stained. The bed seemed old and the mattress was uncomfortable. We also believe that the bed had bed bugs.

The privately owned condo we stayed in was immaculate and featured a full well stocked kitchen. The maid service (sparked by a little first day gratuity) was very good. The beach in front of the resort was coral free and was excellent for swimming, sunbathing and relaxing. A couple hundred yards south lies the famous Black Rock snorkeling area but just 50 or so yards to the north is some coral formations that provide a very easy snorkeling sight that's home to more than a few sea turtles and a wide variety of fish. The on-site restaurant \"Castaway Cafe\" had good food at a little above average prices but truly excellent service. Try sitting at it's poolside bar (full menu) at sunset for some great views while eating. Make friends with the bartender and then count on good service at each visit. Other eating out options can be found at Whaler's Village about a 5 minute drive south. Another 10 minutes down is Front Street. Both locations are full of shops, restaurants and tourists. The only drawbacks to our stay were the \"nickel & dime\" fees ($100.00 + in phone fees, parking and in-room safe access for a 7 day stay) and a typically overpiced gift/sundry shop. Also the landscaping was somewhat less spectacular than I saw at pricier resorts. The resort itself sits in midst of a seemingly endless string of other resorts, hotels and retail establishments. You'll need to drive bit to see the true Maui. Also, don't assume ocean side or ocean view means you'll have the waves lapping at your lanai.

We booked an ocean sideview room with a king sized bed in the Dolphin Building and requested a second floor unit if possible. Upon arriving, we were informed that the owners of these units were occupying them and that all that was available were first story units further back from the ocean. When we requested something a little closer to the ocean we were essentially advised that this was the best they had. After reluctantly accepting the keys, we were apprised of the various fees for use of the safe, phone and parking lot and a fire and brimstone speech about the perils of losing the rationed out beach towels.

I was additionally bowled over by the intense heat and the fact that our \"king sized\" bed was a queen sized Murphy bed that you had to pull out of the wall. To the front desk's credit, after calling the front desk regarding the non functioning air conditioning and insect problem,they sent staff quite quickly to remedy the problem. The gentleman who fixed the A/C problem advised that the A/C mechanism connected to the lanai sliding doors had been disconnected (no doubt by the greedy and lazy owners)and proceeded to fix it. The staff who came to remedy the bug problem merely sprayed the entire counter surface (where we would presumably cook our meals) with Raid and left without cleaning the dead ants off the counter. Although, a non smoking room I found it ironic that the owners would be so intolerant of tobacco smoke and yet allow the stench of animal urine and fur to permeate their \"home\". I would not have minded the non functioning A/C as I realize this is the tropics, however, my wife and I are both allergic and asthmatic and required some ventilation and relief from the animal smells. Regarding the ants, sorry folks. There's no excuse for this in light of the money we paid for the room. If I didn't mind bugs, I'd go camping. I've spent many vacations in the tropics and have never had to contend with bugs. Also, upon examining the bottoms of our bare feet, we observed them to be black with filth and whatever dirt had been left by housekeeping. After calling the desk again to please assist us with finding a cleaner unit for us, they advised that they \"may have another similar unit tomorrow\" but could not make any promises.

The following day, after a sleepless night in the small uncomfortable bed, sub par breakfast at that glorified greasy spoon Castaways and a dip in the paint chipped swimming pool, we decided to call our travel agent to clarify the terms of our booking agreement.

Prior to doing so, I consulted the Maui Revealed book (the Blue Bible) and decided to call Kahana Village a mile up the road (see my review for this \"Real Gem\").

We booked our trip through Expedia and reserved a Deluxe Garden View room. The grounds are quite lovely and well maintained. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our condo was located in the Banyon building. This building overlooks the long drivewayand other buildings. It was not a bad view. Our lanai was not large but it was more than adequate and had a table with 4 chairs. A strip of lawn and pretty hedges act as a buffer between the road and our room. We stayed in room 126 (a deluxe studio garden view room) and found it to be very clean and spacious. I loved the bathroom area. The large dressing area contains a roomy closet with mirrored doors and has a spacious counter and sink area. The toilet and shower are separate which is great--while one showers the other(s) can dress, style their hair, iron, or whatever. The kitchen area was adequately equipped and the main living area was roomy. It contained a queen size bed (the mattress was okay...not the best and not the worst); a large sofa bed (we didn't sleep on it but it was comfortable to sit on), a dresser, a hutch with a large t.v., a nice dining set, and a coffee table. The carpeting was in good condition, and the walls look like they'd been recently painted. We slept well each night and the 10:00 quiet rule is definitely enforced. We were not able to hear our neighbors next door, although, you can hear people talking outside as they walk by the rooms due to a screened window vent near the door. It's a great place for families, those who are looking for peace and relaxation, retirees, or those who are simply looking for a clean, quiet, and affordable condo. The beach in front of the villas is one of the best on the island. It has a great snorkeling area too. We booked a snoreling tour to Molokini and Lanai and weren't too impressed...in fact, we saw more fish, turtles, and coral in the reef area in front of this lovely and uncrowded beach. The restaurant overlooks beach and ocean and we found the food to be quite good. The pool areas are very nice (they even offer free scuba lessons) and the pool near our building was rarely used so we enjoyed having it all to ourselves most of the time. These condos are privately owned so each one is decorated and equipped differently. We were happy with ours and we were very impressed with how thorough the housekeeping service is. We can't wait to return to the Kaanapali Villas. Our only complaints would be the $5.00 per day parking fee (we never had a problem finding parking) and the daily phone charge of $1.56 regardless of whether or not you use the phone (which we never did). Also, the air conditioning is centrally located which isn't necessarily a bad thing, however, everytime we turned it to high, our non-smoking condo smelled STRONGLY of cigarette smoke. Otherwise, it was fine. Our favorite places to eat: Canoe's, Cheesburger in Paradise, & the Lahaina Fish Company. Favorite alternate beach: Makena Beach. Word of advice: Some of the Condo's are close to the busy highway. If you don't wish to be close to road noise then request a room away from the highway.", "Date": "September 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holland, MI", "Title": "\u201cGreat Honeymoon!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3833379", "Content": "We spent our 8 day honeymoon at the Maui Kaanapali Villas and just loved it!

Our view was of the garden, rather than the ocean, but was still nice. The staff was very friendly and courteous. The maid service was minimal - fresh towels every day, but very little cleaning was going on. Parking near your condo can be a challenge. The hotel offers beach towels for use, so dont bother packing your own. Snorkeling near the hotel (North about 500 yards) was great! The beach directly in front of the hotel is very nice and the water was calm. There are 3 pools on site, however, 2 of them are literally right next to each other enclosed in the same fence, so i'd call it just one large pool. The other pool is quite small. The onsite restaurant, Castaway Cafe, was great for breakfast, but dinner was severely lacking the night we tried it. I went with a friend of mine - we're both single males. We were surprised at how few single women were on Maui. Maui is all about honeymoons, anniversaries and family vacations. We like the condo complex, but wished it was a little closer to the activity in Kaanapali. If you want peace and relaxation, this place was great..... if you want a little more action and people around, stay in one of the resorts in South Kaanapali near Whaler's Village (stores, restaurants, etc). There is a trolley that runs between the complex and Whaler's Village - we never took advantage of it, but it seemed like a good idea if you were planning to just visit the village and go back to the condo.

The clean sand makes it a nice place for kids ti dig and folks who like to walk barefoot. The showers off the beach make it easy to rinse off before going back to the pool or your room. The staff was always friendly and helpful. They also have a security guard to check on guests and keep an eye on visitors. There is wireless connection in the library which is a nice open place to read and check email. The grounds are well kept and provide a nice walk. The rooms and grounds are very clean, and the housekeepers vacuum every day! We must have had a recently updated condo, as there were new appliances, glasses and silverware. It was right across the street from the train stop, a couple lights down from the Star market, and the golf course.

I can't imagine how they could ever get a poor review! We had a studio condo with a \"garden view\", although you could see the ocean from our lanai. They didn't have a room available for upgrade to what they considered ocean view, but they let us look at a couple of rooms and choose which one we wanted. We chose the one that hadn't been quite so newly decorated but had a better view. Since the room was ready, they let us check in early (about 1:00 pm instead of 3:00 pm). We had a large room with full kitchen (stove, refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave). They even start you out with a supply of dishwashing soap, dishwasher detergent, paper towels, coffee, tea, sugar, creamer, etc. I have to agree with some that the water pressure in the shower wasn't the greatest, but I've had worse at 4 star hotels. We didn't try the Castaway Restaurant so can't comment on that. We did take advantage of the 2 for 1 luau coupon they offered which was held at the Hyatt and found it to be very good and well worth the price. With the coupon from MKV we got 2 tickets for about $82 which included food, drinks and entertainment. You can take a shuttle to the Hyatt so you don't need drive there. There's also a luau next door at the Royal Lahaina that you can just walk to. We didn't have a problem with late housekeeping as someone else mentioned. The first morning we went out for breakfast at 7:30 and when we returned before 10:00 the room had been made up. I agree with the person who says a tip helps. We were always left plenty of bath towels, pool towels, etc. The snorkling was great just a very short walk up the beach. You can rent snorkle gear right there, but it is more expensive. I'd recommend renting elsewhere, especially if you are going to use it all week (which you'll want to do after you try it!). Many place have weekly rentals and Maui Divers even offers a free snorkle cruise if you rent the equipment for a week for about $35. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

The beach in front was great, not very many people at all. We walked several times to go snorkling towards Black Rock.

The room was decorated very cute and the bed was very comfortable. The carpet appeared to be new. We did not have a view of the ocean but we had a gorgeous view of the pool and grounds! We had easy beach access. The beach was gorgeous and less crowded compared to the opposite side of black rock. Also, there is the best coral reef for snorkeling about 50 feet north of the KPV. We saw gorgeous fish, huge sea turtles and even one octopus! I preferred the snorkeling at this location better than black rock as I found black rock much too crowded! We had friends staying at The Whaler and if we wanted to visit them we could easily walk to their place or take the open air trolley that was free! My only 2 complaints about my room as the water pressure was very weak and the temperture was hard to controll. Also we never had maid service before 4pm.

Our room was in the hotel portion (not a condo unit) and while it was nothing absurdly fancy it was more than enough for a place to rest your head and shower - You're in Maui why do you want to be in a hotel room all day anyway? The beach was relatively crowded but absolutely beautiful - some of the nicest waters and sands I have seen. Snorkeling is pretty good too, especially if you walk northwards on the beach to the public beach access area, or in front of the westin - go out about 50 yards and you'll have a hard time NOT seeing a couple sea turtles, tropical fish, and beautiful coral formations. If you're up for something more adventerous, set aside a couple hundred bucks and call up PonyExpress and book a Haleakala O Pele Crater Ride - you take a 4-5 hour horseback ride into the crater, which is more like being on Mars or another planet then anything earthly. It is absolutely amazing and you certainly won't forget the experience of being on top of clouds and riding around in an extinct volcano. A helpful note if you're traveling on a tighter budget - You can save 10% if you book online through them - search the web for 'Pony Express Haleakala' and it should turn right up. It's also worthwhile to grab a good guidebook (Maui Revealed was our choice) and take the road to Hana - its beautiful as well. Be aware - the road FROM Hana traveling the south side of the island is much more insane then the road to Hana - however we saw many people successfully navigating the roads in every imaginable rental car so pack a lunch and some snacks and set aside a full day (10-12 hours) for a remarkable experience. Wear hiking shoes and perhaps bring a pair of flipflops and swimsuit just in case - many waterfalls, pools, and scenic points are a small hike away. You'll trek through lush tropical jungles, bamboo forests, etc. It is a rainforest so don't be surprised if it rains on you, we got about 45 minutes of rain and its more like taking a shower, the weather is still hot (80+ degrees) and the rain falling is warm. Back to the hotel... If I was to complain about anything it would have to primarily be the construction going on next door, but realize this is hard to avoid anywhere you stay. Maui is a booming island and every imaginable beachfront parcel of land is being developed. Fortunately you can't hear the construction from the beach and most of the hotels property. Also, the food at the Castaway Cafe was mediocre considering the prices, and there is no room service which can be annoying. All in all I'd say Maui Kaanapali Villas is a great place to stay, especially if you're traveling on a tighter budget. It's very quiet and relaxing. If you have young kid's they might be bored stiff however, theres no super crazy waterfall pool slides or whatnot like some of the mega-resorts. The Kaanapali Villas are more geared towards adults, but I'd consider that a very good thing, its much more quiet that way. I think the reviewers who are complaining about things must be uptight and very difficult to please in general - yes theres a few geckos and frogs on the property running around, a gecko ended up in our room - welcome to Hawaii, theyre cute anyway and certainly nothing to ruin a vacation over. A great place with a fantastic beach - I'd go back in a heartbeat.", "Date": "September 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cPeace and Quiet\u201d", "Author": "mahalonuiloa8", "ReviewID": "UR2593295", "Content": "Just returned from Maui (Sept. 7-21, 2004).

MKV is on North Kaanapali beach, it was serene, peaceful and down right pleasant. The staff was very friendly and seemed to be smiling all the time which put me in a good mood. The beach is excellent, the pool clean and nicely kept. Castaways restaurant was excellent but a bit pricey for me. My condo was nothing fancy but very clean. My condo was a split level. The bedroom was upstairs and the kitchen, living and dining rooms were at the first level. One slight and very minor problem, the AC did not function on the first floor. The bedroom AC was in very good operating condition. The trades were blowing nicely my entire two weeks so this presented no major problem. If you are into lots of crowds and activities, you are a mere car drive from Lahaina and South Kaanapali area. My second week was at the Hyatt and although a beautiful resort, it also attracts many tourists. Which for me is not ideal. I would return to MKV . This was my fifth visit to Maui.

We read a number of reveiws from tripadvisor, and overall had a not so good impression about the hotel, but reviews did say this was one of the best beaches. While the hotel is outdated and needs some love, the staff was extraordinarily friendly and the beach truly is one of the best on Maui!! You can't beat the price for this hotel ($100.ngt), and really, how much time do you spend in a room?? It was clean and comfortable, definately not 5 star, but they did have a microwave, coffee maker and tv with good channels.

The week prior to that we were on the Norweigan Cruise of the Islands & my husband caught a respiratory virus the day before we boarded & was under the weather for a good portion of our trip... We wanted to extend our stay last minute & we decided we didn't need anything fancy. We just wanted a decent location on the beach to sleep & shower that was clean. I would give the beach 5 stars. The sand here seemed \"softer\" somehow. I don't even generally like sand. There was a reef for snorkeling right out front which was great. The walk from our room to the beach at the Days Inn was about the same distance we had to walk at the Hyatt from the elevator to our room. This was really nice. You could be on the beach in 15 seconds & there is a convenient beach shower on your way back to your room to rinse yourself & gear off. A few of the parking spots are reserved for the restaurant (Sarento's) that is also on the property. It didn't fit in our plans but if we have the opportunity to return we would probably eat there. It has good ratings but is expensive. Kind of funny that it is right there with the Days Inn. The parking can be difficult at night (we always found something) but I suspect that after the restaurant closes you would have less of a problem. If all else fails you could probably park at the public beach access lot between the Days Inn & the Mana Kai Resort (not positive about this at night though). Definitely if you are on the oceanfront building you might be bothered by the restaurant patrons-- esp on the first floor. I think the second floor of the oceanfront building might be better but you still might be bothered by the restaurant patrons/noise. Just something to keep in mind. Our room did have the memory foam mattress which was comfortable. The room was small especially for us since we overpacked & accumulated a lot of stuff on our trip. I still was able to figure out where to put all of our bags (2 Large Suitcases & 2 Large Duffel Bags with a few smaller bags/backpacks). The bathroom had a shower with a handheld shower no tub. The sink vanity was very small but they did have a couple of shelves on the wall to put things. There was an in-room safe that you had to checkout the key from the front desk. I was able to put my 15.4\" computer in at an angle not large by any means but I put in the most crucial stuff. There was a fridge & microwave. There was a hairdryer & coffee maker on the small vanity (no sink) outside the bathroom. The gal that checked us in was friendly. That was really the only staff member I met since my husband was the one that would trade in the beach towels & made the trips to the office. I thought the outside of the property was very well maintained as well. Two knocks I have against the place was 1. The air conditioning didn't work very well & 2. The exterior windows needed washing on our room. The Five Palms restaurant is next door at the Mana Kai Resort. We went for Happy Hour the night we arrived. It was a pretty good deal. My husband was definitely rubbed the wrong way by the first waitress/hostess he came in contact with. The next one was much friendlier. We opted to sit above b/c there was a small wait for the bar area. Our waitress was not as attentive as she should have been & we had to wait a bit but we are fairly easy going. Another party got upset about something & left. Other than the Five Palms & Sarento's those seemed to be the only restaurants on that end of the beach (at least within walking distance). Anyway, we were even willing to camp to extend our vacation 4 extra nights. If you are wanting a \"resort\" experience this is not the place for you. There is not a pool nor the service of a resort. If you want a clean (albeit a bit dated) place to sleep that is right on a nice beach this is a great spot. If you are used to a little higher calibur of hotel, you probably won't like this place.

My wife & I have done a decent amount of travel; we expect to get what we pay for, and nothing more, are generally happy with our accommodation as much of it is researched on TripAdvisor, but Days Inn would have to rank as one of the worst places we've ever stayed. I won't bore you with the details of our experiences with water running into our room under the adjoining door and soaking a laptop bag and a camera bag. To be fair, that was probably a spill or wet swimming gear left by the occupants, but did nothing to endear the place to us. As others have said, small and 'cozy'. Well, that's an understatement, as I can only think of two rooms I have ever stayed in that have been smaller. You have to move the table to open the window! The room was as dark as a dungeon, and smelled the part! The bathroom fan roared like a jet engine, and the AC wasn't much better. Thankfully in December there's little need for it at night. The walls are paper thin, and our bed head was under the wooden staircase, and we heard every stomp of people going up and down day and night. It was simply unpleasant to be in, and completely unsuitable for a 'base' for a beachside holiday. You can't eat a meal in there. You can't even open a beer. This place is an overnight truck stop, and nothing more. After 3 days we couldn't wait to leave, and even considered leaving earlier! I pity the poor guys we heard checking in for an 8 night stay! The service was friendly enough, to a degree, but three things really stood out from our stay: 1. Three days stay and all 3 days they had run out of beach towels by the time we'd asked. On the 3rd day, after turning up at 10am and complaining, they finally (miraculously) \"found\" a couple of towels for us, and brought them down to our room. 2. They use the guest laundry to wash their own linen. With only 2 machines, we had to wait until the current load finished before we could start ours. And then we had to wait for them to finish with the drier. A whole morning wasted doing laundry. It's disgraceful. 3. This was unbelievable... the so-called 'Ocean Front' rooms - presumably with a premium - have had their courtyards reclaimed by the restaurant next door!!! So not only can you not sit outside your own room and enjoy the beach, but you have a handful of dining tables literally outside your window! And I do mean, literally outside your window. Not 2 feet from the window, which is about 3 feet from the bed!!! Until 10:30pm every night!!! No doubt seating an extra 16-20 people ordering $50 steaks makes a lot more money than wjhatever premium they charge for an 'Ocean Front'. Take my advice, ask for a room *away* from the front, as you don't get a view from your room anyway! We sat on the beach and looked at the neighbouring accommodation, green with envy. Oh, that reminds me, they chain their handful of beach chairs to the fence, so you can't move them out of the sun into the shade. Right now I'm writing this review from Kaua'i Beach Resort, which cost us the same, and is worlds away in standard. Not even close. I can say they're clean. The service is friendly enough, but that's as far as I could recommend it. Definitely could *NOT* say it was value for money. It's also on the far extremity of the 'resort stretch', so it's just a little too far to walk for dinner, and my wife & I generally do not mind walking at all.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBest value\u201d", "Author": "Saltek", "ReviewID": "UR122337194", "Content": "Right on the beach with two restaurants on location.

The first night I was there, I woke up to a beautiful ocean-view from my hotel room window. That is where I spotted her- a beautiful mermaid on the beach, hanging out on a rock. I quickly ran outside to get a closer glimpse and unfortunately she got frightened (possibly by my handsome looks) and jumped back into the water and disappeared from my life. That entire day, all I can think about was her. Here I was in one of the most beautiful places in the world and I have a girl on my mind. Sure, I went snorkeling, parasailing, and cliff diving (which was a bad idea when you have that special someone in your mind- I almost jumped too short), but all I can think about was her. I went to a tiki bar that evening to get my mind off of her in hopes to meet some nice looking Polynesian women. I drank mai tais, pina coladas and even smoked a little maui wowie and all I can think about was her (I even secretly named her Ariel). I couldn't wait to go to sleep that night so I can wake up to another sighting of her. I set my alarm at 4:30am which is daybreak. The next morning, I jumped out of bed and gazed out the window. She was no where in sight- I guess she did not return, or perhaps I missed her. I ran outside and there was another man who seemed like he could have seem Ariel (he had love in his eyes and I can see the sweat on his palms). I asked him if he had seen her and he said yes (and apparently he scared her away!) I spoke to this man and evidently, he lives at this wonderful hotel and he basically lives to see her each morning through his window. He explained to me that she is very shy and the moment she hears a door open or sees a shadow of a human she returns back to her kingdom. He also explained to me that this is the only hotel that anyone has ever spotted a mermaid in the entire world. Even Tom Hanks (you know, he was in \"Splash\") has stayed at this hotel just to see a showing of her. He also said that she only makes an appearance once in a while and I was lucky that I spotted her the first morning there. I waited for her every day for the remainder of my stay. She never returned. I sold all of my belongings back home and am moving to Maui. I am going to live at the Days Inn just so I know she is near to me. I can't wait to see that beautiful red hair.

After reading the reviews, we got exactly what we expected. A comfortable bed with little frills right in the middle of South Maui. We requested a second floor room to avoid the reported noise. We never experienced outside noise at an unreasonable time. The maintenance crew will run leaf blowers in the morning, but we were up and active by 8AM and it never interrupted any sleep. The hotel is a series of 6 or 7 buildings and we were located right in the middle. That may have insulated us from the beach/restaurant noise, 107 steps from my door to the beach, and from the street traffic. The only chance for noise was the door shared between our room and the adjacent one. I think I heard a toilet flush once and I think I could hear the shower. No big deal. My wife and I were probably the noisy ones. The hotel shares a parking space with a restaurant that provides valet parking. The valets will fill up the shared parking before taking cares across the street, so two nights we had to park across the street. No big deal, just worth a note if you are coming back before 9PM at night. Another note, the parking spots are very tight, so you may have a problem entering and exiting your vehicle when the lot is full. There was a section of the hallway on the first floor that collects water. It looks worse than it is, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen it note a couple of times and wanted to address. I stepped in it more than once in sandals and my foot never got wet. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a byproduct of them hosing down the sidewalks to remove sand or watering of the plants. That being said, the staff could mop/sweep the water away t o minimize the issue. Now the room. For as cheap as the room was, the bed was well worth it. Maybe I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sleeping on crap at home, but every night it was a sound sleep. Linens were always changed and the cleanliness of the room was never in question. The room is quite small. Three drawers under the entertainment center with a decent sized CRT TV, a vanity station right behind the bathroom door, a small open closet for hanging a limited number of clothes, a safe and a decent sized bathroom. There were times my wife and I were interfering with each other trying to get ready, so I quickly learned to chill and enjoy a drink while surfing the very extensive cable TV lineup. There is also a coffee maker, iron and board and hair dryer. There is a small fridge that easily held half a case of water, a six pack of soda, a six pack of beer and bottle of wine. Side note, stop at K-Mart a few miles from the airport on your way to Kihei and stock up. Maui is expensive. One issue I had was internet access. When advertised, I was expecting access to be available in my room. While there is a DSL router in each of the rooms for the phone, you could only access the wifi internet in the lobby. The signal quickly fades about 10 feet outside the lobby doors. At first, this was upsetting and I spent an hour in the lobby the first night with my iPad. The second day my wife asked me I wanted to reserve an hour or so in our schedule to check my emails, but decided while I was in paradise, I was going to unplug. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad I did. I only checked once more during the trip to confirm our flight status. The front desk will provide towels for the beach. Know this and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pack towels. Save a pound in your suitcase. We traveled around the island as much as we could and our beach time often involved our friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beaches that were staying at the Four Seasons and the Fairmount, but our beach may have been the best. There are large rocks in the water in some places, but there is a large stretch of the beach that was perfect for wading and boogie boarding and such. At the ends of the beach there were amazing snorkeling spots. Also, there are hotel chairs you can sit at, although a limited amount. The immediate area provides almost anything you need, although a little on the pricey side. You are within one mile from a ton of shops and restaurants in Kihei. The 10 minute stroll up to a Mexican establishment called Fred\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was awesome at sunset and the trip back after dark was romantic. The hotel next door has a convenience store in the lobby and a surf shop to rent snorkel gear and other beach equipment. There is also a yoga shop toward its beach side that offers a $20 session at 8AM. The restaurant was on the pricey side and the food for the price was a little disappointing. Overall, this is a no frills hotel that gives you a great location and a good nights sleep while you enjoy the island of Maui. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plan on spending more than a couple hours awake in your room and are not a picky traveler, this is a place for you. For the price, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat it. We ended up paying a third of what our friends did staying in the resorts a mile to the south. If I had to do Maui again on the cheap, I would highly recommend it.

We had just spent 2 nights at the Aston Ka'anapali Shores on West Maui. The Days Inn had good reviews, and was a price we could afford, so we went with it. The location is good - right on a great beach. Next door are more condos and hotels. There's a restaurant at the end of the hotel at beachside - we didn't try it but we saw wedding parties eating there both nights. The dining lanai is actually right in front of the oceanfront ground floor rooms - so beware of paying for an oceanfront room and then having to keep your blinds shut for privacy! The motel is 5 or 6 separate blocks, each 2 stories. There are 8 rooms on each floor. The 4 corner rooms on each floor have 2 windows on the corners, and a small bathroom window. The 4 inner rooms have only 1 smallish window, and no window in the bathroom. The property has a slight grade, so on the uphill side, the ground floor rooms look at a concrete retaining wall about 3' high with some plants separating each building. We had requested at time of purchase through Expedia a view room - however we got a ground floor interior room facing the concrete retaining wall. I've stayed at a lot of hotels and motels of all grades for business and pleasure - and this room was amongst the smallest and most cramped. Our room was about 10'x10'. The \"king\" bed (smaller than a regular king size for sure) took up most of the room. In addition, all the rooms have AC units mounted INTO the rooms - taking up precious interior space. It was dark and felt like a basement. The bathrooms are small as well with a shower, no tub. After checking out the room, we went back to the front desk, and asked about availability of any other rooms. She told us the only ones left were in the same situation - ground floor, 1 window, facing the walls. I mentioned asking for a nicer room at booking (over 1 month before) and got the impression that they didn't read the request and that the room was just allotted at the time we checked in. The price is still good for a beachfront motel, but don't expect a place to hang out. We envied the neighboring condo, which had 8-10 stories of oceanfront rooms all with balconies. Also, other than the stair and deck access to the upper stories, there are no porches or balconies to hang out on. It's really a no frills place to sleep. Please note there are no additional facilities such as pool, fitness center, business center, etc. They did tell us there would be WiFi throughout the motel, but it apparently was not working during our stay. You could use a computer station in the small lobby. There is a mini fridge in the room and a microwave. While we were disappointed with the room (especially compared to the hotel we had just stayed in on West Maui), it was clean, and did the job.

Most rooms do not have oceanfront views but the ocean is a few steps away. The rooms are nice although small and I did not have any problems with noise. I was in a second floor room, room 214. SInce I was just one person, the small amount of closet space was not a problem. I did not even use all the dresser drawers. Some people or a couple might have felt a bit cramped. I would recommend a second floor room if you are concerned about noise at all. The cleaning crew came through regularly each day, but the hotel has what is a common policy now, which is if you leave your towels up, you are not asking for them to be cleaned, only if they are on the floor. I did not want towels cleaned until the end of my stay (I stayed 4 night, 12/14-12/17). You can also check out beach towels at the front desk which is convenient and there is a computer with free internet access in the lobby for accessing email. This was great since I did not lug a laptop with me. There is a laundry room with a soda machine accessed by room key near the front desk area. There is snorkeling along the beach and a reef which has a fair amount of fish. The sea turtles were there ( one swam right past me) and people said they could hear whale song, although I wasn't sure if I heard anything. People come here to snorkel and paddle out on boards and other water sports but the beach was not crowded , at least when I was on it (I went out mostly in the AM and also for evening strolls) and had a nice family feel. There isn't breakfast service at the hotel but you get a discount coupon for the hotel next door. However, that hotel , which is just a walk across the grass from the Days Inn, has a store where you can buy deli items, groceries and other sundries, as well as baked goods, and I bought what I needed for food from them during my stay. It was considerably more reasonable than eating at a restaurant. The drive along the road in Kihei to the hotel is somewhat stripmallish, but there are beaches all along the road, and some decent places to get lunch. I tried the Maui Taco place (if that is the correct name) which has no bathrooms but is decent food. You can walk along the beach all the way down through the resorts in Wailea (I am not checking spelling) , where a walkway goes up after about a half mile to mile so that you can see the views higher up from the cliffs as well as how the people plumping down twice or three times or more what you are paying at the Days Inn are paying for. However, I didn't think any beach there was better than the beach right outside the Days Inn. If I had wanted to just do beaches, I could have easily stayed here a longer time, and for the price it is a deal. I read a review about the seafront suites not being as advertised, and Sorrento's is busy at night, but I didn't ask or care about a seaview in the room, since I was going out to see things, not staying in my room. There are outdoor reclining chairs on the lawn right before you enter the beach at the hotel (this hotel runs along a relatively narrow strip from beach to road, and at the back there is a lawn right before you get on the sand; so most rooms are along the walkway. but all are just a short distance to the beach; possibly it is louder on the first floor, although I did not notice a lot of activity along the walkways at night). People come for the beach during the day and then leave at night, unless they are going to the Sorentos restaurant or to the restaurant at the hotel next door. Or unless they are staying at the hotels all night of course. But the grounds of that other hotel and the Days Inn merge, and there are no real restrictions in terms of walking between them. It just leads to a nice feeling, I didn't think there was any problem as far as people not at the hotels causing problems. The parking lot on one side of the hotel is hotel only, on the other side is shared with people coming to the beach during the day time. I always used the lot smaller lot on the hotel entrance side, and never had a problem parking. However, I did not go out at night and was usually parked if I had driven anywhere by sunset. Mostly at this hotel you don't really need to drive except to go visit nearby beaches if you want to. South from the hotel you are in the resort area with divided streets and a luxury feel. The Days Inn is right on the border between the luxury area of Wailea and the more regular folks area of Kihei. So you can check out both worlds just walking around . It's an easy drive down to Makena beach and further on to the lava flow area. A short drive north besides the Kihei business area is the Humpback Whale Sanctuary and you can easily drive around the bay to where you get whale watching trips with Pacific Whale Foundation.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cMisleading advertising\u201d", "Author": "bashfulliz", "ReviewID": "UR90930361", "Content": "We would not recommend this hotel to anyone!

We were disappointed to find that there was only one little tiny window in the corner that didt even look out directly onto the ocean - it more so looked out onto the restaurant at the hotel. There was no patio door going out onto the beach. The second floor rooms on the ocean did have a big balcony over looking the ocean. So if you want an ocean view room there, pay the extra for the 2nd floor suites. We didtn even feel like we were ont he ocean in the 1st floor room. That was the other problem that we had; the restaurant patio music was loud and we could hear it even with our windows closed and air on. We wanted to leave the window open to hear the waves. I called the front desk and they said that they would do their best to try to get them to turn it down or off. They did so after about a half hour. For the price of $100 in Kiehi on the ocean, this was a good place to stay; just dont plan to spend much time in the tiny room!", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cNot a very pleasant experience\u201d", "Author": "Thom S", "ReviewID": "UR89679733", "Content": "The rooms in this hotel are tiny and dirty.

The online reviews were accurate - we expected a small, clean room with no frills but a great beach, nearby restaurants, and the cheapest prices anywhere. That's exactly what we got.

You can even rent beach towels from the font desk, and you can rent all types of beach gear (including paddle boards and snorkels) from the hotel next door. My only word of caution is to be careful parking in the small lot out front - our car door got dinged and we were worried about being charged for the damage by the rental company (turns out the rental company didn't care, but it stressed us out nonetheless).

While we were staying there and talking to other guests they had various problems with toilets that continually ran, sinks that didn't drain and screens that were torn. Of course, I didn't witness any of this but if this is a sample of problems, what is really wrong? For location and cleaning staff, I would give it 3 stars but for the rooms in general maybe 1/2 star, little better than a hostel.", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cleveland, OH", "Title": "\u201cA great deal\u201d", "Author": "o15", "ReviewID": "UR55986588", "Content": "We had a little bit of difficulty because of a canceled reservation( on their part) They made everything right.

First time I had my room cleaned;came back from running to find towels taken - not replaced,other items I did not want removed,removed,shower uncleaned. AND door to room not properly closed . As in ANYONE COULD HAVE GONE IN !!!! Reported this to front desk and housekeeping immmediately ! NEVER recieved call from head of housekeeping,Manager or Gen. Manager. Stayed 8 nights (nowhere else to go). But heard nothing from Manager until day before check-out,at which time I ran into him at front desk. Said he had \"just heard about it \"that morning. Sure he did. Because I never heard from anyone,did not have my room cleaned after first time. Did not trust it wouldn't happen again - of course ! Having gotten no response from anyone. Manager ONLY took off $50 late check out fee. For handycap people; they have two spots outside office. One was used by hotel truck 8 out of the 9 days I was there. Even after bringing it to the Office's attention ! Only nice thing there; Right on very nice beach. Even if given a week's free stay - would NEVER EVER stay there again. EVER. FIRST bad experience with staying at a Day's Inn. For cost of rooms;while they list a lot of channels,they don't ACTUALLY have them. Have a card in room saying;Forgot something? See us at Front desk. (Or something like that.) Called. They have NOTHING. Fitness Center; Never saw it. Only open from 9-5.

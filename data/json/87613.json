But we really needed a hotel with a convenient location to downtown and a low price, so I went ahead and booked it anyway. I'm glad I did! Yes, the hotel is old, and it's not the fanciest, but the room was clean, except for a couple of items under the bed forgotten by the previous guest. The beds were comfortable enough and we had plenty of clean towels, soap, and toilet paper. I do wish we could have had a fridge so we could bring back leftovers from the yummy restaurants we visited, but I'm not going to complain about that for the price we got. There is no breakfast included in the price. Although there is a cafe at the hotel, we got a delicious breakfast at Yolk every morning just down the street -- they are a little expensive but definitely worth it. We did not have a car, but every time we walked by the parking lot there were plenty of parking spots, even at night. We were here from a Saturday to a Thursday in March, and even on the weekend there were spots available. My biggest complaint is the noise at night -- the hotel is near some busy streets, so you get street noise. The doors to the rooms also slam, so you hear your neighbors' doors slamming at night. We had quite a bit of noise on Saturday night, but the other nights during the week weren't too bad. Also, the shower would get scalding hot for a few seconds at a time, then go back to normal. This happened to me every morning, but my friend showered at night and did not have this problem at all. Also, the WiFi did not work sometimes, although it did work OK about 80% of the time. Despite these incoveniences, I would definitely stay here again.

I think this is a must do trip for everybody... what a wonderful city. During our week, after lots of on-line shopping and reading of reviews, we chose to stay at the downtown Chicago Howard Johnson. First off the price was very reasonnable compared to other downtown hotels. It was under 100$ a night and included a special which gave us a free night during the week. Another important factor was the free parking. In no other hotel of all downtown Chicago did I see free parking. Most will charge about 20$ (some even 30$) a night for parking. Obviously the rooms weren't as luxurious as other hotels, but this all depends on what you're looking for. During our week we were only in our room for sleeping and getting changed for the evening/supper time, otherwise we we're constantly on the go and visiting the many attractions that chicago has to offer. The room was well equiped but slightly old and out of date. A fresh coat of paint and a new carpet would make it look brand new. The location was incredible. Every morning we would set out for our day (always on foot). A few blocks to the south and you have your choice of Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts as well as access to the subway/elevated train. From there you could go anywhere in the city. Overall a great experience, and if we ever decide to go back to Chicago we'll definately check out the Howard Johnson again.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, OH", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "KMWCleveland_OH", "ReviewID": "UR125105169", "Content": "A rather dingy, older motel in central Chicago.

Well...there are about 4 cars in the lot right now. Which made me initially question \"Why is no one else here?\" I would soon find out... Maybe the other potential guests had already discovered that many of the outer doors to the rooms DO NOT LOCK. Kind of a big deal as far as security goes...so that made me feel extremely unsafe, which is probably why I did not sleep very well. Then as the night went on, I began to hear teenagers and bar-goers outside walking past my window. (Oh yes, on the SECOND floor there is a balcony where anyone can walk past your window just as easily as on the first floor and since the outer doors do not lock it could be anyone walking out there, not just Howard Johnson guests.) I did not see any sort of security guard so I'm not sure where the other reviewers saw that guy unless he just happened to have the night off the night I'm here. Second most unpleasant part of the room, aside from the uneasiness, was the temperature. Though I immediately turned the heat on, I did not feel the temperature of the room rise any amount of degrees.

One person wrote there were bedbugs, one person wrote that the hotel rooms were disgustingly unkempt, and one went as far as saying it was in a bad neighborhood. None of these things ended up being true in the slightest. The HoJo gets a bad rap. I'm not saying it's the Hilton, but it's not a cardboard box in an alley, which is what some people would like you to believe. CONS -Thin walls. We had a shared door with our neighbors who on the first night were a family with an endless bounty of screaming children refusing to go to bed. The second night it was a group of friends who partied into the wee hours of the morning. This made it hard to sleep for some of the people in the room. -I didn't like that there weren't any fitted sheets. My boyfriend tends to toss and turn in his sleep and more than once he woke up sleeping on the mattress. Personal preference. PROS -Location, location, location. The neighborhood is safe and within walking distance of many attractions. Example, the bf and I walked to the Lincoln Park Zoo one day in under 30 minutes. My friends and I walked to the 7-Eleven many times at night without any problems, even without the boys around. There's also lots of good eateries that are inexpensive around the area as well. It's very easy to get a cab if you need to too. -Despite having to book a smoking room even though none of us smoke, the room was very clean. Sure, there were some scuffs on the walls and someone's faded name written near the floor in the bathroom and it smelled like cigs, it was all very clean. Again due to the horror story reviews I mistakenly believed (I assume the people who wrote them were over the age of 40, at least it seemed that way) there would be bedbugs and blood smeared on the wall. This wasn't the case. Maybe I'm more tolerant because I'm in my early 20s, but I didn't think it was so bad. -Free parking also ruled. Just get there early because it's first come, first serve.

Absolutely disgusting is the only way I can describe the hotel room allocated to us. I have chosen my words carefully in referring to the room rather than hotel because I note there are other previews which are fairly positive (and for the life of me, I cannot understand). The hotel looked like a really old fashioned \"L\" shaped Motel on two levels. The type you see on TV where you book in then drive up to your room. Two levels in blocks assigned A, B, C etc., and each block with eight rooms, four facing front and four facing back. Our room was 2B on the lower level facing the back. This was our fifth stop-over on a 17 day holiday so although our first impression was not good, we decided that maybe the hectic day was making us over react. To explain all the background to discussions with reception etc., would take too long so I have attempted just list the bullet points covering the positives and negatives: POSITIVES: 1. The little diner attached to the hotel was really good. Spotless clean, very helpful and friendly staff, very good food (breakfast on 2 days) and excellent service and prices. NEGATIVES: 1. The room was dingy, badly lit (one of the two bedside lights not working), small and crowded due to a huge old fashioned TV and cabinet in one corner. In daylight the following morning we realised the room was truly a dump - the decor looked like it hadn't seen a lick of pain in years, curtains were ancient, filthy and marked (although they certainly kept the light out), the carpet was stained and looked filthy. 2. The bedroom window was opaque glass so we couldn't see through. They opened about a foot from either side and looked out on to a back alley hosting two big bins. The window was covered with a metal mesh frame to protect from??? 3. Vagrants/homeless people obviously slept in the back alley. At 11pm first night someone was chapping at the window through the mesh wire asking if we could spare a dollar. Following day I mentioned this to reception and they said we should have reported it and they would have sent security to investigate. I asked; \"didn't security patrol to try ensure guests don't get disturbed?\" They had no answer. 3. After being away for most of the day we returned to our room around 10:30pm to discover it hadn't been made up. Reception offered to move us to another room but that was it. We didn't want to pack up and move at that time of night so I went to reception and collected fresh towels. 4. The hotel had the nerve to have a banner outside which read \"newly renovated\". On questioning this a fellow guest suggested that this might refer to a newer block of rooms at the end of the Motel. Indeed there was a newer block but this was never offered or mentioned to us. SUMMARY Honestly, this is the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I am not in the habit of writing previews but felt that I had to report on this one.

I have stayed 4 nights. Overall, I have been very pleased. Granted the place does not look very modern on the outside but inside the rooms are fine. I have a single king size bed that is comfortable. My window is opaque so I can't see outside. I don't have a car but the sign in the lobby claims free parking. However, they say there are only 41 spots for 71 rooms, up to one car per room. So if you leave your spot you may not get it back. I see nearby parking lots for $15-18 dollars for 24 hours. I got a great price of $69 by agreeing that the room would be unrefundable; I booked 5 months in advance. This was by far the best price of any Chicago downtown hotel. The Ohio hotel is a few blocks away and I believe that was also inexpensive, maybe $99. The room comes with free wi-fi; it works well. If you consider the free wi-fi and the free parking, you end up with a very good deal. The Hyatt charges $14 per day for wi-fi and parking I believe is close to $30 per day. My bathroom is small but comfortable. There is a combination shower/tub. Caution: the toilets have an industrial style handle (tankless) and the flush would probably wash down a whole grapefruit. So....(1) don't flush while still sitting down, and (2) when someone else in the building flushes the shower partially looses cold water press and you can get momentarily scalded if you have the water set for very hot. Please keep this in mind, especially if you have young children or very elderly adults who are taking showers. BE careful and don't set the water too hot. The rooms are spread out over several buildings. Most are 1-2 floors, one building is 3 floors. I mention this because you will hear street noise in the morning because you are close to street level in all rooms. I imagine very tall hotels would not have this problem. I brought a white noise machine that helped a lot. The location is convenient to much of downtown Chicago IF you don't mind walking. I can reach Navy Pier in about 30 minutes, but I am a fast walker. My room has a cathode ray TV and a coffee maker and a very nice desk and also a lounge chair. The room smells fine with no bad odors or musty smell. Check in was 4:00; I arrived very early but they would not let me check in until 3:00. However, they allowed me to leave my bags and wander about the city. I used Go Express shuttle service to get here from the airport ($30). No refrigerator or microwave in the room. There is an ice machine so if you brought a cooler you could keep a few things cold overnight. Two blocks away is the biggest and most amazing McDonalds I have ever seen. About 4-5 blocks away is a Trader Joes. Two blocks away is a Walgreens. Dozens of restaurants in walking distance. I am very happy and would stay here again.

(Good luck finding something nearby!) Everyone at the front desk was nice, but from the moment you walk in, you feel like you're in the 1960s. The hotel does not seem to have been updated for decades - which is kinda quaint (and probably makes it easier to snag those good rates sometimes) - but also kinda sad. Our room was a decent size, the air conditioning worked wonderfully and housekeeping was excellent. But, just getting ice or a bottle of water made for a somewhat scary walk through dimly lit, random hallways. Overall - you won't feel like you're getting a bargain here, even if you get a dicounted rate. It's just slightly shabby.

It was an older hotel, with older furnishings, but I basically wanted a clean room to sleep and shower in. And HoJo provided it! It was easlily within walking distance to Hard Rock Cafe, House of Blues, Coyote Ugly, Rock Bottom Brewery and many local restaurants. The area was nicely lit, and felt safe.

The hotel itself features the Cafe Luna on site, a great morning breakfast for a supreme value. I agree that the hotel does appear a bit dated on the exterior, but I found my room to be in excellent condition, appears to have had a fresh coat of paint, and updated carpeting. The doors to the rooms are located inside, so you have to use your pass card to get in, that gave me a secure feeling. But the overall area of the hotel is buzzing with activity, the Rainforest cafe and many other attractions are merely a 10 minute or so walk from the hotel. Michigan Ave. is just down the street. The L-train station is about a 3 block walk, I did it toting several pieces of luggage to get out to Midway, if going that route plan for at LEAST an hour to get to Midway you have to transfer at the Clark/Lake Street station.

After reading the reviews here, I did expect something better. It is clean, cheap, and in a very convenient area - walking distance from a lot of things. And th free parking is a huge budget plus. However, it isn't the most attractive place. You wouldn't want to invite a colleague or client to meet you there. There's not really a lobby. It's basically a motor lodge, and it looks sort of run down. To get to my room, I had to walk through the outside parking lot and into the covered parking area, which is dark and deserted at night (and a little creepy for a lone woman), and then through a keycard-locked door, and then up a creaky elevator. The room itself is of a good size. There's no desk, but there is a little round table you can use. No high-speed internet, but there is a data port. Connecting through the data port is painfully slow - I could never get more than 24 Kbps. And beware the phone charges - local calls are .35 to connect and .10 per minute after that. Bathroom area is roomy, with separate vanities, which is convenient. The room door is thin, and you can hear everything in the hall, which also means people can hear what's going on inside your room. TV is old school, but it works fine. Overall, this is a fine place to stay if you're visiting and want to be on a budget. For business travel, it's not very convenient.

My husband had called ahead and requested a crib for our daughter.

The crib was set up in our room, per request. The hotel was tidy and the room decent. My only complaint about the room was there was no extractor fan in the bathroom.Therefore, after showering, the mirrors were all steamed up. We settled down to sleep, but it sounded like a party was going on next door. A quick phone call to the front desk saw our neighbours go quiet, but then the other side started, so another phone call and they also quietened down within about 20 minutes. I had difficulty sleeping, due to being outside my time zone (my 4-month-old daughter and myself had travelled internationally) and while my husband and daughter slept well, I was up most of the night and spent much of that time in the lobby talking to one of the staff. Another staff member offered me a complimentary copy of the LA Times to help while away the hours. The bar was closed at this odd hour and the Burger King across the road had closed at 1am, but one of the lobby staff advised me of soda vending machines on each floor. Wile I would have preferred a hot beverage, at least he was kind enough to alert me to this.

From the beginning it started out poorly. While checking in at the front desk. As a Platinum Elite Member I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m used to having an accessible Concierge Lounge with complimentary bottled water and soft drinks. Since this was a Friday evening, I knew there would be no service in the Lounge for the weekend so I asked the young lady at the front desk about breakfast since the lounge wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be serving on Saturday. When I stay on weekends I usually get my breakfast comped. This property comps nothing. To make matters worse, the young lady stated the Concierge Lounge is for Platinum Members only. I guess since I was wearing a sweatshirt and jeans instead of my usual suit, she assumed I was a nobody. I reminded her I was a Platinum Elite Member and she stated, Oh! I told her I wanted a room that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t connected as I always do because of the noise from the rooms next door. She stated she would give me a corner room (and that usually means a larger room). I got to the room and the first thing I noticed is that it was a connecting room which I told her I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want. As a corner room, this was the smallest room I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen. I called and got a different room which was much bigger. The bed was very hard, not like the comfortable Marriott bedding I find at other properties. The wireless internet was not working, nor was the DSL connection. I called the front desk again, and they transferred me to the help desk. I waited and waited on hold, but gave up after five minutes. The next task was to find dinner. I asked a lady working the Concierge desk if there were any restaurants that delivered. She gave me a few menus from local places and told me I must be in my room when they arrive if I order out. Once again, my intelligence was insulted by a young lady who must have thought I was a country bumpkin. I explained to her I do this on a regular basis and walked away. How rude these employees were! I stopped by the Concierge Lounge to at least get some bottled water, but everything was put away so nobody could get anything. I ran into another gentleman in the lounge also looking for water, and he too agreed this was unreal, and the personnel were unfriendly. So after a long day of flying I decided to take a shower. At least that worked well. After drying off, I put the robe on that was hanging in the closet, and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but laugh. This was the smallest, tightest, cheesiest robe I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen. It felt almost like spandex it was so tight. I then decided to order out after seeing the room service menu and found the best Italian food. This was the only high point at this Renaissance. The Restaurant was Valentino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pizza and I figured it would be good since they guy I spoke with on the phone was Italian. Their food exceeded my expectations, and the prices were very reasonable. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll write a review on them later. Getting back to the Renaissance. Will I stay here again? Never! Will I recommend it to anyone? Never! I think I would stay at a Fairfield Inn over this place. At least the Fairfield Inns have friendly employees. At the best, this is a three star property. The General Manager here certainly doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t promote customer service. I stay at Marriott properties all over the U.S. because Marriott has the best customer service that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come to expect. so if you are looking for a hotel near Los Angeles International Airport, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay here. There are a lot of other hotels by the airport that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bet have much better service.

Since we were travelling with kids we made extensive use of the pool area. The pool is small, but there was a sufficient amount of sunbeds. What was not available in sufficient quantity were towels. The pool area was definitely a neglected area of this hotel. Nobody bothered to collect used towels and nobody bothered to supply fresh towels. One evening we had to call the reception and then go to the reception TWICE to get towels for our kids (and 14 other people) in the pool. The good thing about the pool was that it is open till 23:00 p.m, thus even after a late arrival or a day full of sightseeing we could make use of the pool. We were not happy with the children's policy at the gym. Our 12 year old son is an avid runner and works out every day. He was not allowed to use the treadmill. He definitely was not playing on the machine but seriously working out and he was supervised, as I was next to him, but we were told that he was not allowed the treadmill and he had to get off. Very difficult to understand. We were very impressed by the breakfast buffet that was included in the price. There was really everything from scrambled eggs to salmon to a wide selection of pastries. Everything was very fresh and of good quality. A nice touch was the cookie decorating activity that was offered for the children on Saturday afternoon. Our children really enjoyed this.

At the time of booking the hotel was offering a 25% discounted rate which made the price much more reasonable.

Our check in was not as smooth as planned as we waited curb side at LAX for over half an hour before the complimentary shuttle appeared. The wait included two phone calls to reception to try and track down the transport! The issue is not the fault of the hotel due to the badly designed LAX collection bays - but the hotel should pay more attention to the whereabouts of their shuttles as there was another bus directly behind our shuttle making a mockery of their claim that one they are set at 15 min intervals. Maybe one bus skipping some stops and going ahead to passengers at other terminals is advised? The hotel itself was very quiet and clean. The beds were a bit soft for our liking but that is simply personal preference. We all slept well so that is the important thing! Breakfast is overpriced so we opted for a simple meal at the Burger King across the road. We did pay the additional fee for internet nor did we have time to fully explore the hotel. Instead we took a taxi downtown for approx $30 - convenient as there is a taxi bay at the front of the hotel.

The room was fine BUT i noticed no shampoo was in the room. WHen i called to get some sent up, the same gal from check in apologized profusely and had someone bring some up. When i called later for room service the first question she asked was if i got the shampoo. Great front desk follow through. When i went to shower this morning, i noticed hair in the shower. Not one or two but several. Rather gross. Given this and the issue with the lack of shampoo i'd suggest their housekeeping manager double check their work. Other than that, the room was nicely appointed, quiet and quite comfortable. The front desk staff went out of their way to please.

The Renaissance has the convenient proximity to the airport but not the noise of one. Really, it's so well soundproofed and that you forget you're near an airport until you walk out and see planes practically on top of you. That combined with the amazing bed and nice heavy curtains that completely block out the light ensure a good nights sleep. There are a couple of little downsides. The wireless internet is expensive ($12.95 a day) and if you want take out it's around a 15 minute walk to anything (Sepulvuda Blvd has lots of shops.) But if you can spare the money for a proper meal, the hotel restaurant the 96th St Bistro is excellent. Just order a main meal (they range in price from $18-40) and for free you get a small loaf of bread with 3 spreads (big enough to serve as a starter) and then afterwards they bring you this massive strawberry covered in chocolate and nuts that is amazing.

The check-in staff was both very professional and friendly, with the sort of crisp attitude that often seems lacking at 9 p.m. among airport-hotel employees. The lobby and public rooms are stylish and appealing, and would not feel out of place downtown. The hotel perhaps aspires to be a little more chic than it can credibly pull off, given its location and purpose as airport lodging, but the bar seemed lively and people appeared to enjoy themselves in the sitting area near the entrance. My room was fully functional, on the smaller end for a four-star hotel but in keeping with other higher-end airport hotels at which I've stayed. The bathroom was fresh and relatively spacious, making up for the slightly utilitarian, though very clean, nature of the bedroom itself. Regrettably, Renaissance, like the rest of the Marriott chain, does charge an exorbitant rate -- roughly $15 a night -- for Internet access. A friend met me the next morning in his car, leaving it in the hotel's convenient garage. Realizing that we'd left the parking card in my room after check-out, I went back to the front desk, which immediately billed my credit card for two hours of parking without any questions and put the credit on my room key, so that I simply needed to swipe the key card at the garage exit and was on my way. A very intelligent and convenient system. It may be ambitious and its guest rooms may lack for excitement, but the Renaissance Montura is a respectable and comfortable hotel that has managed to define itself independent of LAX.

There's no disputing that we got a great deal; the room rate was superb for a hotel of this service-level. Overall, our stay was fine; there weren't any major problems. However, I thought the hotel fell short of what I've come to expect from Renaissance Hotels. Renaissance properties generally stand-out, in my experience, for offering service that you'd expect at full-service hotels in the Marriott family, but in an environment that feels a little different (whether that be stylish design, a funky edge, a historic renovation, etc). This hotel offers none of the above -- it is a standard airport property with pretty bland, if non-offensive, style. The service was fine. It leaned toward good at the bell stand and toward bad in the restaurant but fell in the middle overall. The room was OK -- comfortable bed; the rest of the decor was average and seemed a little worn. The fitness center had pretty good equipment but the weirdest TV system I've ever encountered; when the guy on the treadmill next to me would change his channel, my channel would change, too. The restaurant was pretty gross -- slow service and tasteless, expensive food. (Note: around the corner from the hotel there is a dumpy-looking, but completely delicious, Greek restaurant.

I mentioned to the staff and they seemed bewildered, sent someone up to check on the problem. It was too late, as I had completed the shower and we were checking out. I thought at the time it must be a fluke. But, a month later, we checked in again, as per our usual Christmas time layover to Hawaii. We stayed here two nights, again NO HOT WATER. We had different rooms and even different floor than in November when we experienced the hot water shortage. I read in another travelers review that they too experienced no hot water. So, obviously there is a problem and they are \"rationing\" the hot water. This is more than a coincidence. I think in their efforts to cut costs as they have done away with the club lounge breakfast and afternoon appetizers during the weekend, they are also cutting the hot water supply. I hope I am wrong. We have up until this year, had great experiences with this hotel. If they fix the hot water problem, I will come back, if not, I will be looking for another hotel.

YES, there IS a pool and whirlpool. It is located on the second floor, on the outside of the fitness facilities. Go into the fitness facilities, and the pool and whirlpool are right outside the door. It's not a huge pool by any means, but it is adequate. I'd imagine it would be a nightmare in the summer time. I do have video of the fitness facility/pool for those interested.

I did research before my stay (mind you, I live in California and drove down there, so I had a car) and just down the street is Century Blvd, which has Denny's, McDonalds, Taco Bell/Pizza Hut, CA Pizza Kitchen, Jack in the Box ETC. So, if you're not a Burger King fan (which is across the street from this hotel), no worries! It is about 8/10 of a mile according to Mapquest. Google Century Blvd Restaurants Los Angeles to see the complete list of nearby dining. It is just up the street, turn left and you're pretty much there. I was quite confused with the TV. There are very few (free) channels, realistically, and while they did offer movies, even recent theatrical releases, I wasn't keen on the idea of paying $19.99 to see Hancock, which I wasn't impressed with the first time I saw it. for $8 . Luckily, I had my laptop, and some DVDs, and placed that next to the TV. If you're planning to stay for a length of time, I reccomend a laptop or portable DVD player. Bring DVDs of your favorite TV shows. Hollywood and Sunset Blvd are about 10 miles, and you do not need to get on the freeway to go to either. It's not a horrible drive, and as you're driving, you get a good view of the Hollywood Sign, which you don't get as you drive to this hotel (again, the hotel is off the 405, you can see the Hollywood Sign from the 101). This hotel is also not far (about the same distance-10 miles or so) from Rodeo Drive, the world famous 3-block shopping district in Beverly Hills. This hotel is an excellent penny-saver option for those who want to tour the nearby LA landmarks, such as those above mentioned. I'm not going to reccomend this hotel for families with children, for one reason- Location. This is no where near the major theme parks (which, unless flying, travelers with children are most likely going to be in the LA area for). Disneyland is clear down off of 5, this hotel is off the 405. Unless you want to do some driving, I would reccomend paying the extra money to stay at a hotel in Anaheim (which is in a different county from LA), if you're going to Disneyland, Calif. Adventure, ETC. With traffic, you're looking at an easy 1 hr drive one-way to or from the Disney parks. If you're going to Six Flags, that is also off 5, North of LA, and also a distance from this hotel (or any LAX hotel). Pay the extra money to stay in a hotel adjacent to the theme parks, and save the long drive. Your kids will thank you. If you're traveling through LAX, if you're going to see LA area landmarks, I highly reccomend this hotel.", "Date": "October 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cHandy to the airport\u201d", "Author": "Ozstitcher", "ReviewID": "UR21043686", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for one night before our flight to Australia.

The bellman who brought our bags up was very helpful when we discovered the fridge was not working. Turns out, it's not a fridge at all but a \"chiller\" whatever that is. But they brought a real fridge up for us for no extra so that was good. The bathroom was nice and big but it appeared that the maid had not done her job properly. There were towels but no toilet paper! One roll was completely empty and the other almost empty. We had to ring down for more. There was also no bath soap only one for the sink. I really don't think this is acceptable for a hotel in this price range. My daughter used the pool and spa. The pool is very small and the spa even smaller. I don't think you could've fit 2 people in there! There were workmen in the fitness room and we had to dodge wires hanging from the ceiling each time we went through to the pool. Not good.

Arrived and found the hotel easily, put our car into the parking garage (cost about $23/night with check in/out privileges). Check-in was a breeze, pleasant receptionist thanking me for choosing their hotel etc, made me feel very at home and happy. Lobby also looked nice. Our room was on the club floor (11), and had a nice view of the airport (as requested prior to check-in so that was noted and acted upon). The room had a nice flat screen high def TV and the usual great Marriott bed. Felt at home and enjoyed the nice bathroom too -although huge disappointment that later in the evening there was no hot water, so no bath, we didn't report the problem though as we didn't want to watch someone fixing it late in the evening. It was working by the next day. We had arrived a little late (~8pm) and after freshening up went to the club lounge to try 'deserts', which were very tasty (and free). The prices in the club lounge aren't cheap I admit, but, the offer of cocktails for about $9 isn't too bad for this class of hotel imho, whilst you can enjoy watching the planes land. For food there wasn't anything nearby apart from a Burger King across the road, as such we asked in the club lounge for a recommendation for a nice Italian. They gave us a name of one a short drive away - it was tasty, and it was also Zagat rated we noticed, so definitely a positive recommendation from the staff. Next morning we checked out and left, but, had a good time overall and if I was near LAX in the future I'd try and stay here.", "Date": "October 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Beach, CA", "Title": "\u201cSharp & modern room decor, but a few things could be improved...\u201d", "Author": "LKWLongBeach_CA", "ReviewID": "UR20675253", "Content": "The large, remodeled rooms on the club floors are great.

New carpet, quality bed linens, Two CD/IPOD-capable clock/radios. Soundproof windows, sitting area, 2 TVs (one plasma). Writing desk with lighting & power/internet station, etc. That being said... We booked one night to attend a function being held at the hotel so we wouldn't have to drive the 30+ miles back home at midnight after the festivities. The 11th floor room with club lounge access was nice; but the hallway outside smelled like a 55 gallon drum of 90 weight transmission oil was hidden within a 10' radius. Perhaps the elevators were just serviced? It did remind me that I need to stop by JiffyLube this week to have my oil changed in the car... We booked the \"Romance Package\" for a few extra $$$ (a bottle of chilled champagne, chocolate-dipped strawberries & fresh rose petals sprinkled on the bed upon arrival)! Note: \"Upon Arrival\" means sometime after 6pm....no matter when you arrive (check-in starts at 3pm). We checked in at 4:30pm - no romance. We called front desk to check on romance's status, & were told we'd have it within 30 minutes. We went to the club lounge...hor's douvres start at 5:30 pm. Until then, there were plenty of sodas, bottled water and coffee/tea available, along with some not-quite-ripe pears. At 5:30, they set out some VERY nice appetizers (shot glasses filled w/veggie sticks, rice with curried chicken skewers, cute little gourmet cheese & dried fruit bowls with crackers). Drinks at the lounge were pricey, w/average wine going for $8.50/glass. Better wine was more. (Hint: the liquor store on the corner of 98th & Airport will sell you a BOTTLE of average wine for about the same $$$). After a quick hunger-satisfying snack, we returned to our room to dress for the evening's gala in one of the ballrooms. SURPRIZE!! A hotel staffer was \"preparing\" the Romance Package - Part I for us by lazily spreading rose petals on the bed. We all agreed that they were pretty, and smelled really nice. But, OK...some ambiance is definitely lost when you have to sit on the couch & chatting with and watching somebody prepare your room for \"Romance\". And this was only PART I of the romance thing....Part II was handled by \"Mr. Catering Guy\" who knocked at the door bearing said champage & strawberries 15 minutes after \"Ms. Rose Petal\" left with her empty rose-petal-holding-mini-suitcase. In the meantime, since romance was on hold for a spell, we turned on the plasma TV to catch up on the day's affairs. The sound on the TV set was amazing! The completely black picture, however, left something to be desired. A quick check of the cables & controls left us with the realization that this problem was over our heads and we'd need a professional to fix it. We finished dressing, and being cautious travelers, placed our valuables in the thoughtfully provided personal safe located in the top dressser drawer (great idea - beats having to crawl into the closet to find the safe, which is where most hotels place them). Just before leaving, we placed a call to the front desk lodging our TV repair request, and placed another in-person request with the Concierge on our way downstairs to attend the pre-gala cocktail party (just in case). Attendance at the cocktail party was great, but that also meant \"crowded\", with lots of bodies in little space (the hallway outside the banquet room). It got really hot, really fast. We decided to take short leave of the festivities and head back up to our room to enjoy a glass of cold champagne and a chocolate-dipped berry or two, because (as it was upstairs in the club lounge) a glass of mediocre wine was $8.50. Back at our rose petal festooned room, we found \"Mr. Maintenance\" carefully checking the plasma TV. He deduced that the tube was blown, and announced he was on the way downstairs to see if there was another TV around he could swap out. We advised him that we'd be there for about 20 minutes, so to come back after that, which he apparently did, as when we returned after 11:00 pm, the plasma was fixed. The last issue happened when we tried to access the thoughtfully-provided-and-easily-accessible-personal-safe containing our valuables, and found that no matter how many times we entered the carefully programmed personal code, the LED display returned a \"ERROR90\" message. Another call placed to the front desk requesting someone come by to fix obstinate electronic device resulted in yet another hotel staff member (this time from security) knocking on the door; this time at 11:45 pm, to reprogram the safe and rescue our belongings. While this seems like a lot of inconvenience...I can say the room itself was quite nice, the hor's douvres and the breakfast items were terrific - after we turned in the slight molded bagels in exchange for fresher, less green English Muffins. Recommend the management pay a bit of attention to quality checking the well-decorated and appointed rooms, and some time reviewing guest-preparation processes. This would go a long way toward making guest's stays more enjoyable. ....by the way.

We had a 15 minute wait (at 6.30pm on a Sunday night) for the shuttle pickup which was empty when we boarded at SouthWest. Checkin was easy and quiet. We had a Club room with 2 queen beds a cot/crib. It was a little tight all round but clean and pleasant enough. We got the kids into the bath straightaway, with their yelps of delight and play. As we were ordering room service (about 7.30pm) the Customer Service Manager came onto the line and very pleasantly told us that he'd had a complaint about the noise from the kids. We explained we had had them in the bath and were rushing them to bed after a bite, so it would be quiet soon (they are pretty good kids and seasoned travellers). He offered us COMPLIMENTARY cookies and milk for the kids (and our own drinks with the meal were complimentary) to entice them to bed. How many places can you go where you get complimentary drinks for a complaint against you??? Anyway it was a hit with us all. Room service dinner was good all around, my crabcakes were yummy and memorable and the kids meals were good too. We all had a good nights sleep - great blackout curtains, no noise from the airport (we were facing), comfy beds. Club Breakfast was okay and the kids were thrilled to see the low-flying planes in front of the club lounge! Snacks through the day consisted of fruit and sweets. The Club lounge is always a great place to escape from kids in a hotel room. We organised an extra 4 hours accomodation (50% rate I think to 6pm) and all headed out to Manhattan Beach - the main reason I chose the Hotel was for its proximity to the free bus (that'd I read about on Trip Advisor). DH and the kids spent the best part of the day at the beach and I spent time and money at the Manhattan Beach Mall. Concierge was very helpful with directions and what to do in Manhattan Beach. Check out and transfers were easy. We checked our emails (at a small cost) before the quick and easy transfer to the Virgin Terminal.

This, however, is close to the airport, and I felt quite safe there.

Surrounding the hotel are the many giant car parks of LAX. Parking was charged extra, but with in-and-out-privileges for the day. Room The room I got was very, very good. Clean, spacious, modernly furnished. Extremely comfortable bed. A desk with a network cable for the computer. A flatscreen TV, huge minibar. This was a very nice surprise, far beyond what I expected. Maybe a bit 'too much' for what I was looking for: a comfortable place to sleep. Bathroom Bright, clean bathroom with a huge tub with shower. Very nice. Service I didn't really bother the staff much, but housekeeping did a very good job, and check-in/check-out was a breeze.

The bed was really nice, but the furnishings were a bit old - yet well-maintained and very clean. Two flaws: the water temperature of the shower was bothersome - e.g., taking a long time to get hot and needing frequent adjustments.

There's a Burger King across the street, but nothing else of note within sight in any direction in terms of shopping or eating. The hotel charges $17 per night for parking (unlimited in/out priveleges), which seemed extreme, and maybe that's one reason why the room rate is so competetive.

The pillow-top bed with the soft cotton sheets and duvet were bliss. I dreaded having to get up early to leave as I wanted to luxuriate in the linens all day! The windowpanes must have been tripled-paned, as we could watch the planes land, but did not hear even a slight engine noise. The registration staff was competent, but not overly friendly. The early morning (5 AM) coffee and continental staff were kind, given the early hour. It was nice to be able to grab a cup of Peet's coffee before having to face LAX.

However, the beds themselves more than made up for it. They featured duvets and other European-style appointments as well as enormous pillows which made it especially comfortable when sitting up against the headboard. The location of this property is central to everything. It's closest to the South Bay area which includes Redondo and Manhattan Beaches. Hollywood is about a 30-minute drive as long as you stay off the freeways. All in all, I would recommend this property, especially to business travelers or people who only have a few days to spend in L.A.", "Date": "January 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern Illinois", "Title": "\u201cAwesome!\u201d", "Author": "SouthernIllinoisJane", "ReviewID": "UR6532117", "Content": "What a lovely property! This hotel is not new like a normally select, however it is very well taken care of, beautifully furnished and definitely an upper class hotel. I paid $119 and stayed one night. The airport location worked out great since we were leaving LAX the next morning. The beds were wonderful....probably close to the best I've slept on in a hotel. The few downsides of the hotel is that the rooms are quite small and there is not very good lighting in the room. Two of us were trying to get ready in the morning and the lighting in the living/sleeping area was very dark. The concierge was very helpful. They directed us to the Promenade Shopping Center where we had a great meal and saw a movie....beware, the movie prices on a Saturday night were $15.50 per adult!

The room we had (9th floor) was well organized, very clean and very quiet. I loved the bed and wished I could have taken it home with me, it was that comfortable; and the linen was incredably soft and warm. Our room rate ($119) included breakfast for two adults and children under 12 free. I was expecting a basic continental but it turned out to be a fairly comprehensive buffet style with white table clothes and full service. They do have a menu if you choose. We also ate dinner one night and again I was very impressed. The Sword Fish with lobster sauce was increadable. Take your time though, it's not a fast service restaurant during dinner time, but if you are in a hurry, there is a burger King accross the street , which you never see unless driving by to get to the hotel parking garage ($13.00 per night by the way). There appears to alot of convetion space here if needed, excersize room, pool (small / 4Ft deep max), and a well appointed lobby to just hang and watch the world go by.

The hotel is really designed to give people in transit staying, I suspect, for an average of one or maybe two nights. That is why I tend to rate the hotel as fine and may other people on tripadvisor.com would rave about the hotel. The hotel has been going through a process of staggered renovation and there has been a real improvement in the quality and state of the bedrooms. One improvement, in my view, being the beds! These are definitely soft, comfortable and have piles of pillows to snuggle down into at night. The rooms are a good size, both the normal rooms and the suites although the latter tend to be fairly dark. There is usually good space to do work, good internet access and fairly good bathrooms with great water pressure. The one thing that is a pity they have not addressed is the air conditioning which is very boisterous and noisy, and I have found that I need to leave it off when going to bed at night and so in summer the rooms get hot and bit uncomfortable over night. The other area that is not great is the bar and dining facilities. The bar is small and not that exciting and the food is pretty average and limited. So while this is fine when there for a night or maybe two, if you stay any longer then you tire of the food. The problem being that as this is a hotel airport there is nowhere to pop out and walk to for an alterative meal. There is a small outdoor pool that is very popular, with small hot tub. The gym is pretty good with a range of cardio equipment to keep most people happy with TVs above each. The weights area is very limited but fine again for a work out. The hotel has a large parking garage with self parking or valet parking. The view from rooms in the front of the hotel are over the airport and worth asking for when you check in - or you get the view of the multi story car park (which you will see I always have had!) So this is a good hotel for an airport hotel, probably good for a conference as is so handy for the airport but not a hotel to spend longer in. One thing as an aside is although planes come really close to the hotel the hotel is very sound proof and even between rooms is very well insulated! A tips is that you can get amazing rates for club room access at the weekend (from a Thursday to a Monday check-out) off their website.

I didn't request the tray and don't know who put it there for them, but it was beyond wonderful for them to have it there. Someone mentioned the elevator arrangement. There is a separate elevator for the parking garage and you do have to then go through the lobby to reach the elevators to the floors, but we considered this to be a good security measure as there is then no outside access to the floors.

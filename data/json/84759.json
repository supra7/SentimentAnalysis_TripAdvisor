The hotel is a great location between everywhere, from Disney to many locations on the same highway, including dining variety. The staff was very friendly to us and the main lobby has a very nice simple style to it.

This hotel was right down the street from the Silver Spurs Arena. Everyone of the parents compained to the coach that we didn't want to stay there after reading all of the reviews on Trip Advisor. She insisted that she had stayed there before and it would be fine. Oh my god! How nasty this place was. We made the best of it, but ewww! I would have rather forked out the money myself of everyone to stay at the Peabody. Dust build up in all of the corners. Vomit floating in the pool. Perverted maintenance guys staring at the teenage girls while they were trying to practice their routine in the grass. Let's just say, they coach agreed with us after that stay.", "Date": "July 26, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ramada Heritage Park", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34352-d84759-Reviews-Ramada_Heritage_Park-Kissimmee_Florida.html", "Price": "$56 - $77*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2145 E Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy.</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">Hwy 192</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Kissimmee</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34744</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "84759", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/2f/10/2f106c4534b99aae4a34cd1cd2179e384large.jpg"}}

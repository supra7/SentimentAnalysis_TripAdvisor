Recently my job took me to Champaign, IL for 8 weeks. Unable to find affordable accomodations in an extended stay facility, I booked with Red Roof Inn. They offered an affordable alternative. No stove? Not an issue for a seasoned business travler with a crockpot! The room was very comfortable, clean and for the majority of my stay, very quite. The staff was excellent...friendly and attentive. Clean towels and rubbish removal every day. This is an older hotel, but well maintained.

The t.v. worked just fine, there were no problems with the shower or the sink, the bed was clean and made each day. At night the hotel was relatively quiet, the heating unit functioned well and wasn't too loud. The only major issue I had with this hotel is that I lost my key and had to go to the front desk to get a new one. The front desk clerk issued me a new key when I told him my room number. I had not seen this desk clerk before, he did not ask my name or for any form of ID from me. This was a bit disconcerting as, I'm guessing you could walk in and ask for the room key for any room and get it depending on who was working the front desk.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fulton, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for the price, clean and everything works\u201d", "Author": "MzeeRick", "ReviewID": "UR121904898", "Content": "This is one of the older Red Roof Inns, but it is scheduled for a complete remodel in 2012, I was told. We have stayed here many times over the last 10 years, and have found it very reliable, though not completely up to date. Office staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms are clean, beds are comfortable, bathrooms are clean with great water pressure in the shower and the wi-fi works well. No pool, coffee in-room or continental breakfast, but who wants stale Hostess donuts anyway? McDonalds and Bob Evans are only a block away. Also there are a lot of other good restaurants close by and the Red Roof has order-in service available. So if you are looking for a 4 star resort, this is not the place, but if you want a nice clean room, good night's sleep, a hot shower in the morning and hot cup of coffee anytime in the lobby, this is it. Rates are great if you search for them. We will continue to stay here regularly in the future. Oh, and be sure to check out the squirrels that live in the trees on the property.

We thought perhaps our first time in 2008 we just got a bad room. Wrong. This room was worse than the last. The carpeting was filthy. The bathroom door was literally held together with packing tape. I should have taken a picture. The furniture should have been retired years ago. It was way below thrift store. The lampshades were torn and mismatched. Worst of all was the bathroom. The seat had been left up and there were \"dried drops\" on the rim of the bowl. If housekeeping cleans anything in the room it should be the toilet. If that is not clean, everything else is suspect. There were also sticky smears on the furniture that could have easily been wiped off. I am not a snob or a particularly fussy person. I can adapt to used furniture and tired beds, but I will not tolerate filth. I highly recommend you stay elsewhere. This place need a total overhaul. I also hate the fact that you have to go to the office in the morning to have them remove the safe fee. When I went to the office it was closed.

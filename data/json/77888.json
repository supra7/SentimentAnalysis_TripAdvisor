Three things were frustrating, however: 1) I'm not sure what kind of tv system the hotel uses, but there was terrible reception and images on the screen were always breaking up; 2) Valet parking was over $40/night plus tax. 3) The valet directed me to a self-park garage beneath an office building just next door to the hotel. Ample parking there and the overnight charge was $24. While the rate was low, I did not feel safe having to walk down a downtown Los Angeles street at 5:30 am and around the block to get to the entrance to the office building's parking elevators. The building seemed deserted. I saw a security guard at a desk one morning, but not the next day. I'm not sure where I'll stay the next time I have business in Downtown L.A.

The Checkers Hilton in downtown Los Angeles was certainly convenient but I do not view this property as a great representative of the brand. Of course, I knew prior to going it was a Hilton which is trying to assimilate in an old building which likely dates back to the 1920's. This translates into the probability of smaller rooms and may I say, small may not be the world to use as it related to my particular King room. It was smaller than small. If you put the bathroom and closet together, it equaled the size of my room. In any event, the greeting process at the front entrance was none existent. Of course, it is possible the doorman was busy doing something else at the time of my arrival, but there was also no bellman available. Fortunately I was able to handle the luggage on my own and did so without a problem. The lobby is more modern and represents what one would expect in a smaller property but does not represent the nostalgia of the days it was built. Oddly, all signage on property including room numbers, have an elephant logo which is likely from a prior flag or owner which has nothing to do with Hilton. I believe I saw a similar logo on a hotel in Dubai but cannot be sure and I'm not certain what flag was on this property prior to Hilton. Upon entering the room I was surprised with just how small it was. Frankly, it was disappointing. The bathroom was large, modern and full of marble which was pleasant to the eye. My issue in my room (601) was there was a constant noise originating from shaking pipes all through the night and the toilet ran all through the night as well. Further, there was a constant issue with the cable/satellite tv of losing channels throughout my stay. Finally on what turned out to be my last morning at the hotel, the satellite was completely inoperative for a period of three hours which is when I decided to check-out and go to another hotel. Also, the bathroom had mildew on the wall and along the baseboard was filthy dirty. I did have room service which was purely average and I also tried the restaurant which offered a great salad and my entree of fish and chips was severely undercooked. I'm sure this hotel has a chance of doing well and it appears they are trying to do the best they can with what they have to work with. Unfortunately during my stay, it represented a brand of much lower standards and even though I knew it was a \"boutique\" style property, that actually increases my expectation level, not decreases it. I would not stay at this location again as the alternative choices are too great.

Then it got worse -- the 2nd day, my server told me the fruit plate wasn't included! I complained a bit, he said he would see what he could do, and magically a fruit plate did appear, but I only had 2 bread items -- was he trying to \"stick it to me\"?

I have had varying experiences with complimentary HHonors breakfasts, but the norm is usually a continental buffet bar with pastries, breads, cereal, fruit, etc. At the Checkers, I was offered the choice of a basket of bread or toast. I received (for by $12-14 value) exactly 3 miniature pastries that were defrosted within the previous hour. I recommend here taking the extra HHonors points and going to Starbucks across the street. The rooms were nicely appointed, but the large flat-panel lacked high definition feeds. The picture was too grainy on that nice, expensive television to justify it being in the room.

We arrived to a middle room with no wine. I excused myself from the BF to ask the front desk about this - I was told by the concierge that there was no record of my requests, and upon further inspection he noted that this was a Romance Package and apologized for not having the sparkling wine sent up. In addition, the concierge told me that I should have contacted him directly to coordinate the wine and package details. Isn't that why I am paying the higher rate? So that they hotel can coordinate all of this for their guests? Not happy. This was supposed to be a surprise so I didn't want to tell the BF why we were hanging out in the room rather than explore the fun neighborhood. Finally, one hour later, the sparkling wine arrived. In the morning, I had not heard anything about breakfast so I called downstairs and was told that my breakfast vouchers were down there and that the person who checked me in had forgotten to give these to me. We were getting ready to check-out so I asked if I could just have a refund for the Romance Package and just pay regular rate. I was told that the manager was not in until later that day and that someone would have to call me back. Hours later and no call, I called. I spoke with the manager who was fine with refunding me the difference (it was only $50 difference anyway). Not once did she apologize for ruining what I thought would be a romantic surprise. The price difference was not the issue. They ruined the experience. I received the difference refunded to my credit care.

Size wise this is a small indy boutique hotel with a great bar, generally friendly staff, average-sized, clean and comfortable rooms and boutiquey amenity offerings (i.e. not many). Check-in: Went smoothly and quickly, albeit it was 10pm.Elevators are a bit slow at times and for someone as impatient as myself - a considerable frustration...but it's old and retro. Room: Comfortable. Typical Hilton room, while the property itself is not your typical, the room certainly is in it's styling and character. The bathroom had only a walk-in shower(which I prefer), but with nods to an earlier time. Lots of gray and white marble; it was a good size and everything worked well. F&B: Food was typical Hilton, but quite nice. Slightly overpriced, but in line with hotel food costs. Great little bar with fantastic specials on one-day (Thursday??). Nice bar staff, great drinks, nice ambiance. Room service was fairly prompt and got everything right. Property Amenities: A little roof-top pool and seating nice area. Pool is a more oversized jacuzzi tub without the jacuzzi. Nice for sitting and enjoying the weather and if you are into short laps...well at least you have the option. Location:Great downtown location, across from Starbucks and historic Biltmore. Nice walking distance to some of downtown's hot new restaurants and bars, so generally a plus for me.Parking rates are absurd, but on par with other downtown parking/overnight rates. Areas to be improved: Invest in new elevators, you need them. Offer/Improve free wireless OR an evening reception for your guests. You have a lovely bar and are a small property, it'd would be worthwhile investment. Recommendation(?): More personality and individuality than what is offered at LA Live, and a bit less of a cluster, but LA Live probably more interesting for families and kids. This is great for young professionals and yupsters.", "Date": "July 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cunhappy experience\u201d", "Author": "maple95128", "ReviewID": "UR69236379", "Content": "I highly suggest, do not stay in this hotel.

The washroom was clean with decent water pressure, though the counter top was a touch cramped. I have Hilton Honors Diamond status and did not receive my normal perks of a room upgrade or access to an Executive Lounge (they don't have one) but they offered other amenities such as a choice of a free bottle of wine or food plate and chocolate covered strawberries in my room daily. BTW, I don't normally like chocolate or strawberries but they were incredible and I'd recommend ordering them from room service as a dessert. Daily breakfast in the Checkers restaurant was quite good, though I was a little disappointed by my single room service order... though it was decent, it's not what I would expect in a 4^ hotel. The wireless internet was reasonably priced for a business hotel at $9.95 (though leisure travelers may not think so) but the signal was very slow during peak periods of morning and late evening.

It is a short walk to the Pershing Street Metro system and you can take buses everywhere if you don't wish to drive. I went to LA Live for a concert and a Dodgers game so it's good for entertainment options.

We kept having to drive around on the one way streets to find space to have them valet the car. After dropping the car off the reception was nice and gave us our room keys and breakfast vouchers. The doorman were nice and brought our bags upstairs and we tipped them. We asked for advice on where to eat and ate at the best sushi restaurant in the world. I forgot the name (Mitaki or something), a few blocks away and very inexpensive compared to the quality and quantity of food. I've had sushi in Hawaii and this place blew it away. We walked to the concert and noticed that a Holiday Inn was located right across the street from the Nokia Center and that was where we had to pickup the tickets for the concert. So from now on we will probably try and book a room there and check it out. Walking back to the Hilton Checkers at night was kind of sketchy as they have a large homeless population that moves about at night, but we made it back with no problems.

My eldest son is a sophomore at USC and for the past two years I have been searching for a hotel to make my regular place to stay when in town for a visit. Thank goodness I have finally found the Hilton Checkers! It is heads and tails above the Millenium Biltmore, which is right across the street, in terms of both quality of cleanliness and service and far superior to the Hotel Miyako in nearby Little Toyko, which although charming and in a great location, was lacking in quality of room amenities. From the moment we checked in late Tuesday night, I knew that I had made the right decision to book at this property. The lobby was well appointed and the check-in process was completely hassle free. We were given a room with two queen beds on the 11th floor (room 1107), which was close to the elevator bank, but this fact did not result in any excess ambient noise in our room. The room was spacious, the beds extremely comfortable, the a/c in excellent working condition, and the bathroom was well appointed, with dual shower heads and all of the extras you could desire (cotton balls, q-tips, etc..). Even though we were arriving rather late, room service was open and the food we ordered was delicious - the hotel staff was even able to accomodate my son's specific dietary needs and prepare something off menu. But be forewarned - the room service prices were a bit steep! As we were there a total of three nights - and due to my son's illness, spent pretty much the entire time at either the hotel itself or in the immediate vicinity, I had plenty of time to formulate an opinion of both. I was extremely impressed with the attentiveness of the housekeeping staff, who arrived at approximately the same time each day and did a great job consistently. Also, when I needed to add on an extra night during our stay, the person whom assisted me at the front desk was very helpful and made sure that I was able to secure the same great AAA rate. Each time I called down for my car, the valet service was prompt and attentive (although once again, hotel parking is pricey). Honestly, every person with whom I came into contact during our stay was absolutely delightful. The Hilton Checkers will be the only place I stay in Downtown LA from here on out! Just a few comments on nearby restaurants: Directly across the street is a great little bakery called Mocha Java Bakery that has the best croissants (including chocolate!) that I have eaten outside of Paris. At the end of the block across the street is a Starbucks, Robecks Smoothies and Famima, which is an amazing general store that has everything you could possibly imagine, including delicious take away meals that provide a much more affordable alternative to room service. Just another block down on Grant and 7th is an amazing restaurant and take away cafe called Bottega Louis that has a wide array of freshly baked breads, fine French cheeses, and delicious salads, etc.. Just a short drive away (and possibly a walk, depending on how adventurous you are) is Little Tokyo, which is an oasis in the middle of Downtown LA. If you are craving high quality, delicious, Japanese cuisine, then Oomasa is the place for you! We ordered take out for one lunch and two dinners there, and I make sure to visit it at least once during each of my visits. You will not be disappointed.

The room was clean. The room service prompt. Unfortunately, the squeaky girls next door made me feel like I was in a dorm room. The neighbors on the other side started to watch tv at an early hour. The place had thin walls. The other problem was the bar. I came in late, after 11 pm, so maybe the place was closed. But there was a bartender and one gabby patron sitting at one end, so I took up a stool. The bartender never even looked in my direction. She could not have been enthralled by the gabby middle aged guy at the bar. Not worth it--really. After several minutes and no sign that she was aware of my existence, I left. Bad! (The bar at the Biltmore--much better. It was raining so I decided not to venture across the street and went up to the noisy room instead.) The other disappointment was the spa.

On the Hilton website the hotel was described as 'boutique' to warn that it's a small scale hotel, but it's still got 12 stories! It's in a building with a 1920's Art Deco facade, and they carry that theme throughout the small lobby, bar and *really tasty* restaurant. The decor throughout is clean and minimal.

The marble bathroom was big with tub and shower. Our room faced the library and not the street, we were glad for that. The service was outstanding; we were there 20 minutes after 3:00 checkin, and our very nice and professional desk clerk Ivania offered us a free drink in the bar to wait all of 10 minutes for our room to be ready. She took my credit card from our table at the bar and made restaurant reservations for us, and had our bags taken upstairs. We felt very posh! The restaurant was *really* good...and we like food and eat out quite a bit on our travels. The price...well I was on frequent stayer points, I think it's upwards of $225 but hey these days you could probably work a deal! The dinner was a splurge, but still \"only\" $130 with salads, dinner, dessert, coffee, bottle of wine... the cab to Nokia Center (near Staples where the Lakers play) was under $10/15 minutes and then next morning didn't have to check out until noon (after delicious huevos rancheros and chorizo breakfast).

We have both stayed at the Checkers Hilton in the past when we come to LA for business. This visit, we each paid $250 per night. I see in the other reviews the other previous guests (leisure travelers) gave good marks to this property: I am wondering if perhaps these were less seasoned travelers? As seasoned business travelers, we have come to expect more from a business hotel: THE GOOD: *Handy Location to Financial District and Staples Center *Friendly Staff at the front door *Lovely rooftop pool and patio *Spa on site THE BAD: *Filthy Carpeting- our feet turned black after a short time of going barefoot in our room. *The bathroom was filthy- it was evident that the cleaning staff does only light daily cleaning and heavy cleaning had not been done for a very, very long time. *Tile and fixtures dirty and corroded with scale and lime *NOISY: the staff at the Library next door starts the leaf (garbage) blowers at 6:45am EVERY morning in the common sidewalk betwen the buildings. When I asked the front desk clerk about this, she thought it was funny and told me there was nothing she could do. *American breakfast for two will set you back over $50.... and it's the same ingredients you get at Hilton's Embassy Suites buffet...including the nearly undrinkable coffee. The UNFORGIVABLE: *Since the property is so old, the bathroom fixtures are seperate controls. (non mixing valves) This creates a safety issues whereby it is possible for a person (especialy elderly and children) to scald themselves with hot water. When you shower, the water temp fluctuates between hot, cold, warm and then cold again. *The Television in one of our rooms was not attached to the furniture properly, and when adjusted fell off the stand and injured my associate. *No available power outlets at the desk: how is a business traveler supposed to work? *No power outlet in the bathroom: if you want to use the supplied hair dryer, you must use it in a different room other than the bathroom. *The air ducts were so visibly filled with dust, when the (weak) air conditioning is turned on, little particles of dust fly out of the duct work. CONCLUSION: This property is old and tired... no longer charming. It is in need of a major remodel. If you are going to pay this amount of money for a hotel stay, demand that you receive clean, safe, and quiet lodging.

I was able to book a Hilton Reward stay with points, but would readily pay $250-300/night. I had requested a corner king room which was quite spacious with a large bathroom and work desk area. Housekeeping was fantastic and, by asking the front desk to send someone up when I came down for breakfast, my room was immediately and immaculately cleaned. Towels were very plush and large and my requests to have all feather pillows/bedding removed before arrival were filled. I took advantage of Hilton's pre-arrival offer of a complimentary mini-refrigerator which was set-up and cooled down before check-in. There is a small food store, Fammima, around the corner from the hotel on 5th Street where I picked up bottled water, juice, fruit & yogurt.

From reserving the hotel room myself, conversations with \"Robert\" the Hotel Front Desk Manager (arranging a corner room) one week prior to arrival and meeting the Hilton Checkers staff in person - doorman, front desk, maintenance (mini-refrigerator/no charge), housekeeping, bar and restaurant staff -- just OUTSTANDING! Our son picked us up from LAX which was a 15 minute ride to the hotel (traffic was great/Thanksgiving Day). First stop, Ralph's grocery store (corner of 9th Street and Flower Street). Once we arrived at the hotel, as I stated before, the Hilton Checkers staff was very welcoming and warm. We checked in early, room was beautiful, maintained well and clean. Great view of Bunker Hill and Library Tower (tallest building/West Coast). We visited the pool and spa area -- beautiful area and views. We had our Thanksgiving Dinner at the hotel \"Checkers\". Perfect holiday dinner. Food, atmosphere, service and the staff was great. What a great memory for myself and my husband. The next day, my husband went to Starbucks before we went walking (downtown LA). We both felt safe and comfortable in our surroundings. I know that there is a huge amount of homeless people \"wandering\" but we never felt threaten, nor when approach did anyone get upset with us if we did not give out any money. To our surprise, there is quite a lot of sightseeing to behold in downtown LA. First visit, Library Tower and Bunker Hill steps. Walking further North (Hope Street) toward 1st Street, we visited \"Walt Disney Concert Hall\". Heading back South (Grand Ave.) visited MOCA (art museum), Water Court (water garden, shops, restaurants, next to the Omni Hotel) and had lunch at California Pizza. Once lunch was completed, we continue walking back to the Bunker Hill steps (halfway), to Citigroup Center, thereafter, to the Westin Hotel (hotel elevator to the 32nd floor to view the \"Hollywood sign\". Once we exited the Westin hotel onto Figueroa Street, continue South sightseeing (Macy's, etc). Ended our sightseeing at Ralph's and headed back in the late evening/dark (about a 15 minute walk) without any problems, felt safe. Had dinner at \"Pete's Cafe\" (corner of 4th and Main/casual). Great way to end our night with our son and his girlfriend. As my husband and I get older (42 yrs old) we prefer smaller, well-maintained hotels and esp. wonderful customer service.

Not only that but i was trying to be charged for about 8 calls which i hadnt actually made. After an age explaining that i couldnt possibly have made 3 calls all to the same number all at the same time i was let back into my room. The next evening i went for a meal in the hotel restaurant, the food was beautiful. When my bill came approx $100 i left a $20 tip. It was only when i returned to the UK that i found the waitress had taken $100 for the meal $20 for the tip and a further $30 in gratuity. When i checked in i was asked to leave $150 in case i broke anything - something i have never done in any hotel in the whole world. When i checked out the gave me the $150 back in $1 notes. The pool is nice however. To call this hotel a Hilton is an insult to the Hilton name. Stay far clear of this hotel there are plenty of other 4 stars near by.", "Date": "May 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon", "Title": "\u201cHilton Checkers was Great!\u201d", "Author": "ORmamallama", "ReviewID": "UR4986259", "Content": "We made an overnight trip to Los Angeles last week and made a reservation at the Hilton Checkers. I was a little concerned after reading a couple of the reviews, but we were VERY pleased with the hotel. The staff was extremely courteous and went out of their way to help us. The room was small but clean and the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was large and also clean. It's an older building, giving it great charm. Despite its age, it seems well maintained and clean. I was even surprised by the neighborhood. It seems to have improved significantly since I was there last. I wouldn't take my daughter for a walk at night by ourselves, but that is just common sense. The hotel staff cheerfully helped us with local transportation and directions. I'll stay there again if I have more business to do in downtown LA. I wouldn't recommend this hotel as a tourist base. Downtown is not where you want to be, but if you have business in this part of town, this is a terrific place to stay!

Everything in this report is absolutely true and has not been exaggerated. We can see why our travel agent thought the hotel would be terrific. After we got home, we went to the hotel website and saw what she must have seen when she looked at it. The place looks gorgeous on the website. The actual hotel, however, is quite different from what is on the website. The exterior views on the website don't show the ground and the sidewalk outside the hotel. This is because there are drunks and vagrants sitting or sleeping on the sidewalk. The photo of the hotel lobby has been shot with a wide-angle lens to make the actual small, narrow room appear larger. The lobby shot has also been Photo Shopped to make it appear bright and well lighted and to make the marble floor look highly polished. The actual lobby is dark and dreary and has a marble floor that is dull and scuffed. There is even a cheap burgundy colored curtain on one side of the lobby to close off the bar, which is on the other side of the curtain. Is it perhaps against the law to be serving alcohol in a room where there will be children? This might account for the curtain. The mirror in the lobby that looks so bright and well polished is actually in need of having the back re-silvered and the frame is chipped and in need of a paint job. Most of the other photos on the website appear to have been shot with a wide-angle lens, too. If the lobby photo is any indication, the meeting rooms, bar, swimming pool, and restaurant probably don't look like the photos either. The room that we were given was dark, dreary, and not clean. Some time or other (probably not recently) someone had tried to dust the place. This was done with some sort of less than clean damp cloth. The streaks from the cloth were on all of the glass surfaces in the bedroom and bathroom. A film of dust was covering the streaks. The bathroom floor was downright dirty, as was the tub. The linens on the bed had seen better days. The curtains were absolutely filthy, with repulsive looking stains on them. There were also smudges of some sort of black colored stuff on the curtains. The furniture in the room was shabby and consisted of mismatched pieces. The desk chair was particularly old and cheap. Again, all of this differs radically from what is shown of the rooms on the hotel's website. The suite shown on the website looks lovely...and perhaps this suite actually exists at the hotel. Of course, it may have been Photo Shopped, too. The old, worn carpet in our room had stains on it. We wouldn't have wanted to walk on either the carpet or the bathroom floor in our bare feet. The dust in our room was terrible. I have allergies to dust and mold, so I was having trouble breathing within a couple of minutes after entering the room. Even my friend who was with me, who has no allergies, was having trouble breathing after we had been in there awhile. I'm sure that, even though we never ventured up to the rooftop bar, it doesn't look anything like the photo on the website either. The Checkers really has presented an incredibly false impression of the hotel on the website. We called our travel agent from our room and told her what was going on. She found us a room at the downtown Marriott and we left the Checkers less than an hour after we checked in. Our travel agent also called the Checkers and told the desk clerk that we were checking out and why. We left less than an hour after we got there. At least we weren't charged any money. We loved the downtown Marriott, on Figueroa Street, and stay there all the time now when we go to Los Angeles.", "Date": "March 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, CA", "Title": "\u201cWay too small for a four star hotel\u201d", "Author": "lite2shine", "ReviewID": "UR4243015", "Content": "I stayed here for two nights and I was surprised that this hotel is a four star hotel.

But I guess that's L.A. prices for you. I found the bar intimate and the server friendly. On our second visit over Thanksgiving, $129 per night got us a bigger room this time but a smaller bathroom. This room had carpet dirt spots in the entry way. The staff wasn't as friendly has the first visit but they were still helpful in time of need. The room service was timely and the food was ok. I was dissapointed as with the 1st visit that the bar up on the roof was not open to serve us drinks, so we simply took our own drinks up there to enjoy the view.

While shopping around for good deals and a nice place to stay, I had noticed that people are way more likely to write negative reviews than they are to point out the positives. So I knew that regardless of the quality of my stay in CA, I was going to review each hotel once I got back. That being said, we really enjoyed our stay here. We got there a few hours before check in time but the staff was very accomodating and they were able to let us check in early. Our bags were promptly brought up to our room and we were very pleased with all aspects of the room. The beds were probably more comfortable than in any other hotel that I've ever stayed in. The room was spotless and everything was in working order. We ordered room service one night and the food was excellent. There was a billing error with our bill for the food, but it was promptly corrected. My only major complaint would be the location, which has nothing to do with the quality of the hotel. The hotel is located in downtown LA, in the financial district. So if you happen to be there on a weekend, as we were, don't expect to find anything open nearby. We walked several miles hoping to find a restaurant, shop, or really just anything that was open, with no luck. And as with any downtown area, the homeless population was extensive. But still, we felt very safe once inside the hotel. Also, the hotel has a chauffered car service who they use, which really came in handy getting to the airport, for not much more money than a cab. I would defintiely recommend this hotel, as long as you have activities/plans of things to do outside the downtown area.", "Date": "September 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cVery very nice\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3777226", "Content": "The Checkers is a very nice place to stay in the downtown LA.

However, when I dropped something on the floor, I found a seed of some sort where it should have been vacuumed. On the second day of my stay, the bed top cover was left on the floor after housekeeping had made up the room. The bath was smallish -- something you cannot fix with a renovation.

We chose to visit Dallas on the way, we are from Denmark and we really wanted to see some of the bigger cities in Texas, and having stayed at several other Crowne Plaza locations during our trips to the states, we ended up choosing Crowne Plaza Dallas Downtown, while in town. We had read a fair share of bad reviews inhere, but usually we find that Crowne Plaza is a pretty pleasant experience overall, so we decided to give it a go. The hotel has recently been renovated, so the decor and the rooms are really really nice. Nice big rooms, most of them has a great view of the downtown skyline, which is a pretty big deal in Dallas, where the skyline is among the most impressive in America. The room we stayed in had a nice big LG flatscreen, a small fridge and amazing beds. The lobby is pretty impressive and the staff are all very friendly and helpful. The hotel is located right in the heart of downtown Dallas, you can walk to most of the restaurants as well as most of the historic landmarks. At night I would recommend that you do not walk around in the area, as it is pretty much deserted, aside from the occasional homeless people you will see here and there. This is primarily due to the fact that the downtown area, in general, pretty much becomes a ghost town outside of business hours. However the two main reasons for choosing this hotel for your next Dallas stay are the following: 1: It has an absolutely AMAZING pool on the ninth floor, I seem to remember it being on the ninth floor, but I might be mistaking. Anyway you will fall in love with this \"rooftop\" pool immediately, it has the most breathtaking view of the downtown area you could possibly ask for. The hotel is located right across the street from the Bank of America\" skyscraper, which at night is bathed in green neon lighting, it looks just stunning when you are up at the pool in the evening, Lying in the water at night looking at all those amazing futuristic steel and glass skyscrapers, which Dallas has an abundance of, while the airplanes from Southwest Airlines comes cruising by, is an amazing experience. The only I don\u00c2\u00b4t get about the pool is the lack of an outside bar, it would be awesome to enjoy a bear or a drink up there, while relaxing and enjoying the view. 2: Alex! Yeah it might sound weird, I know, but Crowne Plaza in Dallas has the most helpful guy in America as part of their staff. That guy will bend over backwards in order for you to have the most pleasant experience while in the city. We felt so appreciated from the moment we got there because of him, and he made sure we knew where to go for a great meal, what to see in the city and what to avoid. He insisted on carrying our luggage, drive us around the city in the hotel van and he made sure we felt extremely welcome every time we came home from sightseeing or something else - He is truly a great representative of the Crowne Plaza chain as well as Dallas itself - Nothing less!

Overall, the hotel should meet all your needs for a comfortable stay. The staff is friendly, and the service at the front desk was fast. About the rooms... I stayed in a corner room, that according to my friends staying in other rooms, was a little larger than theirs. The room has plenty of closet and drawer space for 2 people. I found the bed comfortable (slightly firm), and there are enough pillows to invite the Cowboy Cheerleaders over for a battle (attempts at holding this event were unsuccessful). The bathroom is a little small, but not a big deal. The WiFi in the room worked just fine. The only negative I found is with the heating/AC unit. It makes a loud sound when it kicks on, and is a little louder than some people will like. As far as the location... you are pretty much downtown, so the streets around the hotel get deserted in the evening and on weekends. But that doesn't mean there is nothing to do. There is a club in the hotel that gets busy on Friday and Saturday. We had the most fun out at the West End and at the Ten Sports Grill on Main St. On the West End, you should check out Dick's Last Resort. Fun spot (maybe not the place for church groups to go wind down after reading Scripture). Lots of other places to imbibe and consume various dead animals (lots of steakhouses surprisingly). We went to the Ten Sports Grill a couple of times to catch some football, and they have a pretty good menu there. The bucket of wings is worth buying. Ask for Jackie to serve you and tell her that her husband says hi. The only things that keep me from rated the hotel a 5 is that for some, they might not like the location (I forgot to mention that the JFK Memorial is also a short walk away), and some people might find the AC loud. If they had a 4.5, I would rate the hotel that.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGood bed, LOUD A/C, tiny bathroom.

Bed was comfy, lots of pillows. Decent (if a bit small) for price. 3) Good downtown Dallas location. Easy walking distance to several decent bars & restaurants (Sonny Bryans Smokehouse, TGI Fridays, Hofbrau Steaks, YO Ranch Steakhouse, etc). 4) Friendly, helpful hotel staff. 5) Good water pressure, nice shower. 6) In-room fridge that was ice cold at check-in! 7) Attentive housekeeping in-room. 8) Very close to DART & bus stops. Some people like this. Some probably find this disconcerting (due to the large amount of people waiting, some panhandling). We were out walking around both nights: no problems. We noticed a large police presence at night. 9) Key for elevator is a nice security touch. 10) Close to historic West End tourist attractions http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_Historic_District_(Dallas,_Texas) The iffy: 1) Loud AC system. The system clonked loudly each time it cycled on and off, and vibrated oddly. Extremely HOT in the hallway (almost sauna like). 2) Very small bathroom. The vanity/sink area was so small I had to put a towel on the floor and use the toilet seat due to lack of vanity space. 3) Some problems with housekeeping OUTSIDE the room (food trays left in the hall more than one day). 4) Problems with parking gate cards not working. Attendant was less than helpful. 5) Breakfast was $15.00 for a Belgian waffle & coffee. This did not taste like a fresh waffle; it looked, felt and tasted frozen and it came with one sad sliced Strawberry. Pretty sad even for a Crowne Plaza. Starbucks is across the street, in the Bank of America building, down the escalator, behind the CVS if you want REAL coffee. YO Ranch Steakhouse (2 blocks down and 2 blocks over) is GREAT! Had a wonderful meal here: a mixed grill of venison, quail and buffalo -- wow! Fabulous! Great wine... superior service. Treat yourself to a wonderful meal at YO Ranch Steakhouse. Overall: Decent hotel for the price. The bed was comfy, plenty of pillows, good shower. Would have to think twice about staying here again unless I specifically needed to be in this area.

SECURITY: Good security as you have to use your key card to go to your floor level. There were large in room safes - big enough to accommodate a laptop. ROOMS: Rooms really needed an update as the furniture was at least 40 years old and the carpet was very old and not up to the Crown Plaza standard. We had a balcony suite but the door had no latch so you could not lock it. There was no outdoor furniture on the balcony and the balcony area was grubby with a bare concrete floor (untiled) which needed a really good clean up and you could not sit out there because there was nowhere to sit. The fridge did not work properly as any milk or water you placed in there became frozen solid. The coffee machine in the room did not work - we reported it to housekeeping but nothing was done to fix anything. At $320 per night including taxes and breakfast we expected better as the suite was very dated and needed new carpet and furniture. BREAKFAST: Approximately US$11 per person for the buffett breakfast which consisted of cereal, fruit, scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, bread/buns and tea/coffee. Probably the same as you would expect at a Holiday Inn Express so not that exciting but the price was right if you do not have breakfast included. INTERNET: Good in room WiFi connection and no problems connecting. CLUB ROOM/FLOOR: There is no Club Room at this hotel but every Wednesday night they have alcoholic welcome drinks and snacks for Priority Club members from 5pm to 7pm. POSITION: Good position and about a 15 minute walk to the 6th Floor Book Depository JFK tour. Good selection of restaurants are within walking distance to the hotel. There is a CVS supermarket just behind the hotel that has a good selection of food products including wine by the bottle at good prices. They do not sell any fresh fruit. A free hotel shuttle van is available for guests to go to shopping or restaurants within a 3 mile radius. TOURS: There are really no tour operators and you really have to arrange your own sightseeing which is a little difficult if you do not have a vehicle. Forth Worth is definitely worth the trip - you can walk to Union Station (about 20 minutes from the hotel) or take the hotel free shuttle and catch the train to Fort Worth Stockyards (about $10 for a day pass that will include most bus trips). Train trip is about 1 hour. When you arrive at Fort Worth you can take a free loop trip around town and include Sundance Square on Molly the Trolly - many choices to have lunch. The trolly will take you back to the rail station where you can catch a bus to The Stockyards which is a very quaint and unique area to spend a few hours wandering around the many shops/restaurants and visiting some of the museums unique to the area.

Hotel right next to the DART West End Station and Transit area which is very convient if you don't have access to a car during your stay. Riding DART is cheap (4$US for a day pass) and it's very reliable. You're also a few minutes away from the West End Historic District that host a fair amount of restaurants. A 10 minutes walk will bring you to a more crowded section of the Main Street for another choice of restaurants. The hotel is also at walking distance from the JFK Memorial and Museum and from a Tourist office. I'm not sure what was wrong with my device, but I couldn't access the hotel wi-fi service in my room.

Our room was fantastic, it had everything we needed and more. They went through a complete remodel just recently so everything was brand new. The housekeeping staff was also very friendly, and made sure we had everything we needed in the room. Besides visiting with family that live near the area, we had an opportunity to see the sites around the hotel, which a lot of them you can just walk to, for instance the Dallas Aquarium (which is Great), The Dallas Zoo, The located where JFK was assassinated and the museum near by. Also the Hotel has a very modern looking nightclub, that I wish we had an opportunity to experience but unfortunately, No babysitter...To make it short, there was a ton of things to do there and not enough time. On the nights we didn't go out and eat we decided to eat at the restaurant in the hotel. There food was really good, they had a little bit of everything on the menu and all the items we had eaten they were all top notch. So to sum up our experience at the hotel I would just say it was incredible, from the staff and the way we were treated to the hotel accommodations and then the food.

I love the downtown area and it has easy access to the freeway. The first problem was arriving two hours prior to check-in. I spoke with the front desk clerk and i understood i was two hours early and could not check-in. i had a request to stay on an upper floor and i was assured the room was on the 19th floor however it wasnt ready yet. I left the hotel and returned at 4:30 (an hour and a half after check-in) I once again went to the front desk clerk who was not the same as the first person and not very nice, I checked in and was told my room was still not ready three and a half hours after i first arrived (i could have cleaned the room in that amount of time). Now i was told my room would be on the 16th floor, this was ok . I also asked about upgrading to a room with a balcony which i saw on the website but guess they are just for show, the clerk said you can't access the balconies because they are not up to code. (HINT: dont advertise something if something is obviously unavailable). On arrival to the room, there was one bar of very small soap and hair conditioner, i called housekeeping several times with no answer just an answering machine i did not leave a message. I did have a great view of the pool and was ready to get in that evening since it didn't close until 11:00pm. i got into the shower and 10 minutes later i hear someone open the rdoor to my door and say housekeeping. I could not understand why they would be just walking into the room i yelled and he went away. i notified the front desk as i was leaving for dinner about the toiletries and inquired about the time the pool closed.again i was told 11:00. So i went out for dinner and returned to find the toiletries. The second problem was parking. I was in a vehicle that was taller than the entrance to the parking deck i was given two options of parking, 1. in an unsecure parking lot across the street however you could only park ther unitl midnight, 2. a fenced parking area several blocks from the hotel. We ended up parking behind the building in a very unsecure location. back at the hotel from dinner, i decided to go for a swim got into my suit and walked to the pool what do i see a pool closed sign, back to the room. Once in the room i felt rather warm although i had put the thermostat to 71 degrees prior to leaving for dinner. i think it was more like 75 degrees all night long. The bathroom area is so small there may be a 2-3 inch clearance between the door and toilet when the door is open. The next day i after a long day at Six Flags i wanted to take a swim but no the pool was closed again, another disappointment. After another warm night of sleep i got up to use the restroom and almost fell entering the bathroom because the sink was now leaking. I did let the front desk clerk know of some of the problems experienced and he was nice enough to take the 16.00 dollar movie charge off the bill. There was one part of the hotel that was great and it's the restaurant \"THRIVE\" nice decor and great breakfast but a little expensive. Also three of the four front desk clerks i met were really nice. I definitely think this hotel was very overpriced for a king leisure room my rate the first night was $149 the rate the second night was $129, at most i think the rooms should not be over $70.", "Date": "July 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "dallas", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel\"\u201d", "Author": "jayjay201082", "ReviewID": "UR71067419", "Content": "I keep coming back to the Crown Plaza Hotel.

As far as location is concerned, it is walking distance from several eating establisments. I highly recommend going over to Market Street, where there is everything from a Sonny Bryant's, Spaghetti Warehouse, TGI Friday's, and a Butcher Shop Steakhouse. The hotel is also right down the street from the Texas School Book Depository at Dealy Plaza. To check into the hotel, you must pull into the self-park garage and get a ticket. There is no valet parking. When you get inside, mention to the hotel clerk that you are parked in the garage and they will activate your hotel key for entry and exit into the garage. The hotel has a nice restaurant, which I used every day at lunch. The food is good and reasonably priced. There is also a hotel bar, and a nightclub which is open on the weekend. This can be a plus or a minus, depending on your perspective. I found it to be a minus. The nightclub patrons practically take over the hotel, from the garage, to the lobby, to the elevators, to the rooms and they make plenty of racket. I awoke one time at 4am to revelers on the pool deck, even though it is clearly marked that it should be closed at 11pm. I also witnessed several club goers horsing around in the elevators, which can be rather annoying. They must make a lot of money from the club, but as a hotel guest I would suggest closing it down because it detracts from the overall hotel experience. The room was very nice and clean. It had the standard hotel amenities, as well as a mask and earplus so you can sleep better. You might need them on the weekends when the nightclub is open, although they may cause you to oversleep your alarm. The internet connection was very flaky at first, but improved during the week. The staff told me they were in the process of changing from one internet provider to another, and that they had to change the router that they were using. My room included a refrigerator, but no microwave although I heard from other guests that the hotel could lend one if you requested it. We were also working at the hotel, and generally speaking they were easy to work with. The first thing that concerned me were the amount of maintenance they were doing on the floor where we were working, and the noise was rather distracting.

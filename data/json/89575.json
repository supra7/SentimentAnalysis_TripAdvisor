This hotel gave me such a fantastic experience that it seems wrong to keep it to myself. I would like to start out by saying that I didn't even get to spend twelve hours here, since it was sort of a pit stop between having dinner with an old friend and an early morning flight home to California, but I still experienced a thoroughly wonderful stay and was actually sad to leave. I checked in around 9:30 PM after every single staff member had greeted me (and opened every door, including the elevator). Since I had booked through a third party discount deal, I was completely flabbergasted to find that they had placed me on a high floor with a stunning view of the harbor, which was utterly breathtaking in the morning. Every nook and cranny was gracefully clean and well-appointed. As someone who is in charge of cooking and serving breakfast at home, it seemed a waste to pass up a rare chance to have a customized breakfast order, so I placed one for 7:00 AM before enjoying a shower and good night's sleep in some seriously quality linens. The next morning the food got me out of bed right on time, and the poor guy was nothing but gracious as I stumbled around sleepily in a robe and slippers (both the hotel's) trying to politely decline his offer to pour my coffee, which was lovely and hot even after he had left. My last half hour at the Boston Harbor was spent savoring a quiet and fantastic fresh breakfast overlooking a ridiculously beautiful view -- feeling sort of like a princess or at least a temporary member of the \"one percent\" -- before it was off to the airport and back to reality. Of course, I didn't have to lift a finger or even really ask the staff to help me get a taxi -- all part of the service, an expression you don't hear anymore because full service is so hard to find in 2012. I have never stayed in a hotel that took so much care and effort to make EVERY guest feel welcome and comfortable each step of the way. My only (tiny) lament is that the old friend from the night before made me promise not to book a hotel, and stay with her instead, the next time I visit Boston. Ah ... I will think about it.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExceptional in every way.\u201d", "Author": "Steve P", "ReviewID": "UR126467695", "Content": "We stayed here for three nights while in Boston for a March Break getaway with our two children (ages 8 and 5).

I need to say I am a travel agent (Journeys Around the World) but this was a mother-daughter weekend. Loved the location and its proximity to the North End (Italian), Quincy Market, and Aquarium. Have stayed at several large hotels in Boston over the last few years and found the BHH a wonderful experience. The hotel is very friendly and definitely committed to attentive service. Had a Deluxe City View room that was excellent. Very spacious. Wonderfully comfortable beds and linens. Love having the light switches which can be accessed from bed & having outlets by the bed to plug in electronics nearby. Room had a nice sitting area with second TV. Very quiet, no street noise. Turndown service in the evening included Fiji water and fruit -- a wonderful touch! Although there was no coffee pot in the room, they did have a coffee service set up in the lobby. It seemed that was put away around 8am but then the Seagrille Restaurant would give you a free coffee to go. Did see a room with a harbor view and of course those views were also wonderful. From the moment you walk in, with the doormen, reception staff and helpful concierge you know you are in someplace special. There are gorgeous flower arrangements in the public areas and public area for sitting close to the Seagrille restaurant and harbor side. The furniture in the public areas and in the rooms are traditional and very stately looking. Ate at the Seagrille Restaurant for lunch and enjoyed the wonderful harbor view. We ate a lobster salad roll and a crab salad and both were excellent. The clam chowder was also great. After touring one day when it was cold, we went into the Rowe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bar upon our return and they made us some nice hot coffee and hot chocolate drinks. The Bar is heavily wood paneled and very cozy feeling. They are known for the largest scotch selection in Boston. Did not eat the Meritage restaurant but saw they have some wine tasting events for only about $25. Bathroom has Asprey products which I had not seen before in a hotel and were very nice. The towels were extra plush. Of course, there were nice slippers and robes too. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the spa or gym but they looked nice and there is a saltwater lap pool, steam rooms, sauna, Jacuzzi, spa treatments, etc. This is definitely a hotel I will stay at again.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cExceptional and Truly Special Hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "seashell52", "ReviewID": "UR125948824", "Content": "This hotel has exceptional service, spectacular boston harbor views and lovely rooms.

We booked a city view room but received a complimentary upgrade to a harbor view which was a lovely spacious room. My daughter was given cookies and milk every night which she loved. The room was very quiet and we slept very well in comfortable beds. Breakfast buffet was good but just one small complaint, the room is very small and we had to wait, but not for long! And we realised on our final day that you could order cooked items that were not on the buffet! We had drinks early evening in the bar, which was very nice and the staff were very kind to our daughter. One other small thing, and I hate to say this having had such a lovely stay, but I think the hotel is probably in need of a complete upgrade as it is looking a little tired and it is a bit outdated now.

Second there is no way to preview your bill on the tv or with a print out slipped under your door.

But it got me thinking, and I asked him to organize a bottle of champagne and strawberries in the room upon our arrival. I told him what time we were expecting to get to the hotel, and he organized it to perfection. We showed up at 7pm as planned on Friday night, and the ice had not even begun melting. Trust me, I won some points. We had a wonderful room overlooking the harbor, the hotel was first class all the way throughout the weekend. Wonderful location, great food, excellent service...Thoroughly enjoyed it. I wish we could have stayed longer.

We also had a great view of the Wharf. The location of the hotel was perfect for us. Since it is located right on Rowes Wharf, it's within walking distance to Quincy Market, Feneuil Hall and the North End. After a long day of touring Boston in the rain, we were too tired to venture out again for dinner, so we decided to eat in the hotel at the Rowes Wharf Sea Grill restaurant. I'm always skeptical of hotel food, however we had one of the best meals of our entire trip at this restaurant. Our initial plans were to stay at the Four Seasons Boston, however after unsuccessfully trying to book a room online for the four of us (they only allow three to a room) we decided to stay here and am very happy we did!

Maybe they treat conference guests different than others but I didn't have a fantastic experience here- contrary to most reviewers. My husband and I got in late Tuesday night for a stay through Saturday. First impression was a total wow. Everyone was really nice. We didn't get the waterfront view- but the view of the city was nice. The room looked really nice-very colonial- beds turned down when we got in the room. It wasn't until daylight though that I started noticing the \"scratches and dents\" so to speak. First, the bathroom was not great. The shower was horrible. There was barely any water pressure. The toilet made a weird beeping sound- intermittently. I couldn't tell what exactly would set it off but every so often it would just start chirping. Our room was very small so you could barely open the door without hitting the corner the closet was built into. Room service could barely get a cart through. I practically walked into it several times coming into the room. The last really terrible part about the place is the walls are paper thin!!!! I could hear everything and we were right next to the elevator so that's all I could ever hear- especially in the morning. It was sooooo annoying- especially when I wanted to sleep in late on Saturday. Oh also- there was construction or something going on and without warning when I walked out the back door I got sprayed over my head by the guy washing windows. Not cool. The hotel is actually in a very good location. Close to Quincy Market/Fanueil Hall, T stops, the New England Aquarium and a short-ish walk to Little Italy. The \"service\" and employees are great but you sure do pay for it. It's like my husband says- the price of the hotel is really just for the service. It wasn't a spectacular facility. It felt very old. Everyone was nice up until check out. Once I got home I realized there was an extra breakfast charge on our room.

The hotel grounds and exterior are grand and gorgeous. The inside is rather small but still nice enough for a super expensive hotel. Its nothing like the Willard in D.C. No crazy chandeliers, ornate ceilings, or huge vases of flowers that get changed out daily. The hotel itself is \"older\". There are certain areas that could use an update and maybe a good cleaning. We got a deluxe superior room facing the harbor. My mouth dropped as soon as we walked in the door. The view was incredible. Definitely a million dollar view. The room itself was very large with a nice living area, a dressing area and bathroom. It was clean but had a weird muggy odor. The spa and gym area were very nice-huge!! the bottom of the pool and spa seemed a bit dirty- a nice cleaning would do the trick. The shower in the Locker rooms were fantastic! Far different from the room shower. The room shower was a total trick and definitely disappointing. It literally trickled... and it was so close to the front of the shower, I wondered how larger people shower comfortably in there. As far as the service goes, it was hit or miss. My conception is that for a five star hotel at the prices that we were paying, the service should be top notch. Plus, with all the positive reviews on yelp and trip advisor, I was expecting some pretty spectacular service. Not normal hotel or even below service. The front desk and concierge were part of the good but it seemed like everyone else missed the good service bus and took a mental vacation from working in the hospitality industry. The door was never opened for us on the first day. It would have been nice for the door man to greet us as we walked in. We had to hail our own cab. Not a big deal, it was right in front of the hotel. The lady working in the locker room was rude or maybe she was just confused? Whichever the case, I was having trouble using the locker lock and instead of explaining to me how to use it- nicely- she pretty much gave me towel and rushed out without explaining. I found out from another guest how to use the lockers. I must say that day two was much better than the day we checked in. It made us think, how come we didn't get service like this the day before? This review is based on what we paid and the service we received. If the place wasn't so darn expensive, I probably wouldn't have given Boston Harbor Hotel such a mediocre review. The view was spectacular but there are other hotels on the waterfront that are three times less expensive with comparable service. In the future, I'll be staying at one of those.

In four days we walked 31 miles, even walking to the U.S. Constitution and up the 294 steps of the Bunker Hill Monument., Boston is a great walkiing city and so easy to get around, especially with the T which took us to Harvard. The there is the Harbor Cruise we took (90 minutes) to the outer islands and around the bay. Back to the hotel, we are light sleepers and NEVER heard a sound in our room. A big plus. Room was nice, not much different in size from any other nice hotel (smallish bathroom) and decorating was very pleasing. The room was always spotless. There are so many awesome restaurants in Boston that we chose not to eat at the hotel but we did spend our first night eating a small meal outside on the dock while listeniing to their blues band play. I had the Ipswich clams and they were a bit off. Only ate 1/4 of them. Waiter didn't seem to care. Only other thing we didn't like was in their bar which is inside the restaurant. The head bartender was full of himself and even berated and chastised two of the waiters right in front of us. (Only 6 stools at the bar.) I had to ask for water three times before I finally got some from a different bartender. It was about 5:00pm and three bartenders were setting up the bar and taking inventory They were constantly talking to each other and never tried to be friendly with anyone at the bar. It was like we were in the way. Being such a small bar, it was very distracting and not relaxing at all, so we left to find a quieter place to sit. Apart from that one incident, the stay was perfect. Oh, and the health club was awesome. The hot tub was almost as big as a small livingroom! My husband would go down every morning to get his workout in and they had a room set up with coffee, juice, TV, etc. So at least he could bring coffee up to the room without using room service. The spa was immaculate, including the locker room, which was huge. The pool was Olympic size. Perfect location to walk to Quincey Market for a bite to eat and close to the North End where we ate at Giacomo's for dinner. Long wait but worth it. Lots of fun. Ate great steamers at Rusty Dog at Quincey Market and had a wonderful lobster roll at the restaurant at the Marriott Long Wharf, the way a lobster roll should be (chunks of lobster, a bit of mayo and a bit of celery stuffed inside a hot dog bun that is toasted).

We absolutely loved it, and it was our favourite of the three hotels we stayed in during our trip to Boston and New York. The staff were extremely helpful and the attention to detail was very good. Our room was stunning. We had a harbour view room, which was well worth paying the supplement for as the view across the harbour towards the airport is spectacular, seen through floor-to-ceiling windows. The room was very big, with a large seating area in front of the window, and a separate dressing area, as well as a great bathroom with Penhaligon's toiletries. The turndown service always left us each a bottle of Fiji water. One of our favourite features of the hotel was the breakfast. The serving staff were great, and couldn't do enough for you. For instance, one day I hadn't finished my orange juice and instead of leaving it, they gave it to me in a sealed plastic cup to take away, and filled the cup up to the top as a bonus! When we were leaving breakfast each day, they always offered us a coffee to take away. And the breakfast, which we had on an inclusive rate, was always too large to finish. On the Saturday, they offered a buffet-style breakfast, rather than a la carte, but the buffet offered a very varied selection and we liked it just as much. We also loved the swimming pool and spa. Gym clothes are provided for you if required, and the pool is around 20m long, so ideal for swimming lengths. The spa had a calming atmosphere and I had a fantastic massage one day. If we were to find (slight) fault with the hotel at all, it would be to point out that its location is not right in the centre of things. It's around a fifteen minute walk from the Freedom Trail, for example, and 5-10 minutes from the subway. But it's hardly out of town either, and there are plenty of taxis available.

The bathroom was lovely, with a separate vanity area, bench and large mirror outside the bathroom to allow more than one person to get ready. Nice touch.

When we went to the pool/spa and had to sign a waiver at the front desk and the man at the desk greeted me by name even though: 1) I have an unusual name; 2) he was looking at the waiver upside down; and 3) I hadn't written particularly legibly. I felt like wherever I went the staff knew who I was! It was almost a little creepy... The spa had a steam room, sauna, several showers with toiletries, hairdryers, etc. It was a very nice spread and everything seemed to be thought of. Although I was very disappointed that the whirlpool was not working while I was there.... I was a little disappointed with the ground floor public spaces of the hotel. There was very little seating and lounges where you could sit and talk. Also, we parked in the hotel parking garage. They charge by the calendar day and not by the hour so our less than 24-hour stay cost $68 for parking ($34 per day). This was my first time staying in Boston so I can't comment how this hotel compared to other Boston options - but I wasn't disappointed with it. It was extremely close to Quincy Marketplace!

We wanted to stay someplace on the ocean and we have two dogs, and found it's really hard to find someplace right on the beach that pets are allowed. So we decided to look at Boston because it's on the ocean and we though we might take a ferry ride (we learned that the Harbor Cruises do allow pets on the sightseeing tours). I was going to stay at the Residence Inn Tudor Wharf, which as a Marriott rewards member I knew would be consistent and good as usual. But it appeared to be a bit more on the river, and since we usually order take-out because of the dogs, we really wanted a room with the view. I had been searching hotels in Boston and kept coming back to the Boston Harbor Hotel, but wasn't sure I wanted to spend the money for it. When I looked at their web site, I couldn't help but call the hotel to see what they might have available. The night before we were going, I was fortunate enough to speak to Debbie, one of the managers, who was extremely helpful and was able to give me a great rate in a Harborview room. I decided then that I would pamper myself and my husband, because we had been working really hard lately! Was I ever glad I did!!! From the moment we arrived at the hotel, I would say SERVICE is the first word I could say about the hotel, and that word continued throughout our stay. I'm amazed at hotels like this where the people get to know your names, and even the names of our dogs as we took them in and out. When we got into our room though, I heard my husband say \"Wow!\" as he looked at the view. We were on the 8th floor which had an amazing view of the harbor and we could see the ocean beyond. I felt as though I could just sit there looking! But there was one glitch - the room we were in didn't have windows that opened, and I knew that some did, even if every so slightly, and I wanted to be able to hear the sounds of the harbor! Never fear - I called the front desk and they said there was an identical room right next door, and they moved us immediately. That night we ordered dinner from their more casual restaurant and my husband said it was the best clam chowder he ever had. I had also inquired about staying a third night with Debbie, and she sent me a nice note back saying she would extend the rate. She was working at night so I never did get to meet her, but based on our phone conversations and notes, I felt like I knew her, or at least I knew that she was taking care of us as a guest. The decor was beautiful, and the housekeeping staff was great as well as the bellhops, just everyone! We also both were able to use the pool, which is huge, and the whirlpool which was the best I was ever in (really hot and big). My husband also sprung for the deep tissue massage that was really something. It's so easy to get to the spa, you just take the elevator straight down without having to walk around the hotel in your swimsuit - that was a little plus I really liked. Finally, the location is really nice.....very central to everything, including the wonderful new greenway that was marvelous for walking the dogs, but not as busy and crazy as the scene down by the Marriott LongWharf where we took the cruise. On the cruise I was able to see the location of the Residence Inn, and it looked very nice, but not like the view from the Boston Harbor Hotel. Now I'm spoiled - if I ever go to Boston again, I'm going to want to splurge for this hotel!!!

We were given a small suite to replace the horrible smelling first room, and the room with pet hair was eventually better cleaned and clothes that had picked up pet hair were laundered by the hotel at no charge to us. But, it took a day and half before anyone at the hotel even admitted that it was \"pet friendly\"! We just kept thinking how strange it was that someone had an animal in their room!

We booked the bed and breakfast package and it was simple stunning. I was concerned because I booked late I wouldn't be able to get a smoking room, but it was no problem. Our room had wrap-around windows of the harbor and the city, and it was simple huge! I booked the superior room, but I think it was the deluxe due to the size. The B and B package included valet parking, breakfast (in-room or at Intrigue) and late check-out. To me, its the combo of classic, modern and great views with superior service which wins. The view was awesome, just like the hotels website shows. A great view over the harbor, towards the airport, so a nerd like me with my laptop could ID which planes where taking off at the exact time. My fiancee really liked the comfy bed, and she was most impressed when I went out to the store she called guest services and asked where the ice machine was! Turns out its complimentary, and when the room service attendant arrived, they brought her chocolates and strawberries as a \"i'm sorry\" gift because she wandered the hall for 10 minutes looking for the ice machine. We went out for a while, then returned and found our room refreshed for turndown. They actually hung my pants and shirt! I was impressed. We ordered room service pizza which arrived in 22 minutes, exactly 10 minutes earlier than stated. It was really good. In the morning, we had breakfast at the restaurant, mainly avoiding room service because my fiancee wanted pancakes. The buffet was decent, a little lacking in service, however, I thought the food was above average. She was a little disappointed that there were no pancakes available, but she lived! Coffee was ok, not great which you would expect, but thats personal taste. The service here is amazing. Yes, it beats the only FS I've stayed at. I came downstairs looking for the coffee place, and the second I had a puzzled look on my face, two guest services people jumped on me and asked \"sir, may I be of assistance\".

After checking rates on the usual big name online travel sites, we reserved a Harbor View Superior Room only three days prior to arrival at a fantastic rate of $275 through the hotels own web site which I found offered the best rate. I did notice however, that prices nearly doubled for dates just after the weekend of our stay. I assume now this is due to a seasonal rate change occurring just following our weekend, but it certainly emphasized to me the good deals that can be had when visiting even 4 and 5 star city hotels during slow seasons. Due to low occupancy that weekend and plenty of availability, we were able to get a complimentary upgrade upon checkin from a Superior to a Harbor View Deluxe room through our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI Prefer Guest Benefit Program\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which was free to join on the respective web site (benefits of which also included late checkout and complimentary internet access, though we did not use the internet benefit so cannot speak from experience). We enjoyed ourselves immensely and would recommend a stay at this hotel to anyone. Arrived promptly at 3PM which is the official checkin time, and was immediately met curbside by a very courteous Valet attendant who also made sure to see if we needed help with any bags. We stepped through the inviting front door held open by an equally attentive doorman and were immediately impressed with the simple yet refined elegance that greeted us in the main lobby. We found the ambiance and d\u00c3\u00a9cor within the main lobby area and through out the hotel to be very classy yet not so overly extravagant as to feel pompous. Our Harbor View Deluxe room was fantastic and very memorable. At 525 square feet (according to their web site), the room felt very large and was finely appointed with a multitude of amenities. We were on the 8th floor which is actually the FIRST floor of guest rooms, but would suggest requesting a higher level floor to really maximize your enjoyment of the superb view of Boston Harbor through the large picture window in the separate sitting area the Deluxe accommodations offer. The sitting area included business desk, couch and upholstered chairs, short cornered curio that housed a second TV, two lamps and end tables, and fine, heavy window treatments. The sleeping area was equally cozy with a very comfortable king bed (in our case) with very good quality linens and hypoallergenic down like pillows. There was a decent size flat screen TV and accompanying DVD player directly across from the foot of the bed sitting atop a large bureau, and included multiple High Definition channels along with other digital cable channels. A Bose Wave sound system also rested easily within arms reach on one of the night stands beside the bed. Arriving back at our room later in the evening, the room had undergone turn down service and we were greeted with soft relaxing lighting, drawn drapes, soothing classical music playing on the Bose system, bottles of Fiji spring water with accompanying water glass on each night stand, and soft white slippers impeccably position on either side of the bed on a white cloth matt. Under darkness now, the details of an even well thought out lighting design were evident as I found combinations of small, soft lighting in strategic locations very conducive to relaxation and coziness within the room. While not exceptionally extravagant, we were impressed with the overall bath retreat that was actually made up of three separate rooms. An open doorway led from the sleeping area into a short sort of foyer like hall with closet, bureau, and powder area with upholstered bench and large mirror. From here a closable door led into a middle room with vanity and wall-to-wall mirror and the usual appointments. Finally, through yet one more door was a separate, third room with the shower/tub combination and toilet. All three rooms had elegant marble flooring. Also provided, and thoroughly enjoyed, were the obligatory plush terri cloth bathrobes, and premium Pen Haligons shower and bath products which smelled heavenly. Due to our plans, we were unable to experience dining at the hotels signature restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMertitage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but we stopped by to take a look and it had a very hip, stylish look and ambiance and is definitely something we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to try during our next visit. We did however enjoy a lite dinner and some wine at the secondary eatery \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIntrigue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which was a very nice, relaxing experience with elegant, classy d\u00c3\u00a9cor and ambiance as well, though more casual than Meritage. Late Friday night, after the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTaste of the Mediterranean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 food and wine event that we attended in a large room on the second floor, we found a cozy two seat table in the Rowes Wharf Lounge under subdued , low lighting with soft music and indulged in even more wine from a rather impressive selection while just relaxing and taking in the classy atmosphere. The following morning, we went down to what was probably my favorite aspect of this hotel, the Fitness Center/Spa. We did not have time for any spa treatments this visit, but the small spa lobby looked and felt very cozy and inviting. Through the spa lobby was the entrance into the fitness room and pool area. The pool while relatively small, was a rather pleasant area that really facilitated relaxing. There was a 3 lane lap pool with surrounding chairs under beach umbrellas, and a large very enticing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shaped hot tub. Just beside the pool and hot tube was a small relaxing lounge with chairs and couch with TV, daily newspapers, complimentary tea, coffee, orange juice, and big fresh oranges. A soothing choice of relax inducing music was also playing through out the pool area. Checkout on Saturday arrived far to quickly, reluctantly drawing us back to a cold March New England reality from the previous nights comforting indulgences. Checkout, however, went as smooth and easy as checkin. A cheerful doorman grabbed our bags and offered two bottles of Fiji sprint water for the road. All in all, we would definitely recommend a stay at the Boston Harbor Hotel and wait anxiously for our own return visit.", "Date": "April 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maplewood, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cNow this is how to do 5-star!\u201d", "Author": "hartss", "ReviewID": "UR14695059", "Content": "The Boston Harbor Hotel is a bracing antidote to that \"all hotels are starting to look the same\" feeling I have had lately, especially in Boston.

It had a large bathroom with a full-length mirror, large mirror and closet in the entry hall, king-sized bed, TV in the bedroom, sitting area with couch, chair, desk and another TV, and a large window overlooking the city. If it had a small kitchen, it could have passed as an efficiency apartment. We had a view of the city from our window. While the harbor would have been preferable, it snowed every day and was foggy. Therefore, we could not have seen much of the water. The hotel is located about three blocks from Quincy Market, Fanuiel Hall, etc. Since Boston is a walking city, I was easily within walking distance of the historical locations. If you are a man, skip this part. If you are woman, the toiletry items are Penhaligon's of London, Blenheim Bouquet fragrance. Really cute bottles, great fragrance. The staff was excellent. The doormen, the housekeeping staff, the front desk employees, room service, and the concierge were always more than ready to make our trip as wonderful as it was.

If there is a negative about the hotel, it is the very noisy doors. I booked months in advance and asked for the most quiet room possible since I have a sleep disorder. Our room was in the center hallway, by no means the most private area. Desk staff did attempt to reassign us the second day, but the rooms (2 we looked at) had obstructed views. The decision was made to put up with the noise from the banging doors which didn't prove to be a major problem. The first day of our stay, several children were in the room next door and in/out every few minutes, but the next day our neighbors were more considerate. There is a definite noise issue with the bang after each door closes, even if you try to pull it shut as gently as possible. I was told that the hotel is working on that problem. It would not stop me from staying there again, but certainly a consideration when booking. The location is perfect in our opinion. We had dinner out two evenings at the hotel restaurant while we enjoyed performances on the Blues Barge. This is seasonal entertainment and we were there with perfect weather (August 25-30). Staff was attentive and helpful. Our room, with a separate sitting area, was spotless. Free water and fruit each day. Well worth the extra expense for a harbor view. We were celebrating a very special anniversary and I was surprised that it was not mentioned by staff, etc. We didn't expect anything, but every year we visit a city to celebrate our anniversary and some hotels are very thoughtful about a special day. As a tip, I found that by booking directly via the hotel's website, I got a much better price than I could get from anywhere else.

From the time the valet parked our car, to the check out the next day, the staff made us feel like royalty! We have never been to Boston, or any of the East Coast before, so it can be somewhat daunting to find your way around, and decide what and where you want to go. The Bellman first put our bags up, and then spent a good amount of time helping us get aquainted with the city. The concierge was also a huge help to us, and gave us some good advice on where to go when you have a limited time to be in Boston. I read every travel book I could get my hands on before we got to Boston, and I swear this concierge could have written his own book! The concierge staff at this hotel work 24 hours, literally. Since we arrived late in the day, we were tired, so we had room service delivered. They set up a table right next to the window overlooking the Boston Harbor, and all the lights. I do not think I have ever had a more romantic hamburger in my life! The room service was prompt, and the food was still hot. My husband and I were trying to get in as much as we could of Boston, and we were really pushing for time the day we had to leave. We were running late from sighseeing, and were coming up to the door of the hotel, telling the staff we had to be at the airport A.S.A.P.! The whole staff went into action to get us to the airport on time. The valet got our car quickly, and seeing how winded we were from running around, offered us bottled water for the road. The Concierge printed out directions to the airport, and the front desk checked us out at warp speed. We got to the airport in time, thanks to the hotels efficiency. The only things about this hotel that we were not crazy about, was getting to the hotel. It is difficult to get to, because of all the construction going on, but the hotel cannot help that. There was no noise in the room because of the construction. The other thing I thought could have been better, was that the bathroom did not match the elegance of the rest of the room. It was quite plain, with a regular white shower/tub. WIth these kind of rooms, service, and price, I really expected the bathrooms to be as luxurious as the rest of the hotel. We have talked about going back to this hotel again next summer. This time we would allow ourselves more time to enjoy the city, and this amazing hotel.", "Date": "June 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Wedding!!!\u201d", "Author": "cswg", "ReviewID": "UR7686428", "Content": "If there was a rating over Excellent I would have checked that off.

I have also attended a party at this location, and I didn't like the entrance back then either. But the halls are really nice, and service was exceptional.

My pre-arrival conversations and email correspondence were attended to timely and professionally but also with a refreshingly sincere friendliness.

Additionally, the staff in the various departments followed up with me personally during my stay to ensure their particular departments were responsive to our needs and even suggested things I had not yet considered (talk about anticipating your guests' needs!).

This Hotel Owner does not understand the concept of the \"The Customer is always right.\" \\ The rooms are from the 70s and the elevator is old & rickety. You will hear the sound from outside noise from party goers or the cars on the Freeway. It appears the windows are not well insulated. Some were even broken. We had to be moved three times. The owner has Horrible customer service. The hotel has a small & tightly arranged parking lot. Cars are easily damaged. We do not recommend this pit hole!!!! The employees indicated that the Owner/Manager treats the employees poorly, frequently yells at them and makes them cry. We believe them because he yells at his customers too, in front of other customers. One employee was forced to work two double shifts (double doubles). She was there for 48 hours straight. I seriously doubt he paid her overtime. Especially since he said he was going to fire her. The owner thinks he is superior to his employees, as well as his customers. Just because he is the owner of this dump... During the morning we checked-out, the owner tried to double charge us for the pet fee. Keep your receipts as we did. When we showed him our receipt, He said, \"go back to your room!\" He then called our room harassing us 4 times after we showed him our receipts that morning. He wanted to increase the room rate that we were charged. When we objected, he called us \"cheap A ^&$%$&&% bas@##$$~tards\" (because we complained about the rooms, the condition and his bad service.) The Owner is from India and it appears he needs to learn about USA hospitality standards. We were harassed and given a verbal threat.. He said he was going to \"kill us\"... reaching under the counter...really!!!!!! Do not give your money to this business...Someone needs to inspect this location and look into the owner... We were treated better by his employees... The owner said he was going to fire his employee who worked double doubles both nights we were there... She's gonna get fired because she spoke Spanish with us... She did not, but regardless, it sounds discriminatory to me...

I should have known the second I saw what appeared to be a lagoon shaped pool of toxic waste in front of the place. \"Is that a pool?\" I asked my boyfriend. \"It must have been,\" he replied. The checkin process was rather strange and the coffee in the lobby was empty, apparently until further notice. The internet was not currently functional on the circa 1998 computer made available to users in the lobby. Under strict supervision and with frequent reprimands. Wireless internet was not available. We were pleasantly surprised by the size of our room which featured two Queen size beds and a roomy (but semi functional) bathroom. We were exhausted the first night of our two night stay and fell asleep without noticing the substandard air quality and freezing temperatures. It was literally close to freezing in our room and despite numerous calls to the front desk we were not even given extra blankets to ease the chill. We woke the next morning to the front desk pounding on our door telling us it was time to go, although we were planning to stay two nights and had prepaid on line. We went downstairs to consult the woman's computer but unfortunately the whole system was down. Since we were the only guests they elected not to offer the usual continental breakfast. With no where within easy walking distance to get food we looked at one another and said, \"let's bounce\". We then snuck out the side door at the far end of the pool to avoid having to explain this to the front desk lady. The stay was, without a doubt, the creepiest I have experienced.

It was \"deluxe\" because it was poolside, The weather was beautiful, not a cloud in the sky, and yet the pool had no water in it. Soo already a big waste of money. In the room itself, there was: -no internet (internet is promised in each room on their website) -no cable (also promised) -stains on the floors -wallpaper peeling off the walls -inadequate lighting -the heater was behind the curtains- so if you wanted to be warm, you had to risk starting a fire. They'd probably charge you for it too. when we walked into the bathroom we discovered: -the toilet seat was broken off the toilet -the sink and bathroom counter were slanted and coming off the wall -and the water in the bath tub was yellow. Aside from the unsatisfactory quality of the room, -the elevator in the lobby was broken -we were charged for parking (give us a break we just paid 160 dollars for the worst room in history!) -the continental breakfast was non-existent (literally. they say they have one, but they don't.) -The staff often ventured away from the check-in desk in the lobby, so you'd walk in and there would be no one to help you. We arrived to our room late at night, so we didn't have the option to turn around and find a new hotel. We booked through hotels.com, so we called them regarding a refund. They were able to give us 20 percent (better than nothing) and suggested we call the hotel for even more of a refund as that was all they could give us. They patched us through to the hotel manager, who immediately got extremely defensive and rude. My boyfriend mentioned the word \"refund\" and the man was screaming through the phone. He told us that if we didn't like the room we should have checked out at midnight, and claimed we were weird for wanting to swim in an outdoor pool in mid June, then had the audacity to say that my boyfriend was being rude to HIM.

We got settled in our room, age of the hotel aside the cleanliness was very poor and should have prompted us to leave immediately (stupid us). We went out again for the day and returned late about 1am. My friend went to get in his bed and low and behold there was a bed bug on his pillow (have you ever seen a grown man have a hissy fit? not pleasant!). I was able to catch one in one of the plastic cups provided in the room (the little suckers are fast) and we packed up and went to check out.

Apparently that was the end of discussion on his part. Everything was booked up nearby so we had to leave town to find a hotel with vacancy. The next morning I called and spoke with the manager who stated that \"they take this accusation very seriously and that they had the inspector in right away who said that it was okay and there were no bugs. He then put the phone down (not on hold just on the counter) and began to speak to another customer leaving me with no resolution. When he came back on the line he just repeated the same thing and then stated that \"we brought the bugs in with us and tried to blame them\". I told him I was very unsatisfied and told him that I would be contacting the credit card company a disputing the charges. He very loudly replied \"THAT'S GREAT\" and hung up the phone.

The room was pretty stinky and dirty, but we figured we wouldn't be there much since we would be out sightseing.

We considered leaving, but it was late in the evening, and we were afraid we wouldn't find anywhere to stay. Not to mention the fact that they charge a full nights pay if you don't cancel 48 hours in advance.

Guest Room - Cleanliness: C Guest Room - Appearance: B Bathroom - Cleanliness: D Bathroom - Appearance: C Why did the counter in the bathroom slope downward? It was very frustrating trying to get ready each day with our belongings ROLLING off the counter. Most counters are level. Comments: Before I made reservations, I confirmed that the hotel had wireless access. Our room did not. When I called to check on it, the clerk told us that we were put in a room that was too far from the signal. We were unable to use our laptop in the room, which we specifically brought to check finances and move finances so that we were sure to have enough money for our trip. I was also unable to check in on my company at home, or check e-mail in the comfort of our room. Your beds were the MOST UNCOMFORTABLE beds I have EVER slept (or LACK THEREOF) on in my LIFE. They felt like cement blocks. Granted, some people like firm beds, but these were beyond firm. I already have back problems with a slight spine curvature (very painful), and your beds only made it hurt more, plus I was so tired the whole weekend from lack of sleep because of the beds. It's difficult to fit a lot into your schedule in Seattle when you only have 1 full day, and 2 additional days where you have to fit in a 5 hour drive each day to get to and from home. Our 13 year old son kept asking us to go swimming, so when we finally decided that we had time, I called the front desk to ask what time the pool/hot tub closed, however, the clerk said that the \"pool was being drained\", and not available for guest use. We were all VERY disappointed, especially my son. The towels in the bathroom were dirty. They smelled like 'bleach', but they had black smudges or stains all over them, as well as black hairs stuck in them!!! I would suggest buying some nice new towels for your guests. They also felt like sandpaper. Maybe housekeeping should use fabric softener???? One evening I needed to wash a couple pieces of clothing. Your web site states that \"Onsite Laundry Facilites (which is mispelt on your web page)\" are available. These 'on-site laundry facilities' were all the way outside, the door took the clerk 5 minutes to unlock (NOT HER FAULT, SHE WAS VERY HELPFUL, BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD CALL A LOCKSMITH AND INSTALL ONE THAT WORKS), and one washer and one washer was available, in a closet type space, and was extremely dirty. We had to unplug the outside vending machines the whole time that we were using the washer and dryer or it would trip a breaker?!! That is a clear indication that your hotel must not meet electrical code. Your web site, which is how I found you, specifically and CLEARLY states FREE PARKING! But we had to pay $5.00 per night IN ADDITION to our hotel room, which ended up NOT including in-room wireless internet, a pool OR A HOT TUB!!

When I called 5 days prior to the date of reservation, thank God I did, was told by a heavy accented man they do not guarantee rooms because somebody might be staying in it. Yea like me. Isn't that one of the reasons you make reservations? He said \"I just cancell you right now\" So I let him because I felt I was taking a big risk by staying there in the first place.

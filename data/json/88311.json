The deadbolt lock didn't work on our front door. but it was so late when we discovered it didn't work that we went to bed just using the top lock that loops over a bar. There was a nice balcony but the air conditioner cover was off and laying on the floor & we couldn't get it back on so just propped it up and told the grandson to stay away from it. The room itself was clean and the bed comfortable, but the blanket was very stiff and old looking - I pulled it off the bed - didn't want it near me. The air conditoner worked great and we slept well. Bathroom was clean but could use a hook on the door to hold a towel or clothes as you change into or out of of a bathing suit. The swimming pool walls looked sort of dirty. I was concerned that it was algae but it may have been sand. It was a good size and the kiddie pool was great for my grandson. The staff checking in and out was very friendly. They give out a red bracelet that is to be worn by all quests so they know you belong there. I like this concept as we have stayed in several motels in Daytona and I've seen people come from the beach, use the motel swimming pool then go back to the beach and get in their car and leave. We have also seen people at other motels park in the motel we were at because there wasn't enough places in the motel they were at, which made parking sparse! Breakfast was over at 10 and we were running late and didn't make it, but one of the other guests said it was ok. I do think they need to put some rubber mats on the floor in the elevator as the floor was very wet from people coming back from the poll but they had two elevators, which was great.", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salem", "Title": "\u201cNot at all pleased!\u201d", "Author": "Lifes-A-Beach31", "ReviewID": "UR137084948", "Content": "Okay here goes...I checked in on Saturday after a very long drive and upon initial view it was okay. We ran out for food, came back and ate. Time for shower and bed...this is when it went downhill. The tub was dirty (I had to clean it), there was an old wash cloth hanging on the shower rail?!, the tub also had a very slow drain...but we endured since we were tired. One of the bulbs was out in the bathroom so it was very low light...no wonder it was'nt clean...they can't see! There was little piles of sand in the bathroom floor also??!! We have a 2 queen room oceanfront b/c no kings were available when we booked. The queen next to the balcony had long strands of hair all different colors...ewww! Overall room was'nt the cleanest. Sunday morning we reported the tub situation and the one bulb out situation to front desk, they were really pleasant and had george fix things accordingly. i told the housekeeper about the dirty wash cloth and she was apologetic...so we were okay at that point. Now Sunday night a HUGE flying cockrocah got in our room...I managed to get on the balcony and shut the door, the hubby was in hallway, the cockroach won the room. Hubby goes down to front desk for some type of pesticide or something to eradicate this sucker. Mimi at the front desk was very uncaring and asked hubby \"What do you want me to do?\", \"I can move you\". Not the best situation at almost 11 at night. So hubby comes back up and start packing (I'm still on balcony) he finally convinces me to run through room...by the way I only have a sheet wrapped around me...it was bath time! Picture that in the hallway! So hubby gets my clothes and I dress in HALLWAY!! I call Mimi from my cellphone to ask what room were going to. Mimi says you have to bring me your ID so you can get a new parking pass and room..huh! PRIORITIES!!! So, I ask Mimi if she has a bellhop to put our stuff on...\"uhh, no\". Okay I get to the first floor and bingo...bellhop! I send up to hubby and go to lobby. Mimi is sitting on her a**. I was instantly pissed! She could have at least had paperwork ready, key cards, and the all important parking pass ready...but not Mimi. So I asked who the manager was for Monday...Peggy Sue I was told. Now new room on the floor below had noisy toilet, noisy fridge, but much cleaner...yay! Monday morning...toilet in new room doesn't flush...go figure! Called and reported to front desk. they were very pleasant and said George would get right on it. Peggy s\\Sue would not be in til 1 p.m?!

The other issue is the elevators. They are very small and cramped to get into. They work though, so better than a property with steps. Unfortunately, the stairs are far out of the way so everyone takes the elevator. It took all four days we were there to eventually discover the stairs, so it is no wonder no one uses them. The bathroom, although advertised as a wheelchair accessible bathroom, had a 2-inch lip in the shower, and I could not get my shower chair fully into the shower.

The floor also felt damp, as the air conditioner didn't seem to be able to control the moisture in the air. The bedspreads both had stains on them and there appeared to be sand on the sheets on one of the beds. This hotel is considered to be non-smoking (no smoking in rooms or on balconies) but everyday we smelled smoke whenever we went out on our 4th floor balcony. We could never tell where it was coming from. One day I finally witnessed someone smoking on their balcony and I was able to report it. Smoking is allowed on the ground floor (located outside, under the hotel) and it literally seemed like mostly everyone staying in this hotel smoked and would be hanging out down there. There are 2 slow and old elevators that also feel like a sauna when you are in them. Housekeeping didn't come until after 5:30 pm one day and we had been out of the room for most of the day.

They then told us that we would have to pay $300 more dollars than planned and it was our mistake. They repeatedly told us it was our mistake, actually, and were really REALLY rude about it. Finally, they told us we should just take it because we \"wouldn't find any other place as low as that on such short notice.\" ..well, we did. Sucks for them. I would not reccomend this place to anyone; I've never been so mad in my life at a hotel or something stupid like that.

Pool area also looked redone. Pool was not heated during our stay and the water was too cold to swim in. I asked why it was not heated and was told that once the air temperature goes above 70 degrees that they do not heat it. It needs to be heated in Dec. no matter what the air temperature. Free Breakfast was good. They had donuts, muffins, cereals, english muffins and waffles that you poured the mix yourself onto the waffle maker and was very good. They had an attendant there who was very helpful and kept everything clean and filled. The office is open 24/7 and the staff was very polite. The shower was very good as rated by my husband, the shower expert. It had several settings on the shower head, all of which worked. Never ran out of hot water either. I would stay there again.

Not only was donuts and coffee provided -- which is what I really expected -- but bagles, cream cheese, cereal and milk, orange and apple juice and muffins were also provided. The staff was friendly and as helpful as they could be given the restraints placed on them by management. The bad: The fitted sheets on our bed did not fit. They would come off as soon as you set on the bed. Room service did a very poor job of cleaning the room. The safe in our room had no key. It had been lost and never replaced. The office also had no other options for us to allow us to safekeep our valuables, requiring us to pack them with us everywhere we went or risk leaving them in the room. When we entered the room the air conditioning cover was off of our unit. The people across the hall from us had no air conditioning for two nights. The maintenance man said there were some electrical problems. However, our air worked fine. The price for our room, which had a balcony overlooking the ocean, was moderate compared to many of the other beachside hotels.

Housekeeping never did clean the toilet, and in a week, the last nite was the only time the sheets got changed. Housekeeping did not leave towels and when one would go to ask for some they would argue about giving them out. Housekeeping broke a souvenir that was on a nitestand and didn't say anything about it, only cleaned it up. We only noticed because there was one huge shred of glass left on the floor. There was a huge bug in the room that crawled on one person's hand while they were sleeping - thank goodness that was early on the morning we were leaving.

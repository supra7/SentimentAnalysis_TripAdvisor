We do this on a frequent basis, at least once a month. We ended up getting the Edgewater and were looking forward as we have never stayed there before. What a disappointment. It is not a four star facility in any way. Sure the location is beautiful being a waterfront property. However, it is completely off the beaten path. They do have a shuttle, but it will only take you within a one mile radios and only until 9pm. Our first impression: pulling up to a sign that states parking is a whopping $36.00 plus tax per night ! There is no self parking available. Ouch! Having stayed at many different hotels in Seattle I do know that parking can be expensive. Usually though the hotel will offer self parking options. Furthermore the most that I have ever seen is $20.00 NOT 36.00! Also, the Marriot across the street is $15.00 per night. I did ask the front desk associate if there was any other option, and she really was not concerned in the least, she said we could park on the street and feed the meter every two hours if we wanted! Now, the rooms are outdated, and quite small. The room we got was directly above the front lobby area. It was very loud, with cars pulling up all night and guests coming and going. The hotel is also directly across from some train tracks, so you have the constant noise of the trains all night. Also, the room was not clean at all. From questionable long liquid like stains across from the bed on the wall, to the very dirty bathroom. But the worst part, there is no air conditioning it the hotel at all! So, after playing around with the thermostat I called down and asked. The front desk solution? Either open the window or he would send up a fan! I actually tried to open the window and to my shock, the windows do open all the way. 5 floors up from the ground, with no protection! I have a three and a four year old, under no circumstances would this be a safe solution to ANY parent! So, we suffered in a hot room instead! We will never stay here again, there is no value to staying at the Edgewater!

On the downside...the corridors etc felt very old and tired. Also, we were woken several times throughout the night by a train traveling past the hotel. And finally the distance from the hotel to the downtown core was just too far. They did have a shuttle that took us downtown and that was great, but we had to cab it back after a night out at the theater. The staff was neither overly friendly nor rude etc., but nothing memorable either way. We visit Seattle 2-3 times a year and this was our first visit to the Edgewater.

There is no dresser in the room. I also found it odd to have the coffee machine in the bathroom, which doesn't seem very sanitary. The hallways are dark and dreary and look like they need a good cleaning. Our son lives in Seattle and we were going to drive his car back to the hotel in the evenings and park it there, only to find out there was an outragious fee to park there.

I booked the room for a 50th birthday getaway and really wanted the Edgewater for the experience. I normally go through pirceline and get great deals on hotels in Seattle, but given that it was a present and I wanted to be sure of where we would stay, I went ahead and splurged big time on a full waterview clawfoot tub room. I was told by the booking agent that the tub was very large and both of us could easily fit for a nice long soak. She apparently had never seen one of the tubs in person because it was one of the smallest I have ever seen and in no way could be considered large enough for two normal sized adults. The booking agent also said that they would be sure to do something special for his birthday and nothing at all was done. The halls of the hotel are an unbelievable mess with carpet that in not only tread barren, but filthy looking. The bedding had a horrible stench to it that made one wonder how long they allow it to go between cleanings, the bed also squeaked terribly any time you moved. The glass in the doors separating the bathroom and bedroom had hand prints and smudge marks all over it. While the fireplace was lovely, the glass to it was filthy as well and there was a timer for it and at the end of the time the fireplace would turn off and then the timer would start beeping very loudly apparently to warn you that the fireplace had turned off. I'm sorry, but I don't need to be woken up by an alarm an hour after I have turned in to tell me the fireplace turned off!!! I have never stayed at a hotel where the you heard absolutely ever noise that happened in the hall and every single door open and shut while in your room with the door closed. It was as if the door was wide open it was so loud. Unfortunately, the loudest ones in the hallway were the housekeeping staff early Sunday morning.

A small thing I adored, was that they actually have bottles of shampoo and conditioner, instead of those tiny travel sizes. Of course, you can't take it with you, but who needs 1,000 mini bottles of shampoo? They're saving the environment and that is just damn nice. Every morning, I had breakfast on the water.

The bathroom looks nice but has unnecessary things. The bed does not look like a queen; looks like a double. And you can only get on it from one side. Also, it's likely very noisy because the train runs by regularly. The larger Water View rooms are better. It's bigger and nicer. The four poster bed is a king sized. The bathroom is much bigger but the granite floor for the shower is uncomfortable. Also, the shower doesn't have a door. It's just covered by a piece of glass that only covers 2/3 of the shower. They have amenities you can only use when you're there which I suppose makes sense, but charging you $25 if you take them is outrageous. Not even the most organic shampoo & body wash would cost $25! That is just stupidly outrageous. The parking is absurd. It is $36 valet only and they park your car out in their open parking lot, so your car will be covered in rain, snow, or hot like an oven, depending on the weather & season. $36? Please! We parked on the street. But it was really annoying to go out, repark it elsewhere when we had to, and drive it up to the entrance to get our bags. I can't believe they have to make it so hard for us. Having stayed there for the night, I noticed more problems. First, it was noisy. I could hear people in the hallway walking & talking and I wear silicone ear plugs. It's like the building is made out wood from the 1930s and the wood is starting to break down. The next night I wasn't as tired & was often woken up by the sound of the train or a ship on the water sounding its horn. As usual, the people in the hallway woke me up. I'm so glad I wasn't stuck in the other levels, where I would've heard people above me. I believe others have complained about this as well. Also, the bed is too soft. The location is not that great. The ships were noisy, the train was noisy, and it's not within reasonable walking distance to Pine & Pike St. I'm definitely going back to La Quinta & Holiday Inn. They're just not as fancy but way more worth it. This hotel spends too much money on unnecessary things. The fake tree branches that can be manually adjusted at different limb points in the lobby area? The tiny elevator with the tv and the holes resembling kelp? The light up mirror in the washroom?

The gift shop has the best selection of gifts -- and scarves -- that I always buy something unique there. The staff is superb! I'll do a special call-out to Tanya, the manager and Rick, the bellman.

Based on our past experience we booked it again for the President's Day weekend with two other friends. What a disappointment this time! The first thing you see when you drive into the parking lot is a sign saying that valet parking is required at $36 per night! It was my recollection that when we stayed the previous time there was no valet parking or that it was optional. It's not like there isn't any parking available at the hotel and that they need to shuttle your car to a lot offsite somewhere; they have a very large parking area similar to what a hotel out by the airport would have, so it appears they are simply charging as a way of sucking more money from their guests. When we talked with the desk clerk about the high cost of parking, we were told that all the hotels in Seattle do it, and while the Edgewater might be a little high, it is in line with what other hotels are charging. Even more frustrating is waiting 10 minutes at the curb for the car jockey to go get your car, when you're staring at your car parked less than 60' away. Valet parking is inconvenient at best for the customer, and the Edgewater's system was poor. Overall the rooms and hallways are very \"tired\". All the rooms appear to have had the bathrooms upgraded, but for some reason the rest of the room has been left in it's worn out state. Our first room on the water side had a fireplace that had the front glass so sooted up you could barely see the flames. The slider leading out onto the deck had a built in vent in the framework that no longer had a cover on the outside, which allowed cold air to blow into the room unabated all night. Poor maintenance for sure! To the credit of the lobby staff, we were moved to another room the next day after we complained about the two problems mentioned. The staff was the only bright spot of what was otherwise a very disappointing stay. The hotel is in a prime location right on the water, and has the potential of being one of the premiere properties in Seattle, but they've missed the mark. It's almost as though the hotel knows that they established a reputation years ago of being a top-notch hotel, and now they're just coasting without trying to maintain that reputation.

We did hear what ever noise machinery was on the room and train throughout the night. The flatscreen TV in the room was old and had bad static. The phone seemed like it had not been clean for a few years. As well as the clock in the room was off by about 5 hours. The bathroom was the nicest part of the room with a upscale contemporary look and rock shower. After 2 days we decided to ask for a room facing the water and a bigger room. They were about to say no, but luckily they found a room on the first floor. Upon entry into the room it was definitely bigger. The funny thing is the lady said \"oooooh yeah you are in our smallest room available\". The room did face the water, but faced the pier side with a giant crane in front of the room.

We were in town for a wedding so we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to be at the hotel much. I landed this hotel on Hotwire, which worked out great since many others were staying there as well. I had planned ahead and being a saving traveler, I knew I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to pay $36 plus tax for parking if I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to. Parking in the city hotels really has gotten out of control. Sometimes, depending on which hotel you can land some cheaper parking close by, which is what I did. There is a parking garage directly across the street on Wall Street (entrance on Elliot as well). I parked for $21 even. Check in was a breeze and staff was very friendly. Hotel lobby was nice and had a great view of the water. We got a City Lodge room on the 4th floor. I will say overall, there is a lot of walking to and from the rooms at this place. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an older historical type hotel so it does have a lot of character, but be ready to walk. The room, while small was a great room. It had a queen bed, Flat screen TV, a chair and table, etc. The fireplace provides heat for the room. I liked that the window actually opened, unlike many hotels these days. The bathroom was amazing with a great shower. The shower was great for a tall person like me and had a fancy shower head that rains on you. Sorry, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what they call those, but it was nice. It also had a detachable massage type shower head as well. The room had a mini bar with liquor, beer, and snacks; everything had an expensive price on it (as expected). There was an ironing board, bath robes, and a spacious closet in the room as well. The train runs right out front of the hotel and since we were on the city side, you can hear it, if your window is open. If you keep the window shut they provide pretty good sound proofing. It was easy to catch a cab and the valet guys were friendly and helpful in calling one for you. At the end of the night we did partake in some drinks at the Hotel bar which was large, spacious, and had a band playing. I was surprised that the bar closes at 12, even with a pretty full crowd. But at this point in the night we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been drinking still. \u00ef\ufffd\u0160 The hotel offers a 12pm checkout which is nice and they have checkout via the TV, although ours wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working. Front desk staff was again friendly and check out was a breeze. I just got the car and parked near the valet while we loaded. The valet guys seemed to be a little irritated with this, but there were no regular parking spots. Overall, we had a nice stay. I would stay here again, especially if I had some more time to spend at and near the hotel. We did have lunch at Anthony\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s which is a short 5 minute walk, if that. There is also a deli on the way to Anthony\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.

Showers are attractive, but poorly planned. If you are under about 5'10\" it is hopeless to try and reach the water diverter and you will need to reach it. If you stay, you need to have a waterfront room. The city side rooms face the railroad tracks. They furnish free earplugs, and you might likely need them. The worst thing about the tracks is the trains vibrate the parking lot and set off car alarms ALL NIGHT LONG! To help with this, valet parking is required, at $36 per night, which makes their attendants resonsible for your alarm. The Beattles stayed here, but you will likely be more comfortable elsewhere. Really wanted to like the place with the cute rooms and GREAT location, but was miserable.

It's a good thing that there was only water out side. The bathroom has been redone with the obligatory rain shower head but since it is in the far end with a glass wall there is no way to turn it on with out getting all the way in and standing under cold water. The shower wand is a nice touch but there is no obvious way to turn it on. A shorter person wouldn't have had a chance. There is a small lever on the top of the shower head. The card implores one to conserve water but there is no where to hang up a towel to dry, how about a couple of towel bars? there is room for one but the towels are folded and stacked. There is no sound proofing between the floors, we were on the ground floor and could hear every step and movement from above all night long. Our party of 7 had dinner in the 67 which is a beautiful space but when every one had to get out their cell phone to get enought light to read the menu it should be a sign to lighten it up. The servers don't have little flash lights, we asked, and their was no candle light. The server said they could turn up the chandelier but never did.

At first I was nervous because I read reviews that said that this hotel was off path. I was worried that we would get too stuck in the hotel and need to eat at the hotel all the time. This wasn't the case at all. We loved being on a pier and on the water--it was super relaxing even though we had a city side room. Our city view for new year's eve was perfect as we got to see the fireworks over the space needle at midnight from the room. We could see the space needle from our beds and everyday we ate at the market and walked all over-- both to Pike Place and Seattle Center as the Edgewater is located right in the middle of the two. We easily got to Belltown on foot and to Fremont and Capitol hill on the metro. It was easy to get around Seattle with many transportation options and we took the lightrail back to the airport for $4. The hotel felt super cozy and comfortable. My room was really quiet which is something that is very important to me. I'm sensitive to noise. The beds were really comfortable and the fireplace was a treat. The room had really high ceilings and we enjoyed the room a lot even though the style was different than a minimal/modern style that I would usually desire. The only negatives for me were that I asked for a wake up call for 8am on my airport departing day and I didn't get one. Also on the one day that I asked the guest services guy for directions he gave us the wrong directions for taking the bus. The restaurant was beautiful but the salmon dish I had was just ok especially compared to other food around the area.

I cannot believe that this hotel is receiving any positive reviews from people who stayed there. I can totally understand someone falling in love with the lobby, the location or the restaurant... they're all wonderful with beautiful views on the water. Walking distance to everything... but actually stepping foot down the hall on the way to the rooms is a totally different experience. We had a bad feeling immediately upon arrival as the woman checking us in with frigid and uninformed... but we figured maybe she was just upset about having to work on New Year's Eve. Our bags were loaded onto a cart and followed behind us as we headed down the long, dark, disgusting, damp hallway. The smell of cigarette soaked carpet was thick; the water stained walls closed in on us. I could swear those creepy twins from The Shining would show up any moment. Because there is only one elevator (that we could find) we walked a very long way down the hall just to get there... if it weren't for all the effort put in to arriving, I would have opted for the stairs. That elevator does not look like it would pass inspection! Up to the 4th floor - so I held out hope... maybe it was just the ground floor that was so gross and dark... maybe the 4th floor would bring a bright, clean hall. Nope! Another dark, narrow, dank, creepy, stinky hallway led us to our closet... I mean room. The \"room\" was about the size of my walk-in closet of my studio apartment. It was so small that we had to take turns walking around so that we didn't cause a two-person traffic jam at the foot of the bed. So you're probably thinking - \"well in a room that small, I at least hope they have a fireplace to burn you alive while you sleep!\" Exactly! The fireplace (that we could not turn off) pumped out heat all day/night. Easy fix: open the window! Yes, the window that opens up to roaring train tracks and has no protection whatsoever from the elements, insects or suicide attempts... once opened, not even a flimsy screen separates you from the wonderful wet Seattle air. Making the best of it - we headed out for a fantastic night at the EMP's NYE bash. Arriving back to the hotel around 2am we called the front desk to inquire about a 24 hour room service menu (not an uncommon find at decent hotels around the world!) But apparently our request was absurd. The person who answered laughed at us. I'm sorry you had to work on NYE buddy, but don't be rude to the people who you are paid to assist! Terrible. Word of advice: if you, for some God awful reason, find yourself in the hell hole that is The Edgewater hotel on the \"city view\" side... do not attempt slumber without the ear plugs (one pair provided on your night stand... yes, they know it's bad). The train and road noise is unbearable. I woke up every half hour absolutely terrified. The train is so loud that it sounded like we were tied to the tracks. So - close the window, right? Yeah... let's not forget about that fireplace two feet from the bed. The location of The Edgewater is fantastic. Everything else was so bad it was actually funny by the end of our stay. Rude staff + filth + stench + tiny room + ear-splitting noise...I think I'd wake up hungover from this place even if I didn't have a drop to drink the night before. I felt like we must have been on some hidden camera show... things just kept getting worse and worse. I'd stay at a Motel 6 in Werapeyouwhileyousleepville rather than ever step foot in this place.

I put in a low ball Priceline bid for a 4 star hotel and wound up with this hotel. Having never stayed there, but seeing the place a few times, I thought great. Check-in was quick. The valet guys are quick. Kind of over a barrel there though, because you aren't really close to anything and the parking is $34. Had a city view room on the 4th floor. Whoa, so small...Almost as small as a cruise ship cabin. As others have said, no dresser drawers for clothes. The closet was pretty big though. The bed seemed pretty hard and was more like a double than a queen size. There was a gas fireplace in the unit, but due to the size of the room, you got so hot so fast, you couldn't keep the thing on without opening the window full, then you got the full on train noise as the BNSF mainline is right outside the window. It was good of them to leave ONE set of ear plugs on the night stand, hahahahaha...There was a fridge in the cabinet above the fireplace. The TV was a 32 inch flat panel, so that was good. I did like the bathroom. I like the stone tile work and the rain shower. Good water pressure and plenty of hot water. Coffee maker worked fine, but the coffee was crappy. I didn't like the hallways. They were dark and really needed a sprucing up. Paint was chipped, the carpets are old and dirty. The smell of stale cigarettes was everywhere even though its a non-smoking place. There appears to be only one elevator for the place and it is SLOW...Add to that, the fact they were moving beds and using this elevator to do it when people are in the process of checking out. Perhaps there is no freight elevator. I did like the lobby and common area lounge. The view was nice out over Puget Sound, West Seattle and Alki Point. Didn't try the restaurant, so can't comment there. I wouldn't really rate this as a 4 star property...3 and a half tops. Maybe the rooms facing the water are bigger and quieter, but I wouldn't stay in one of those small rooms again. This is not in the same league as the Sheraton Seattle, The W, or the Westin, but they all share the same rating...Go figure...No pool or spa here either. Another thing, even though you are on the waterfront, it is a long walk to the piers where the restaurants are and also to Pike Place Market and downtown.

The hotel has a great location, being the only hotel that is located right on Seattle's waterfront and it is convenient to Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, Seattle Center, and many of the other neighborhoods of Seattle. One of the hotel's claims to fame is that the Beatles stayed there during their 1st United States tour in the 1960s. As a result they have a number of photographs of the Beatles and other entertainers who stayed there over the years. Their downtown shuttle is a very nice amenity, and I cannot praise the staff too highly. They were friendly, accommodating, efficient, and thoughtful. The hotel was quiet in the room had a gas fireplace. Unfortunately controlling the temperature was difficult, and it was frequently to warm in the room, which caused us to turn the heat off completely. The only meal we ate at the hotel was breakfast, and the food and service were both excellent. We did have a waterfront room, and since we looked at the rooms on the other side of the hallway, I would agree with Kaytwowa, do not even think about staying in any room that does not have a water view. From the other side of the hotel you see the parking lot, the soon to be torn down Alaskan Way Viaduct and the railroad tracks.

The location is awesome right downtown. Pike's Place is the furthest away and it's about a twenty minute walk at a good pace. There is a free shuttle that'll take you anywhere in the downtown that leaves at the top of each hour which is a huge bonus when the weather is ugly.

Check in service was great. The room not so much. The room was average size. The good is that the view, and I was on the water side, is amazing. The fireplace is a nice touch. I thought the bathroom was above average, but did not match the room at all. The not so good: The furniture and decoration of this room is bizzare and not really nice. The too much furniture is old and worn. Only one phone and has to be moved to be reachable from the bed. There were no less than 3 competing plaid patterns, too much furniture which included a huge 4 poster bed. The tv is oversize for the room. The room is worn, chipped paint, bad scratches on the doors, tired paint. There were stains on the paint in the bathroom.

We foolishly assumed this was a one time charge and since we didn't plan on using our vehicle while we were there we decided that the $43 dollars would be fine. Upon check out we were charged $86.00 for parking!! After not having used our vehicle the entire time! That's $86.00 for 2 days!! Outrageous! When we asked the front desk about the charge they were rude stating that we should have asked about street parking, but that is often limited. The Edgewater is abusing the fact that there is no where else to park and therefore can charge big money for a service you have no choice but to use. This and the general service at the hotel left us with a bad taste in our mouths. You can do better in the same neighbourhood, shop around.

There are only a few little flaws in the hotel that deducted a few points. Stayed in Seattle the first weekend in November and chose The Edgewater due to its proximics to most of the major attractions in the city. We were without a car and are walkers so this was a plus. If you are not the hotel offers a free shuttle that runs every hour and will take you anywhere withing two miles. We only took the shuttle once and realized they don't pick you up (not a problem in our case) but...if they do they never mentioned it!! The hotel is older and at first glance may not be up to everyones perfection but it is well kept and does actually sit out over the water. It's next to the cruise line building, near the Aquarium, the wharf, and ferry buildings. Not to mention Pike Market and some amazing restaurants. The hotel offers wonderful views from the sitting area which comes complete with fireplace and from the lounge as well. Our room was a water front room and the views were wonderful to awake to. Our room was of decent size with comfortable bed, warm gas fireplace. docking station for and iPod and big bathroom. That bathroom was one of our low points. Our photos showed a soaking tub and I requested one when I called to confirm. I did not receive one, rather a very nice walk in shower. I was really looking forward to the soaking tub as we were staying there for three nights! Another disappointment was the cost of INTERNET. In this day and age I really do expect free Internet?! Most of our better hotels do offer it! Our room was right near the railway so we had a constant rumble. If this is going to bother you, ask for a room closer to the main of the building. I don't know how the rooms on the upper levels might fare with the sounds. Everyone at the hotel was very pleasant. Room service was fast and efficient. The food was very good as well. The one thing I would advise is if you ask for a cab; don't let them tell you to come down and let them call. You will sit for twenty minutes. Tell the front door man you will be down for a cab in ten! It's a $32 cab ride to the airport or a $40 town car ride. So if you are a tipper ~ you do the math?!

It is right on the water and located in the Belltown area of Seattle. Belltown is a great place to get super food and super night life The Edgewater has great comfy rooms but you'll need to know what you're in for. For starters, this is a high end boutique hotel so be prepared to pay higher rates than a standard hotel. If you don't like spending money, you should look elsewhere. It is a fabulous place regardless. They have mandatory valet, so if you don't want to pay for that, you need to park on the nearby surface streets or garage. If you can get a waterside room, do it; the city side is noisier. The waterside is much more impressive anyway. The food at 67 (the hotel restaurant/bar) is super and the Sunday brunch is fantastic. The nightlife at the bar is pretty good with live entertainment as a normal fare on weekends. This hotel is often booked with weddings on every weekend so you get a good idea of what type of place this is. If it's good enough to get married in, it's good enough for you! Because it's built on a pier, there is no pool. For those looking for a pool, you probably aren't staying in a boutique hotel. Wi-fi isn't free either (a small gripe of mine). In the old days, you'd get Starbucks coffee in the lobby, but they got rid of that service and placed coffee makers in each room. I'd rather have my coffee ready to go so I can have it downstairs. There's a Starbucks in the gift shop for those that want it made for you. Since this is a boutique hotel, the rooms aren't made for 2 queen beds (another thing you might need to know). 2 bed rooms are configured with doubles. The staff is superb, from the Valet, to Front Desk, to Wait Staff and Maid Service. Everybody is top notch and provides a great service. Location is great.

The hotel itself is an older hotel and I would not consider it an upscale hotel but we still had a pleasant stay. The room itself was small and cozy with a great fireplace. The bathroom on the other hand was great & would definitely hold up in a 4 star hotel. The room itself I would give a 3-star rating. The TVs were not LCD/flat screen and you could see the age of the room. The pillows and the bed were not comfortable for us. The train did keep my husband up at night. I took sleeping pills so I slept through the train. We did not like the fact that you had to pay for internet but this did not take away from our stay b/c there were coffee shops in the area that did offer free wi-fi. The cool part about this hotel was it was over the water. We did enjoy our stay but I am not sure if it would have been so great if we had paid full price on it. We bid on it using Priceline so that is probably why I title it \"a pleasant stay at the Edgewater\". I think if we would have paid full price we would have been disappointed.

Lovely views and staff were nice. The king bed I had was comfortable and the shower/bathroom is nice. I guess because they maybe use compact fluourescent bulbs it is very dim in the room (you know you can put more powerful lights in!). Concierge was helpful.

It is just a stroll from great things to visit like Pike's Market, numerous pubs, and the Seattle Aquarium (be warned though, there are many hills if you do not stay ocean-side).

We walked from the King Street station to the hotel, arriving just after 1pm, only to learn our room would not be ready till after 4pm. So, we carried our bags around the waterfront with us the rest of the afternoon. (In all fairness, I never asked if we could leave our bags, as we only had one carry-on each. Also, the check-in time is posted I just wasn't watching the time). Check-in was fairly smooth, though I learned from overhearing another customer that I needed a key to access the mini-fridge in our room so we could keep our drinks cold. That seemed rather odd. The hotel is fairly high class, with valet's and luggage service, but this meant little to us walking in with our carry-on bags. The elevator is interesting with a large TV showing sea life, and perforated light walls on the sides in tree patterns. Once off the elevator, the hallway to our room was narrow as others have mentioned, but I fail to see why that matters for the short walk to our room. The room itself was clean and nice with rustic decoration as advertised. Except for the decorations, this was just your basic hotel room. The bath is to your left as you walk in, bed on the left, TV and fridge on the right, and chairs at the far end next to the window. The features that distinguish the room from your average motel 6 are the clawfoot tub in the bath, the sliding doors that open the bath to the rest of the room, and the gas fireplace in the corner. There's a large flat screen TV too, but we never even turned it on. Obviously, the Edgewater's best asset is the view. The motel is built on piers right out on the water and we had a great view of the boats coming and going out on Elliot bay. We opened both sides of the main window and spent hours looking out, listening to the sea gulls, and enjoying the sea air. Before checking out the next morning, we had breakfast in the Six Seven restaurant on the lower level. The view was great and the food was tasty, albeit a little overpriced (Fourty five dollars for breakfast for two). Overall, we had an enjoyable stay at the Edgewater. We were right down on Seattles waterfront, could open our windows to the water, and enjoyed soaking in the clawfoot tub. We even made full use of the noon check-out time. My biggest disappointment was the cost ($400 for the night). This was easily the most expensive place we have ever stayed and we have been in many better locations with larger rooms and more amenities. Our room at Edgewater was just a fancy Motel 6 room with a view. It was nice to be sure, but not worth twice what would we would pay anywhere else. Still, just about every motel I looked at in downtown Seattle is equally overpriced. I also thought it was kind of cheap to have to pay an access fee for the mini-fridge, and pay extra for a bag of popcorn. In a motel that appears to be upscale, you would think they could include something as basic as a few snacks at no charge. It also seemed like they were trying to sell you everything on site, from the bear on the bed, to the shampoos in the bath ($25 if you want to take them home!).

We chose the Edgewater because we were coming from Victoria on the Victoria Express ferry which arrives at berth 69, right next to the Edgewater at berth 67. So we wheeled our suitcases the short distance to the Edgewater. Location The hotel is not near stores or areas of interest. Probably the closest shopping area is Pike Place, about a 15-minute walk away. We soon realized the hotel was too remote for us. We had booked for Saturday through Tuesday nights, and we checked out on a Monday. They charged us half of the estimate for all four days. Sadly, if we had booked for only Saturday-Sunday (much cheaper weekend rates), then we would have wound up paying considerably less for those two days. The halls The long halls can be entered from only one side so you do a lot of walking if your room is far from the entrance. The long narrow corridors don't seem to fit with the premium rooms on the fourth floor. The halls are narrow enough so that it's difficult to navigate a suitcase past the maids' cleaning carts, and people who are sensitive to scents will feel the hall does not smell fresh. The sense of mustiness is enhanced by the hunting lodge motif and squeaking floorboards. Room We were in room 430 on the fourth floor. There is a sofa against the foot of the bed with cassock in front of it that could be used for a breakfast tray. There is an enormous plasma TV screen can be watched from the bed or sofa. In one corner a gas fireplace goes on if temperature controls changed suddenly from cold to hot. Good bathrobes, umbrella in closet. The bed is comfortable and inviting with lots of cushions and a little stuffed bear that we named \"Ed\" wearing the Edgewater T-shirt, propped against the pillows. The posts of the four poster bed are made of raw timber, probably for effect. There is a writing desk by the bed, and the floor is carpeted. There are more than enough electric plug outlets. We liked the location of the air conditioner/heater. It didn't blow on the bed or sofa. Good selection of teas with the tea and coffee maker. The refrigerator had a freezer compartment, so we could freeze our ice pack. Bathroom The wide bathroom with entry way takes up a quarter of the room-bathroom area. There is a stand-up shower. There is no more than one double hook to hang towels, bathrobes, etc., so we wound up putting them on back of the toilet even though hooks could have been installed in many places on the wall. View The view from the rooms on the fourth floor (see photo) is similar to that from Six Seven Restaurant, but the view is broader, including a view on clear days of Mt. Ranier hiding behind the red fingers of a container port crane. A porch runs the full length of the room with access through two sliding doors. We were in room 430, close to the Norwegian Cruise Line berth. NCL passengers could look down on our porch, taking away some privacy, but the cruise ships made a pretty view for us, and we missed them when there was no ship in the berth. The view from the fourth floor may be good for Seattle, but it is no match for the view at, say, the Pan Pacific Vancouver. Quiet enjoyment We could hear the couple in the room next to us banging suitcases around on Sunday morning, and about an hour later in the same room there was such a lot of commotion that I went into the hall to find the source, and I found it was the housekeeping lady. I have no idea what she was doing. There is a function room on the 4th floor by the elevators, and the decibels get pretty high during receptions. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best to avoid room 484. It is the guest room nearest to the fourth floor function room. They have a heavy door that can be closed against the pandemonium when guests are trying to sleep night. Service Service at check-in, check-out, housekeeping, and concierge was polite and efficient but not exceptional. Restaurants The restaurant Six Seven is so outstanding that we ate there twice. They provide half-plates, so instead of sharing, I had a halibut, and my wife had pork loin. Both were excellent. The desserts were tasty with distinguished presentations. I had a panna cotta with blueberry topping, and my wife had a lavender honey creme brulee with a glass of Red Mountain Kiona ice wine. It was an extraordinarily satisfying meal. We recommend Six Seven Restaurant whether you stay at the Edgewater or not. We had breakfast in the room, and the food was very good and delivered promptly. We ate in the room rather than on the porch under the gaze of cruise ship passengers. Internet Edgewater's unique Internet policy seems a bit grasping. If you want wi-fi (no LAN), you pay an additional $4 an hour, $10 a day, or $25 for three days which is annoying. If you are using two devices, such as a computer and a smart phone, the charge is doubled, and if you use three devices, the charge is tripled, which is annoying to the power of three. We were charged for using two devices in one day. We felt the hotel was good for a day, considering its view and location near the Victoria Clipper and cruise lines, but we prefer to be in the middle of shops and restaurants, and we felt a wee bit ravaged paying for Internet access on a per-device basis. We moved to the more central Pan Pacific Seattle Hotel where LAN and wi-fi are free for all guests. The hotel offers a lot, but the pluses and minuses divided by the price would yield an average value.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern Pines, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cVery uninformative & rude staff\u201d", "Author": "NYLover30", "ReviewID": "UR115925271", "Content": "The suite we had was just OK for $ 500.00 per nite.

The hotel lobby and rooms have a \"rustic\" Pacific Northwest decor which was fun and each room comes with it's own teddy bear on the bed and rubber ducky in the bathroom.

No problem, I thought as we had booked and paid 3 months in advance and should have a reasonable room. Why would we need an upgrade. On entering our City View 4th floor room we were taken back by its very small size and Queen size bed. With our luggage in the room we barely had room to open the suitcases without having to step over them. Then I saw the complementary single set of ear plugs (were they mine, or my wifes) on the table and I knew we were in trouble. I now understood why the receptionist got in early telling me not to bother asking for an upgrade. Sure enough, within minutes a train rumbled past outside our window. No problem, with the window shut you could still hear it but not too loudly. However, the room was very hot and smelly, so trying to sleep with the window shut proved to be impossible, so on with the airconditioner. Well, that was not such a good idea as the thermostat controlled fan kicks in every few minutes with the roar, reverberation and vibration of a farm tractor ploughing, and the room still was too hot to be comfortable. A bit of checking and we found the gas fireplace in the corner was still burning and putting out a considerable amount of heat, even though it was switched off on the wall. By this time it was past midnight and we were yet to get any sleep, so a call to the front desk resulted in the night manager arriving and after partially dismantling the heater he was able to extinguish the flame. At last the aircon was able to cool the room to the point where we were able to sleep with the heavy doona replaced by a light blanket. The two nights we spent at this hotel in what must be the smallest room in the place at $255-00 a night were, we feel, the worst value for money of the 20 or so hotels we stayed in during our 2 month trip to North America. Prior to this hotel we stayed one night in Hotel 1000 on 1St Av in Seattle, about 10 blocks from the Edgewater, and we paid $215-00 for a City View basic room which was two to three times larger with a beautiful bathroom and excellent, modern facilities. The Edgewater has good location on the waterfront, but absolutely nothing else. It is a very old, dark, dank, dimly lit, depressing dungeon. The walls are paper thin and you will be awoken by your neighbours bathroom visits during the night. The restaraunt is expensive with very average food, the lobby decor is weird, to say the least, and appears to be a collection of odds and ends from a number of recycle shops. There were at least 7 different styles of chairs in the lobby area alone when we were there in June, 2011. And the deer antlers looked at home in Alaska, but don't quite work in a so called 4 or 5 star hotel in downtown Seattle. Other reviewers have praised this hotel, and I am unable to understand how they can. Obviously they were not in the same 4th floor room as we were. On looking into rooms on the first three floors that were being cleaned next morning I could see that they are larger than the fourth floor, so if you do stay here you should specify any floor but the fourth. Yes, the location on the waterfront is nice, but we did not feel this one factor compensated for all the negative features of the hotel and should we visit Seattle again we most definitely will not be staying at the Edgewater.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hillsboro, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cUncomfortable but beautiful.\u201d", "Author": "cking48", "ReviewID": "UR114689524", "Content": "Worst mattress ever.

The Edgewater looked like a good base camp for that. Due to a late flight arrival, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to the hotel until about 11:30 p.m. Despite the hour, both the valet parking and front desk personnel were cordial and efficient. We were checked in quickly, which was great after a long day of travel. We were situated on the first floor in room 108, and I was adamant about being on the water side of the hotel after reading the issues others have had with the railroad noise on the city side. I obviously can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak for the city side rooms, but I can tell you that we did not have any noise problems in our room despite being on the \"railroad end\" of the building. The room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heating/air conditioning system was slightly noisy, but to me that was welcome. I need some background white noise to get to sleep. The other unexpected benefit of that room was having a cruise ship docking area directly outside the window (see photo). Kind of a funny thing when we opened the curtains the first morning there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what a surprise to have an ocean liner right outside. We were there 3 full days, and each day the ship would depart at 4 p.m., only to be quietly replaced by another cruise ship overnight. A cool side show. The hotel restaurant (The Six-Seven) is great for breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we went there each day.

Our Edgewater room was clean and well maintained with comfortable beds. If I were to quibble about anything, it would be minor items. For example, if you are located at the far end of the building as we were, the hall to get to your room from the lobby/front desk/restaurant is kind of a hike, and the narrow hall was sometimes crowded with cleaning carts. Reminded me somewhat of the hike to your room at the Vegas resorts. Also, the room taxes in the State of Washington are really a piece of work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our statement showed both a room tax of 15.6% and also a daily sales tax. These 2 taxes came to over 20% of the room price on some of the days \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in a word, DOH! Clearly not the Edgewater\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault, but be prepared. They stick it to the tourists in Washington State. In addition, the cleaning people consistently placed the Edgewater Teddy Bear on my travel partner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bed after cleaning the room instead of mine. This was an obvious injustice, and very insulting. Just kidding, of course\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. None of these issues amounted to anything substantial. On the whole, the Edgewater hotel is a beautiful thing, the kind of a thing that makes you want to come back, a happening thing of which I have multiple positive post-visit mental images.

It sounded enchanting--'The only waterfront hotel in Seattle'--which is apparently true. I found all of the staff to be very friendly and welcoming, and the hotel has a charming 'northwestern rustic' atmosphere, decor, and room furnishings. Here's where things fell apart: I received e-mailed confirmation, yes confirmation, of my reservation for initially two rooms--one standard waterfront room and one 'city family suite'. Both were expensive by my standards (and budget) at the upper two hundred dollar per night level. I was entertaining three friends, plus myself, and decided that the suite alone would offer sufficient sleeping space, since it has two double beds, plus a queen-sized sofa bed. I then cancelled the smaller 'waterfront' room by phone and received e-mail confirmation. I will say that all of my e-mail confirmations were prompt and inviting. I will also say that the staff were generally friendly and did their best under circumstances that were sometimes beyond their control. This was especially true of the night front desk and front door staff, who made every effort to be gracious and as accommodating as the situation allowed. However, when we arrived shortly after midnight the first night, we were told, in a perfunctory manner, that our suite was no longer available (no explanation, except to say that our nightly rate was reduced by $100) and were summarily, the FOUR of us (and NONE of us four men normally sleep together), put into a room with only TWO double beds. They then provided a TWIN-sized rollaway bed, which was quite bulky and REALLY crowded this significantly smaller room than had been confirmed originally. Again, this was in the middle of the night when were tired from traveling, and caused considerable consternation and stress among the four of us. I finally went back to the front desk (a LONG walk BTW), and asked if they had any additional rooms. The night clerk said they had one left, a small room with one queen bed, which I slept in for the night. The next day, I spoke with the first of two managers on duty. She herself admitted not knowing why were denied our original suite and seemed truly dumfounded that this had happened at all. Then she agreed to not charge us 'anything' for the first night. This was later retracted by the both managers, who then charged us for the double-bed room. The next afternoon, we were finally moved into the suite, which met our sleeping requirements, and were quoted a set discounted price for all four nights. However, when I received my final bill, the price was changed, upwardly and significantly, night-by-night. The clerk on duty seemed confused by the complexities of the bill, and the second manager from the day before, was on the phone. According to my calculations, we were overcharged by approximately $ 105.00, including a movie charge that the very friendly but somewhat confused clerk did research and told me was an error. The movie charge was taken off (thank you), but rather than continue to haggle, for the 4th or 5th time with one of the managers, I decided to try to work things out, via e-mail, with Mr. David Cocks, the General Manager. While this hotel certainly offers terrific harbor views, from both its lobby and its restaurant and bar areas (and also has rooms that face the water, which we didn't have), I must say, with sincere regret, that the booking and billing hassles that I experienced definitely do NOT justify the high prices, nor the waterfront location. Though uniquely positioned on the harbor, there are also several other hotels just one street from the waterfront as well, and the harborfront, several miles of it, is easily accessible on foot from any of them.

My husband and I were celebrating our 10 year anniversary -- we had a 3rd floor waterfront room next to a boardroom. Fri and Sat nights weddings were held at the establishment and they have music going until midnight (3AM EST). Fri night it was kind of funny -- \"Oh, Honey, it's like we are in college again... hear that bass, is that YMCA again? ha ha\" but still a bit annoying so I called down to front desk to see if there would be another wedding on Sat, planning to move rooms if that was the case. I was assured by a bored male voice that there were no more weddings for the weekend and none Sat night. And then BAM -- even louder music (like a G6 anyone?) -- even my husband (easiest going person on the planet) was annoyed. For some reason also there were people going in and out of the boardroom late at night too. I called down Sat and got earplugs but you could still feel the thumping and alas sleep came well after midnight with us up about 4 hours later to travel the next day. My husband had a conference in Denver the week before and got stuck at an Econo Lodge before the Ritz (true dichotomy there) -- anyway he said the noise at the Edgewater especially Sat was louder than the Econo Lodge where his neighbor had left empty bottles of 40oz colt 45 outside his door. The noise was not so classy and not for a hotel that markets itself as a romantic weekend getaway. I am all for weddings and I am also all for adequately soundproofing in hotels that charge a good amount per night and market themselves as a luxury hotel. We mentioned our dissatisfaction at checkout and were told we'd get all of our parking reimbursed (about $180 or so) and then we were told we'd just get $100. My husband and I hate public scenes so we were not going to argue at the front desk in front of everyone BUT while I appreciate the effort and I'm glad they tried I think this was inadequate. After we got home I did call and leave a message with the manager so they would know why I'm leaving a negative review. PROS: 1. location, location, location-- loved the waterfront.... you will hear the Victoria Clipper leave early in AM (7ish or 7:30) if you leave your window open at night 2. fairly comfortable beds and pillows 3. clean rooms 4. well updated bathrooms w/ clawfoot tub and retractable doors that open to bedroom and waterview 5. nice gas fireplace but all heat recirculates to room -- no \"just for ambiance\" AMBIVALENT -- none of this counted for or against the hotel just some insights ... 1. gym -- not good, not bad -- you've got good selection of free weights w/ 2 adjustable back and seat benches, 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, stationary bike (I think everything was matrix brand) -- 2 sets of weights on pulley systems w/ bar attached at top for pull-ups, etc 2. the restaurant -- just so-so -- we were told by staff that breakfast is a must so we started there -- my husband w/ smoked salmon platter (hard to screw that up -- smoked salmon, bagel, porcini cream cheese, capers...) and he loved it as he always loves smoked salmon, I had the smoked salmon omlette and I'd give it a 4/10 -- we did not go back as there are many wonderful restaurants within walking distance 3. no coffee makers in room -- some other travelers from other hotels had complimentary coffee makers in rooms and we would see them get beans freshly ground at some coffee shops and we were jealous -- would have been a nice touch 4. restaurant brews starbucks -- I like starbucks but I can get it anywhere -- I thought it would have been nice if they had beans from smaller local roasters but again that's just a personal opinion so I did not count it in review 5. concierge was nice but not terribly helpful for more adventurous activities -- we found everything we loved on trip advisor, yelp, etc. 6. you can hear surrounding rooms tubs/showers -- not a huge deal but just be aware 7. for energy conservation their default is they only change sheets every 3 nights -- if you want more frequently you have to call the front desk -- again not a big deal but if you are taking midday naps in sunscreen due to being up late the night before because of noise you may want new sheets CONS 1. NOISE, NOISE, NOISE -- in my mind a hotel fails if you can't sleep there when you want to sleep 2. expensive parking -- to get around this we learned later there is a parking garage directly across the street that charges $21 a day (entrance directly off wall street) -- the garage is open I think 8-11 and there is a $40 charge if you need to get your car out after hours but if the hours work for you this is a lot less than the $36/day valet mandatory lot w/ all the valet tips at the hotel 3. as with anywhere some staff were just rude but you could avoid them In summary I think there are probably better hotels for the money in the area. However, if you are going to be there midweek you may be able to enjoy a great location without intrusive noise. ***see review of Western Prince Whale Tours -- AWESOME!!! -- best day ever -- we chartered a flight w/ Westwind aviation (a package deal w/ Western Prince) to San Juan Islands, Friday Harbor and then went out on the Zodiac -- can't recommend highly enough -- the entire day was smooth, seamless and AWESOME!! -- it made our anniversary vacation exceptional", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cPretty but Overated\u201d", "Author": "VanBC_81", "ReviewID": "UR109224357", "Content": "So, as we drove up to the hotel for our first stay at the Edgewater we were very impressed with the views of the water. The valet staff for the most part were very helpful, though the cost of valet was a little much. Checking in was really easy and the staff were very pleasant. The lobby overlooks the water and is a beautiful place to relax and watch the boats go by. The hotel is centrally located and is very close to great restaurants and bars in the area. Our room was located on the city side and we found that the trains running out side the hotel became a noisy with the sliding door open at night. I'm a hot sleeper and usually need some cold air circulation. So I closed the door and turned on the A/C unfortunately the A/C unit was so loud we had to turn it off. This was a real annoyance for the both of us for the rest of the trip. We would have asked for another room but our stay was only 2 nights and the hassle wasn't worth it. We expected of all things the A/C to run well in such an acclaimed expensive hotel. We stopped by the hotel restaurant twice on our trip. The first night we stopped by around 11pm for a nightcap and were pleasantly surprised to hear a great band playing covers which we really enjoyed. The service was great and the restaurant was very stylish and comfortable. Our second restaurant visit was not as good as our first. We went by around 4pm the following day for a snack after a long day of sightseeing. We ordered a starter off of the bar menu and when it arrived it had an item in it that neither myself or my partner consume in our diets. I'm pretty diligent about reading menu ingredients because of my diet limitations. Any how when I told our server about the extra item she gave us a disgusted look, whisked away our plate and threw it in the garbage. Our first instinct was that we had made a mistake and read the menu incorrectly, so I borrowed our neighbors menu to confirm my suspicion and indeed we were correct. No word of the item in the ingredient list. I tried to get her attention again soon after to tell her that the ingredient was not listed on the menu and when I did she told me I was wrong without looking at the menu. Our newly made appy arrived and looked great though our server did not bring us new cutlery, which we also thought was odd as the previous ones were already soiled. My girlfriend had to go to the bar to get it. Basically I was thoroughly disappointed with that restaurant visit. The last thing you want on a romantic weekend is a disgruntled server to ruin the mood. Another gripe is that there wasn't even free wireless in the lobby which is really not good in this day and age,though they did have a business center where you could use the internet.

It was absolutely beautiful!

Unfortunately, the first night they did not have the double room I requested, so we had to settle for a king on the 2nd floor (246 I believe, which had a slight view of the pier next door). It was a small room with a good-sized bathroom. Because of the reservation mix-up, I requested some sort of comp and received 3 days of free Internet, rather than having to pay $25. This was satisfactory. Still, I had to pay an additional $60/night plus tax in order to have a full water view room, which sounds steep, but I really enjoyed the views so thought the expense worth it. We stayed in room 360 for 2 nights, which had a bit larger living space but much smaller bathroom. They need more hooks to hang towels in the bathrooms. The tile on the walls in the shower is great, but not so great on the floor. The rooms were clean, and we used the fireplace the first night a few minutes at a time, which heated up the room quickly.

I had a south-facing room with a fantastic view of Elliott Bay. It's a charming hotel with a rustic feel and it's really neat that the Beatles stayed there all those years ago. Initially, I was impressed with the rustic feel of my room; it had a high ceiling and a clever wooden entertainment center that included a refrigerator and several drawers for storage. Curiously, there was also a mirror, roughly 6-feet high by 3-feet wide; it reminded me of the \"mirror of desire\" in the first Harry Potter movie. The room had a gas fireplace and two leather chairs nearby with a footstool that looked like a lamb. After about an hour of getting settled, checking email, and glancing out the window at jumping seals, diving seagulls, and on-time ferryboats, I noticed that the room was drafty. The draft came from a sliding window that wouldn't close properly. When I turned on the gas fireplace, it took only a minute or two to realize that the fireplace had a foul, fuel-like odor when operated. This is when the charm wore off. It's clear that the hotel has been remodeled and some of the enhancements are nice. However, much like the other hotels in the area it's not worth the inflated price. I stayed there on a slightly discounted conference rate, yet after standard fees, room tax, and a $10 Internet fee, I paid over $220. Others may disagree, but these days this is a lot for a hotel room (especially off-season). Regarding the city of Seattle, I had a few free hours to explore and I discovered that I like the city. However, like most North American big cities, it's expensive. Gas prices are over $4.00 per gallon, on-street parking is $4.00 per hour, and one of the main tourist attractions, Pike's Market, is less than a block away from a strip club. Such an establishment has a right to operate, however, I think it's bad business for the city of Seattle to allow that type of business near a major tourist attraction. Other big cities with tourist centers have dealt successfully with this problem (e.g., Boston comes to mind). I'm sure that many embarrassed parents have had to fib -- awkwardly -- to their old-enough-to-read kids about the kind of dancing that happens in the club. Overall, the Edgewater is not a bad hotel and the staff members that I dealt with were very nice and helpful. However, it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like many things these days \u00e2\u20ac\u201c isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth the price.

We had upgraded to the waterside of the hotel, since coming in the view was just gorgeous so once we walked into our room I was pretty disappointed by the quality of the room. The only modern and nice part of our room was the bathroom at most. We were told that it would definitely be a lot quieter being on the waterside but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.

There are a lot of fine hotels in Seattle and many more upscale than the Edgewater, but if you want a true Seattle/ Northwest experience, this is the place. Photos can describe the ambiance better than words, so I've attached a few. Basically, the decor is Northwest Lodge with ample use of logs in the furniture (as in a log four poster bed) and plaids in the carpets and bedspreads, and a gas fireplace in each room. The bathrooms have a glass enclosed stone shower. Public spaces provide comfortable seating for conversation, enjoying a good book in front of one of several stone fireplaces, or just enjoying the view. Lots for famous performers have stayed here so there are photos of those celebrities in the lounges. The Edgewater is unique enough that one gets the feeling that the staff really enjoy working here. Everyone we encountered was very personable. The bar, with its water view, was busy when we stopped by for a drink after check-in. Later, after a symphony concert, we thought we'd stop by for a quiet nightcap but it was not to be... the place was even livelier with the 20-30 crowd. The restaurant, also with a drop-dead view of Elliott Bay and the Olympic Mountains (on a clear day), has creative entrees at breakfast, lunch and dinner. The Edgewater is a great place to stay anytime but, particularly for someone planning on taking the Victoria Clipper to Victoria, BC, the Clipper dock is right next door. Also, for summer cruises to Alaska (depending on the cruise line), Seattle's Cruise Terminal is also adjacent.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "maple falls", "Title": "\u201calways nice\u201d", "Author": "toddycrackkorn", "ReviewID": "UR97214862", "Content": "enjoyed our stay, parking is spendy.

It has been afew years since we have stayed, but have been to many weddings and receptions. As a retired couple we go to Seattle about once a month, and usually enjoy the excellent service and location of The Roosevelt Hotel. We decided to try The Edgewater again as we had enjoyed our stays in the past. Regretably, we will not be returning , or be able to recommend the hotel to family & friends. Upon checking in we were assigned a Cityview Deluxe Room, which we had reserved. However, we didn't realize we had one of three of the worst rooms due to the proximity of the railroad tracks. Upon hearing a train every 5-10 minutes I saw the complimentary earplugs on the fireplace and knew we were in for a long night. My fears became reality as I wore the ear plugs, and still didn't get any sleep due to the crossing sounds and never ending trains. Waking up extrememly tired I made coffee and turned one of the mugs over to use to find it dirty with particles of food stuck to the sides,,(I have pictures of the mug), upon seeing that disgusting mug it made me question the cleanliness of the entire room, decided to forget the coffee. As it was chilly we tryed for two hours to get the fireplace working, which had worked the previous night, to no avail. The pilot light was on, but the fireplace would not come on manually or using the thermostat. For a Hotel of high reputation we were sadly disappointed at our experience this time at The Edgewater. Since we are retired, we travel extensively and expect more from a 5 Star Hotel. Also, our bill which was delivered to the room was wrong, however, the front desk attendant remedied that at check-out.

Having an oceanview room is ideal - not just for the beautiful view but to avoid the other side of the hotel which runs alongside the railroads tracks, which of course could be a little loud. The rooms are beautiful with a cozy, cabin feel. Rooms come with a fire place and a teddy bear - perfect for those rainy West Coast nights. The wimsical, rustic feel of the hotel lobby makes it great for kids and parents alike - you may also be pleasently surprised to find your four-legged friends are welcome as well. During our stay we chatted with a woman in the lobby who was staying with her Golden Retriever. She said that not only does the hotel allow dogs, you can have them anywhere in the hotel outside of restaurants and mentioned that she was thrilled with their pro-pet policy. During our stay, the hotel was the back-drop to both a wedding and a Christmas party - both of which I believe were hosted in the 4th floor banquet hall. The Edgewater hotel would make a beautiful venue for either event and honestly made me rethink the destination of my own upcoming wedding! The purpose of our trip was to see an NFL game at Qwest Field - seeing as how we're Canadian, it was our first time. If you too are going to a Seahawks game, make sure you give yourself enough time to experience Pioneer Square before the game. The Seahawks drumline 'Blue Thunder' is known to wander from bar to bar to pump up the pre-game crowd. But if you do intend to have a pint before the game, make sure you arrive well before kick-off. By 11:30am, FX McRory's already had a line-up almost out the door. The Edgewater Hotel is close enough to the stadium that you can walk to and from the game - but if you're looking for peace and quiet away from the football mob, the Edgewater is far enough down Alaskan Way that you'll be spared from the noise. The Edgewater is also just a short 5 minute walk to Seattle's famous Pike Place Market, the Seattle Aquarium, and a large selection of shops and restaurants. Whether you're looking to check out a sports game and enjoy Seattle's nightlife or whether you want to just relax by the water, the Edgewater Hotel is the perfect spot to take in a beautiful city.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coos Bay, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cExcellent customer service!\u201d", "Author": "ilem26", "ReviewID": "UR90935295", "Content": "My husband and I stayed in a basic room on the second floor. Our trip began with a ride from the airport, $45, in a white Lincoln Town car sent by the Hotel. When you arrive you see a beautiful entryway with a large fireplace and several valet attendants. They quickly help you out of the car and bring your things to the check in desk. The check in process is quick and we were in our room in a flash. The hallways and stairways take away from the elegance of this hotel; the carpeting is worn and because the elevator took so long we tried the stairs. Typical emergency staircase but there were broken ice machines and odd items seen as we walked up. Just wait for the elevator. The room was very nice; fluffy bedspread, little gas fireplace that you control, and the bathroom was very clean, stone tiled all over...to include the shower stall. No bathtub but the shower was interesting! Never took a shower without a door or curtain but the water pressure was amazing and I stayed in there forever! The only bad part of the room was the fact that we were on the street side. I felt like we were in the scene from My Cousin Vinny where the train keeps going by at horrid ours of the night. When we closed the door to the balcony we didn't hear it as bad, but the room grew too warm with it closed so we suffered with the many trains that went through. The hotel restaurant and lounge was great. Very interesting decor and beautiful views. We ate several meals there and enjoyed them all. Of all things to be my fav...the MAC n Cheese....sooooo yummy. And the Spinach salad. My husband and I are still trying to recreate the way it was made. Great location in relation to the Aquarium and a few other attractions with a short cab ride to Pike's Place and a cab ride to the Needle was around $20 but I think we got bamboozled on that one. The concierge at the hotel was GREAT and took special care of me when I needed to find the bar my husband and brother hunkered down at and he even delivered me safely to the door!

We spent a couple weeks trying to narrow down some hotels, but it started to become daunting. We had specifically ruled The Edgewater out for numerous reasons (the main being the large number of bad reviews we were constantly reading about it), but we waited until the day before and for some reason decided to do priceline and let fate decide. We wanted four star for fairly cheap ($109/nt) and close to town. When we were accepted and it The Edgewater we were kind ofdisappponted. When we got there the first night and saw our room we quickly realized why we got the dealwe did. It was a city side, of course, but the view is still really cool! Well, that night my girlfriend didn't sleep one hour because of the train noise and the rain on the all metal roof of the hotel (I personally love both of those sounds and could sleep all night to them all night). Shewentdown at 6am to the front desk and explained her issues with them. They were incredible about it. They upgraded us to a water view king with clawfoot tub and 50\" flatscreesn and AMAZING view of the water, at no extra charge!!! That's four star! Unlined the bar in the hotel! The happy hour is fantastic while you watch the freighters roll in! Also the housekeeper, Idalia was the reason we stayed four nights and felt like royalty! She should get a raise. She wasn't even working yet and dropped what she was doing to grab us more coffee condiments when we couldn't find anyone else around!!! Thanks Idalia! You and the rest of the staff were great! The valets are top notch and everyone should take a lesson from this staffs playbook! Kudos to The Edgewater!

It's valet only, with a overnight-24 hour fee of $33.00, and $6.44 sales tax!!!! So over $40 dollars once you pay the valet a night!!!!

Very clean with sufficient room for clothes and a good size desk with extra outlets for computer and other electrical devices (rare to find these days!). Bathroom was practical. No tub, but good size shower. Wall and floor tiled with stone. Water pressure was not a problem. The decor in the rooms is mainly \"northwestern\" with carved wood, stones, heavy solid wood furniture and lamp shades depicting mooses, bears and fish...Not exactly my style but....hey, everything else was perfect, including the amazing restaurant and bar (\"six seven\")!.

Great beautiful location, but this hotel is definitely not for everyone. Here's the scoop: Location: Right on the water, close to the Seattle Art Museum. The views from the lobby are amazing, right onto the water. Unfortunately, it is right across the street from train tracks. The last train on Friday night was around midnight, and the first one Saturday morning was around 8:30. Last one Saturday night was around 6 p.m. A 5 minute walk to the aquarium along the water, where you can get some yummy ice cream and gift shops. There's also an amusement center with games and a carousel for the kids. Definitely take the elevator just a block or so walk away on the same side of the street up to the level of pike market. From there, it literally is a few minute walk away. On the way there, a World Market is a great place to get cheap snacks/drinks. $0.79 for a litre of water versus $3.29 along the waters. They sell beer and wine as well, with other house hold knick knacks. Hotel: As you approach the entrance, you're greeted by an amazing outdoor fireplace and water fountain. Great views from the lobby Floor to ceiling windows looking over the water. It's definitely has a unique decor. Fancy 'Alaskan' decorations. I wouldn't call it tacky (as others have), I quite liked it. This hotel has been awarded the 4 diamond rating from AAA 4 years in a row (according to the plaques on the wall). Great seating area in the lobby, a couple of fireplaces. Parking (valet) is $33 plus tax ($40 total) per night. That's standard for all downtown Seattle hotels (we stayed at the Westin once and it was $40 as well). After reading reviews, we parked across the street in a parkade. It's where all the cruise ship passengers park their cars. Only $20 per day. Safe and secure in my opinion. It closes at 11 p.m. and no in and out privileges. There's an attendant until it closes then the doors shut. Check-In Greeted warmly by a cheerful lady. No problems, and she upgraded us for the second night. Room City View As per previous reviewers, no matter what floor you're on, request a higher numbered room. For example, 238 is further away from the street (and the noise) than 211. Our room number was in the 30's so we were kind of in the middle. We could see the Space Needle and part of the harbour. Traffic noise was busy Friday as lots of people were in waiting to board the cruise ship the next day. The train wasn't too bad with the windows closed, but it does cause a low hum. Much louder when the train blows its whistle. I wasn't too bothered by it, but I can see how others might be. The room was on the smaller side, but comfortable. Nice flat screen tv. The bathroom was nice, yet small as well. I didn't mind it, but can see others wanting a bigger one. Lovely rain shower head, granite tiles in the shower. Good a/c. Each room has a gas fireplace, nice touch. The room was definitely decorated nicely, like a lodge. A fully stocked fridge, but no safe! You can give valuables to the front desk. Some parts of the room was squeaky, so not sure how the people below us felt. Room Water View The next night we were upgraded to a partial water view. Wow, what a difference. The rooms were much bigger. There was also a bear that acted like a foot stool. The patio was nice, 2 patio chairs and a table. We looked onto the cruise ship docks. A cruise ship was docked, so it obscured part of the view. But, we could still see out onto the water fairly well. Wow, nice, very nice. You could hear the water. Once the cruise ship left (at 4 p.m.) the view turned out nicer. We sat out on the patio and soaked in the view. Definitely can't be beat, I can only imagine what the full water view is like. Being on a lower floor, we could hear at times the people above us, as well as the bathroom. It really wasn't that bad, but I can see how it might bother some. Amenities No pool. Business center on the second floor with 2 computers with free internet. A lounge and a restaurant with gorgeous views. Didn't try the food, but smelled good. There is a gift shop on site. There's a free shuttle that will take you I believe anywhere within a mile or two. Overall I would recommend this hotel based on the excellent staff and location. If you're a light sleeper, then I'm not so sure unless you have a room furthest away from the street. The rooms are good (even the city view). We were lucky to have been upgraded.

This place has spectacular views & I don't care what anyone says, after a long day of touring, there is absolutely no better room I would want to walk into when it was time to settle down. Sure there are better hotels in the heart of the city with real 4 star amenities, but NO ONE will beat the view. It is so relaxing. The rooms are small and as someone said, kinda tacky looking. The bed is comfortable but soft. The bathroom doesn't seem to match the design of the room, but who cares! It's still nice. The staff is good but for some reason, the male staff seem more aloof. Weird but true. Room service for breakfast was expensive and the food was lukewarm. However, the Six Seven restaurant was nice. Now typically, that is not my type of dining, but three of us ordered something different and we all loved the food. The staff was accomodating and the view and decor in the restaurant was spectacular. I will add this, if you're not staying on the oceanview side, then stay at the Marriott up the street because its not worth it, with all things being considered. Everything that you need to do is within walking distance. If you're going to Pike Street, there is an elevator up the street that will assist you in getting up the deadly uphill climbs. There is a hotel shuttle that is free that we also take you and pick you up within the free zone & must of what a tourist may do is within the free zones or walking distance from where you would be dropped off. The Victoria Clipper, the aquarium, and tons of other things to do are right up the street. It truly is in a great location. At night I just opened the windows and watched all the shipping boats, ferries, and cruise ships come in and out of port. I would stay again & definitely recommend the hotel to others. One strange thing, but it was not a negative thing, the cleaning people are obsessed with cleaning the room. I have never seen anyone so eager to clean the room. It is as if they get reprimanded even if you tell them you don't want your room cleaned. Strange. Also, contrary to other reviewers, we didn't hear much noise from the surrounding rooms. A child upstairs would tumble and jump until like 8 pm, but after that, not a peep was heard. Who knows, maybe we were the loudest. FYI, instead of paying a lot for the tour cruises, take the round trip ferry rides for under $7/person to get in a nice sightseeing cruise of the puget sound. Booked through Travelocity which allows you to select the ocean view. Rooms were like $149 or so a night. Maybe less, I can't remember but definitely not more.

Also, make sure you know the following before you go; the hotel has NO pool, hot tub, steam room. Also, the gift shop closes very early so if you need any toiletries, etc...make sure to bring them with you or be aware of the early closing, it makes for a very inconveinent first night if not.

The only good thing about the location is that it's on the waterfront. Literally. it's on a pier on the edge of Puget Sound. However, it's not reasonably near anything of interest in Seattle, and if you want to walk, anyplace you'd want to go to from here is uphill, sometimes substantially so. After driving up from the Bay Area, the last thing I want to encounter is an extra $30/night (or so) for parking. It's a complete rip-off. Fortunately, the conference organizer got me a parking pass for the hotel where the conference was held, so I parked there for the duration and walked back and forth every day. In-room Internet? Not free. The room I got, overlooking the street and the train tracks, was one of the smallest hotel rooms I've ever seen. Heck, it was smaller than the boutique hotel room I stayed in in Paris (France) several years ago. A bed barely fit in the room. A chair squeezed into the corner, and a narrow glass table ran along the wall opposite the end of the bed. The bed had a tall wooden headboard, and every time I rolled over, the headboard banged against the wall. (Sorry, neighbor.) There was a small gas fireplace in the corner, which apparently provided the heat. I much rather would have had a desk to do some work--although I wouldn't pay for Internet (did I mention Internet access isn't free?). The bathroom continued the \"upscale\" and pretentious theme, with a marble sink counter on a chrome pipe stand and a stone floor in the bathroom and shower. I found out the first morning that wet stone is slippery. Not the best material for a shower floor, that's for sure. The bathroom wasn't quite as small as the Red Roof by the Portland airport (where my knees poked out the door when I sat on the pot), but it was close. Most of it was form over function. About the only good things I can say about the room is that the bed itself was comfortable and there was a nice, decently sized flat-screen TV on the wall. Upon my exit, there was a charge for parking. At the desk, they found that I had been charged for someone else, so they removed the charge from my bill.

Besides, we spent the better part of each day of our stay outside the hotel exploring. The tub and shower in the bathroom were fine, but the sink drained very slowly. The bed was very comfortable with cozy bedding. The lobby was nice, restaurant good, but the 6/7 bar was our favorite spot! Great food, drinks, and service there. We hit their happy hour every day. (Try the \"Olympic Sunset\" martini!) Even the little gift shop was quaint and fun to visit. My major complaint was lack of coffee in our room - we were in Seattle! They had just removed the coffee makers from all the rooms as a cost-saving measure, I think. You had to either order room service (nice, but pricey) or go down to the gift shop off the lobby and stand in line at the Starbucks counter within the shop. I'm not into going that route at 7AM when I'm on vacation. (Note: since our stay we sent our daughter and her fiance to the Edgewater on their vacation, and she reported that coffee was once again in the rooms - management must have had enough complaints to reverse the earlier decision.) We also loved the location of this hotel and walked everywhere; Pike Marketplace, Space Needle, etc. There were several trails right by the hotel for a nice walk along the water and the cruise ships and ferry boats were close by as well. (We took a day and traveled over to Victoria - great fun.) All in all we loved it and will definitely go back. It's worth it to get a room with a water view; we were treated to seals swimming by a couple of times and the sunsets were breath-taking.

Read on, I can help!\u201d", "Author": "D_M_and_A", "ReviewID": "UR60782792", "Content": "I know, I know ... you were so excited to get that \"four star\" hotel on Priceline.com for less than $100 until you started reading the reviews and realized that you had been duped. Yes, you can almost be guaranteed that the Edgewater hotel will put you on the \"city side\" of the hotel (read: train tracks and parking lot/street noise) if you booked through Priceline.com. You may be one of the few luck ones, but it's not likely. Now that you have a reservation that cannot be changed or refunded, take a minute to just suck it up and let's make the best of it: Hopefully you bid only $70 to $80 for your room. If you are OK with trains and traffic outside your room, you can stop reading now. If you want the \"four star\" room you were promised, or as close to it as possible, read on: 1) Call the hotel immediately and ask to have your room upgraded to the water side (the side of the hotel the happy reviewers are talking about). A \"partial water view\" is currently $30 more and a \"full water view\" is $60 more per night. The partial water view is a joke. You will have a full view of a pier across the way with some dirty water between your window and the pier. Get the full water view upgrade. I know, it sucks, you're now paying $93 more ($33 for valet and $60 for a view) than you intended when booking through Priceline.com, but @ $163 to $173 per night, you are still paying half of what the hotel website is charging. 2) Whether you take my advice to upgrade, or not, you want to be in a room with a number of x40 or high - i.e., 240 instead of 232 or 156 instead of 122. Why you ask ... because the lower numbered rooms are closer to the street and train tracks. Of course if you have an odd-numbered room, you are on the parking lot/street side of the hotel anyway, but you can still make the best of it by trying to get as far away from the tracks as possible. 3) If you do upgrade to the water side of the hotel and ask for a \"full view\" room, make sure you are given an even number higher than x40 and preferably higher than x50. For example, 242 does not have as good a view of the water as 256 and 228 almost certainly will give you a wonderful view of a pier with train/street noise (note the sarcasm here). Also, as with all hotels, the higher the floor, the better the view. The 100's are almost at water level, 200's and 300's are fine, and the 400's are suites on the top floor. If you get an even numbered room, higher than x40 on either the second or third floor, you will be fine. 4) Parking is \"valet only\" @ $33 per night. Add this into your nightly cost. I know, it's outrageous that you are paying $33 per night to have a valet drive your car about 45 feet from where you dropped it off and you probably could have done this yourself, but you are just going to have to live with this too. If you don't want to pay the extra $33 per night for your room (plus tips), don't drive. Business Center: Two computers with internet in cramped room on each floor. Restaurant: Beautiful view, too pricey for the selection and qualify offered. Lobby: Some of the best views in the hotel. Bring your drinks and enjoy! Shuttle: The hotel does have a shuttle that can get you downtown, to Pike's Place or the Ferry Building, but keep in mind they can only operate within 1.5 miles of the hotel, so something like the Space Needs would be out. The bathrooms are nice - great showing. Sinks are odd and back up pretty frequently unless you only turn the faucets on half way.

The people working the desk were not very friendly (they weren't unfriendly) but barely took the time to smile or greet me upon check in.

There's so much history regarding this hotel with Beatles having stayed there and fishing out their window from their room.

It's almost a cross between rustic and modern design.

After complaining to the front desk (I was offered another room, but just did not bother to move as it was late), the noise was postponed to 6:30 am on the second and the third morning. I got up and opend the door, just to find out hotel staff walking around (and talking). The noise seemed to have come from their moving the heavy laundry carts, as they would park in the narrow hallway during the day. That group of staff (and most probably the hotel management) did not seem to be aware of the guests staying in the hotel. The other factor that made this worse was the old, wooden building. It is not sound-proof at all. My good experience was with my daily trip to Downtown. The hotel has a van that would send guests to the city in the morning (free of charge). The driver was a nice person and offered a return service as long as I called him. The front desk and the vallet staff were also very nice. The hotel has a gorgeous waterfront view in the lobby and the reasaurant. I believe it has the same view in those waterfront rooms (unfortunately my room was on the street side). The room interior has a style, with a fireplace. The location of the hotel is good if you would like to walk along the waterfront, and visit the aquarium and the marketplace. But it is a little far from the busy street. I would not recommend walking near the aquarium area alone late in the evenings, as I was approached by a suspecious stranger there one evening. Overall, this hotel needs to improve its infrastructure to claim a four-star one. At this stage, it is a nice motel. If you go there for a casure trip, this hotel is still on my recommnedation list. But make sure you have the waterfront rooms and stay far away from the room 101.

We had to stuck something in front of it to keep it open. 6. No coffee table or dining table or nothing. We had to eat on the bed... Very hard with the little one. 7. Very noisy. Every time the neighbours opened or closed their doors it was like they were in our room. We could hear everything in the hall ways. 8. Very expensive valet parking (but to be fair, we knew that before we go). $33+taxes for each day. But when priceline gives that to you you have no choice anymore. 9. Was not worth the $80+taxes (per night) we paid priceline, and $10+taxes (per night) for upgrade. I cannot imagine who would pay their regular $200+ prices for this low quality.

I was actually sweating in the room and had to open the window for some cold air. I called the front desk and they offered a fan but then later called to say that they are out. By that, I'm guessing other guests were experiencing the same thing which I thought is a little cheap of the hotel to do something like that considering a one night stay averages at $280 per night.

The hotel is great overall, they offer a lot of amenities like a shuttle that leaves every hour to bring you to the shopping district or anywhere within 1 - 2 miles, Valet, great lobby environment, restaurant in the hotel, business center and gym.

It's a property built in 1962 but looks great on the outside and around the public space. We had a waterfront room with views of Elliott Bay and gas fireplace. The room seems to have been renovated, size is fine, and decor resembles a lodge cabin. The bathroom is equipped with modern fixtures that look good at first glance but impractical and poorly conceived. The standing \"spa\" shower has only half a glass panel, so it's unavoidable that the bathroom floor would get wet no matter how we tried to adjust the shower head to point inward. The \"vessel\" sink comes with an instruction next to it - noting that the water needs to fill the vessel bowl to about 3/4 full before the draining starts, due to the lack of a overflow so pressure is needed to suck down the water. The vessel looks cute but we'd prefer a conventional sink that works. Look is not everything. The room is fine but having stayed in many hotels in the same class, we consider this property an average 3-star hotel, far from its \"luxury\" classification. The beds are on the soft side, some of the pillows smell musky so we had to spray some cologne on them to mask the odor.

The maintenance person who checked it out told us other guests had reported the same problem in this room but after having used a gas sniffer the staff had decided the smell was from the fake fireplace logs heating up. We have owned a number of gas fireplaces and never had any gas smells from them like this. He also offered to switch us again but we decided to keep the deck door open a bit to provide fresh air rather than go through the bother of switching. The internet access was extremely slow most of the time - more like dial up than high speed. You could watch the various frames paint in the windows when they finally did display. We paid $10 a day for this - not advertised on the web site and usually free at other hotels we've stayed at. The parking is valet only. Again this isn't clear from the web site but the real shocker is a $30 per day charge for the service. There are commercial lots in the area but they are across active railway tracks, don't stay open all night, and have no security so you don't really have any choice. The food in the restaurant is excellent but they constantly play techno music which can get very annoying after a while. The halls were cold and didn't appear to be heated. The art work on the walls looked extremely faded with mostly blue colors left. The furnishings in the room were quite nice and would fit into a 4 star class hotel. However the bathroom sink has a design flaw and doesn't drain well. To address this the hotel provides a card on the sink that starts with \" Hello. My name is Sink\".

My husband and I pulled up to the valet parking to be greeted by a huge beautiful outdoor glassed- in fireplace. The valets were friendly and efficient. The lobby is open and airy with handsome furnishings and really nice views. Check in with Ben was quick and easy and to our delight we were upgraded to a gorgeous waterfront room. When we opened the door to our room we knew we were in for a treat. There is a beautiful bathroom with a glass and slate freestanding shower and a heavenly claw foot tub. There are French doors that open from the bathroom into the main room so you can enjoy the Puget Sound view while bathing. In the main room there was a huge modern log style king bed with lush linens and a TEDDY BEAR. There is also a sitting area with comfy leather chairs, a corner fireplace and a large furred bear ottoman that I really wanted to take home. (I saw that you can purchase them in their gift shop) There is a Lodge type, comfortable feel to everything, but in a modern contemporary way. Our room was on the second floor right above the restaurant. After taking time to fully appreciate our room and hearing all of the fun they were having below we decided to visit their happy hour :-). It was obviously a Seattle hotspot. It was a packed house. They have some seating outside right on the water. We had the most fabulous cocktails and while we had dinner reservations elsewhere the appetizers looked delish so we will have to try the Six Seven restaurant next visit . Later I read the the \"Mixologist\" has won national awards for his delicious concoctions. The hotel is in a good area of waterfront shopping and restaurants. It is pretty close to the cruise terminal too. After a wonderful night in Seattle we came back to our room, started the fireplace, opened the windows and a bottle of wine and just completely enjoyed the beautiful views, boat traffic and the twinkling lights of the city. I woke early the next morning to the sound of seagulls and ferries. I made a cup of Joe and took it all in again. It was our 20th anniversary and it couldn't have been more perfect unless we stayed longer.

I have heard that a lot of operaters treat Priceline referrals like crap, this is the first hotel that has proved this myth true. Poor word of mouth is from the customers getting a \"deal\" is just as damaging as those paying full fare. Management here should learn to NOT treat Priceline customers as second class citizens.

I bid on 4 nights on Priceline for the price of $100 a night. At first I was pretty excited to get such a good price on an expensive 4 star hotel in Seattle. But then I read reviews on Trip Advisor and became skeptical because of hearing some negative reviews about room size, decor, etc. After booking on Priceline, I called the hotel directly to confirm my reservation and to request a room with 2 beds because I needed to accommodate 3 people in the room. The lady on the phone informed me that she could put in a request for a room with 2 beds, but the only way I could guarantee a room with 2 beds was to pay an extra $20. I decided to take my chances and not pay the extra money. When I arrived at the hotel, I found out that we did end up with a city view room with 2 double beds. The room was nice, but a little small for 3 people. The beds were uncomfortable to fit more than one person in a bed. The fireplace was a nice perk, but didn't really seem to put out much heat. The bear foot rest was a little tacky. The bathroom was beautiful and large. Unfortunately the double doors to get into the bathroom were awkward and loud to open and close. The sink in the bathroom was also difficult to use without getting water all over the counter. We requested to not have our room cleaned while we were there, but it was cleaned one day against our request. The bar area was nice but the temperature was set very low. They had a \"happy hour\" special that ran Sunday thru Thursday. $5 appetizers and drink specials. This was a nice perk, because the prices are normally pretty steep. We did have a few negative experiences in the bar. The first night we arrived, we went down to the bar with some drinks from our room to listen to a band playing. As soon as we arrived in the bar, a staff member came up to us and asked us \"if he could take our drinks from us.\" We didn't really understand what he was asking us but then realized he was being vague about not allowing drinks in the bar that weren't purchased there. We left the bar to return our drinks to the room and returned to find the band was done playing. At this point it was about 12:30 or 1am and we sat to order drinks. When we asked if they had the specific beer \"Samuel Adams\" they just said no and didn't offer an alternative. At most other high end bars I have gone too, they will usually offer some similar alternative. After we were there for about 15 minutes, the staff started rudely flickering the lights on and off. I assumed that this was to indicate that they were trying to close, but I felt this was a very inappropriate way to convey this message at such a high end bar. They could have politely come up to us and tell us \"last call\" or \"we are going to close soon, so this will be your last drink.\" The next day we complained to the front desk, and they told us they would talk to the bar manager regarding this. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to a friend as long as they get a good price on Priceline or Hotwire, but I would not recommend paying the rates the offer directly from the hotel. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t consider this a 4 star hotel that Priceline rates it at; it is more like a 3 star. On a side note, the parking at the hotel was $30 a night. This is pretty steep, but parking in Seattle is generally expensive. We found a parking garage one block away from the hotel on Elliot and Vine that was only $17 per 24 hour block. I would highly recommend this garage, especially if you are not planning on using your car much to get around Seattle. We left the car there our whole trip for almost half the cost of keeping it at the hotel. And the parking garage is covered; parking at the hotel is a valet at a surface lot a few feet away from the entrance.

We traveled to Seattle for business, and we bought this room on an on-line auction site. We paid $90, including tax. After we won the auction, my travel partner called the hotel to make sure and reserve a room with two beds. The hotel told her that they \"might\" have one available when we checked in, but if they didn't, there would be a $20 charge! We called two different hotel staff members at two different times and each was as unhelpful as the other. Finally, on the 3rd call, the woman said there would be no charge to \"upgrade\" to a room with 2 beds. Since when is requesting 2 beds in a hotel room an \"upgrade\"?? When we arrived, we found the decor laughable (a tacky \"lodge\" decor more suitable to Wyoming or Montana than to the Seattle waterfront). After refusing to pay the $20 to \"upgrade\" to 2 beds, we were given a room at no extra charge. There were no luggage carts to take our bags to our room, and they gave us a room as far away from the lobby as possible, right next to the street, with a \"city view\" (not exactly what I would call a view). (The waterfront rooms DO have a beautiful view of Puget Sound). The decor was tacky, particularly the dirty, furry \"bear\" foot stool, and the room was small and had a funny smell. The bathroom was a decent size, but totally did not match the rest of the decor. The only source of heat was a gas fireplace, with a fake rock surround. The fire came on and off all night; so the room was hot, then cold, then hot again. Plus, the light from the fire coming on would wake me up. When we went to get ready for our seminar in the morning, the show head (a rain head type) was broken so you had to stand directly under it (and on top of the shower drain) to shower. There was one small mirror in the bathroom, and one vessel sink, making it impossible for two people to get ready at the same time. And finally, the TV cabinet doors wouldn't stay open because the floors in the room were so un-level! No free wi-fi either. A small thing, but one of my pillowcases was on inside out!!

The furniture and fabrics were in good shape and the linens were of excellent quality. Robes were included in room. The toiletries were Noble House spa products including glycerine and bath bars. The bathroom was one of the largest we have had in Seattle and very well appointed vis a vis lighting and makeup/shaving mirrors. A full sized hair dryer is included. The towels are big and fluffy. The bed is very comfortable. I had read some complaints about the housekeeping. I, mother of the Executive Houskeeper of a competing chain, know exactly where to look. I looked. Whoever Linda is, she knows how to clean an hotel room. Over a 3 nite stay, the service was consistant. The front desk is equally responsive to requests. We have the minibar and the snack basket removed upon arrival. I try not to have Godiva Chocolates and other gratuitous carbs dangled in front of my diabetic spouse. They are very nice and pricey carbs if one is interested. The cab service, shuttles and wake-ups were all performed cheerfully and as requested. They corrected a room service billing error no questions asked. The restaurant food is good. In Seattle you have to be good or you're gone. There is too much good food in this city to tolerate the mediocre. The service is cheerful but a bit absent minded. Corrections are taken in good part however. A very \"no Harm, No Foul\" sort of attitude. Room service hours are on the short side and very early departures need to make other arrangements for breakfast.

The lounge had expensive $10 drinks and a good view but absolutely no character. After experiencing the boring lounge we decided not to bother with the restaurant and instead cabbed it into the city for food.

The entire hotel is decorated with cheesy ornaments and prints to give it an old run down log cabin type feel. It cold be used for an over the top comedy set to shoot movies like Dumb and Dumber.

Overall the hotel seemed more like a 3* instead of a 4* when taking into account the low quality toiletries and housekeeping. We tipped housekeeping every morning and received different service every day. The first morning they removed our dirty glasses and did not bother replacing them with new ones, they did not take out the garbage and left the ice bucket full of water with no replacement bag.

I had this hotel booked for me by the company I was visiting and having read a number of reviews on this hotel which were pretty mixed I was concerned at what I would find. The room: I had a deluxe 'city scape' view which was a resonable size and overlooked the entrance to the hotel. The room itself was clean the bed comfortable but for me personally the decor was not what you would expect in a city hotel. Although nothing wrong with it the slick modern bathroom did not match the log cabin and cuddly toy approach in the main room. The restaurant: The restaurant (bar and lounge) overlook the water and when eating in the restaurant the view is a fabulous place to watch the ships and seals. The dinner menu itself I was not so impressed with. I ate once in the restaurant and struggled to work out what was being described (that could be down to me being English and not familiar with the terms) The food I did have was however very good but I didn't return as it is of a higher class of food and far to fancy to eat regularly. Breakfast has a good choice of foods with a good continental option - but be prepared to wait to be seated! The service is not as efficient as in the evening... Room service: efficient, tasty food - my only complaint is that there is not anything light like a sandwich on the menu, 18% tip plus $2 charge is added for each order. Hotel in general: I have encountered more friendly and efficient staff in other Seattle hotels - they are not bad but I felt at times I was an inconvenince to them. The general decor and facilities are good however the corridors upstairs are in desperate need of a revamp - the carpets are tired the mustard paintwork makes them look worse than perhaps they are. The woodwork is chipped and battered in places and so this is probably the worst area. The business 'suite' is a small cupboard in which you do not want to spend too much time - there is a gym which from what I could see was very busy but not used by myself. Location: fabulously placed on the waterfront , however slightly out of town if you like walking - although they do offer a suttle bus to in to town. The cruise ships are right next door so you dont want a room overlooking that as all you see is the side of the cruise ship. The rail tracks do run close to the hotel but I had no trouble with the noise that some had reported - maybe just luck or that I am used to train noise.

Fortunately, our experience was very pleasant. Knowing that the hotel charges $28 for valet parking per 24 hour period, we decided to go ahead and arrive early and park the car for the day and just walk around downtown. When we arrived around 1:00 we told the valet that we hadn't checked in yet but could we park, they were very nice and accomodating. We went ahead and went to the front desk not expecting to check in, but got our room reserved and everything. The service was very friendly and I didn't get any \"attitude\" about booking through Priceline. We were offered an upgrade to a water view room for $50 but declined. (Another reviewer mentioned the spacious lobby with fabulous water views - I agree that between the VERY comfy lobby, lounge, and dining area there are plenty of places to sit and stare at the water if you want to so you don't need a water view room). There were no rooms ready, but we were told that there was only one party ahead of us and that they would call us when the room was ready. No problem, since we weren't expecting to get in early anyway. We were called within an hour & given access to the room. We went ahead and took our luggage up to check it out. It was room 407 facing the city. For a \"non\" premium view, we had a very nice view of the city including the space needle. Of course, at the Edgewater you are pretty much \"below\" the town, so it's not like you have this huge 360 degree view, but looking at some of the photos of dumpsters from another reviewer, this was definitely better than that and quite pleasant. The room was quite small, but cozy and comfortable. Neat bright red painted bathroom with black & chrome accents. Nice \"rain\" shower, good smelling soap/shampoo, etc. Upscale amenities. Fridge, small TV, nice ice bucket & glasses. Comfortable bed & pillows. I think it would have been TOO small for more than a night or two, but for one night it was fine. The most attitude we got was from the bartender at the lounge. And some of the lounge patrons were a little chichi for me, but it was still a nice night out with hubby. Negatives: the elevator floor was dirty - it had dark stains on the carpet and looked like it hadn't been vacuumed. I noticed this more the day we checked out so maybe it was just especially trafficked over that 24 hour period. Postives: definitely a good deal for $135 on priceline ($110 bid plus their service fees).

We enjoyed walking to nearby restaurants, and even enjoyed the walk to Pike Market - although I wouldn't recommend walking to older folks as it is fairly good distance (we aren't in great shape ourselves but it was a pleasant walk). We had a waterfront room, on the 1st floor, which is interesting in the winter! We had waves crashing right on us basically - but we loved it! We probably could have moved higher up if we didn't enjoy the crashing waves, but we never asked. During our stay we had a problem with the TV. Within minutes the repair man was there fixing it and they even bought us a movie for the \"inconvenience\". The ambiance is wonderful for a winter stay.

I agree about the curtains \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some sheers to allow light in but maintain privacy would have been nice. The Adirondack chairs on the small balcony were comfortable. Noticed a cruise ship docked pretty darn close to the southern part of the hotel, which I would imagine would be startling when you open your window to enjoy THAT water view! (There are a lot of cruise ship travelers staying at the hotel before and after cruises.)

Weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very impressed with the bar/wait staff.

In fact, I slept better in the bed at the Edgewater than in the bed at the Liberty Inn we stayed at the next 2 nights (Dupont). I think the location is better for leisure travelers than business people--It's walkable distance to many tourist attractions and good restaurants. Minibar prices are extremely high, as is the parking fee ($28 for overnight guests). Recommend checking out the other parking options mentioned by reviewers. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small convenience store a block or two up (Wall). There is a Cost Plus World Market a few blocks away (toward downtown but up a block from the pier road), that has reasonably priced wines. The hotel is very distinctively decorated. The hotel lobby is more like a living room, with comfortable reading niches, a fireplace, and game tables (backgammon, chinese checkers). We had some lovely warm weather while there. I went looking for a place to sit outside to read, and was surprised that the hotel had no outside space for people to enjoy the water/weather.

Since the property is built on a pier, the only place we could see the water was from the lobby, the cocktail lounge, and the restaurant.

The bathroom was the most striking feature of the rooms, with a stone shower and two shower heads (no tubs). We found it rather odd that the only closet in the room was inside of the bathroom. There was no auxiliary source of heat in the bathroom which is a touch we like when getting out of the shower. The entertainment center/armoire had a few drawers for storage, but not enough for 2 people. In both of our rooms, the doors on the entertainment center would not stay open. (ever hear of shims?)

Linens and towels were adequate. There were not enough hooks for towels or clothes. House brand toiletries were OK and a quality toothbrush was provided upon request.

We only ate one meal there given the cost. Breakfast would have run a minimum of $15 had we chosen to eat that there. Room service while not tried was expensive.

It's worth it if you can get a water view room for less than $100 on Priceline, but it's definitely not worth full price (especially for \"city-view\" rooms). A little background: I have spent a lot of time in Seattle -- and in hotels in Seattle -- because I have family in Seattle and I used to work in Seattle. I lived in hotels during the week and went home to Vancouver on weekends, so I know Seattle hotels pretty well. I had eaten both brunch and a business dinner at the Edgewater in the past two years, and enjoyed the restaurant and the views both times. So when I bid $89 on Priceline and got the Edgewater, I thought I'd gotten a good deal. In the end, it was a mixed experience, though, much in line with the reviews here. The good: The bathroom. We didn't get a tub (or a balcony), but the shower was quite nice. I liked the dual showerheads, and they had provided pretty much everything I needed in the bathroom (blowdryer, magnifying mirror, etc.). The woodsy kitsch decor. The nice thing about it is that it's meant to look worn, so where the halls (especially) were worn, you weren't sure whether that was part of the hunting lodge look or actual wear. Usually wear & tear in the hallways bothers me; because of the decor it didn't here. The staff. They were in general pretty friendly; we didn't have any problems checking in or out. The bad: The mattress. Hard, hard, hard. At a hotel that lists for Westin \"heavenly bed\" prices, I didn't expect the Best Western mattress. (Actually, I think the mattress at the Best Western over by Seattle Center was better the one time I stayed there.) The trains. We were in a \"city-view\" room, as it was a Priceline reservation. We were offered an upgrade to water view for $50 / night, but didn't take it as we weren't tourists & didn't need the view -- I didn't think about the train tracks, though. Combined with the rock hard mattress, the trains squealing by all night make it pretty difficult to sleep. Avoid city-view rooms. The keys. They demagnetize at the drop of a hat, which led to awkward moments where neither my husband or I could get into the room. The desk staff said it happens all the time if you put the key near credit cards or cell phones. Okay, well, where are you going to carry the key if not in a purse or wallet, both of which appear to be landmines of key demagnetization? Management clearly knows about it; why is it not fixed? No other hotels have this problem. The size of the rooms. Teeny, as already mentioned here. We only just had space to walk between the queen-sized bed and the chair. The little things (also quite mixed): The nickel-and-dime routine. If a cafe two blocks away gives me free wireless with my $2 coffee, why can't the Edgewater give its customers free wireless with their $100+ room? If I can park on the street for free right outside the hotel, why charge $28/night for parking? (not to mention I think $28/night is the most expensive hotel parking I've ever seen in Seattle.) Weird layout. For some patrons, the long walk may be difficult. The lobby isn't in the middle of the hotel, like in most places -- you check in and then all the rooms are down a long, long, narrow hallway. The elevator is halfway down that hallway, not near the lobby. So it could be difficult for elderly or handicapped patrons to navigate. The number of people. Because it's on the water it's an event hotel. You'll see a lot of people in the narrow hallways and and in the lounge / lobby. We didn't have much problem with noise in the hallways up on the fourth floor, though, fortunately. No name toiletries. The sort you'd expect in a mid-level chain, not a place trying to be upscale. Also, a very strong, not very pleasant scent to them. They were supposedly from a spa in the Noble House chain (basically the same as generic \"Holiday Inn\" toiletries). It didn't exactly make me feel I was in a hotel worth $300 a night (good thing I didn't pay that). The fireplace. Nice idea, but ours didn't work. It had a pilot light on all night, but no matter what we did with the thermostat the fireplace wouldn't light. We tried the timer as well and that also didn't work. Trying to sleep across from the pilot light, combined with the train noise and the hard mattress, was difficult. The curtains. Two choices -- completely shut and blocking all light, or completely open and flashing the street as you dress. I like having some light in the room during the day, even while I'm getting up & getting ready, so a set of sheers behind the heavy curtains would have been nice, and you usually see that in hotels, but the Edgewater just had one set of heavy curtains. Many of these are not big things, but small touches that, when neglected, show that the Edgewater isn't an upscale hotel worth the money they charge. If you can book a water-view room for under $100 on Priceline, it's worth it.

The noise level was probably my biggest concern. When I arrived at the hotel, it was almost exactly like the website pictures. The entrance area had a nice big fireplace and the doormen were very friendly. The lobby area had a nice, beautiful view of Puget Sound. There were 2 fireplaces in the lobby area with board games near the seats by the window. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely a lodge theme at the hotel as there are antlers all around you. If you have children, this is probably not a good hotel to bring your children, unless they are older and know to avoid sharp objects. The receptionist greeted me promptly and even upgraded me to a water view room with a balcony when I asked her if I could have a quiet room. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing because they had a convention staying with them, the more expensive rooms were the only ones left by the time I arrived for check-in. Needless to say, I was super happy about having the free upgrade. I read about the stinky, dim hallways and I was pleasantly surprised. The hallways didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look any different to me than any other hotel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at. The one leading to my room was relatively well-lit and did not smell like mold. My room looked like the pictures they provided on the website. It had a cute little, but expensive, teddy bear sitting on the bed. The fireplace was a nice touch and there was a bear ottoman near the fireplace with 2 comfy chairs. The balcony had 2 plastic lounge chairs with a small table. The bathroom was very nice. It had 2 shower heads; one was the rain one, another which was a regular one. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor matched the rest of the theme and was neat. I took a close-up picture of the bath products in case anyone wanted to know the brand name of their products. Their bar soap was slightly drying, but their shower gel made up for that. The shampoo and conditioner were great; the conditioner definitely kept my hair nice and moisturized. The body lotion had a nice smell without being overpowering and also moisturized without being oily/greasy. Having the balcony was super nice. It was a little cold to stay outside, but I put on my coat just so I could enjoy being on the waterfront. I suppose when the cruise ships start arriving in April, the view and noise level would go up a little, but when I was there, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem. For the rest of the amenities in the room, there were a little refrigerator with drinks inside and a little bar above it for the liquors. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a 4 cup coffee maker with Starbucks coffee. There are nice plush bathrobes if you like those. They also provide a good iron and ironing board as well. The hotel apparently also had bikes you could use, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a chance to see what they were like. The shuttle service was excellent. It left promptly at the top of the hour, but you have to make sure you arrive about 10 minutes before it leaves, as it is a popular service and the other hotel guests definitely utilize it. It runs from 8 or 9 AM until about 10 PM. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it in the morning since I needed to be at my conference before the service began. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a $6-10 cab ride to the shopping area in downtown. If you want to walk, it would probably take about 15 to 20 minutes with a few uphill climbs. I usually walked back from my conference in the afternoon and the walk back was pretty nice if you walk along the waterfront area. Word to the wise, some of the cabbies will take you around an extra block or two to run up the meter, so be weary. If you know you need a cab, call ahead to the bell desk about 10 minutes before. The hotel isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the main downtown area, so it takes them a little bit to get to the hotel. Calling 10 minutes prior saves a little time. The bell men were super friendly and point out good restaurants for you to try. Chris was super friendly and made sure the cabbies were heading to the hotels for a prompt pick up. The in-room food tasted pretty good. The tuna tartar had a good zest and the grilled scallops weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overcooked. The wasabi mashed potatoes had just enough of a kick without you needing water to cool down your mouth. The business center was on the smaller side, but you could use the internet for free inside. There was a printer without additional charge as well. If you prefer to have internet in your room, it was $10/day. The gym, again, is a little on the small side. There were 2 treadmills, 2 elliptical machines, and 1 bike. There is a flat screen TV, so you could catch up on the news while you work out. They have some free weights and a pulley system. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine if you just want some cardio while you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re there. Checking out of the hotel wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too difficult, but I think they forgot to print out a folio for me. Perhaps it was because I booked through Priceline and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any additional charges, so they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to give me one.

Having never had the opportunity to stay there I was very excited to have the chance to do so for my birthday. Upon arrival of the Edgewater the exterior landscaping and outdoor fireplace are very nice. The interior is literally covered in tree branches and tree trunks. Decor is very Pacific Northwest. I was there using a certificate that I had won at a school auction. I paid an extra $50 for a full water view, even though at the auction the certificate was toted as being the Beatles Room. Not the case! At check-in the receptionist asked if we would like a room with a balcony or a room with a tub. We chose the room with the tub since the weather wasn't condusive to sitting on a balcony. The receptionist said \"we want to make sure you have the best room we have\". Our room was on the 2nd floor near the elevator, which I typically ask not to be by. The room itself had a spectacular view, there is no beating it! You are literally over the water. The decor was once again Pacific Northwest/Native American, not to my taste but o.k. First thing we noticed as we watched seals play and a bald eagle soar, was the floor vibrated and there was a constant hum from some type of machinery below us. We later found out that we were right above the Lounge. My biggest complaint was \"the best room\" was above the Lounge, and we were not told there was live music, which was very audible from our room. When I called the front desk they said the music would continue until midnight. We were given the option to move to another room, but that would have been incredibly inconvenient as we were all ready for bed. They did offer to credit back our upgrade fee, and provide us with earplugs. Which took a half an hour to receive. Beds were fairly comfortable. The flat screen tv was not in HD, in fact some of the channels were down right snowy. The bathroom was very nice, and loved the shower. As for the tub, it was never used as it's only a one person tub ;-) I have stayed in equally nice hotels, with great views for half the price.

I try to stay in a different hotel each time I visit. Two weeks ago, I spent a week in the Edgewater. The first thing that struck me upon arriving at the hotel property is that it is on a pier - it is quite literally on the water - as in above it. Located along Seattle's vibrant, revitalized waterfront it is surrounded by active cruise terminals, ferry docks, and some very nice on-the-water seafood restaurants. My expectations were quite high upon arrival. The valet and front desk service was excellent throughout the week. They have clearly been very choosy in staffing these areas; they are engaging, polite, and highly efficient service providers. The main lobby sets the tone for the look of the rest of the hotel: rustic elegance. The hotel seems ripped right out of a 1990 Orvis Catalog, with rough hewn wood paneling and heavy use of greens and browns and plum colors. A large open fireplace further sets the tone as you head towards the elevator. Upon exiting the elevator, you experience the worst of the Edgewater: the hallways. They are not well lighted, somewhat dank, and seemingly two or three years past the time they should have been completely renovated. Most of the rooms extend down one very long corridor, and the ambience/architecture of the walkway is not terribly inviting. Nor does it seem all that clean, although I never saw refuse or even dirt ... it just SEEMS less-than-clean, likely due to it's worn condition. The rooms are quite small, but well appointed. The rustic theme is most definitely continued into the rooms, and a gas fireplace occupies a fair chunk of one corner of the room. The rooms are so small the king size bed occupies a large portion of the space, with a fairly large, upholsted easy chair occupying most of the rest of the space. There are NO drawers, and no place other than a run-of-the-mill closet by the door to hang close and store your luggage. Among the nicest features of the hotel rooms are the bathrooms. While they are scarcely larger than a cruise ship bathroom, they feature a shower and bathroom floor lined with natural stone, featuring glass and chrome trim throughout. While small, it serves to modernize the otherwise stuck-in-the-early-90's decor of the room/hotel. The linens are of a high quality and exceptionally clean - the window coverings, carpet, and walls appeared to be in excellent repair and were very attractive. Our room had an inspiring view of the Space Needle - at night, it is spectacular. The bar/salon and restaurant are very good. Cocktails are exceptionally well made, and service is great as well. The bar was packed every night I was there, and seemed to attract people from the city - not just folks staying in the hotel. Although I only had breakfast in the dining room, the food was very carefully prepared - hash browns were crispy on the outside and moist and flavorful inside; the fruit was delicious, and the cappucino first rate. Both the lounge/bar and dining rooms take great advantage of being ON the water, with beautiful views of Elliott Bay, and the ferries and other ships cruising by. The wonderful restaurants of Belltown are within a very easy walk, as are the Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, and the shopping district near the convention center - and Pioneer Square and many other sites are just a few more minutes away. I was torn between an Above Average and Average rating for this hotel. It is not cheap, and I was concerned/distracted by the dated decor and poor condition of the hallways. However, the service, views, and quaint rooms were strong enough to walk away feeling as though the money was well spent. This is not my favorite hotel (yet) so far in Seattle, but it's in my top three now; and I wouldn't hestitate to recommend it to those who want a real waterfront feel to their hotel stay while in town.", "Date": "December 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cA bit below average... unfortunately\u201d", "Author": "koko269", "ReviewID": "UR11447388", "Content": "The first impression I had of this hotel was that the location was quite nice.

This didn't bug me at all. It's made to look cozy with all the fireplaces and woodland theme. When I was walking to my room, the hallway had this stench of sewage. It was unpleasant but not unbearable. I was hoping that this was only for the first night, but the smell remained after the second night. Another thing that I didn't like was the fact that the washroom in your hotel room wasn't very soundproof. So there wasn't any privacy in the washrooms.

The hotel is very clean and quite different from other hotels in its class. The lobby, bar and restaurant decor is that somewhat of an eclectic lodge style. When you arrive, the drive through entrance to the hotel has an enormous fire place in the valet area. The service at the hotel was great at the front desk, bar and restaurant. We had an upgraded waterfront room. The room was a bit small - or appeared that way by the oversized lounging chairs and the king sized bed. It reminded me of room sizes in Europe. The rooms continued the same Lodge Style decor of the lobby area. The bed mattress and linens were very comfortable. The room had a fireplace which heated the room very quickly. The bathroom was large, but most of the space was taken by an oversized stoned-tiled shower and a separate full sized \"club footed\" bathtub. The amenities in the restroom were better than most 5 star hotels. No need to bring special soaps, rinses or conditioners. This place has that covered. Make sure you put towels you want replaced on the floor in the mornings. The room has a small refrigerator, but all the space is occupied with the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offerings. Be sure to take a look at the price sheet in the room before deciding to chow down on the chocolates, chips and sodas. The room also had WiFi for $10 a night. In the reviews, everyone advises getting a waterside room because of the city side noise. I am not sure I agree. The hotel is on the water right next to the Ferry operation to Canada. If you stay on the water side, you will hear waves banging the dock equipment against the dock all night - it reminded me of someone banging on symbols. If you stay on the City Side, you will hear the comings and goings of the cars driving in and out of the hotel - including the occasional train whistle (the tracks are directly in front of the hotel). So, if you have the window to your room open, you are going to hear noise. After mentioning the noise issue to the front desk, they offered us ear plugs. However, if you have the window closed, you hardly hear a thing. Keep in mind, this Hotel is not air conditioned and in the summer you will want the window open. One other thing about the rooms - BE ADVISED - the hotel's meeting rooms are on the 2nd floor and meeting preparations start as early as 6am. If you stay on the second floor, you will be awakened by the noises from people attending these meetings. We literally had a businessman camped outside our door on a loud cell phone call for over 30 minutes one morning. It was very annoying. Do not stay on the 2nd floor. The hotel is centrally located.

It is in a decent location for walking to attractions and there are some upscale features. It is built on the water, but bear in mind that, unless you have a view from that side of the hotel, you will have to walk down the street to actually see the water. The view from the lobby was nice, but there were very few places for people to sit and be looking directly out at the sound. There were two major problems with our stay... 1. THE BIGGEST ISSUE - the room attendant or minibar attendant took two iPods from our room. The management did nothing to help and gave us the run around. For us, this was a major issue, We had traveled 2000 miles (in a car from Texas) to stay in Seattle and this put a big damper to our stay. 2. The hidden charges. Add it up - parking is $26/day and is mandatory valet, if you have a car. Tipping everyone from the bellman to the valet multiple times while you are there (if you get your car more than once). Paying for your room itself - even if you got a pretty good deal through Hotwire, like us. The rooms are nice, but they are not worth $300/night. On top of it all, we did not have a bathtub, just a shower. That was okay, but not what we would have expected. The room was small. The fireplace was nice, but we could not keep the room temperature regulated. It was either cold or hot - never moderate. If you are going to Seattle and have an endless budget, stay at this hotel. Keep plenty of cash on hand and make sure you don't take any valuables into your room, EVEN IF YOU LOCK THEM UP OR PUT THEM OUT OF SIGHT. If you do have something go missing, you will most likely hear, \"That has never happened at our hotel before.\" Don't expect the management to help you in any way. The only way I would stay at this hotel again is if I had very deep pockets and did not mind spending a lot of money with little return. On the other hand, if you would rather have a couple hundred extra dollars of spending money while you are visiting Seattle, I would recommend any of the other standard chain hotels downtown, that rent for half as much and have great locations.

The decor is a little odd and the interior halls are badly in need of renovation. They have spent money to upgrade the rooms which are interesting, but they've not spent anything to upgrade the interior halls, etc. The hotel was built probably in the 50s or 60s and in some spots it looks like it. But the rooms are nice, albeit a little inconsistent. The waterfront balcony rooms have fireplaces and balconies where you can walk outside and enjoy the spectacular views. They are in a kind of rustic Northwoods look. The bathrooms are simply to die for. Nouveau chic style with marble counters, cut stone floors, big fluffy bathrobes, an interesting table top sink bowl, a walk in shower with thick doorless glass and the best showerhead I've ever used. The kind with a BIG oversized head that's practically like being under a waterfall. But the motifs of the bathroom and the room are in total contrast. The mix is not very appealing stylistically, but they are comfotable. The management doesn't get high marks from me because of the sign that says they want to save water so they will only change sheets every three days and towels only if you put them on the floor. But then the toilet and shower are not low flow and there's no sink drain stopper, so you have the leave the water running for ten minutes while getting ready. So much for water saving...it's clear they only want to save money not water. But they don't return the savings. While this is a very nice hotel in a great location, it is terribly overpriced.

My husband had a business meeting in Seattle at the Edgewater and we went out there early with our 1 year-old for a weekend getaway. Since we did not want to pay the $450 a night price-tag the entire time we were there we stayed at the Westin ($250) until his meetings. The Edgewater was more of a walk to many sites than the Westin although it was right on the water. There was also a pot festival going on at a nearby park which brought many undesirables around the hotel so walking places was a pain (and we are generally pretty liberal about such things.) The Edgewater was nicely decorated, clean and remodeled with a very cool, modern bathroom and kind of a lodge feeling decor in the room. The rooms were just too small though compared to newer hotels. The beds were older and not very comfortable. My husband outweighs me by about 50 lbs and it was like sleeping on a hill being in bed with him. The worst thing though was the air conditioner/heater. It was so loud every time it kicked on that I woke up (about every 10-20 mins) and I am a heavy sleeper! It was horrible and it blew very strongly right on the bed. Another sign of the age of the hotel I assume. Also, the hotel makes the appearance of being family friendly, a teddy bear on the bed and a cute furry pig ottoman beneath the arm chair, but really the whole hotel is just not very toddler friendly. This only matters of course to those who have little ones. They dropped off a crib which we had to set-up ourselves and it had dirty sheets that were fit for a full-sized bed. There is an electric fireplace in the middle of the room which is nice but it is hot to the touch. The shower has no door so the kiddo can just crawl in and out and no tub. The bathroom has glass shelves for towels and such but they are under the sink - low to the floor. There is also a tray that the coffee maker sits on in the room- not sturdy.

On the street side many complained of parking lot and train noises. Occupant above kept me up with late night pacing on carpeted floor. Bring earplugs for good nights sleep. With the sliding wall some people may find their toilet privacy lacking as the wall is basically paper. Lighting in bathroom somewhat dim and short on shelf space. Outside bell service, even when given advance warning of large parties did not secure taxis.

To justify the cost and the location you do have to stay in a waterfront room - a room on the city side (as you can see from the photo, taken from the top of the Space Needle) really would not do a stay at the Edgewater justice. Being English and used to small hotel rooms we found our room just perfect with an amazing bathroom, beautifully comfortable bed, great terrace overlooking the ocean and cosy fireplace. The staff were all uniformly friendly and helpful and the hotel was also well placed for all of Seattle's best attractions. Complaints? Well just two really. The first was that I didn't realize the Beatles Suite existed until after we had left so missed the opportunity of having a look inside (had I known about it beforehand I might have been tempted to book it which I suspect might have proved an expensive option). The second complaint concerns the wretched bear, Mr E Edgewater. What a mean and dirty trick it was to leave the cute and cuddly Mr E propped up against our pillow. Needless to say we were not allowed to leave without him and at $35 he proved to be an expensive little chap! Still he seemed to quite enjoy the rest of our holiday and the flight back to the UK, and once he has finished his period in quarentine he will be able to join all his other furry English pals in our bedroom at home.

My family stayed in cityside rooms for the weekend and we had a memorable time. So much about the Edgewater is postive but nonetheless there is room for improvement. First the positives- 1. The setting is magnificent! Whether in the lobby, the restaurant or in the banquet rooms, the Edgewater is all about the most magnificent water views in Seattle. 2. The staff is very accommodating and personable. Whenever there was a concern, they were quick to rectify the situation. 3. The SixSeven Restaurant had delicious food and spectacular views. Be prepared to pay top dollar and have a leisurely meal with attentive yet somewhat slow service. 4. The rooms all have a rustic charm as does the entire hotel. The lodge feeling that permeates the hotel is both welcoming and luxurious at the same time. 5. If you happen to be fortunate enough to host or have an affair in the banquet room(s), you will be so pleased by the decor, service, food and setting. Now, the negatives: 1. Room 343 (our room) had quite a few problems. First of all, it smelled awful when we entered. After complaining to the front desk for more than an houir, a maintenance man came to the room, sprayed some deodorizer (which did help) and apologized for the smell. The manager on duty was extremely apologetic and offered us a credit on our bill which was appreciated. 2. This room needs to be lived in by those who remodeled it to appreciate its challenges. Granted the bathroom was beautiful, re-done in flagstone tile, shower and modern sink. However, the closets are located in the bathroom with two heavy French doors at its entrance that bang and clang whenever you try to open them. Don't try entering the bathroom when someone is sleeping because that person will wake up immediately. 3. Since the closets are in the bathroom, it is impossible to get your clothes if someone is using the bathroom. In additon, there isn't any mirror in the entire room except the sink mirror in the bathroom. Try getting dressed for a wedding with your wife and sharing an over-the-sink bathroom mirror! 4. The lighting in the room is dim- since you face the city side, you do not want to open the curtains so lighting should be a priority in the room. 5. The lounge prices are outrageous (even when compared to New York metropolitan prices!) And $17 for a mini-tray of six grapes, a couple of slices of watermelon/honeydew with 6 cheese wedges! 6. Valet parking is charged by the day even though the lot is in front of the hotel, half empty and easily accessible for self-serve parking. In conclusion, the Edgewater is still an amazing experience. Since you are paying so much anyway for the room, opt for the scenic waterview rooms and chalk it up as a selfish extravagance. It just seems that for the prices that are charged at this hotel, there should be more attention to detail, value and comfort.", "Date": "July 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Broadlands,VA", "Title": "\u201cEnjoy a meal there but stay some place else\u201d", "Author": "ChristinesMom", "ReviewID": "UR5318522", "Content": "My husband and I recently stayed at the Edgewater to celebrate my 50th birthday. While I was impressed with the staff and the facilities the rooms leave alot to be desired. The renovation going on was very distracting. Specifically: We arrived early to check in our room because my husband was not feeling well. Our room was not ready yet so the desk staff generously gave us a coupon for two free drinks to be used in the beautiful bar while we waited. The dining area, bar and outdoor cafe area have a view of the water that can not be matched. The food was excellent. We enjoyed a delicious breakfast there. The hotel lobby has a large sitting area with floor to ceiling windows, a fireplace and library area where there are comfotable chairs and tables with games nearby. You could spend an afternoon there reading a book or watching the ferry boats go by with no problem. The hotel is renovating many of the rooms on the first floor. When we were there it meant noise and chilliness in some areas because doors were left open because of painting etc... This work should be made clear on the hotel website so a person is aware of it before making a reservation. We had a standard room that faced the city $239 a night. The room was so small there was barely space to walk around the bed on either side. As another reviewer pointed out - the city side rooms face the rail road tracks. The trains went by from 3:00-4:00 a.m. the noise is very intrusive. If you must stay at the Edgewater I would suggest spending the extra money at least ($75-150) for an upgraded water side room if you really want to stay there and have a special experience . An alternative I would recommend is book a night(s) at the Residence Inn on Lake Union and enjoy a meal at the Edgewater. The Residence Inn is 5 minutes away from the Edgewater, is also on the water/marina and by bidding on Priceline I was able to get a room for between ($90-100).

I had ordered hundreds of roses to be delivered to the room for our arrival (which was right after our wedding) and needed vases for them. The hotel initially said that they could provide them, but then couldn't, then after some haggling with my sister in law could, and on and on. Long story short - the hotel DID end up providing the vases. Not to mention that not only was our reservation fixed, but we were upgraded to the infamous Beatle's Suite, compliments of the management. And all of this was with minimal hassle. I found that the staff was nothing but polite, professional, and eager to make things right. The room was out of this world, the view was spectacular - I swear that the famous Seattle cloud cover even cleared for the time that we were there! The bed was easily the most comfortable hotel bed that we've ever slept in, with great linens and down pillows to boot. We couldn't have been happier. The only downside, and it's a really minor one in light of all the great stuff, was that whenever another door on our hallway slammed closed, it caused quite a racket.

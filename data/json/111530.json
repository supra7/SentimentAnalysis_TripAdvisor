My room was on one of the Starwood Preferred Guest floors. I also liked the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153green program\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which gives guests credit if they stay more than two days, and decline the sheet and towel changing service. If I were to rate the hotel just for its room, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d give it 3.5-4 stars. Nothing fancy, but better than the average. The room a/c or heat worked fine. My issues, and reason for downgrading are: 1. absolutely horrible service with getting a taxi cab. Three of us were to meet other colleagues at the Veracruz restaurant (see review elsewhere, excellent by the way). None of us were from Dallas. The door man said we could take the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s SUV (seems odd that a hotel featuring green services has a Suburban available, why not a Prius, or something? Do you really need 4 WD in Dallas). Anyway, I gave the doorman the address (408 N. Bishop in Oak Cliff), and he said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be $5 each. That rate seemed a little higher than a taxi for what was supposed to be a ten minute drive, but not ridiculous. Shortly after entry, and after programming the GPS to locate the address, the driver informed us that since the restaurant was not downtown, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be $25. That was not the worst thing. The driver then proceeded to check his bids on eBay while he was driving in heavy traffic and on the freeway. I was in the front seat, and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see these shenanigans, but one of my colleagues saw the whole thing. He only almost hit a Jersey barrier a couple times, and had to brake severely as well, to avoid running into someone. I am always leery of these \u00e2\u20ac\u0153black cars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and should have known better. But, we were already running late for our dinner with others. But, in the future, never again. It appeared to us that the doorman and the car service were running a nice little side business. 2. I specifically asked for a room away from the elevator and ice machines. My room, XX77 was directly next to the motors that operate the elevators. I noticed this initially, but see 1 above, we were already late, and it would have taken extra minutes to change rooms. I was tired when I got back, and went to bed. Hearing the noise, I used my Bose earphones (same as one sees on airplanes) to get some rest at first, and then burrowed in pillows after the headphones were not comfortable to sleep on one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201cSheraton Dallas!

I was told nice things about the hotel and was really looking forward to my stay. My stay was completely disappointing. My room was in the South Tower (2206) was the room left so much to be desired. The furnishings were a throwback to the early 1980s and have obviously been in the room since then. The bed linens were decent as was the mattress, however the dust ruffle was various stains all around that greatly resembled feces. It made me wonder how clean the sheets really were. The bathroom was a complete disaster. It was obviously remodeled, but, it was not done intelligently. The countertop was over done and extended into the shower which prevented the shower curtain from closing properly. It was generally uncomfortable to shower in there due to the poor design combined with the horrible shower head and the lack of hot water. The room service food was lackluster and was more expensive than most comparable hotels. The service time was decent, however the order taker was rude and did not seem to listen. The bed pillows are old, uncomfortable and one of them smelled horrible. Time for new pillows! The front desk staff was nice, however, they did not even attempt to correct my dissatisfaction. I could feel them rolling thier eyes when I walked away after bringing up the lack of hot water and the miserable shower. The only compliment I can deliver is the valet staff. They were polite, respectful and very attentive. Talking with the valet staff would have to be the highlight of the stay there. (although at $29.00 a night, I would recommend self parking).

The Conference center is right across the street and there's a 2nd floor walkway to it...or you can cross the street. There are great local inexpensive places to eat within walking distance. It's located in walking distance from the artistic locations of the city including the Dallas Symphony Hall, the Art Museum and I'm sure many other places. We felt very safe out walking at night in this area. Conference rate was 159 per night which was a bit higher than the Marriott nearby (139). But the room and the general climate of the hotel, plus the convenience to our conference, great food and great rooms made it a value. The staff deserves kudos and compensation for making this a great experience. Only negative was overworked elevators during certain periods. But we learned to time our elevator rides to non busy times. We were on the 24th floor, so stairs were not an option.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stonewall, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNice and the beds are awesome\u201d", "Author": "LKStonewall", "ReviewID": "UR126037948", "Content": "Stayed mid week.

We booked a Club Level Junior Suite three months prior to our stay. Upon our arrival, there were at least three large conventions happening at the hotel at the same time. As a result, it took one hour and twenty minutes to get to the front of the check-in line. When I did, I was told that they did not have that level of room available due to on-going renovations, and they did not apologize for not alerting me to this situation ahead of time. They \"found\" me a club level king room (not optimal for three adults, but it was all they had, and they brought us a roll away), supposedly with the same package. However, they neglected to tell me that we would have to take an elevator from our room on the 27th floor of the South tower down to the 2nd floor, then walk to the elevator bank for the Central tower, then take that elevator up to their 27th floor for club lounge access. An extreme hassle and time waster, especially due to the fact that the hotel was so full. Parenthetically, the club lounge was undoubtedly the worst I've ever experienced. The food was not only mundane, but in quite limited supply. In fact, on our first breakfast day I saw the hostess turn at least two groups away, saying there was no room/food, and suggested they go to the hotel's casual restaurant instead (this is exactly what people who pay for concierge floor do not want to do.) On our second breakfast experience, they apologized that the kitchen had not sent up any hot food that morning as promised. Oh well, that was not surprising as they had run out of cookies the evening before (after we had made the Herculean effort to get there specifically for an evening cookie.) There were no apologies for that - just, \"when we run out, we're out.\" Another problem - we were supposed to have \"free\" wi-fi in our package. We had to agree to a charge before the wi-fi would hook up, which I figured wouldn't be a problem to rectify. Wrong. First, the wi-fi was sup-optimal, and did not allow access for six straight hours on our second day, despite 4 (yes, 4) separate phone calls to their \"help\" (poor choice of words) line. All I can say is their \"senior engineer\" would not last long in our company. When I called to the front desk to have the charges removed anyway (and told them about my problem) the person asked for my computer problem \"reference\" number so she could confirm that we really had a problem. O.K. Needless to say, when the bill was slipped under our door on our last day, the charges were all still on it. (They did delete it when I went down in person and spoke to them.) And our room? It clearly needed renovation, so I'm glad they're in the midst of that. I hope they replace the chipped sink and leaky faucet, as well as the toddler-sized toilet (it reminded me of those one finds in a kindergarten class.) Also, when we arrived, our room had no bathrobes (it was supposed to) and when I called, none materialized for 45 minutes. I called again (again requesting 3 robes), and got one robe about 10 minutes later. I gave the maid a couple of dollars and asked her to get two more, as well as another set of towels, and she did take care of it. But, about 20 minute later a different maid arrived - with one robe. It was quite comical. The only reason I give this place a poor instead of a terrible is that the bed was quite comfortable, and I\"m trying to be charitable.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLAURA at Drafts\u201d", "Author": "wince2127", "ReviewID": "UR125829636", "Content": "Laura was great!

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AT THE MANAGEMENT LEVEL. In a nutshell, here's what happened: 1. My stay was pre-paid by a third party. 2. The hotel had no record of the pre-pay so put a large hold on my personal credit card. 3. When I later obtained and showed the hotel a receipt for the pre-pay, it took many conversations with a manager and the accounting department to figure it out. 4. The hold wasn't released on my card until my bank intervened, despite the fact that someone else's card was charged 2 weeks earlier. 5. NO ONE AT THE SHERATON EVER APOLOGIZED FOR THE TROUBLE!!! My stay was for a meeting with an organization who paid for my stay. They pre-paid the stay with a credit card. When I checked in, the hotel had no record of the pre-pay, so I assumed someone had forgotten to take care of it. I had to give my own card, on which the hotel placed a $450 hold. Then I found out the company HAD indeed pre-paid. When I showed a receipt to a manager, he said he needed someone on the company end to confirm with a form, which he would email. While the email recipient waited for the email before going to a meeting, the manager took about half an hour to send it, and when he did, it required information she did not have, despite his assurance to me that she simply had to respond \"OK,\" essentially. The next morning, the travel agency who made the reservation talked to someone at the hotel and took care of it before my check out. Except that the hotel kept the $450 hold on my card! I had to have my bank spend half an hour on the phone with various people at the Sheraton to get that taken care of! And no one, not once, ever apologized for the trouble this had caused to me and the entity sponsoring my stay. Even the kind woman at my bank commented on the attitude everyone she spoke with at the Sheraton seemed to have -- it seemed they didn't really care, she said.

As I admitted this feeling to the indignant young man at the registration desk as I was checking to make certain that this was in fact true, I was answered with the question; Really, why is that sir?

Or plan to sit in the noisy registration area, the only place where web access is free. Also don't forget that if you need a car while here it's going to cost you another $22.00 per day to self park your car. If you actually like to have a good nights sleep with heat, remember to bring a space heater. As a part of the currently popular marketing ploy of attempting to be \"green\". This is one of those hotels with the motion sensor thermostats. Upon check-in the room will be cold in the winter and hot in the summer. That's okay, it's one less thing for housekeeping to remember. Only a mildly annoying point. It's the fact of no heat in the night that wakes one to shivering scramble for more covers that then sets the thermostat back into on mode that then heats the room back up to wake you to a pool of your own sweat as you throw the blankets aside. Plan to repeat this in one hour intervals. The over zealous concierge desk personnel smack of Walmarts greeters and really know how to make everyone feel welcome upon entering. So much so in fact that it feels as if it's all in leu of a flashing neon sign to say; \"This place is so fancy, We have a concierge!\". The well appointed room interior of room 675 is quite pleasing to the eye, however the rule of form following function seems not to be understood by the designer hired for the last remodel. The case goods are small and dysfunctional for anyone actually staying for more than overnights flop. No refrigerator or microwave, (of course room service is available at the expected prices) minimal towels And no shampoo or lotions. Sure these are simple little points to be complaining about. But for the stated price of over three hundred dollars a night for this room, I'm really wondering who could be so disconnected from the current reality of our economic state. Generally the room is small and very minimally functional or accommodating. The location is very literally central to the city and convenient to major highways. It's nice. Yes, it's \"nice\". I've been in worse, and for the money, I've been in a lot better. Even at the amazing daily room rate through Priceline.com I still couldn't recommend this hotel to a friend.

We stopped by the concierge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desk twice and they had limited knowledge about the city or directions. The people working at the car valet were unfriendly and inattentive. They did not leave the keys in the car so you had to wait for someone to let you in. We ate at two of the hotel restaurants both the food and service was poor. I would not recommend staying here.

I was then moved to a \"renovated\" room in the Center Tower that was nicer (although most of the TV channels were not clear). Now, I can understand when the house keeping forgets to clean a room or even flush a toilet, but the main reason for my negative review is how the hotel staff treated me. They were nothing short of rude to me and treated me as a nuisance. As an example, during my second day, I was contacted by the hotel staff (while I was in my conference) to immediately report to the registration desk. When I arrived, I was informed that I had failed to check out at 12p. I explained to the registration clerk that my reservation was for two nights and that I was not due to check out until the next day. The clerk informed me that because my reservation had a special room rate the first night, but not the second, my reservation was split into two confirmation numbers, which in turn required me to check out and then check in for my second night stay. The clerk then proceeded to check me out of my room and then check me in to the SAME room (all the while having a snub and argumentative attitude). In summary, I do recommend this hotel.

It's not cheap. The hotel is located in the business district and that makes, for cheaper parking rates around the building on the weekend. Mass transit trolley, is right outside the door. Stores, restaurants and nightlife only a block or two away. Since our visits were on the weekend. It was like having downtown all to yourself. No crowds, no parking issues and access to everything. The hotel itself is a hub of activity. From Self Improvement to Herbal life seminars, including a Fetish Convention and a Black Tie Gala. Yes that's right, all those folks going back and forth, all at the same time. This along with just plain ole guest and people in town for the game too. The rooms are of decent size, they also offer Green (earth aka Eco friendly) rooms too. The Wi-fi did have an exorbitant charge of almost $13 a day (WOW). But I needed it to plan the rest of my trip.

In a hotel that big, one would think they'd be able to have a quiet floor where they space folks out a little bit. The metro station (DART) rail was right across the street from the tower we stayed in. Some other reviewers mentioned road/metro noise but the room was not noisy above it (although we were very high above it). This area of downtown Dallas is quiet on weekends but the security at the rail station was very present, and the valet staff at the hotel were helpful in flagging down taxis so that we could easily head out to dinner. The hotel is a short taxi (or drive) away from some great restaurants in uptown Dallas. The fitness room in this hotel is impeccable and the pool area was gorgeous although very cold - I wish it had been heated!!

Not So Good: The roads around the hotel are one way; if you miss the entrance you have to circle around a couple of blocks to return to the entrance. Parking costs are crazy, Vale is $24 and Self Park is $21. So add that to the overall cost of Sheraton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expensive rooms. I look for minor issues because they are indications of how Sheraton takes care of major issues. In my room the bathroom light cover was covered in so much dust that the bathroom lighting was very dim, the hot water faucet handle was loose and spun around, and the sink drain was clogged. I found a safety issue, the electrical outlet located at the head of the bed had a two outlet converted into four outlet with four plug connected to everything, all of the wires were nestled against the box spring. Potential fire hazard - You be the judge. Finally; Sheraton has a restaurant but their prices are not very reasonable, an example would be breakfast buffet was around $20. The quality and quantity fell short of my expectations. Good: The exercise room as over the top, great facility, great equipment. The pool was located outside the exercise room on the fourth floor so the view was interesting. The Sheraton has 29 floors, great stair running if you enjoy that kind of exercise. The staff was the best part of my experience, they were very friendly. All of my questions were answered to my satisfaction. The registration process was slow but Sheraton had several agents on duty to keep the flow moving. Over all, my room was vey nice, the view of DFW was breath taking. The bed was pillow style and the TV was a large flat screen high definition model. I was impressed with room service.

Internet is about $13 per day but the hotel does provide free wi-fi in some public areas - so you don't have to pay $13 to do that quick email check. I think that's a reasonable compromise.

Check in was quicker than I thought. We arrived for a conference and there were at least 30 people in front of me waiting to check in. But the Sheraton had prepared for the traffic and had staff at every available check in station...probably 8-10 staff...and they got us through the line within about 15 minutes. When it was my turn to check in I was greeted as a preferred Starwood member (don't remember when I registered for this, but THEY knew), was checked in promptly, was given details about Internet use, parking, and the new green program which gave me a $5 food/beverage voucher per day for declining housekeeping service during my stay. I was a little worried that because we'd received a discounted rate through our employer that we'd all end up in older rooms. The elevator quickly took me to the 29th floor, I opened the door, and WOW. I was so pleased. My room was clean, obviously refurbished recently, and was everything I could've expected and more. The beds are super soft and cushy. You almost sink into them when you lay down. The only problem with this is that it didn't provide the best support for my sometimes bad back, but it was so comfy for most of the night that I'm not complaining. The bathroom was clean...no hair from the previous visitors. Plenty of lighting throughout the room, lots of outlets to plug things in, curtains that covered the windows all the way, water, coffee, flat screen tv...are you getting the picture here? I also had free Internet service, I think as a preferred club member perk. As a club member staying on the club level, I also had access to the club lounge. Each time I visited, it was clean and there was a staff member available to greet me and make sure I had everything i needed. The lounge was spacious and had a great view from the 27th floor. The only complaint that really isn't worth mentioning was with parking. Valet was swamped when we arrived, which I expected it would be because of the conference. We did the self parking which is usually $21 per day, but we received a discounted rate because of the conference we attended. You have to swipe your room key to enter/exit the parking garage and each time we left we had to call for assistance because the key didn't allow us to exit. But the attendant quickly activated the card and we were off. Dining in the hotel is limited. I wasn't overly impressed with the menu at either eating establishment, and as is par for the course at all hotels, the room service menu is insanely priced. We only ate once at the Draft Sports Lounge. The food was decent, but we dined away from the hotel the rest of the time. Overall, I have no complaints about this hotel and would definitely, definitely stay here again. I like for a hotel to make me feel like, although 1,000 other people have stayed in the same room, I'm the first one to be there.

I understand it takes a great deal of money to renovate hotel rooms but the old rooms should be maintained better. How hard is it to clean or cover up shoe marks on the wall? The front desk staff was helpful and made the switch for us which was appreciated. The center tower rooms were much more spacious and clean. Being that water or soda is a minimum of $3.00 a bottle in the guest shop, I tried walking to the vending machine to buy one at $2.00. The vending machine on my floor as well as four others was empty. I called roomservice to ask if they could bring one up for the same price and was told to go to the guest shop. When I explained the price difference, the employee told me that she was not sure why they don't refill the machines and told that she could not just give me one for $2.00. I mean it's a bit trivial and I'm not typically one to complain over a $1.00, but that just seems like mediocre service. Probably not worth the money for this hotel unless you can get a good deal on Hotwire or something.....no way this is a four star hotel.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cNot great for business travelers\u201d", "Author": "gretayesinia", "ReviewID": "UR117552976", "Content": "Was here for a conference.

There were many good things about this hotel but there were a few misses that they may want to look into. Upon check-in Alexandra (the intern) was extremely welcoming and made our check in process, speedy and pleasant. She gave us information we valued and was a joy to talk to. Our room was very clean, the only thing we would recommend the hotel to do is to put signs on the coffee and water bottles. Every hotel I have been to advertises its coffee and water with a sign or note that reads \"enjoy this complimentary coffee\" or \"Refresh yourself\" with a sign on the water bottle revealing a price on it ($4.00). Breakfast at \"Kitchen Table\", one of few restaurants the hotel has, had a very delicious breakfast. It was a little pricey but the proportions are large and the service was good. Joshua was our server there and although it was early in the morning his happy mood was contagious and he was on his game meeting our every request. The hotel offers a Green choice deal for guest to not have their rooms cleaned each night. We chose not to do that but very soon realized that we would need extra towels. Helen at the front desk was great with arranging extra towels to be placed in our rooms, much appreciated Helen! We chose this hotel simply because of the frozen yogurt bar that we saw on the hotel's website. DuVeena, the employee at Chill Zone, is the shining jewel of the hotel. Since it was the 4th of July weekend the yogurt bar had different hours and we barely made it in before she closed but she was welcoming, quick with service, and offered us many different options even though she was limited. After leaving the frozen yogurt bar we were walking to the room when we noticed a homeless lady wandering around the hotel. The hotel should consider putting security on all entrances and exits of the hotel because it made us very uncomfortable when we watched this lady go around asking the guests for money. Downtown there is already enough people hassling for money when you walk the streets, but inside the hotel the guests shouldn't have to worry about that happening. Once we returned to the room we decided to lounge at the pool for a while, the chairs and beds at the pool are great but beware that people lay their towels out early in the morning to reserve the chairs until they decide to come down later in the day. The pool itself was pretty dirty and it only seemed to worsen over the 4 days we stayed there. We loved how big the hotel was but we were surprised to learn that there was so few restaurants and that their hours close early. We did get to dine at Draft sports lounge during our stay and we were very impressed with the sports lounge. It was a busy night and Laura was our server. She was very sweet but was overwhelmed with the amount of people eating there that night and we could tell.The food was great but the chips and salsa was a huge disappointment. I love all kinds of fresh salsa but this one did not taste like it was fresh made. It tasted and looked exactly like Pace Picante salsa. That was really upsetting to me, if your going to charge $8 for it, then make it worth it. The chips were extremely salty past the point of enjoyment. Check out was a breeze but it was disappointing that parking each night was $21. That is standard pricing for hotels with parking garages but it would have been nice to know that when we booked the hotel so we could have better arranged for it. Overall this hotel was good but it definitely has some areas that could use improvement.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississippi", "Title": "\u201cMixed reviews\u201d", "Author": "NiniMississippi", "ReviewID": "UR115153804", "Content": "I attended a national speech and debate tournament here.

Although mornings were chaotic at the elevators, the staff handled all of the people and needs with amazing finese. I was impressed with how patient and cordial all of the staff was as they dealt with so many high school students. I called about an issue with the bed frame, and maintenance was at my door within an hour. I called about a barking dog( who brings a dog to a hotel and leaves it alone for 6 hours?) and security was on the floor dealing with the poor animal within minutes. There were negatives: no in- room refrigerators or microwaves... unless you rented them. No free wireles... Downtown Dallas is a bit scary. I was uneasy on the mass transit system, even in the daylight. We went as a group of 8 to the Westend for dinner one evening, and a homeless woman snatched the carry-out bag from one of my students saying she needed it more than he did....probably very true, but still a bit unsettling. Although there are many restaurants in the area, their hours understandably vary with the business trade. There are few shops.

My friend has been Starwood Platinum for many years. She booked our rooms over 3 months ago, and asked her ambassador to make sure that one of the rooms had 2 double beds (as opposed to 1 king bed). We checked in at about 7pm on the first night (a Thursday, the first of 4 nights). We were told by Ana at the front desk, sorry there's 2 rooms, but neither have double beds. Nothing I can do. Understand that it was a very busy weekend at this hotel (they were full apparently), with lots of conventions, but we did not think this was \"service.\" My friend who booked the rooms said politely - will there be another double room free in another tower, any thing free tomorrow? you mean all the people in the double rooms have platinum status too..? is there anything you can do? Answer was (after she checked the computer) - nothing I can do. We almost booked a whole other room, then I suggested (vs Ana suggesting) a roll away bed, so she said, ok we will bring one right up. (which by the way never did happen). After this miserable check in experience, my friend and I then went to the lounge. Our key didn't work. The lady in the lounge said \"it's because you only checked in a little white ago...\" This has never been an issue in other hotel lounges (other Sheratons, Westins etc etc). We were like, ok, here's the name, no problem. We told her about the issues with check in, and she gave us the name of the hotel night manager (helpful). When we were leaving the lounge, she told us to move a chair back that we'd moved from the table beside us because there weren't enough chairs (surprising). After my friend called her platinum ambassador and complained about the check in experience, about 3-4 hours later, the night manager Roger (or Robert?) got us a room in a different tower with double beds. Appreciated, but hard to believe that this wasn't available somehow without my friend making a bunch of external phone calls to someone in another city. Took forever for the staff to come up with the room key (it was about 11pm + at this time, so really just wanted to get to bed). Room was in the older tower, but this was fine - relatively quiet and comfortable. The one bright spot at this hotel is Helen who works at the Kitchen Table restaurant. She was super friendly, all about service, and couldn't do enough for us. Dallas overall is a great city that is all about service... we didn't let the first crappy day at this hotel ruin our trip. We checked out the original Neiman Marcus - the ladies there were super nice and told us about the history of the store and we had lunch at the Zodiac (which was excellent). We took the Dallas Stadium tour (worth the money), checked out Southforth and went to a Rodeo at the Stockyards. All in all a nice visit and I would definitely come back to Dallas, I would just not stay at this hotel.

Some may notice this is a second review of this hotel, as I was in it last year in June as well. Things didn't measure up to what I'd expect of a Sheraton at that time, but I really have to give them all the kudos possible on how great things were this year. First, the room was really awesome. Spotlessly clean as always, but also wonderfully cool. Last year they must have been having some sort of air conditioning system trouble, but thankfully that's all been remedied. The room was a bit warm but reasonably comfortable on our arrival, and cooled right down to just the right temperature immediately upon our setting the thermostat. I was told the rooms had been renovated, and I guess they had, because the vent wasn't located in the window sill like our room last year at all. We were able to shut out that hot Texas sun without also closing out the cool air. Like before, the hotel is still making an effort to go green by having the thermostat cut the air when the room is unoccupied, but this time it cooled to a comfy temperature practically just as soon as we touched the thermostat on our return. Second, big kudos on the comfort in the big convention center. Last year several people brought in thermometers and registered higher than acceptable temperatures in the big room downstairs even after midnight. This year was a big improvement. While I wouldn't suggest you wear your woolies, it was always a perfectly acceptable temperature in all parts of the convention center, including the big room downstairs. One of my group was told by an employee the air conditioning system had received a total overhaul due to customer comments since last year, but I can't say if this was the full story. Whatever they did, it definitely worked, and everyone returning from last year did a lot of talking about how awesome it was. I'm posting this because I want to make sure anyone searching reviews on this hotel knows everything is a-ok awesome now, and they should definitely choose this hotel. As always, everything was kept clean and the water stations were kept full at all hours. I made an effort to personally thank any employees I saw working, as I'm sure it was a big job with the big crowd they had for the weekend. I honestly didn't think my comments here after we spent what felt like a weekend in a low oven last year had really registered with the manager who left a reply, and I want to just put out there what an awesome effort must have been made to correct the problem and what a great thing it is to see a big hotel so obviously take a serious criticism to heart. After this stay, you can count on me to always book Sheraton whenever one is available where we travel. I'm so impressed! I'd also like to send special compliments to the chef who made a special effort to make a special order for my friend during Sunday lunch. I know it was an extra effort and would like him to know it was appreciated how he worked things out for a member of our party who just likes plain food and nothing fancy. I always think it takes more skill to make plain food taste like something special, and my friend was really impressed with the quality. Last, I'd like to leave a compliment for the staff who kept the coffee pot by the restaurant filled with hot, fresh coffee every morning and for the lovely waitress who so unobtrusively kept my cup full every morning when we all went in to breakfast.", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAttentive & Caring Staff Made Our Stay Great!\u201d", "Author": "Vampirate_Kitsune", "ReviewID": "UR114720011", "Content": "We came to Dallas to attend a huge convention (more than 18,000 attendees).

Some of the lounge chairs were missing their cushions and the hotel should have provided towels at the pool. The fitness center was well maintained and clean.

When we notified concierge, he said, \"Yeah, that's been a problem.\" We ended up using the machine on the floor below us. - Our mobile phones (using AT&T network) did not work from our room when we checked in, but would work in the lobby. (This problem corrected itself during our second day.) - The amenities in our room seemed to be set up for a single guest when we arrived. It took three calls to the front desk to get suitable towels and toiletries for the two of us. Unfortunately later in the stay we were again down to a single wash cloth, soap, etc. Annoying, but we worked our way around it. - Parking fees and in-room internet fees were quite high. Side note: Dallas Fish Market, within walking distance of hotel on Main St., provided us a really superior dinner one night of our stay. It was a spot-on recommendation from Concierge Richard at the hotel. Bottom line: No major problems at this hotel, but more annoyances than I would've expected from Sheraton.

So if you're lucky, everything will be fine, but if you're unlucky, staying here could prove to be a giant hassle.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "JOHNSTOWN, PA", "Title": "\u201cI wish it was better\u201d", "Author": "HOSKI", "ReviewID": "UR101907153", "Content": "I stayed here for 5 nights for a conference for work. I wish I could say it was a great stay because I did sleep really well here and I usually have trouble sleeping when traveling but I just can't say it was good. I got in about 9:30 pm and check in was very quick. They asked if I parked a car and I told them no and they asked if I want to sign up for the green program. I said no and asked if I could change my mind later. She asked if a king was ok and since I was alone that was just fine. Off I went to room 1215 in the South Tower. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay in this tower. People in the other two towers liked their rooms; the people in this tower hated them. The room was tiny. It looked ok except the ugly mustard yellow paint. I will admit I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t check it well because I was hungry and tired. I went to eat in the restaurant off the lobby and it was pretty good. I then returned to my room and decided to start unpacking. Where to start? The drawer space is limited and the drawers are small so you really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put folded jeans in them. I opted not to use them. The closet wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that big either but everything fit. Here is where I started to see that the room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as nice as first glance. There was only 1 door instead of 2 for the closet. The one door was a big glass door that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the track but leaning up against the frame from the inside. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it back on the track. While trying to do so I looked at the track on the floor and it was completely filled with dirt and crumbs. Yuck, yuck, yuck Ok, so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shut the closet, I would at least shut the safe door that was hanging out of the closet. Wrong, the safe didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay closed. I used a folded up napkin to wedge it shut for my stay. I checked the bed for bedbugs and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any. The bed ended up being the best part of the room. There was no dirt or hairs on the sheets or pillows so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m assuming they were changed. That and the fact that they had a lot of TV channels including my favorites. The garbage cans still had garbage from the previous occupant in them. And to jump ahead to the next morning, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m thinking housekeeping only changed the bed and did the floors. When I checked in there was only one towel and two hand towels in the bathroom. The one hand towel was folded strangely but the other set looked good so I figured I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d use that and get everything fresh in the morning. Well in the a.m. after my shower I grabbed the one towel that was there and that I assumed was clean. When I opened it, it was dirty. I squeaked, dropped it and used hand towels. Ok, it will get better because housekeeping will come and take care of everything. Wrong, I had a $5 voucher under my door and no one came to do my room. I called and asked for towels and decaf coffee. They asked if I signed up for the green program and I told them no and that I needed towels and decaf coffee because the one towel in the room was dirty before I got there. Housekeeping brought a stack of towel & washcloths along with 1 decaf coffee and a hand full of regular. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get my room serviced all week but eventually did get coffee from room service. This Sheraton has no idea on how to do a green program. It is a great concept but they are using it to not pay housekeepers and to not put supplies in the room. There are basic needs that still need provided even if a guest selects the green option. Oh, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say toilet paper and here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stretch, more than 2 packets of coffee in 5 nights. Sorry this ticks me off because I like to go green but I have when someone uses it as a marketing ploy and really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being green. One way they could go green is to turn down the air conditioning in the meeting rooms so that people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wear winter coats to meeting. Even the guys went for jackets and the speakers joked they had never been so cold when in from of an audience. The room was a mix of old and new. They left some really old fixtures and then added really nice counters and a few other items. $4.50 for a bottle of cheap water? Really? The bathroom ceilings are mildewing because there is no fan in the bathroom. When you look up it seems like there is one because there is a grate but look closely and the grate is covered and sealed with metal behind it. If I would have stayed in a room near the ice machine I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have stayed their. I have a mold allergy and since the ice machine leaked for 3 days and soaked the carpet that part of the hall smelled so bad from mold and mildew that I could hardly breathe when I went for ice. The smell just got stronger as you went down the hall. The staff overall was nice. No one went out of their way except the valets out front. When I checked out it was quick and friendly. Then I looked at the bill and discovered I had been charged for parking each night. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the same person again because she was helping the next person in line. When I went to someone else and told them I was charged for parking she asked if I had a car. She took it off the bill and handed me a new one. I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gotten my credit card statement yet to make sure it is correct. Overall, I would not stay here again and would not recommend it.

I've attached photos of the bathroom, which seemed to be in a serious state of disrepair, and of the towels that were placed in our bathroom for our use - which I quite honestly wouldn't have used at home for our family dog. There were also other issues, no remote for the TV, unresponsive hotel staff (took over 45 minutes to receive replacement towels and only after 3 calls), intoxicated guests who had a screaming match in the hall at 3:30am, etc. It so happened that the same weekend we stayed at the hotel, the Dallas Margarita Ball was also being held. After checking in to the hotel (around 1pm) and then leaving to visit some friends, we returned to the hotel (at 6pm) where we were told that parking, both valet and self, were full, due to the event being held at the hotel. Even being a paid guest in the hotel, we were made to park almost 6 blocks away and pay $20. When I complained to Leonard, the manager on duty, I was informed that there were 11,000 people coming to the hotel that night and \"that's just the way it works\". I quite honestly find it hard to believe that any business would treat a paying guest this way and still maintain their customers.

I didn't have the greatest view (almost entirely a brick wall), but I wasn't there for the scenery so it wasn't a big deal to me. I enjoyed using the coffee pot, which came with small samples of Starbucks coffee. The hotel was extremely congested because of the convention, and pretty much every escalator was not working for the 2 days/nights that I was there, which I found to be extremely inconvenient. Trying to get on an elevator was a joke - I had to wait at least 10 minutes to catch an elevator up to my room. I wouldn't have minded as much if it wasn't being run by incompetent convention staff - I would have much preferred to have the hotel staff keeping an eye on the elevator lines and making sure things ran smoothly. I didn't get a chance to eat in the hotel's restaurant (I ended up eating my meals at the adjoining Plaza of the Americas because it was quicker and cheaper), but I was able to eat at the yogurt shop located on the ground level of the hotel, which was delicious. I wanted to go to their coffee shop, but after looking at the menu and seeing their hefty prices, I walked right out (hence why I used the coffee pot in my room). Despite how crowded the hotel was because of the conference, I was easily able to get help from the front desk when I needed more copies of my room key, and the check-in/check-out went extremely smoothly. I did an express check-out on a computer in the lobby, which I liked instead of having to wait in a long line with everyone else. I also requested more towels for my room as I left for the day, and they were waiting for us in the bathroom when we returned after a few hours. Also, I didn't take advantage of this personally, but other convention-goers told me that the hotel staff was willing to hold onto their luggage for a few hours even after they checked out so that they could attend the rest of the convention and then head straight to the airport.

I'm not an avid traveler but does do my fair share to know the good from the bad. Years ago I joined the SPG and I try to stick with SPG whenever I could. I would have to say this Sheraton has fallen short of the SPG expectation. Upon arriving at the hotel, the 1st level/lobby area looks nice and appears to be newly renovated. The gentleman behind the counter cheerfully annouced that I was being checked into a junior suite in the south tower. When I got to my room and opened the door, the room was pitch dark and I couldn't find the light switch by the door to turn on any light in the room. I couldn't let go of the door since I couldn't see any thing if I do. Finally I had to wedge my suitecase in the door to prevent it from closing when I searched for a lamp to turn on. Now I could finally take a look at the room. The suite is about double the size of a regular room. But somehow the whole room just appeared to be really musky and outdated. The bathroom doesn't appeared to be updated at all. Definitely doesn't seem like a hotel that just went through a million-dollar renovation. Then I noticed this really loud humming/buzzing noise. I called the front desk and asked to be moved to another room. At first they were trying to convince me that it might be just an air filter problem and they will send someone over to fix it. But I insisted that could not be the case. So the front desk had to go check with the manager and get back to me. They called me 20 minutes later and offered to move me to a room that's 2 floors up directly above my current room(1507 to 1707). In between the 20 minutes window, the guy showed up and confirmed my suspicion and told me I'm right underneath a mechanical room on the 16th floor. So now I'm being moved to 1707 which is above the mechanical room? I'm not falling for that trick. I refused and asked to be moved to another tower(they have 5 different towers). So the front desk had to go check and get back to me again. 1 hr later, I finally settled into my 3rd room of the night which is in the North3 tower. The room/furnishing are much more modern and cleaner. I decided to order room service and watch a movie. Guess what, the movie shakes violently on the TV and you get a headache just looking at it. So I had to call guest service to cancel. 2nd day, called for toothpaste, doesn't show up for 1hr. Called 2nd and a 3rd time, it finally came. My laundry did not come back at 9pm as promised. Called and they said they will go check and call me back, no call back. Called again, they said they will go talk to the manager and call me back, no call back. Finally at 11pm they sent some security manager knocking on my door thinking something was stolen from my room. I had to drag myself out of bed to clarify the situation. 3rd day morning, I called again about my laundry, they said management is aware of the situation and they will call me back, again, NO CALL BACK! I couldn't wait, went to check out at the front desk. The lady behind the counter said: \" oh we found your sweater, it was placed in the wrong room\". So I was at least happy to have my sweater back. Opened the dry cleaning bag, the sweater was hanging nicely from the hanger with my hair dangling down from it! I proceeded to check it out, stain was still on the front. There are couple other minor annoyances I'm not going to mention here. Overall I would not stay here again even if you pay me. Yes , the facility is OK , but the service is definitely lacking. The staff is courteous, but what good does it do when all you hear is \"I'm sorry....\" I wish there's nothing they need to be sorry about in the first place. The best service at this hotel would be the man who delivers room service which makes me feel that the 20% gratuity is well deserved. And after all these inconveniences, no one showed up to offer a nice gesture to appease the situation.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Coral, FL", "Title": "\u201cFantastic\u201d", "Author": "Anastasia062", "ReviewID": "UR82089825", "Content": "Wonderful experience, comfortable beds.

I got a real suite deal by booking directly on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s web site. I reserved one of their executive 2 queen bed suites for the night. My dad and I arrived early that morning of our reservation and went ahead and parked in the garage (one of them which is just underneath the hotel). Upon check-in the guest service agent was very friendly and welcoming, she saw my request for a high floor and gave my party a 32nd floor in the North Tower and also gave us information about the hotel. I also verified if the room included club lounge access which it does. Upon entering the room, housekeeping was just finishing up with the cleaning detail and what I could see just from the door was not much but when the attendant finished I saw a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153jaw-dropper\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of a room. This room was unbelievable in size. This has been the biggest suite I have stayed in soo far. The room has a sectional sofa with bed in one section, sitting chair, table with four chairs, 2 TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, 2 closets, bar/counter, and separated by a door is the bathroom and spacious bedroom with 2 beds, sitting chair and desk. The room also had 3 phones in it with one being wireless. I was very impressed with the room. Also there is lots of hotel room artwork present in the suite. This hotel is fully loaded with pool, fitness center and an open business lounge with internet in the lobby. The hotel is also right next door to both the DART rail and bus stations and is also connected via skybrige to nearby business areas with a convenience store and the Westin City Center that has lots of food venues and the ice rink in the plaza building area. During my stay there were some issues that I encountered. The first of the issues was that when I trying to turn on the bedroom TV and it was not working. I called down to guest services to alert them of the issue and within a few minutes a maintenance person was there. She fixed the TV super fast and when she left the desk called to make sure everything was taken care of. Later that night while my party and I were out, the manager on duty called to make sure everything was satisfactory on the voice mail and I left a voice mail to confirm everything. Now this is what I call service and dedication. I will give the hotel 2 thumbs up for that, it is so wonderful to feel welcomed here. The other part of my issues was that I had so much trouble with my key cards when trying to get in the room, leaving the garage, and getting into the club lounge. The desk agents mentioned that they tried a new system each time but I would like to recommend to the hotel is if possible to try another route to see if this can be fixed. Another thing to watch out for was that in the room the ice tongs were very dirty and the 2 glass tumblers looked like they had been wiped out versus being properly sealed and sanitized. Just a few notes/tips about the hotel: I would like to add is that I was surprised a little bit when I heard that there is only one club lounge, which in a way was ok with me but it is located in the South Tower. If you are staying in the other two towers (North and Central) you have to come to the lobby level then go all the way to the South Tower then up to the 28th floor. The club lounge is soo worth visiting if your room includes access to it. Also when parking in the garage that is underneath the hotel, level A is reserved for Valet only and level B & C are the self parking areas. Self parking comes to about $20.56/day (includes taxes) and is unlimited in/out with guest room key I do want to highlight a staff member who showed outstanding service.

While it was an Adam's Mark, the staff was always polite, responsive, and at least appeared to be trying to help, even with an event that overtaxed the hotel's capacity. The first year as a Starwood property I made some concessions for the change in ownership and branding, new staff, and management inexperience with the event. I can no longer make excuses for this venue. With the exception of one manager (detail lower down), the staff was rude, unresponsive, and incapable of assisting with any requests, answering any questions, or finding out who would be able to assist or answer questions. Typically, if service is simply very good at a Starwood property, staff learning that I am (was) a platinum member immediately lead to excellent service. At the Sheraton Dallas, the staff went from ignoring me to rude and condescending. The restaurant has also gotten really bad. The food was not up to previous standard for the venue or Starwood venues in general. Sitting at a booth, our waiter served the two people on the outside of the booth first, and then ran his sleeves through our meals to serve the two people in the inside of the booth. We had to repeat our orders multiple times because he was too busy joking with the hostess at the door, or just had too much on his mind and couldn't remember what he was doing after he left our table. Service was very slow and impossible to get hold of.

The hotel is huge and a little difficult to maneuver, but about the time I left I was getting better at it. There is a second floor bridge to a large convention facility across the street. Check-in began one of the worst travel experiences of my life. There was a line to check in, something I have not experienced in other business travel for a good while, but I later learned the very large hotel was at close to 100% capacity. The front desk staff were very helpful. My first room was very nice. I was surprised to see I had been booked in a \"Junior Executive\" room... king sized bed, living area with sofa and two chairs, flat screen TV and a bar area with refrigerator. But... no air conditioning. Dallas in July can be very humid and as I unpacked I did everythkng I could to get cooler air. The fan worked, and the hotel has installed special thermostats that are supposed to sense when a person is in the room and then begin cooling. I called the front desk, but it took awhile for someone to come to work on it. Long enough, now, that I had called the desk again to request another room. I was dripping with sweat at this point and very uncomfortable. I was promised another room with the explanation that I was being upgraded (at no additional expense) to an Executive room in the other tower since the hotel was so booked. A service person did arrive and, perhaps, was able to repair the A/C. I'll never know since a bell hop arrived to assist me in moving my belongings to my new room. It was huge, the largest room I have ever stayed in. But, surprisingly, not all that impressive after you got over the square footage. My bell hop explained that this tower was a former office building that Sheraton had aqcuired, and I found myself wondering what the room might have been originally. The first room was a large living area, but with very little furniture or decorating. There was a sofa and coffee table, a couple of floor lamps, and a small round table with chairs. On one wall was a flat screen TV, but it was so far across the room from the seating area that I found I did not enjoy usuing this room at all... too hard to watch TV. It was almost as if this room had \"not been completed\" yet. The bathroom was nice, but there was no bar area with refrigerator like the room I had just moved from. I missed that. The bedroom was spacious with two queen sized beds and a small desk and chair. There was also another flat sreen TV in the bedroom. Drawer space was curiously poor, as there were about three small dressers spaced throughout the two rooms with very small drawers. I found I had to put my clothes in two rooms, rather than one, yet I was the only one staying in the room. Tired, sweaty, and very hungry I ordered room service and was told it would be about 40 minutes because of the full hotel. After an hour I called back and they asked to take my order *again*, as it turns out my order was lost, or otherwise never prepared. They comped this meal for me (fair) and got it to me as quickly as they could. It did taste good, but I was starving and irritated by this time. The rest of the stay proceeded okay, and I have to say that staff seemed interested (at times) in making my stay enjoyable. The wireless internet available in the room comes at three pricing levels. I'm pretty sure you are charged BY DEVICE as I found my iPhone did not automatically connect to the Wi-Fi access I had paid for with my laptop computer. Instead I was prompted for payment options again. I declined, but another traveler should inquire before setting up multiple accounts for multiple devices. I saw many people accessing convenient locations to use their laptops in the lobby area (comfortable chairs with power plug-ins close by) but, while I could detect a Wi-Fi signal with my iPhone, I could never connect to it. Once again I was prompted for payment options. I thought free wireless was available in the lobby area? Same thing for the convention center. Maybe it was just \"my turn\" for unfortunate travel mishaps but overall I did not enjoy the stay at this hotel and do not plan to return.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Simpsonville, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cConference stay at Dallas Sheraton\u201d", "Author": "gergs", "ReviewID": "UR71057225", "Content": "The Dallas Sheraton is an excellent Hotel.

However, services to the business traveler are definitely in question. We traveled for a business conference in July, 2010. We thought it priced too high, but opted to bite the bullet and pay the $18.95 PER DAY for in-room wifi service. Things went well for the first couple of days of our stay (we were there four). We were both able to access the wife in our room with no problems. On the evening of our second day, one of us was not able to connect to wifi in our room. A quick call to tech support revealed that the charge should have been $18.95 per day PER COMPUTER. My conversation with Andrew Franks (guest services manager), was unproductive, and he offered, as a \"goodwill gesture\" to rescind the charge for one day. One factor that was also of concern, they did not tell us about the \"per computer\" part of the charge, which I found unreasonable in the first place. I recommend that you locate another hotel if your conference participants are dependent on wifi, and want the convenience of working from their guest rooms at no additional charge.

We were told we were getting a four-star hotel that was in the vicinity of our dinner destination for the evening (Medieval Times). We ended up on the 17th floor of the hotel, which was clean and had 4 eating establishments located inside--The Kitchen Table (closed due to low occupancy), Draft (a sports bar and grill), Chill (an ice cream place that also looked closed) and a coffee place. Parking in the hotel's parking garage, which is below the hotel, was $19 for the night. We tried to park in a $5 lot across the street but were warned that traffic from the nearby club might cause it to fill up while we were out to dinner. So, the good deal we thought we got on the room was pretty much eaten up with the added parking. Hotwire does warn that hotels may charge additional fees, but this seemed a bit much. However, the hotel is in downtown Dallas, so if that's convenient for you, then the added expense may be worth it. We had chips and salsa at Draft. Food items seemed a bit pricey. Our snack was $5 and the salsa tasted just like Pace Picante, nothing special. The waiter was friendly, though. The lady at the concierge desk was also friendly when offering advice on the parking situation. Other downsides: the shower was slow to drain and I think there was supposed to be a light over the shower, which was burned out. It seemed really dark in that part of the bathroom, but it was roomy. Many TV stations on the flat screen were grainy. The pillow cases had a strange texture. The room seemed small for one with a king-sized bed. Check out time was listed as noon. At 9:50 a.m. housekeeping knocked on our door and we had to tell the lady we were still there. That made me feel rushed and I actually thought it was quite rude. Positives: the room seemed clean and the sheets were comfy.We didn't swim but we did check out the gym area, weight room and pool with cabanas on the fourth floor. That looked like a nice feature. They had a gift shop. Several computers with Internet were available near the lobby. The bottom line: we have been happy in most of the Holiday Inn Expresses where we have stayed in the past. Most of those are considered three-star, but we missed the included continental breakfast they offer and would rather stay outside of the bustling city at a place like that rather than a four-star in the middle of downtown Dallas that overcharges for parking.

As another reviewer mentioned, the fitness center is one of the largest, nicest facilities I've experienced. There must be 20 or so treadmills and ellipticals and a room full of free weights and machines. The pool area was also tastefully redone. The pool itself is nothing fancy, but they put the nice padded chairs as well as some cabanas around it, so it's very enjoyable to lay out around the pool with a nice downtown view. I would highly recommend this hotel if you have business in downtown Dallas and definitely choose it ahead of the Westin if the rates are comparable. The only major downside is that the hotel can get kind of crazy if there's a large convention, but once you've stayed here a couple times, you'll figure out where everything is and the large size isn't much of a problem anymore.

At first the hotel is overwhelming because it's so huge - with rooms located in three tall towers. However, after getting oriented, I realized what a wonderful place this is. I had a King-bed room in the north tower - room 1869. There was a spectacular view of the Dallas skyline from the room. The bed was comfortable and the quietness enabled me to get a good night's sleep. The best thing about this hotel is the wonderful amenities. The fitness center was the best I've seen at any hotel, and it was open 24 hours (no additional charge). Also, the hotel has a section near the lobby which has computers where internet connection is available to hotel guests at no additional charge. A DART rail station is located just outside the hotel, which makes this a convenient place to stay if you need to get to the Dallas Convention Center. On the second floor, the hotel is connected to a skywalk which will take you to Plaza of the Americas which has shops, dining, and an ice skating rink. Most of these businesses close early in the in the evening, but the McDonalds stays open longer. Aside from the hotel restaurant, it was difficult to find dining places that were open in the evening in this part of downtown. However, I found a great Italian dine-in/take-out place called Carmine's Pizzeria, just a couple of blocks from the hotel on the corner of Harwood & San Jacinto. They're one of the few places that stays open throughout the evening in this area. The bottom line is that I found the Dallas Sheraton to be a great place to stay in downtown Dallas. I would recommend it to anyone and it will probably be my first choice if I ever need to stay in downtown again.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cIntrusive Housekeeping Staff\u201d", "Author": "the-Soror", "ReviewID": "UR67144810", "Content": "A housekeeper literally *WALKED INTO OUR ROOM* while we were sleeping and didn't answer a short, quiet knock on the door.

Sheraton Check in was rapid, efficient, and the customer service at a high standard. I was directed to my elevator and tower directly and made my way to the room. As is usual for Texas, everything is bigger, and this hotel is no exception. While the overall property is huge and common areas the same, the room floors design was laid out in an easy to navigate square pattern. I have stayed in much more sprawling properties. While the walk from front desk to the North Tower elevators is a 5 minute hike, from floor elevator to your room is a quick walk, regardless of where the room is in the square. The room was very clean, non smoking, well lit, had a nice large screen flat panel TV, and a wall to wall window with a view of downtown. The bathroom was surprisingly spacious, nicely designed, and stocked with toiletries and linens. The bed was very comfortable, and the room quiet. I had no problems sleeping for my whole stay. The eateries around the hotel were sparse. Being on the edge of town, a short walk (10 minutes max) to Main street was the fastest access to a restaurant area. I visited two places downtown, both of which had very nice cuisine, one Mexican establishment known as Iron Cactus and another Italian establishment known as Ravenna. I also observed several other interesting places on the same street. The West End was known to be near and worth exploring, which I did not have time to walk further into. Word of advice: The last night I ate at the Sports Bar in the hotel to save time. The food was very fried and awful compared to the external establishments on Main street. I would NOT eat there again. Also, the only coffee shop nearby is in the hotel, Pete's, which closes promptly at 5pm. You have to be joking. 5pm in a convention hotel? I recommend the SHeraton kick them out and invite a Starbucks onboard with a later opening time. The nearest Starbucks, by the way, is only open until 6pm and is also on Main Street. The Hotel gym is awesome. I have never said that in any property I have reviewed, but this one merits the praise. It was more like a LA Fitness or Bally's than a hotel based micro-gym. I never had a problem finding a treadmill, since there were about 20+, and that carried over to the life cycles, rowing machines, etc. All the equipment was new, functional, had TV screens, or you could look out at the roof top pool, which was surrounded by lounge chairs and outdoor beds. Yes, Beds, which sounded like fun for falling asleep after a quick swim or just enjoying the outdoor air. Blast not bringing my swim suit along! Checkout was efficient and in short order I was ready to leave from the underground parking area. Which leads me to the one issue I had with the stay. My room key was coded to allow egress from the parking garage. Naturally it chose to quit working when I used it in the underground lot that last day. The HELP button on the exit post worked, whereupon I had to explain who I was, why I was calling, and wait for them to check that I was valid to exit, a 5 to 8 minute delay. Not a tragic issue, but given all the good things that occurred at this property, one I can live with.

However, we found this hotel to be very, very nice in many ways. We all stayed in the North Tower, which has been (I understand) recently renovated, and the rooms were nicely furnished. My executive suite was actually huge, very nicely appointed, two large flat screen televisions with HD, very comfortable beds (the usual Sheraton Sweet Sleepers -- but very nice.) The suite had brand new high end designer carpet. Very clean. Bathroom very nicely appointed -- not palatial, but very pleasant, and fine. We were on one of the club floors, and the club itself was basic but very nice. For convenience I found myself eating in the hotel restaurant several times, and the food was tasty and well prepared, and the servers were quite nice. Outside the restaurant, there is a nice outdoor areas with chairs positioned around fire pits -- and it's a very pleasant place to grab a drink at night.

We went back to the lobby (tried to call from the room but phone won't work) and asked for a room with a TV that could actually be viewed from the bed. We were told that the there were only queen beds in the renovated towers, and that they didn't have any kings (not that there were just none available... he told us they didn't MAKE any kings in the new areas, a little unbelievable). We took a Queen room and it was okay. Definitely not a 4 star, as advertised, as I have stayed in nicer Holiday Inns but it was okay.

At this response, he promptly disappeared....back into his valet office/room & away from the cold. He did not ask if we wanted a bellman....which we definitely did. I went inside to check in while my husband unloaded the car...expecting a bellman to appear at any minute. By the time we were checked in, my husband had brought all of our bags inside so we began looking for a cart. We found one and loaded our bags on it...right in front of the valet window. My husband went to park the car while I took the bags and two children upstairs. When I came back down to return the cart, I decided to ask Mr. Valet Parking whether they even had a bellman on duty.

This offer seemed a bit disingenuous since it came after he had watched us load our bags on the cart and watched me and my two children struggle to move it past his valet window. I told him I had taken care of it and he promptly went back to looking at his computer screen. Highs: On Friday we decided to order room service for dinner, but didn't have a menu in our room. After waiting for one to be delivered for half an hour, I finally walked downstairs to the restaurant to get a menu. Mr. Magdy Rizkalla did not have a menu, however, he kindly offered to let me order room service at the restaurant rather than continuing to wait for a menu to be delivered. Our order was delivered in about 30 minutes and, surprisingly, it was complimentary. This was completely unnecessary, but very much appreciated and demonstrative of the fact that Mr. Rizkalla definitely understands the importance of service. On Saturday night we had dinner in the bar while we watched football games and had excellent service by a woman in her 40's with long wavy blonde hair...don't know her name, but she was terrific.

We were vendors at a convention, and the add-on fees for receiving packages, electricity hookups, phones lines, etc. were excessive and not competitive with other hotels we have done business with. The hotel staff was cordial, but did not go out of their way to make us feel welcome and valued. Check-in was like a cattle call where the bellman abandoned our cart of luggage next to the registration area and walked off without a word. Hotel check-in clerk was all business, and did not seem warm, or happy to have us there. Hotel did not offer free internet in the $119/night rooms. The $30/day parking garage fee was excessive.. Sure the hotel is located downtown, but there is nothing to speak of within walking distance, other than the Americas building with some fast food outlets that all close around 6pm. Our hotel bill of $690+ for a 4-night hotel stay (and the 1 day of room service breakfast) was, in my opinion, too high for the service we received. I would never repeat an experience like this unless absolutely necessary for business. Had I been one of the convention attendees, I would have been even more disappointed in the hotel's value for price paid, and might have left the first night to go stay somewhere else. It is clear that the hotel uses the fact that there are no shopping or food stores nearby to its advantage, and overcharges its guests. If you have a car where you can go out and buy things, then you get to pay $30/day to park it.

All of the staff we encountered were polite and pleasant, but either overwhelmed with the number of people they had to serve or under trained or not properly supervised. The service in the Sports Bar was particularly slow and on two occasions we left after 20 minutes without even having been offered a menu. In the main restaurant/buffet, we were given contradictory information about when the buffet was actually open even though the food was out, it was apparently not available for service.

When it did not arrive within the specified \"window\", I called and was told they had never received the order. To their credit, we did receive the same order on the house the next morning.

My partner and I were here to attend a scheduled convention held at the Hotel. My partner checked in mid-afternoon and I arrived after 10:30 on 7/30. The room he had been given was in the south tower. The walls of the room were unfinished - almost as though it were still under renovation. There were more than 40 rivets and bolts all around the door itself - snagged my blouse opening the door. The toilet in the bathroom, aside from the extremely bad floor planning, was a PUBLIC toilet! The brand that you flush with your foot. The shower head was the old, circular type and even that had lime deposits and didn't release water through more than half of it. I went down to the concierge who was extremely polite and helpful. He directed me to the hotel manager who was also very helpful, polite and expressed understanding of the situation. He asked the lady at the registration desk to find another room for us. While she did find another room, she was taciturn almost to the point of rudeness at having to do so. And no, I wasn't rude - after all, I was being moved to better accommodations. They moved us to the North tower - this room was much better. The elevators - There were two elevators for the second tier of rooms of the North tower. One didn't work the entire weekend. The working elevator was faulty and didn't pick up on certain floors of that tier. At times, it did not recognize the down call button from the 17th floor and the only way to get the elevator to pick you up was to hit the up button and go up before coming down. I waited for 17 minutes, hearing the elevator come down past our floor twice before realizing I needed to go up before going down!! Parking - The room card is used to let you out of the parking structure. Our room key DIDN'T work a single time during our stay. We had to push the call button to get someone to let us out. They said they would fix it and it was never resolved. And TWO times, NO ONE responded to the call button. On both occasions, we had to ask other hotel guests to use their room key to let us out. Other hotel guests had the same issue. Check-out. We were overcharged by $125 for the three-day stay. Instead of being able to express-checkout, I had to go back to the registration desk to sort out the bill. After telling them they overcharged us, they said they took $100 off the bill (the difference in the room charge from $189 to $139). I had to insist the associated taxes to be adjusted as well or I would have been charged the taxes for the incorrect room charge. On a good note - housekeeping was good. And the pillows were excellent. The comforter was very good quality but was noticeably stained in several places. The concierge desk was wonderful. Everyone I spoke to was professional, friendly, helpful and an absolute credit to the hotel. Overall - this was the most aggravating and disappointing Sheraton experience I have ever had. I spent what should have been an enjoyable weekend convention, frustrated and constantly alert over the incompetency and inadequacy of the hotel accommodations.

Despite some of the other reviews, we had a fine experience at this hotel. We were given one of the remodeled rooms (straight out of the hotel photos) on the 26th floor of the Central Tower. This is a huge hotel, but seeing as we've stayed in other large hotels (the Omni Shoreham in D.C. for instance), this wasn't a problem for us. There were three of us in our party; two adults and one teenager. Our room was newly-remodeled, comfortable and clean, although the toilet did flush oddly on occasion. We had state-of-the-art temperature controls in our room, and our section of the hotel was very quiet (a little highway noise from passing sirens, but nothing more bothersome than that). We were across the hall from a Presidential suite which may explain why we had very few travelers sharing our floor. It has been noted in other reviews that some hallways, etc. had odors, and our hallway did have a somewhat musty odor, but nothing that was really noticeable, and the smell did not carry into our room. The hotel staff that we encountered was incredibly friendly and helpful. From check-in until check-out, we found this hotel staff to be some of the \"nicest folks\" we have encountered, and we have stayed at hotels around the world. (If you want really rude hotel staff, try a Galway Bay hotel in Galway, Ireland, during Race Week!) We ate a few meals in the hotel restaurant (Pearl Street Cafe) in between our jaunts to museums, and ordered room service one night. The waiters and waitresses at the Pearl Street Cafe were attentive and friendly. We were even given free desserts during our first meal there. While small mishaps occurred with our restaurant meals (bacon left off of a bacon cheeseburger, for example) the food was good, fast, and really appealed to our teenage son. Room service was incredibly fast and thorough, with the person taking the order going over each choice and each entree methodically. No mistakes of any kind were made with the room service. Also, the weekend breakfast buffet was actually good (we're not usually fans of breakfast buffets). The hotel has an internet area off the main lobby that has numerous stations, and while internet access in the room comes with a fee, the service off the lobby is free for hotel guests. We used both services, painlessly and easily. This hotel is walking distance to most museums and the historic West End District, which has some fun places (like Gators) for casual food. We did not rent a car for this trip, and for what we were doing, did not need one. A DART station is right outside the hotel, so trips outside of downtown can be easily made using this form of mass transit. The Plaza of Americas was the only disappointment to us; we thought it was a bona-fide mall, but it really is only a hotel, with an ice-skating rink and an extensive food court attached. Our trip to this attraction took only ten minutes, but luckily, the museums in the area made up for the Plaza. The hotel is less than 30 minutes from Love Field, with a taxi ride costing about $30 (not including tip). The hotel also has an indoor pool and fitness center, but we had no time to try either on this trip. Overall, for the price, this hotel proved to be a good choice for us and made for a very pleasant stay. If we were to need a hotel in the Dallas downtown area again, we would choose this Sheraton again over some unknown experience somewhere else.

Maybe it was because there didn't seem to be a convention going on the weekend of my stay, but my experience at the Sheraton Dallas could not have been more pleasant. I pulled up to the front but wanted to self park so the valet politely gave me directions to the parking garage. I then went to check in. No lines, and the man behind the counter had my reservation right away and handed me my keys within 30 seconds. He told me where to go to get on the elevator and asked if I needed help with my bags. I got to my room and it was one of the newly renovated rooms. The room was not huge but perfect for my needs. It was amazingly clean, smelled great and had a large bathroom. They put me on the 30th floor so I had an amazing view of the city. To address some of the other complaints people on here had; I never once had to wait more then 30 seconds for an elevator; the rooms were well appointed and clean; I never heard one peep from any of my neighbors, and I found the neighborhood around the hotel to be plenty safe (walked around the city all weekend including past 1 AM and never felt threatened). The hotel may not be located in the most exciting part of Dallas, but most of downtown is dead anyway...so that makes little difference. I only have to complaints. The outdoor pool was closed, the indoor hot tub was also closed, and the indoor pool seemed to be open but was yellow in color and emitted an unpleasant odor. Also, one of the nights I wanted some late night food. I asked the concierge on duty if he knew of any places around that may still be open (it was 1AM). He sneered at me like I was dumb for asking and said that there was a Denny's 2 miles away and that was all (I wanted something within walking distance). I ended up walking around and found my way over to Main St. where I found a number of open restaurants serving the after bar crowds. You would think in a hotel this size, the concierge would be more knowledgeable of the local area.

There was a creepy hole right above the shower and the toilet did not flush properly. It had a 20 inch TV with basic local channels, tons of news channels and no movie channels.

Although my new room was on a higher floor (separating me from my co-worker), it was no better, no bigger and no nicer than the room that was dirty. Some upgrade! The bathroom was tiny--You couldn't fit two people in there standing up--it's probably 4 feet by 6 feet, including the tub! The toilet, which reminded me of a bus station the way it had the 'pull lever' is about 5 inches from the sink which butts right up to the shower. Tight quarters! The restaurant was much better under Adam's Mark...They had many Mexican offerings and a nice variety...Now it reminds me of a small-town Holiday Inn...Limited menu, very little creativity, and high 'downtown hotel' food prices. The English spoken by the staff was horrible...I could barely communicate with my waiter one night, and not to mention the assistant staff. I have easier communication in Asia! On my way to a meeting, I was going to stop to the gift shop (on the second floor) and grab a juice and a muffin for breakfast. Despite the permanent sign saying something like \"Open 7AM to 8PM\" (or whatever it was), the doors were closed and there was a sign on the door saying they'd be back in a half hour (this was at 9AM). Very annoying and not what I'd expect from a full-service hotel...So, I missed breakfast that day. The place isn't bad...It's just not great by an stretch of the imagination. Had it not been for the convention being right there, I'd surely have sought accommodations at the nearby Fairmont or Westin.", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cRude Staff\u201d", "Author": "ShambhalaKeith", "ReviewID": "UR22138342", "Content": "We booked online to stay the night after a 3000 person dinner.

We also heard other guest complaining that suites they had reserved had been given away. We took another room with two queen beds and we were given two vouchers for the buffet breakfast. Ok, that was acceptible. I did appreciate it. However, the person at the desk did not ask for any ID, so in reality they could have given our room to anyone. Once in the room, we found remnants of previous guests that had not been cleaned out. Nothing big, just tags in the top of the closet. But it does make you wonder how well it was cleaned. We had a small snack in the restaurant to tied us over until the dinner that night, signed the bill back to our room, only to be chased down in the lobby. At the desk, they didn't ask if we wanted to put down a cc for further purchases so the restaurant could not charge to the room. Again, nothing big, just embarrasing. The next morning, the staff at the restaurant was incredibly rude. The coffee cup I was offered was dirty, and the waiter slammed it into the saucer as he took it away. When we asked to break a $20 in order to tip, he was rude again. We are putting together a convention in Dallas for another proffesional organization we belong to.

Stayed at one a few years back, but couldn't find my membershirp card, so signed up again. When I checked in, they couldn't locate me, but signed me in as a preferred member anyway. The Good: I was in the South Tower (27th floor), which, according to other reviews, was most recently updated. I felt the room was huge - Preferred Member?. The bathroom seemed large enough and I had no problems with hot water. The room was clean and well stocked. The bed was very comfortable and had about a dozen pillows. The hotel is connected to Bryant? Tower and Plaza of the Americas. As I was there for business, this was an excellent conveience. Dallas offers excellent public transportation. Access to the Train to the West End, where there is a variety of restaurants/bars is within a block. There is an old time trolly - you have to walk about 7 blocks to get it, but it's free and well worth it - takes you to another part of downtown Dallas with other restaurants/bars. Please tip the conducter. The Bad: Although the TV was a huge LCD, the cable line up was limited. About 20 \"channels\" 10 in analog, then the same 10 in digitial. There were no heavy drapes to block out the morning sunlight if you wanted to sleep in. There was Wi-Fi connectivity, but you had to pay for it, as well as local calls. As a Preferred Member, I was given access to the continental breakfast for free. In the rinky-dink little town where I live, the cheapest of hotels offer these services for free. For the price of the room, these should be free. You could hear doors \"slamming\" all night. My first thought was why are people slamming their doors? But, that was just the nature of the heavy doors. The Ugly: The hotel lists several different \"restaurants.\" However, the list hasn't been updated as most of them are now closed. Of the remaining, most close around 7 pm - as do most of the restaurants in the Plaza Food Court. The \"Sports Bar\" has four average sized TV's in a grid against a wall. This was closed by 10 PM. A sports bar that closes at 10PM? (Actually, it seem to be the norm in Dallas, places closing early.) The sole restaurant that has extended hours has a VERY limited menu and is quite overpriced. I didn't make it to the pool area or hot tub, as business needs superceded. I had no problems checking in or out. I called for a wake up call, came about 5 minutes later than the time I requested, but the clock could have been off. Asked which cab service was best and found out there was a shuttle every 30 mins to the airport - I don't recall this being mentioned in the services of the hotel. Summary: Not a bad experience - of course, I didn't have to pay for it. For an upscale holel, you pay far more than for what you recieve.

It wasn't even very warm. I called guest services and they said it was normal, especially because I was on the 20th floor. (The higher up you are, the more likely you won't have hot water.) They offered that I could change my room, but I was in a beautiful suite and didn't want to move rooms. Then she told me to just let the water run until it turned hot. I let it run a full 15 - 20 minutes, which is expensive and wasteful. After 15 - 20 minutes, it was a good temperature. But it is pointless to stay in a suite and not have hot water! I didn't like the food in the restaurant either. Not only was it extremely overpriced ($6 for a cup of soup), but the food wasn't anything special. When it was the Adam's Mark (before April 2008), they had an awesome restaurant on the top floor. Now, that's gone and the only restaurant is the mediocre one in the lobby.

Overall, the hotel just needs someone to stay at it. Judging from the size of the convention area, and from some of the other reviews on this site, it must be very crowded during the week. My girlfriend & I were staying there on a weekend. And the place was a ghost town. I never saw anyone down in the hotel restaurant, either morning or evening. In fact, I could count on two hands the number of people I saw in the lobby, period. With the mammoth dimensions of the lobby, it just felt incredibly empty. The hotel might have felt a little different if there had been more people there. But with that emptiness, many of the rough edges appeared even more rough. Though one rough edge they can't really cover is the pool area. This thing hasn't been updated in at least 20 years. It's a guess. But considering that the linoleum at the bottom of the pool is starting to peal, and the stainless steel hot tub has graffiti, I can't help but think there are some major updates which should be scheduled for the very near future. The room itself, though a little cramped (as another review pointed out) wasn't so bad. There is an updated, flat screen television. There are matching granite table tops. There are comfortable seats beside the window. There are lush, thick, thick towels. And there's an incredible bed. We had a king sized bed in our room, and both of us slept like we were dead. Waking up was very difficult. Again, some rough edges (like an antiquated air conditioning system and paneling that was coming off), but most of the room felt very cozy. And, most importantly, the furniture that was in the room was very comfortable. Like I said, if I had paid full price for this room, I might have a different story.

The fact that the water in one of the 3 flower vases on the registration desk was in desperate need of changing shouldn't depend on ownership, however. During check-in, one staff person (thankfully not the one who was checking me in!) was both eating & talking w/her mouth full to another guest-ugh! Rooms, at least on the 7th floor of the South Tower, are incredibly small as are the bathrooms. The room is so small the side table for the arm chair is actually behind the chair!! No fitted bottom sheet on the bed, no pillow top or even mattress pad, either. First room I was assigned had a malfunctioning A/C unit; hotel sent 3 staff to work on it &, after I requested it, changed to me another room. I didn't have time for them to spend hours tearing the room apart, though I appreciated the effort. 1 of the sliding doors to the closet of the new room was off the track & literally leaning against the wall (eventually that was, somewhat, rectified). No luggage stand-multiple requests for one, plus additional hangers, & foam pillows until nearly 4 hrs later. The single long blonde hair hanging off the shade of the desk lamp was a nice touch that was still there when I left nearly a week later. As I said previously, the bathroom is very small &, I think, laid out very awkwardly. They clearly spent a small fortune on covering every surface in the room & bathroom w/granite, including bedside table, corner shelf for the tv (large flat panel) as well as the bathroom floor), but couldn't spare a few dollars for a curved shower curtain in the bathroom to give guests a tiny bit more elbow room. The 'don't steal me' hair dryer is actually behind the toilet which makes it difficult to use given the short cord on it. At least they refrained from 'don't' steal me hangers' in the closet. Carpet in the room is in desperate need of cleaning (even before my can of Pepsi exploded all over the closet door, walls, & ceiling). A red 'status' light behind the tv started blinking in both my room & my colleague's room next door Monday night & since the tv's sit on a shelf in the corner, we ended up w/a flashing red light clear up to the ceiling. By that point, we were both so fed up w/the hotel, we simply threw towels over the flashing light for the duration of our stay. The public areas of the hotel are, overall, quite run down, dingy, & in desperate need of, if not a complete make-over, at least a deep & thorough cleaning. My traveling companions, who have (unfortunately for them!) stayed @ this hotel before, said the service in the Pearl Cafe has improved quite a bit since the change-over, however, the food itself hasn't. We only ate breakfast there, so I can't comment on the rest of their menu. The Westin City Center is connected to the Sheraton by a enclosed skywalk which has a number of food court style restaurants as well as the Westin's restaurant where we ate 3 nights (the crab encrusted tilapia is wonderful!).

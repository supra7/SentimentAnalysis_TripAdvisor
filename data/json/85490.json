This requires that I find dog-friendly lodging. America's Best Value Inn was the closest dog-friendly motel in downtown Daytona Beach (not on the beach, or in the tourist areas, but downtown near the government and businesses). The rate was $36.00 per night and an additional $10 per night to have my dog. They don't do anything with the $10 pet fee, except allow you to bring your pet; no special cleaning occurs when you leave.The fee is high and unwarranted. The room, however, was worth the basic $36.00 per night. It had a king size bed, It had a compact fridge and a microwave on top of it. It had a desk with a 10/100 network cable to connect to free internet with. It had cable TV with HBO. The bathroom was recently redone. The problems with the room were that the outlet in the bathroom did not work (requiring me to blow dry my hair in the bedroom) and the shower curtain did not have magnets to secure it to the tub so when the shower is running (good water pressure, hot temps), the curtain billowed all over the place, spraying the entire kitchen sink and toilet and floor with tons of shower cast-off. I was there two nights, and I tried to pin down the curtain the second day, but ti is not really a shower curtain but the decorative curtain you see on showers that are meant to be lined with a plastic or vinyl liner. So water all over the bathroom was the norm. I had to take my dog to doggie day care every day while I attended to my business (read my review on the Pet Paradise Resort) on Trip Advisor, if you need a good doggie day care).because I was not allowed to leave her unattended in my room. I could have used that $10 extra they charged me to pay for doggie day care. I consider this stay to be par for the course for budget accommodations -- not top of the line, but not a dump. I was not unhappy with my stay; I just hate being charged unnecessarily for having a dog with me.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Myers, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWORST Experience of my life!\u201d", "Author": "kc7294", "ReviewID": "UR125868888", "Content": "WORST Experience of my life!

Whole motel recently remodeled and we stayed three nights. Staff most gracious and efficient giving us room not facing intersection at corner of motel. Motel also just far enough south of Daytona airport take-off and approach to minimize noise for sleeping. Bed was fantastic and with TV on minimum volume, noise from intersection and airport drowned out so we slept like a baby. Room had a big new TV with big cable package plus heating and cooling new and quiet. Impressed with housekeeping as room clean and stocked properly at arrival and throughout visit. Only negative is website said coffee available in office but none offered. Rates are thrifty enough you can bring a couple of coffee cups, a jar of instant java, add water, stick in microwave, and have as much coffee as you might desire. We know that for next time. Overall, we had a very pleasant stay and spent 1/4 the rate others at our meeting paid giving us that warm fuzzy feeling only a super deal can give. Yes, we'll stay again and are looking forward to it!!", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery affordable but not compromise in quality\u201d", "Author": "Eifelyeti996", "ReviewID": "UR110245961", "Content": "For less than $50 a night a king size bed.

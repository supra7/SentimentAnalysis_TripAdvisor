In general a midtown location is fairly convenient, but much of the convenience came from its being on 40th street, just one block from the buses that stop just south of Grand Central and run to all three major airports. Being able to walk one block and catch a bus to Newark for $16 was a revelation. The room was surprisingly spacious \u2013 I had paid for a small room, but was upgraded to a \u201cTower Suite\u201d which was essentially a one-bedroom apartment. The bed was a bit hard, but other than that the room was great. Street noise was a bit audible (room was on the fourth floor) but this was not a problem for me.

It is clean and inexpensive, but not grand. But it has, IMHO, the best location in the city, bar none. First, there is a every 15-minute shuttle bus (Olympia (downstairs, hard left to end of building and left out the door)) from Newark Liberty airport which has a stop (41st St., Lex and Park) one block from the Bedford. Two blocks away is Grand Central Terminal with all its connections and amenities, including a Times Square shuttle. Within a block are several restaurants (diner, Italian, Korean, Japanese, a Jewish delicatessan, street vendors). Within a block are an American Airlines office, a drug store, an Irish pub and a mini mart. It's two blocks from the Chrysler building and a 10-15-minute walk to the Empire State building. The staff is friendly and helpful; on one occasion, my wife left a pair of sentimentally-significant earrings in the room, which was returned to us. We think this speaks volumes about the Bedford. So, if you are in NYC for the city itself, not to lounge around the hotel, it's an unbeatable, inexpensive, perfectly acceptable by any one's standards, choice. If the Bedford is booked when we want to visit the city, we change the dates of our visit so we can stay there.

On the whole the location for Bedford is both convenient and central. Just a few minutes to Grand Central and airport buses. And less than 10 minutes to Times Square. We had a so called \"De-Luxe room\". And as the rooms differ very much, my review is mostly limited to 508. Forget \"De-Luxe\". It is medium standard. But \"De-luxe-size\". Our room had two excellent and wide (140 cm) beds. On the firm side. (We can\u00c2\u00b4t stand soft matresses.) Wall-to-wall carpet. I love that. Two large and well-insulated windows.

And a lot of similar places in 200 meters. Also restaurants. On the negative side: The AC was noisy, but not very effective.

Described as boutique, our room on the 10th was slightly faded from its' best, but warm, comfortable and adequate if not luxurious. The kitchen area was limited and the electric rings lethargic in operation - so slow we used the coffee machine when we wanted hot water for a drink. Apart from that there were two TVs, copious hot water with choice of bath or shower, a 6' wide bed which creaked but was comfortable, and controllable airconditioning units. The hotel has no restaurant as such, but Blooms on the corner of Lexington (30 seconds from the front door) has an excellent choice of full breakfasts for $10-12 including OJ and Coffee. Location of this hotel is simply superb. The Airport Express bus to Grand Central sets down within 100 yards of the front door ($15.50 single to JFK, $27 return). Subway are buses are as close, and 42nd Street is 2 minutes away. The Chrysler Building is on teh next block in Lexington, and you can walk to the Empire State in 15 minutes (you can see it from the back of the hotel). Having access to Subway lines 4,5,6 at Grand Central, together with cross line 7, means that you can be anywhere in Manhatten in around half an hour - fantastic! Staff are really helpful and although they were full and could not gives us a late late checkout on the day we were leaving (with a 10.30pm flight) they were only too happy to let us hang onto our room until 2pm free of charge so we could return and grab a lunchtime shower and change of clothes. I guess this is something of a phobia, but the only thing that worried me a little about is that the floor area is small, and it spreads up over 17 floors with around 8-10 rooms per floor with a lift and stair shaft down the middle.

This large room contained a corner with a very small kitchenette (fridge, 2 electric rings and a small sink and cupboards above).

We arrived late. Front desk was friendly as was the bellman despite the hour. He took us up to our room and gave us the full show-around. We had reserved a one room suite and-- since it's New York-- were really surprised by the size of it. There was, in fact, an entire separate bedroom with its own TV. The bathroom was attached to that bedroom, so not the best convenience, but fine. The room was warm when we got there, but the bellman turned on the two a/c units and soon enough, it had cooled off. This is an old hotel with old decor-- thick layers of paint on the door, brass doorknobs and (attention Moms) a big old fashioned tub for soaking. The room was quiet as could be and it was clear they pay serious attention to sleep-- really good pillows, okay mattresses, blackout shades on the windows, plus drapes-- the room stayed as dark as the ones in New Orleans that are designed for people who stay out drinking all night. People who stay out drinking all night and six-year-olds who arrive on late flights need those dark quiet tomb-like rooms, so they get their rest. The room had a small kitchenette with mini-fridge, electric stovetop and coffee maker. Plus a cabinet with some dishes. There was a hallway to the living room with had two sofas, both pulled open to reveal a slightly larger than twin bed. The room looked out on a small courtyard of apartment building windows with a BIG TREE-- something you don't expect to see a couple blocks from Grand Central. Downsides: Warm room on arrival, somewhat dingy decor compared to upscale hotels, courtyard and fire escape look a little dicey to non-New York eyes, but I'm sure they're fine. Toilet is crammed against the wall (but I've seen that before in New York). Upsides: LOTS of space. Deep old tub. Kitchenette. Very very friendly staff. Spitting distance to Grand Central. Quiet. We're writing this one down as a standard option for New York trips and I'd highly recommend it to other families who aren't frightened off by an occasional dust bunny behind a radiator or a dated bedspread.

Boutique hotels in NYC are a gamble, so we had pretty low expectations... and the hotel met them, sort of.

The front desk was friendly enough, so no complaints there. There is free wi-fi, which was a plus, and the safe was also free. The location is perfect--just two blocks from Grand Central and maybe a 15 minute walk to Times Square. On the website, there are photos of beautiful renovated rooms. We did not get one of those. Our room was tiny (as expected), sad and old. Yucky comforter, no decor, cracks in the ceiling, and all around just tired and drab.

The walls are paper thin, so we could hear our neighbors, the TV had issues, there was no \"all about your hotel\" welcome book or anything (a basic one about NYC, yes, but nothing specifically about the hotel services available), stains on the carpet, and the window A/C unit that was blocked by the curtains. And there were just all around very few \"extras.\" No coffee or mints in the lobby, no breakfast, no smiles, nothing that showed anyone there cared that we were staying there. The worst thing I can say about the hotel (and the reason I would possibly not go back) is that the bed was like a rock. I have NEVER slept in such a hard bed (and I barely slept in this one!) It was honestly like sleeping on the floor. Hopefully, the renovated rooms have new beds, because it was horrible. All in all, it wasn't terrible enough to say \"I'll never go back!\" but not good enough to say \"It's the only place we'll stay in NYC!\" If we get another good rate from the travel website, we'll probably stay there again.

The rooms have great flexibility for families and groups - suites can sleep four to six in various combinations of twin or double beds and fold outs. It's also nice to have a fridge, stove and microwave when in the city so you can save money on breakfasts and lunches. The building itself is beautiful, and the lobby has a well appointed waiting area with plenty of tourist information. Some of the rooms seem to have been redone with the change of ownership, and the bathrooms are all new white & glass. The rooms are very generously sized for New York City, and though the furnishings may not appear as new or glamorous as some other hotels, they are far from worn or tired.

Good size rooms, beds large and comfortable, plenty of hot water, very warm rooms with air conditioning to cool it! TV and safe. Bit noisy at night sometimes (but you are in New York) so take earplugs if light sleeper - didn't worry my teenagers though! Small kitchenette with hob, fridge, sink, kettle, coffee maker, saucepans - no microwave which was advertised but no problem for us. One hob wasn't working and was fixed immediately Rooms need updating - clean but old fashioned and blankets tatty. Beds made (new mattresses being delivered whilst we were there), towels changed and room cleaned daily. Staff - one lovely concierge (don't know his name but he was small with mustache and speaks fast!), Jimmy was quite friendly, reception staff OK but not overly friendly or helpful but we didn't go to talk to them! Scotties diner (round corner) the best for breakfast - great pancakes, waffles, bacon and eggs over lite! approx \u00c2\u00a325 for great breakfast for 4 that lasts you all day. Also great pizza takeaway place round corner. Went to Ellen's Stardust diner where waiters sing all night, Heartland Brewery (below Empire State) and Ess-a-bagel (Cinnamon Raisin with berry berry cream cheese - delicious). Radio City music hall show great (South Sea Port ticket booth good for cheap tickets).

Five minutes from Grand Central and in walking distance from Central Park, Empire State Building, Times Square. And quiet (by N.Y. standards!)! Breakfast is included in the form of vouchers for a (large!) continental breakfast, including fresh orange juice and coffee ad lib, to a very nice diner two doors down. There is a small kitchenette (a cupboard, really) with a fridge, coffeemaker and plates and cutlery, so that you can eat in (which we did twice). There is a very nice italian restaurant next to the hotel. The bathroom has all amenities and is suppplied every day with sumptuous towels and bath accessories (even conditioner and body lotion). The shower was hot (so no fear of legionella!) Beds are good, good mattresses, nice pillows and sheets. The room had a free WiFi, safe, ironing board, trouser press and hairdryer. Now to the drawbacks: The room was clean, but not overly so. It really needed a thorough renovation, but apparently they are doing the hotel up floor by floor, at least there were lots of carpenters and painters in the elevator always. The cold water had a peculiar smell, so we did not drink it (we brushed our theeth in it though, and none of us got sick). The heating seemed to be controlled from outside the room, as the very old radiator was very hot during the day and cold in the morning.

Totally Unprofessional.\u201d", "Author": "ticex", "ReviewID": "UR20800298", "Content": "After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor I expected the Hotel Bedford to be an acceptable hotel and a suitable venue for my girlfriend and I to relax on our one and only night in NYC after a week of travel around the USA. I couldn't have made a worse choice! Despite the fact I had a confirmed reservation guaranteed with my credit card I arrived at the hotel around 10pm only to be told by a rather agitated receptionist they had no record of my booking, everybody had already checked in and the hotel was now full. However, after 30 minutes of debating this it seemed a miracle had happened and some rooms might be possible but sadly at a yet to be disclosed higher price. At this point I was highly suspicious so I said \"no problem, I'll go to another hotel\" but before leaving I requested some kind of written confirmation from the reception I had tried to use my reservation and they wouldn't charge my credit card for a \"no show\". Funnily enough the chap at reception suddenly became rather aggressive and point blank refused to give me anything. The story now changed and he said he'd \"do me a special favour\" and give me a room reserved for a corporate client that was yet to arrive but I'd have to pay a much higher price - strange seeing as he told me on arrival everybody had already checked in. At this point I felt like I was being held to ransom so I refused his kind offer and said for me there were only 3 options: 1: I have my room as booked for the agreed price of \"only\" $295, 2: No room, so I have a written confirmation they won't charge me for a no show, or failing this 3: I'll ask the 2 police officers at the foot of the road to witness the situation so my card wouldn't be charged. At this point the chap at reception decided he would disappear to \"the office\" for almost an hour only to return with yet another offer for a room at a higher price. I repeated my list and said he had another 10 minutes before I had no option but to leave. Amazingly just before this deadline a room had suddenly freed itself up and my reservation was found. It certainly wasn't worth the trouble! Instead of the one double bed the room had 2 of the most uncomfortable single beds I've ever experienced, the TV was ancient and only showed one channel with so much interference it was unwatchable, the wallpaper was peeling from the corners of the walls, the toilet seat was an interesting shade of dark brown at the rear, the shower was dirty etc... Basically the room was run down and very badly cleaned. However, my 2 hour check in was obviously rather tiring for the reception as he had vanished so there was no possibility for complaints so I had no choice but to accept this awful room. Overall this experience essentially ruined our night in NYC and if the attitude of the receptionist and the bellboy are anything to go by I suspect is kind of the norm for late check-ins at this hotel.

Fantastic little hotel in the heart of all the action in NYC. Euro style yes, but only as far as the lobby goes, but the one bed suites are simply huge. Plenty of space for a family of four, very comfy king size bed in separate room, two also quite comfy double size sofa beds in living room, and plenty of space to move around within room. Not so European then, as the tendency on the other side of the pond is for very small rooms. A good size fridge in room (not usual minibar size) for storing your own cold drinks (and beers!) and a small kitchenette area with stove, microwave, sink, coffee maker etc. Trouser press, iron, ironing board all in good working order. An AC that cools well, a must in NYC in the summer months! All in all, don't see the need to pay more (I paid 370USD per night inc taxes for this room, (its the third best in their 4 tier pricing of rooms) as after having checked out many many options, I couldnt find a bigger room with all these ameneties for under 600USD per night. Oh, and the icing on the cake must be the view of the Empire State Building, this if you are on or above the 12th Floor. Seemed to me the smaller rooms are from floor 2 to 10 or 11, the one bed suites from like 12 to 17 and the 'tower' suites above that. So, the higher you go, the more you pay!!

This was my 2nd. time at this hotel, last year I was travelling solo but this time with a friend so booked a suit. Once again great room size and storage ( HUGE by most NY hotel standards.) The large lounge had its own storage ( containing digital safe for your valuables ) in addition to that in the bedroom, 2 double sofa beds and a decent size mirror so it was easy to work around only having one bathroom. For this reason though you may not want to go for max. possible room occupancy if it is an all girl trip ! Staff still as friendly and helpful as last time. Norman, (Mr. vacuum cleaner !) is a particulr favourite of mine. Yvette, our room service girl kept everything in tip top condition and anything we requested was dealt with immediately. Always plenty of hot water and fresh towels, although we did arrange that only the used towels ( left on the floor) be changed on a daily basis. As other postings have mentioned there are great food options on Lexington and at Grand Central, check out the food market on the lower level. If you are going to the upper west side visit Fairways supermarket on Broadway and 74th. street, this should be a tourist attraction in it's own right ! This is also the area to buy wine at a sensible price ( base of Brooklyn Bridge also good value). Two things worth knowing about the hotel is that they do have a washer and a dryer for guest use, located in the basement, and , if you need a brolly ( umbrella ) just ask to borrow one at the reception desk.

We were upgraded to a tower suite for the remaining 6 nights but we were given this only after we had told them that not having a room for us was unacceptible since we had booked 5 months before hand and confirmed our stay 1 month before arriving. Basically the upgrade was given only after we refused to leave and insisted that they give us a room there. Since we now had to move to another hotel we asked the doorman to find us a cab and after about 5 minutes with no success he just said \"forget it\" and went back into the hotel.

We were booking two rooms and while the receptionist had no problems booking in the first room (#301), he said we had to wait for someone to come downstairs. Eventually, a couple come down and say \"No, we don't like that room either,\" and hand back a set of keys for #310 before leaving the hotel altogether, luggage in tow and calls of \"We still have to charge you for one night!\" coming from the receptionist. Guess which room we got? Yep, 310. When we got into both 301 and 310 we were appalled - the rooms were old, dirty and smelly. Yes Mr Porter Man, feel free to turn on the a/c, but you're not going to hide the dingy mess you've led us to. We'd read on TripAdvisor that there were some refurbished rooms so we marched down to the lobby and complained, only to be told there was nothing they could do that night and to come back tomorrow. Eventually the porter came upstairs and sprayed each room with strong air freshener (only marginally better smelling), but this did nothing for the faded wallpaper and hole in #310's closet. The next morning we went downstairs and asked to be switched - surprisingly, the receptionist did it without questioning why. I can only surmise that they know what 301 and 310 is like. Our next rooms, 1101 and 1110, were much better. Functioning ACs, no bad smells, king beds, cleaner bathrooms and bigger TV combine to make a nice place to stay, while the fridge also has it's uses. Don't get me wrong, Bedford still has some downsides - the 'high speed internet access' borders on false advertising, the beds are hard and only my AC lets me specify a temperature, but compared to some rooms here 1101 and 1110 are wonderful.

As there were 3 of us, we booked a 'suite', which had a separate bedroom, with kitchenette as well. We thought this would be ideal. Like all other reviews, I have to also say that the location was excellent, although we did find ourselves 'raising our eyebrows' when we saw it all behind the scaffolding.. First impressions were not great! The lobby looked lovely, but the rooms really looked grotty, but then again, they were clean. I found the staff to be extremely nice and helpful. When we arrived, we found that the room configuration didn't suit us (double bed in the bedroom, and a double pull out couch in the sitting room - as we were 3 women, we each wanted our own beds), so they immediately changed us to a different suite which had 2 single beds in the bedroom, and the double pull out couch in the sitting room. The 'kitchen' is literally a sink behind a folding cuboard door, and has a fridge and coffee machine. It was fine. All we wanted really, was the fridge & coffee machine - we knew we wouldn't be cooking so this suited us. The bathroom was very small and very dated - the grout between the tiles falling out etc, but it was clean. Towels &sheets changed every day etc. The products weren't great, but being women this wasn't a problem as we brought our own. The one MAJOR downfall for us, was that the bathroom was off the bedroom, which meant that the person sleeping in the sitting room had to come into our bedroom in the middle of the night, which was really not the ideal situation. I was surprised to read in another review that they were able to order taxis to the hotel - They would not do this for us, and told us to go out on the street and hail one ourselves. When it was a different man behind reception, we asked would he do it, and again, he wouldn't. Because of this, and 'rush hour' we missed our dinner reservation, and for the other nights, we had to stand on the street a lot earlier to make sure we got there in time. They did however book an airport shuttle for us, which was very convenient. Also, they did allow us to keep the room until 3 p.m. on our day of departure which was very convenient for us. The first night as we were so jetlagged, we asked them to recommend a restaurant that was close. They did book us at the Italian restaurant around the corner, but I wouldn't recommend it. The food was nice, but minuscule portions and we were starving afterwards, devouring all the bread and fighting over the breadsticks! and the price was astronomical for what we had - we were studying the bill for ages just to make sure there were no mistakes! (It cost us $80 per person!!!!) Back to the hotel - No complaints really, except the bathroom situation, but if it's a central location you are looking for without paying a huge price, and if it's only for sleeping, this is the ideal place.", "Date": "January 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wrexham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cStay well away fron this hotel!!!\u201d", "Author": "Jet_Set_Addict", "ReviewID": "UR6364409", "Content": "Whatever you do, please do not stay at this hotel - I've just returned from NYC and had the misfortune to have stayed at The Bedford.

I can also vouch for the airconditioning which worked overtime for us as we were there during the heatwave a couple of weeks ago. The staff were friendly and helpful and the guest laundry which is hard to find in Manhattan hotels, came in very handy. The location was great, within walking distance to practically everything. We caught a lot of cabs (when it got too hot to walk) and they are very affordable. We ate quite a bit at Blooms Cafe on the cnr of 40th & Lexington and Scotty's Diner on the cnr of 39th & Lexington.

I was expecting two twin beds, got two doubles. no microwave, but a \"murphy-style kitchenette\" with cooktop, mini frige, and dishes, utensils, pots, etc. Ridiculously immmense amount of closet space, including lock-up closet room with locking safe, but didn't use it. They \"doubled up\" on the toiletries. bathrooom was older ceramic tile, spotless, and there was plenty of hot water (pressure took a few minutes to \"settle down\", up on the 15th floor!). Hotel is on the corner of 40th and lexington, and a 1-1/2 block walk to grand central terminal for most subway lines, number six subway within a block on lexington. Lots of quick breakfast/lunch places around, and starbucks across the street. My hotel priorities consist of location and value, without compromising safety and cleanliness. This hotel fits the bill. Will definitely return next year.", "Date": "December 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cGot what we paid for....\u201d", "Author": "worldair", "ReviewID": "UR4163854", "Content": "My family stayed in a one bedroom suite at Thanksgiving.

After reading some reviews on trip advisor i felt like cancelling our holiday. Those people who have booked this holiday and have not went yet dont get to worried on the reviews. If your looking to go to New York on Holiday you wont be going there to stay in your hotel all the time. Believe me you will only be in your hotel to sleep. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite and it was basic. A bit dated but it was clean. The bed was comfortable and huge the suite was big. There are loads of cupboards to keep all your shoppong in. The location of this hotel is excellent you are near everything 5 mins to 5th avenue. and 10 mins to Times square. Two blocks away there is a park and there is an ice rink and little market shops were you can buy all kinds of stuff. It is open till late. The hotel staff were friendly and very helpfull and the doorman is allways there to help but dont forget to tipp him. When we arrived we were allocated are room which i asked for a high floor and no smoking but i was given a smoking room so i called down to reception and they sent up the doorman with a new room key from a room on a different floor this time it was no smoking there was nothing that was to much trouble for the staff. Here is a little tip for you for transfering from the airport to the hotel dont get a taxi they are anything from $40 to $70 if you go out of the airport main entrance ther is a coach they drop you off at your at different locations through manhatten it is $15 single or $27 return and they pick you up and take you back to the airport so you wont spend alot on your transfer you will have more money to spend when your shopping. The bus terminal is round the corner from this hotel about 2 mins walk. Well i hope everyone has a fantastic time in the big apple like we did. I will deffentley be back to The Bedford Hotel again i would strongly recomend this hotel. The only down side of it all is that you have to come home and come back to reality.", "Date": "December 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geelong", "Title": "\u201cgreat location, huge rooms and cheap but thats about it\u201d", "Author": "Anki77", "ReviewID": "UR4161822", "Content": "First piece of advice - if you get room 205 immediately ask for another room. We stayed in 205 and it was a huge room but it was only one floor up facing the street. The windows don't block out much noise (but it is a quiet neighbourhood in the evening) however we were woken in the mornings at about 6am with garbage trucks etc. Also the room is right above the service entrance, so you get all the noise from that as well. Also we think the room was probably above the boiler room as it was roasting every night and you could hear the fans 24/7 although you got used to it if you could forget about it. Also the plumbing was a concern as we could hear the toilet bubbling away every now and then. We considered asking for another room but we got used to the noises in the end. Besides that, the room was big and clean and we only paid $170USD a night plus tax in the end. As we didn't spend much time in the room, it didn't really bother us too much and didn't ruin our time in nyc but i probably wouldn't stay there again. Whilst waiting at the elevator one day we did see into another room which looked heaps better than ours, so they probably all aren't as bad as ours.

The tiny hotel lobby is nice, however, it is not wheelchair friendly as there are a half dozen stairs leading down to hotel lobby and that is the only access. The staff were pleasant, our room was ready earlier than we expected. However we were given a room w/ two twins instead of a queen. We immediately called down and as they were booked we could not switch. I did not want to unpack everything for one night so we stayed in that room. But other than that the room was good, had good views of the Empire State Building and if you leaned over, you could also see the Chrysler building. Carpet felt/smelled clean, furniture looked sort of dated but wasn't worn. Room was huge, although bathroom was small. Tiny little galley \"kitchen\". No microwave. But the fridge was nice and we heated water and made coffee too, and they had plenty of mugs, plates, etc. The beds weren't that comfortable but they weren't the worst either. It was very very quiet at night (except occasional siren below on the street) and very dark as well. Everything was clean and functioning, except two things that bothered me were, 1. a big water spot on the ceiling (we were on the top floor), and 2. the shower - a little mildew on some tiles on the wall, and the water temperature varied wildly, you had to be careful not to get scalded. Also the windows opened fully - I don't know if that's common in NY but we were on the 17th floor and I would have been very nervous if we had young kids with us. No screens or anything. But all in all it was a decent stay. NY taxes are so high, I can't remember our final bill but it was definitely more than $270 a night b/c of taxes/fees that NYC levies. The location was pretty good, very close to Grand Central and the Chrysler building where we caught the subway, cabs were easy to get except for one morning, but it was rush hour.

Upon arrival, we were shown to our room, but when I opened the closet it was full of clothes! Luckily whoever's room it really belonged to wasn't taking a shower! Finally we were shown to our actual, very small room, which was OK. What next? Oh yes. I put our valuables in the room safe, but when I opened it again that evening the power failed which meant I was unable to lock it again. I was assured by reception that their 'engineer' would fix it as soon as possible. Needless to say, when we checked out 3 days later the safe still wasn't working and I had resorted to hiding our passports in more and more bizarre places! We were allowed to squeeze our valuables into a tiny safety deposit box in reception. But when the guy on reception took about 10 minutes and about 15 keys to get it open again, I decided I'd stick to hiding things around the room. What next? Again on our first night, every time my wife used her hair dryer, we lost all power in the room, which had me fumbling about trying to find the fuse box. Never mind, \"let's go down to the hotel bar for a relaxing drink\". Not quite. I know New Yorkers are famed for their 'attitude', but a guy behind the bar at the Bedford makes Danny DeVito's Louie De Palma character in Taxi seem like a nice pleasant chap! \"Let's go to bed then and get a good night's sleep\". Wrong again. BANG! THUD! BANG! Someone should introduce the Bedford to hydraulic door closers. You know, those things that gently close a door behind you. The Bedford's doors are like giant mouse traps. Crashing shut every time someone enters or leaves their room. And unluckily for us, we were next door to a gang of party boys. In and out all night! BANG! BANG! Surely nothing else could go wrong on our New York trip? Doh! Both of us got food poisoning! (At least we can't blame that on the Bedford!) So we had to stay in bed all day Saturday and booked a cab at reception for 4am on the Sunday to leave for the airport, paying a $12 deposit. We were assured that it was a 24 hour check out. When we appeared in reception that morning (still shaking and shivvering with the effects of food poisoning), surprise surprise, there was no receptionist. Just a porter fast asleep on a sofa. When we woke him to ask if we could check out, he said \"Gimmee five more minutes!\" and went back to sleep! After the initial shock (was this real, or just a food poisoning induced nightmare?!) we woke him again and he told us that the receptionist had gone to bed in one of the rooms but hadn't told him which one! So he spent the next five minutes shouting his name up the stairs! (4.10am. No sign of our cab at this point.) Eventually the receptionist appeared and called the cab company who said that the booking was actually made for 4PM! So we had to get our deposit back and stagger down the street with our cases and catch another cab, arriving at the airport late, sick and fed up. Oh yes, it wasn't until I'd recovered from my illness till I realised that I was charged over $70 above the agreed rate for our stay! Bye, bye Bedford.

We were in a one-bedroom suite, which had a HUGE living room and smallish but adequate bedroom. The decor is fine; I was worried it would be depressing. There is plenty of drawer space and two large closets. The bathroom is acceptable and clean, but, as with the rooms, you can't hide the fact that this is an old hotel.

So I wouldn't recommend locking up your computer in the closet. The hotel now offers free Internet access, which we didn't use (having left our computers at home). Note that the charge for phone calls from the room is steep; your best bet is to buy an \"800\"-type phone card and use that instead. The one-bedroom suite has two phones but just one TV. Nonsmokers: Be sure to check with the hotel that you are indeed booked into a nonsmoking room. The hotel doesn't have many rooms of that type.

The water in the shower had a tendency of shifting from hot to cold without notice, a \"classic\" feature in older hotels I guess... Towels were clean and changed every day. The cleaning of the room was very good. Overall, we were happy with this room and our stay at the Bedford Hotel. It is not a hotel you visit for the atmosphere, but the location and value for money are strong points to consider. We can recommend this hotel if you are on a limited budget (we payed about $150 a night for the room, no breakfast included).", "Date": "April 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby, UK", "Title": "\u201cgreat value\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3351050", "Content": "Was a bit scared of staying here after reading some of the reviews about this place. I found this hotel great value for money compared to similar hotels of this price. The rooms were really large, with huge beds and a TV. The bathrooms were a little small and could do with updating but were perfectly fine for just a few days. Found all staff very helpful and the hotel was in a fantastic location, couldnt have been better! Only slight problem was the noise of the pipes at night which were very loud but slept through most of it as exhausted from the busy days. Overall would definitley stay here again, its not the plaza but then you arent paying plaza prices. Great base for a great holiday.", "Date": "April 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, MD", "Title": "\u201cNeeds a major facelift!\u201d", "Author": "rtbabb", "ReviewID": "UR3350020", "Content": "Stayed at the Bedford on Sat., 4/9/05 - just one night, thank goodness. I was with 4 girlfriends, so I slept on a cot that was like sleeping in a wire hammock. The room was clean, but very \"tired\". The bathroom was old, mildewed and exhaust fan-less (hence the mildew), and we wouldn't touch anything in the kitchenette - very grungy. Also, the pipes made A LOT of noise and it often sounded like the toilet was going to explode. It was easy to get scalded in the shower, as the water temperature changed radically whenever someone flushed elsewhere in the hotel. The iron needed to be cleaned and the ironing board was in bad shape. It was, however, VERY SPACIOUS and the staff members were friendly and helpful.

The location was great, about 10mins walk will take you to times square etc. Its based on a quiet road so you hardly hear any traffic noise ! The hotel rooms were nice, i stayed in a one bedroom suite which was great the four of us. Clean, lots of space and having a kitchenette included was very handy ! The reception staff at the hotel were pretty unhelpful and rude. Im not sure if i would come back to this hotel as we were not made feel welcome what so ever.

I thought New York was fantastic and I will definately be coming back some time in the future. Unless I'm lucky enough to win the lottery and be able to pay to stay at the Waldorf Astoria, I would be happy to stay at the Bedford because I know that it is ideal and nice. I would recommend this hotel if you want to save your money for sight seeing & shopping. There is so much to see & do you literally only sleep in your room anyway. Bellunos (italian) and Peking Park (chinese) are just minutes away and we had lovely meals there. We found an irish bar called Mulligans near by and we had nice food there to, the bar staff were very welcoming. The pick up point for the bus to the airport is in the next street and is $12.00. We got a taxi to the hotel from the airport and it was $60.00 but had we got the bus it would have been $20.00 return. Just remember that you have to tip everyone there. It was one of my best holidays, Statue of Liberty & Central Park were great and the Empire State building was fantastic.", "Date": "March 9, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Bedford Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d93403-Reviews-Bedford_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$172 - $365*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">118 East 40th Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10016</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "93403", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/00/cc/00cc7e60d9084be2315756ae818fbebb5large.jpg"}}

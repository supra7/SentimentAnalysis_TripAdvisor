Overall, this is a fine place. The jazz club is excellent and we were able to go to see Ramsey Lewis this past weekend. The show was fantastic and everyone who works at the club are excellent. This time I was smart and booked a king room. During the last visit, I asked for 2 beds and unfortunately, that meant 2 twin beds which were too small and uncomfortable. If you are travelling with 2 and don't want to share a bed, this hotel is not for you. We ate dinner one night with our extended family of 9 in the restaurant and the food was good. The service wasn't up to par and dirty dishes were left on our table after new food had been brought out. This caused a very crowded table. Also, our server didn't stop back to see if we needed/wanted anything else until we were almost done eating. That being said, the food was good. Another evening we stopped at the bar to have a drink and there was no one in it to wait on us. When she finally returned after 5 mins or so, she didn't even acknowledge us and started folding silverware in napkins rather than seeing if anyone wanted to order. Eventually we got her attention and drinks which were fine. Now as to delivering hilton honors benefits, they do offer the basic continental breakfast included in room rates. If you want the hot items, $6.00 extra charge. I booked a king suite and that is exactly what I was given. No upgrade although the clerk said a river view is an upgrade. I asked for a larger corner room or one of the loft suites, but was told no. Same thing during my last visit 4 months ago. The housekeeping staff are excellent and also so happy to give you extra water or peanuts and the rooms are definitely well cleaned.

One night we walked across the bridge into Cambridge, visited the Harvard campus (AMAZING!) and had a GREAT dinner. Another night we took the shuttle into Boston, stayed late, and returned on a taxi (less than $20). The only downside of the hotel is that you can't walk into Boston, otherwise, it's an excellent hotel.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ossett, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cServed its purpose but don't expect what you pay for!\u201d", "Author": "Eloise99", "ReviewID": "UR118108119", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel because we had planned a night out in Allston.

The hotel is also not too far of a walk from the Allston neighborhood, which has many bars and restaurants. The room itself was spacious and comfortable, particularly the bed. I opted for a room with a balcony rather than a suite. The view of downtown Boston from the top floor of the the hotel was definitely worth the trade!

The following is the best summary of the good and bad of this hotel: Good Size and layout of the suites. Nice atmosphere in the suite. Good lighting and heating works well. Comfy bed River view Close to Harvard Bar staff friendly and flexible. Very good wifi - even in the suites Not so Good Air conditioning only. No way to let fresh air into the room No grounds around the hotel. Right beside a very busy noisy road Food at main restaurant very hit and miss Breakfast uninspiring - very run of the mill. Room service stops at 11pm. Front desk staff not very engaged. Check in was functional and cold. Felt like i was being processed, not welcomed. Overall, This is a very functional hotel that is comfortable without being inspiring. As a location almost exactly between downtown and Harvard/MIT it works well but it's not a hotel you would go out of your way to recommend to friends. It's built on a very small piece of land at a very busy junction so as soon as you exit the front door you want to leave. The entrance is dominated by the adjacent car park which makes it quite ugly. Once inside an effort is made to make it seem welcoming but the design instead makes it rather cold where sounds echo and the desire is not to hang about but to head to the suite. Inside the suite, the atmosphere is good and the furnishings modern and quite fresh. The inclusion of a coffee maker, fridge and microwave is welcoming.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cDouble Tree quality but a little overpriced.\u201d", "Author": "RoyU", "ReviewID": "UR117598064", "Content": "This was the only area hotel I could find with rooms available for college move in week.

The only negative involved the complimentary shuttle. The hotel is very conveniently located for drivers, as it is 30 seconds from the highway and has ample (but expensive) parking. Since we were flying and planning to spend most of our time in Back Bay & Downtown, we decided to not rent a car & rely on the shuttle. It makes the rounds about every hour, and they suggest that you reserve your spot on it. The driver twice had to turn away riders while we were riding, as the van was full. Some people on the van had not made reservations, which would have upset me if I was denied. The driver said they are probably switching to first come/first served, which could be okay if that was a consistent policy. However, since the bus goes to Copley Square first, then Boston Commons, followed by the Aquarium, you wouldn't know if it was full if you were waiting at the third stop. The point is, ask the front desk what the policy is before planning your day. Enough negatives, here is why we would stay there again. The room was spacious, quiet, & very comfortable. We ate breakfast there once & we didn't have to eat until dinner-- it was very filling & tasty. The pool was cold, but the hot tub was wonderful after walking the streets of Boston all day. The cookies put back all the calories I walked off!! While you have to walk a long way to get anywhere, the sidewalks made it easy & gave us a great view of the Boston architecture on the way to Back Bay or Harvard.

We were warmly greeted and given fresh chocolate chip/oatmeal cookies which were very tasty. I also caught glimpse of a Starbucks sign, which for me was a good thing as I like their coffee. It was a bit of a challenge getting in the driveway as the intersection that the hotel is located on, is very busy, plus the fact there is limited space in the entrance circle. But, once we were able to get in the driveway and checked in, we were able to easily park the car in the multi-story car park that is attached to the hotel. Keep in mind that you will be charged a moderate fee of $35 per night for parking. I was really surprised at the size of the rooms. I didn't expect the suites to be as large as they were. We had two separate rooms with a bathroom in between. We had a great view of the Charles River and the Boston area. The bedroom had a very comfortable king size bed, well appointed furnishings, and a flat screen TV. The bathroom was adequate, and fairly clean, but could use a little bit of attention to detail. Mind you, this isn't necessarily an issue with all rooms. The living room had a couch, table and chairs as well as another flat screen TV. WIFI is available in the rooms for a fee. Our room rate did not include breakfast, and we chose not to eat breakfast in the hotel the next morning. But I did have my Starbucks coffee. Likewise we did not use the restaurant on the evening we arrived. We did look at the prices which to me seemed a bit high. We chose to eat downtown as there are many other choices available with reasonable prices The hotel is within walking distance of Harvard University with easy access to the metro subway system. The hotel provides shuttle services to and from the Harvard area as well as downtown Boston which was really helpful as we didn't need to get the car out of the parking garage. Make sure you get the schedule for drop off and pick up times. The shuttle does not run to the airport, as they are not licensed as Hackney Carriages. Hackney laws prevent them from stopping at the airport, but you can get a taxi ride that will cost around $40. Alternatively you can ask the concierge for information on other private shuttle services. If you like to watch the university students rowing the competition boats, all you have to do is walk out the door, cross the street and walk to the Cambridge Street bridge.

We stayed at this hotel over Easter weekend this past April. My husband and I had a suite and our 3 teenagers had their own suite also. The suites are very roomy, clean and comfortable, with a separate sitting area. Our daughters generally share the bedroom and our son gets the sofabed in the sitting area, and that way he gets his own TV and private space. We are Hilton Honors members and got some very good rates (about $100/room per night) , although even without the Honors benefits, the rooms were still very reasonable compared to rates at other Hilton properties in Boston. This hotel is actually in Cambridge, and is adjacent to the Harvard Business School. Harvard University is just a short walk away, over the Charles River. Many rooms are riverview, as well. The location is great, as it is an easy exit off of the Mass Turnpike even before you get to the complicated downtown Boston driving--I do not enjoy driving in Boston! It's a few blocks of walking to get to a T station, but the best part of the hotel (In addition to the cookies!) is the complimentary shuttle service from the hotel to various tourist attractions, such as the New England Aquarium, Copley Square and Boston Commons. Check the schedule carefully at the front desk and you can be dropped off at one of these destinations and then picked up again later in the day. Saves a lot of money and time. The hotel has a jazz club inside it, a feature we did not have an opportunity to enjoy, but it' looks very nice and had a very large crowd on one of the nights we were there. There are a couple of nice bars to relax in and our kids enjoyed room service pizza one night, while we had something more grown up!

Overall, I gave this very high ratings because of the service. The room is nice, but make sure to ask for a King (or queen) suite, as you don't want a room with twin beds. The suite is a bonus because it has an extra room with flatscreen tv/sofa bed. Also ask for a room overlooking the river -- very nice to wake up and see the crew team practicing along the Charles.", "Date": "May 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw, Poland", "Title": "\u201cThis place is OK, nothing special\u201d", "Author": "TheButterflyEffect75", "ReviewID": "UR107037778", "Content": "I have stayed at Doubletree two times, and honestly there is nothing special to say about the place.

It is WALKING DISTANCE to HARVARD. The hotel has good facilities, a nice lobby and restaurant and shuttles to main attracctions and sites in Boston for free. My kid and I were not so pleased with the hotel choice as we were there for leisure and it is not good for this: it is far from almost everything except for Harvard, no cafes or shops around. And the hotel itself lacks infrastructure: the bar is quite limited, the shop is really a small corner by the reception where they have put some bottles, medicines and chocolates. There is not even a cappucino available at the hotel. In room TV is so limited! Just 35 channels and no one for kids! So, if you have to spend a while inside the hotel, it will be quite boring. Rooms are large, not very new but comfortable. Fridge, minibar and microwave. Bed is very good. Bathrooms are ok. Not luxurious at all but clean and comfortable. Staff is UNBELIEVABLE! They are warm, kind, always smiling, always trying to help. They care so much for you that they come to offer help even when you are not asking them for it. I don\u00c2\u00b4t know if it was because my kid and me were wandering along the hotel all day and they are not used to have families (just business people), but they seemed to be delighted to have us (especially my kid) there and they offered warm cookies, cokes and coffee for free all the time. The shuttle used to stop at noon. Once, I had to go to the aquarium at noon and there was not shuttle service until 3 pm: well, they took us to the aquarium just to help us. This hotel has such a great service that they made me love the hotel and the brand even when I usually prefer more luxurious ones. Good for people and for the manager!

The answer: nothing! My stay was very nice. As a Diamond Hilton HHonors member, I was given a suite on the top floor of the hotel and my room actually had two levels -- a main level with a small living room and a loft level with the bed. All of this was very nice, and the views were spectacular. Decor was fine; bed was comfortable. The bathroom was AWESOME -- really great style and a shower that included sprayers in the wall. A nice touch of luxury! Not sure if this bathroom is in every room or was an upgraded feature of the room to which I was assigned. The hotel has a large atrium, which always gives a hotel a nice, airy feel. The lobby is a bit small and a little on the cramped side. Service at check-in was excellent. I was especially impressed that as a line built 2 additional staff members immediately came out of the back to help process check-ins, moving the line very quickly. I had a breakfast meeting in the restaurant. The service was good and the buffet was of high quality. After the breakfast meeting, a colleague and I met in one of the hotel's common spaces to continue our conversation. A manager approached us to explain that the space would soon be noisy due to some renovations going on in the hotel's bar. It was nice of him to warn us...but I was especially impressed when he offered us one of the hotel's empty meeting rooms to finish up our work. The hotel's parking is in a garage that was full enough I had to go to the top floor during my stay, but since there's an elevator connecting the garage to the lobby this wasn't a big deal.

The front desk reprogrammed it and then it worked when I left. - The bedside clock was approximately 1 hour off and there was no way to adjust it. There were no radio stations set on the pre-set buttons. - The guest room door closure mechanisms are worn out, allowing the doors to slam loudly when people entered and exited their rooms. - The TV in my bedroom did not receive any channels.

Boston was very cold and windy when we were there, and unfortunately, the heater in the room never did seem to warm up the room. Still, the comforter on the bed was a perfect weight for sleeping. One odd thing about the hotel (or at least our room) was that the water pressure for the toilet was extremely weak...you literally had to flush several times to clear the bowl, and even then, it was never a sure thing! There was free internet access in the business center, but not in the rooms. Many other Hilton properties offer free Wi-Fi in the rooms...why is it so expensive here? The buffet breakfast ($20.00) had a wide range of items, but overall I felt it was overpriced, e.g., the scrambled eggs were cold, and the fresh fruit wasn't very ripe. We ended up driving to a McDonald's on the second morning of our stay. The location is pretty close to everything (e.g., the Harvard campus is just a few minutes by car and about a 15 to 20 minute walk on very nice sidewalks). So, in some ways, the hotel is nicely situated, but on the other hand, the property sits amongst several very busy roads on what seems to be the middle of a cloverleaf.

Be warned it does not run \"frequently\" as we were told, it runs every hour and you need to make reservations. It also ends fairly early so you'll need to cab it to get back. The parking is crazy high ($35) but in line with other hotels. Their policy on computers is nuts too. They charge $10 for each IP address, which means if you have your laptop but want to use the wifi on your cell and your kid has an Ipod with wifi, you will pay $30 a day. The worst policy I've ever seen. You can use your computer for free in the lobby but it's a bit crowded. The room was fairly clean and well-appointed but the bathrooms could have used more attention. The grout between the tiles in the tub were a bit on the moldy side. The bed was heaven. We had a suite with a separate bedroom and my wife and I loved the King bed with feather top and the pillows were feathered and the best we ever had. My daughter had the pullout couch and she said it was less than comfortable. The staff is friendly and courteous but, as I said, understaffed. The one down-side was the driver of the shuttle. He was gruff and unhelpful and the only words I ever heard him say were, \"Did you make a reservation?\" My wife and I called him the Shuttle Guard. The pool seemed nice (we didn't actually use it because it was packed with families with kids and was a bit noisy. If you're a business traveler or just someone who wants to take a quiet dip in the pool you might have more luck on a weekday or when kids are in school. The location is good. Just outside the city and close to Cambridge but forget about running out to a local store for breakfast. You'll need a car. On the whole the hotel is beautiful but suffers from short-sighted management. I was told the hotel was full so you'd think they might have staffed up a bit. There was also quite a bit of mis-communication. We called the hotel twice and again at the desk and asked about the shuttle service each time and no one ever gave us a direct answer.

I will breakdown the sequence of events and why you should think twice before choosing this hotel. LOCATION: Very poor. It is near nothing and close to nothing. The street outside the hotel is very busy and a cab must be taken everywhere. ROOM SERVICE: perhaps its just me, but does room service start early? 7:30 is a little early to be knocking on doors. I made sure to put my DND sign up the next day. HOTEL LAYOUT: The layout of this hotel makes it VERY noisy. If you have three people, the person sleeping on the sofa bed, will hear everytime a neighbor closes the doors, will smell the breakast food on the 2nd floor (we were on the 7th), will hear loud banging at all hours of the night. The layout is an interior corridor layout so it appears that noise is transferred very easily in this hotel since it is missing walls and insulaiton. ROOMS: Rooms were clean, and housekeeping prompt so no complaints there. However, for a \"suite\" you would expect a separate sink (other than bathroom) but there were none. Bathrooms had adequate counterspace. BREAKFAST: Buffet is not worth 19.95, but of course since you are in the middle of nowhere you have no other options INTERNET: 9.95/DAY CABS: Cab drivers frequent this hotel so that will not be a problem. Our issue was that cab drivers seemed very picky and would ask you where you are going and then would decide whether or not they wanted to take you. Make sure they turn on their meters as soon as you get in the car. OTHER: There was a loud banging through the walls of our hotel room. It started at 3 a.m. and continued until 7 a.m. The maintenance engineer was called and he could not determine the problem. Initially the thought was that the banging in the wall was coming from the pipes, but this was refuted by the engineer, so therefore we had to put up with the screeching noise in the wall all night as the hotel was sold out and there were no other rooms to switch to. The maintenance engineer did his due diligence and even offered us free breakfast coupons for our lack of sleep because of this issue. But it is very disappointing that the promised call from the hotel manager never came. Nor did he call and check up on our status as we were greatly inconvenient. I will be writing a little to the Hilton headquarters as well as to the GM of this hotel, this evening. Then there was a FIRE ALARM on Saturday evening/afternoon. Seriously??!!! When is the last time you have experienced a fire alarm in a hotel? This definitely gives you hints as to the type of guests you will be staying with as well as the caliber of this hotel.

A desk for sitting/working at finished off the bedroom. I splurged on in room dining one night, which was all it took to find out how expensive room service was. A small bowl of clam chowder, chicken parm and a bottle of beer was over $40; till I added a tip it exceeded $50. The food was mediocre at best; definitely not worth the $50 + I paid.

Due to budget we saved a lot of money by staying at this hotel, and would definitely recommend doing so if you are in the same boat. The hotel was really nicely presented, with nice staff, bar and lounge and the rooms (we had standard) were a great size, really clean, nice bathroom and we were lucky enough to have a beautiful view out of the Charles river! There is also a small pool with a jacuzzi which we loved - it is open till 10pm and is perfect for relaxing after long day sight seeing! It is important to mention the location of the hotel, after we ourselves were freaked out after booking by people mentioning how bad the location is and reccomending that we try to book elsewhere- but don't fret it is FINE! Option one: They have a really good and extensive shuttle bus service which takes you into different parts of the city, and only takes around 10 minutes to do so. You do have to prebook your seat for the times you want, so if you are organised or have a family this is a perfect way to do it. (N.B there was always spaces for when we wanted, so capacity doesn't seem an issue). Option two: You can take the T, to Central Square and then walk about one mile (along River street) to the hotel. The route is basically straight along the one road and doesn't take that long. On route there are two supermarkets if you want to stock up on water etc! We used to take this option on the way home to give us flexibilty when we wanted to return instead of prebooking a shuttle time, and we even walked it late at night and always felt safe! You could always take a taxi from Central Square too if you wanted. Word of warning- I wouldn't recommend this route if with young children as the road crossings at some points aren't that well planned out (mainly the first crossing from the hotel. In a nutshell the hotel was great, saved us lots of money, location is not an issue and it was perfect for our amazing, full packed stay in the beautiful city of Boston :) We would recommend to families, couples, short business trips, and for those who like to spend their holiday out and about exploring and keep their hotel for sleeping!

It was a very annoying and disgruntling stay. First off, the hotel is INFESTED with MICE!!! We saw them multiple times including in our ROOM! When we called the front desk to complain/alert them, all they did was send an engineer with mouse traps. They barely said 'sorry'!!! It is obvious that they get many such complaints every day. The engineer said we could change rooms but it was night time and our daughter was already asleep, not to mention we'd been living there for a few days already and it would be awful to change rooms. We also aren't dumb and know if there's a mouse here, there's mice in other rooms, too. Housekeeping was a nightmare. We expected our trash to be emptied and our room refreshed (new toiletries, coffee, beds made) every day and atleast 2 or 3 days of our 6 day stay had us calling the front desk and demanding house keeping's attention. The hotel is loud- we could hear the jazz bar every night from our room. And don't even THINK about napping in the day because housekeeping hangs out in the hallways and flirts with engineering (no wonder the rooms are dirty and there are mice- no one is doing their job!) All this at a very expensive hotel. It felt like they nickle and dimed us every chance they could get- wireless internet ($10/day) parking ($30/day) early cancellation fee ($75).... even the coffee in the lobby was $2!!! A few pluses- the pool was great, nice hot tub. Great location (for us, anyway to get to the new house). Also, the lobby was beautiful with a sixteen floor skylight. My daughter loved watching the bank of 4 glass elevators go up and down up and down (sitting in the hallway doing this was when we saw our first mouse). There is an excellent restaurant in the hotel, but it's VERY expensive- $19 for the breakfast buffet!!! And room service is not only expensive but they charge you $3 for the delivery PLUS 15% gratuity PLUS meal tax. I've never encountered this in a hotel (charge for delivery plus charged gratuity). On the last note, we were told by 4 different people calling our room from outside lines that it was very inconvenient to try and get ahold of a room and that the front desk was always rude!

During my whole stay I never signed anything other than the restaurant tab. I was given keys to room on the eighth floor, so we went up there only to find people already in the room. So I went back downstairs to the desk. The staffer who gave me keys to another room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to understand why I was upset and insisting that he make sure that I was only being billed for one room. I was also upset because I had made a reservation for a high corner room with a river view so we could see the aerial display for the fireworks. The desk clerk told me that you can't see the fireworks from the Doubletree. A lie -- since we watched them from our room last year. At no point did he take any responsibility for the error. I asked for breakfast coupons and he gave them to me for breakfast the next day. We were assigned another, which was hot. In fact, it kept getting hotter. We called the desk who sent maintenance who worked on the air conditioner for a little while and things seemed to get better. When we came back from Fenway that night, the room was very hot and the sofa bed didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to work, so we called downstairs and maintenance came up again. The room never got below 80 degrees that night. In the morning before we left for an afternoon game, I went to the desk to complain again. When we came back from the game, the room was slightly cooler. As the evening wore on, the temperature crept up above 80 degrees. So I went downstairs again. This time I spoke with the night manager who was genuinely concerned and who cut the price of our stay in half and offered me a free night if I could stay on. He also sent up fans which made that night more bearable. He had the only positive customer service attitude that I encountered among the desk staff.

(last shuttle return is at 4pm) Since everything we wanted to do was near Copley Square, Boston Common, or the North End, we took a lot of cabs. A cab ride from Copley to the hotel was anywhere from $14 - $20 depending on traffic. I have to say however, that we were there on a very busy weekend. Harvard Square and Central Square were somewhat close (if you're driving), so we ate there a few times. Cool shops and restaurants. The concierge at the hotel was SUPER nice, and actually all of the staff were very friendly. As for Marathon Day, the hotel had shuttles for the runners to Boson Common quite early, and was no problem. Also shuttles all day back and forth for the rest to Copley Square and back. It was a good set up. We ate at least one breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel. All were good, and the service was good, but it is rather expensive. The bar/lounge area is comfortable, and the hot tub/pool area was great. Would i stay here again? Yes, if i'm driving around siteseeing around the Boston area. No, if I'm planning on doing things in town. Too many other hotels are nearer to the T, or within walking distance of the major areas in town.", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cGood, but get the right room\u201d", "Author": "Andrew_and_Kate", "ReviewID": "UR61807044", "Content": "Good, clean hotel.

With the property's proximity to Harvard and MIT, it was clear they have quite a few related events, thus the quality of the common and group areas appears higher than most Double Tree hotels we have experienced. We were disappointed with the cleanliness of our bathroom. Too much dirt and dust and foreign hairs for our taste, but we always examine the bathrooms very closely when we evaluate a room. Another slight disappointment was the parking fee. We understand they need to pay for the nice garage structure, but we thought $25/day was a little high for a hotel that is not in town. It would certainly be even more at a downtown hotel, but $15/night would have been okay with us. While it may be possible to get a view that isn't great, our view of the river and MIT was outstanding. There were rowers every day, and that added to the feeling of the area. Given the property is a bit removed from downtown Boston and Harvard Square, the shuttle is a very nice service. It is regular, on demand and costs nothing.

It is their policy to charge their guest for a minimum of $25 for a full day of parking while non-guests who use the parking structure for 8 hours can pay only $10.

The Double Tree Cambridge, (located in Cambridge obviousely hence the name) and has beautiful views of Harvard and the Charles River. I saw a review where someone wrote the property was isolated- I have no idea why that was written because the hotel is just across the small bridge from shops and restaurants and even provides a free shuttle service to/from atttractions across the city. It seems centrally located to me. Oh, and btw- its an 8 minute ride to Logan airport (do not stay at the airport, YIKES). The property is beautifully maintained and was recently renovated with a modern feel. On the top floor of the hotel are bi-level suites; the space and the views are incredible. The room features floor to ceiling windows (20 feet high) with 2 bathrooms, a kitchen and a loft bedroom. How can you go wrong. The hotel also has other great features: Free business center, full-service restaurant and seperate bar, the world famous Schullers Jazz Club and large meetings spaces for weddings, family reunions and large conferences. The hotel can also host small meeting like mine (15 people) where you are given the same attention as a conference of 200.

However, its isolation makes it a challenge. The hotel itself was nicer than I expected, with a renovated lobby and a respected local jazz club in the atrium. The small gym was surprisingly well-equipped and just down the hall were two coin-operated washers and dryers--a great idea. Great little salt-water pool and hot tub. Room service menu was extensive and available until 3 am, and the breakfast buffet, while a little pricey at $17, was good. The Hotwire rate is pretty good for expensive Boston, but Hotwire customers may be a little surprised with what they get -- my room, while well-appointed, was the smallest one on the floor, barely half the size of the other \"suite\" style rooms. Doubletree are being a little sneaky, giving Hotwire customers the \"runts\" of the litter. Thankfully it didn't matter to me as a single traveler, but a couple might find it a bit cramped. While the hotel's location next to the Charles River across from Cambridge makes for lovely views of the river (if you're lucky), it's extremely isolated. Across the river you'll find a Whole Foods and a Rite Aid, and jogging/biking trails line the river, but car-free travelers will have to buck up and learn the bus route to the Red Line, because there is nothing, and I mean nothing, within walking distance, other than some sort of train depot and a Harvard lab building, and lots of multi-lane roads.

We selected this property because of its relative proximity to Harvard taking into consideration what other posters on this site have cited about its isolation. We thought that the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shuttle to/from Harvard Square would offset this disadvantage. Certainly one of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets is its view of the Charles River. Ours was a bi-level suite on the top floor facing the river. We never tired of watching the sculls glide past. This positive, however, could not possibly overcome the host of negatives we encountered with service. It began the moment we arrived with the frosty reception at the front desk. We should have known what was to come when we were greeted more as interlopers than guests. Other dealings with the front desk during our stay were equally borderline rude. Our breakfasts, though, are the source of the biggest horror stories. The restaurant staff enjoys engaging guests, that is, if you consider arguing a form of engagement. The first morning I went to the buffet to order an omelet. After looking at the list of possible ingredients I request a spinach omelet. The cook says he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make one. I point to the list and tell him that it says he can. He argues that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m wrong so I walk away sans omelet. Day 2 arrives and I know omelets are a lost cause so I decide they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mess up cereal. I go to the buffet for a box of cereal, but there are no bowls. The hostess is the only staffer I can find so I inform her of my need. She tells me the bowls are on the left-hand side of the buffet. I explain that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where I looked, and there are no bowls there. She counters that I did not look hard enough. In a stern tone I said I need a bowl. With a scowl she goes into the back returning with six bowls. What was priceless was her look of utter surprise when she got to the buffet and realized there actually were no bowls. One other thing about breakfast, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to get more than one cup of coffee. On Day 1 we were promptly poured a cup when we sat down for breakfast. When we got up from the table 30 minutes later that was still the only cup of coffee we received. Day 2 was even more galling. We had the same waiter as Day 1 (short guy with white hair) so our expectations were tempered when we sat down and got our first cup. After 30 minutes the waiter comes up to our table with a pot, peers down at our empty cups then turns on his heels walking away with the pot. What happened on Day 3? We took a cab to Cambridge for breakfast. Apparently the acute coffee shortage has not struck there allowing us to enjoy several refills.

We had to call housekeeping to bring toilet paper since we ran out. The hotel has a swimming pool and good-sized exercise facilities. The location was okay. It was a 20 min. walk from the Central stop (Red LIne train). You can also take the 64 bus, which stops across the street from the hotel, but it runs every 30 min. to 1 hour depending on the time of the day. Make sure you arrive early to take the free hotel shuttle. You are supposed to make reservations but there were people who got on without reservations and some people had to wait for the next shuttle.

Why would I give it a less-than-perfect rating you ask? One word: location. The hotel itself was quite nice. Very clean, accomodating/helpful staff, and welcomed accomodations. The price for the room wasn't as good of a deal as initially thought though. Booked the room in advance for $80/night, compared to a regular $120. However, the special rates apply to non-suites, which are smaller-than-average rooms that are typically near the elevators. Foot traffic wasn't extremely noticeable, but there were random occassions over the extended weekend where we were woken up by people coming back in for the night. Check-in was a breeze, and the staff was helpful. Didn't balk when we arrived a couple of hours before check-in time, and even offered us a room on a higher floor due to a performance at the jazz club that night. Check-out went just a smooth, and the hotel did not mind when we left the car in their garage for a few extra hours. Two other small quips are that the TV was a small set, and housekeeping comes EARLY (8:30am on Saturday morning), so make sure to put the knob hanger out the night before. Now, onto the 'location'. The hotel sits right off an exit from the Mass Pike, which makes it easy enough to get to. That's where the travel ease ends, though. The hotel is not close to any public transportation. The closest T stop is Harvard Square in Cambridge, which is a $7 dollar cab ride away. However, that requires you to travel through Cambridge on the T before you get back into Boston. The hotel does offer a free semi-hourly shuttle to here, and other destinations w/in Boston, but it was rarely on-time and it was hard to line up the schedules with our own. Its service also ends early in the evening (schedule says 9pm, but we found it to be closer to 8-8:30). You can request a shuttle at a specific time within the designated operation hours, but you need to give at least 2 hours advanced notice. In light of all of these issues, cabs become your best friend during the stay, but they get very expensive very quickly. You can get to just about anywhere west of Rt. 93 for $20 or less, but the frequency of needing a cab adds up. The cab drivers are well aware of the hotel's ill-fated location, so there will be a bevy of them sitting in wait in the hotel's circular drive. Parking is also a compound expense, charging $20/night in the garage. A little ridiculous, but actually comparable to most private garages in the city. In all, the hotel does what it can to make its location less of an issue, and otherwise it is a very nice hotel. However, if you are a person who is more budget-aware than most, you may want to keep looking as you consider the 'unstated' expenses of staying here.", "Date": "February 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cNice and clean\u201d", "Author": "Buchba", "ReviewID": "UR6310628", "Content": "Came to Boston from Providence late at night.

I had nothing but good experiences with the hotel, my room, and the staff. I was on the 9th floor with a great view of the river. Hands down, if I had a car with me, this would be my hotel of choice in Boston. Problem was, I had no car. I booked this hotel through Priceline, which I will hesitate to do in the future. This hotel is not in Cambridge, but in Allston, MA. It is a solid 15 minute walk from the nearest T stop (Central), or $7 cab ride. Its a $20 cab ride to downtown. This added up to a significant expense over my trip, and a lot of wasted travel time getting where I wanted to go. Yes, there is a shuttle and the drivers are super nice, but it doesn't run continuously or late. There is a Whole Foods market about 5 minutes away and it was nice to go there and get food, but you do have to cross that intersection that others have mentioned. When I was reading reviews on here before my trip, I was like \"What's the big deal about crossing a busy intersection?\" After seeing it, I feel like I could write a book about it! Its the busiest intersection I've ever seen, with multiple highways all converging in one spot. I would look out my window in awe at that intersection. Its not easy to cross either....seriously, I guess you have to see it to believe it. Anyway, none of that should reflect on the hotel. It was a completely positive hotel experience. I have no complaints, just be wary of Priceline if you don't have a car.

During our stay, the hotel was full of Clemson University fans who were playing Boston College in football. The bar was completely full of fans after their game, but the staff handled each and every customer in a timely and courteous fashion. We also appreciated the friendliness of the staff. The shuttle mentioned frequently in these reviews was very helpful; we were dropped off on separate days at Faneuil Hall and in Havard Square and promptly picked up when reaquested. The one time that we did not take the shuttle back to the hotel, we rode the T Red Line getting off at the stop between Havard and MIT - Central I think. We then took a cab back to the hotel for a little over $5.00. I would strongly recommend staying at this hotel as the price was right and was really first class in every way with a concierge that was a big help with directions.

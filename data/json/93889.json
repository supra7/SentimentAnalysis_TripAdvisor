They transferred me twice to front desk and nobody answered the phone. The carpet was dirty. The TV is actually all the way on the left side of the bed, so you can't really watch TV. The carpet was dirty. There is a mirror right in front of the toilet. so every time you sit on the toilet, it's so unpleasant to see yourself doing number one or number two. Awful!! Also, there are Grand Tremont and Tremont Plaza Hotel (which is in the same building) but different entrance and it's very inconvienient to stay at one place and then go to a different place for conference or wedding. Lastly, I got food poison from eating the food there.

I used to live in Baltimore so I am familiar with the city and hadn't heard much about this hotel. I wasn't expecting much, judging from the chaos we experienced at check-in. There was a wait to even pull into the line to wait in line for valet parking, and inside things weren't much better. However, once we cleared the first floor, things were much much better (and stayed that way). We could see the entire harbor and more from our 31st floor room. Room was spacious, clean, and came with free wifi and bottled water. No strange smells, which as a frequent traveler I always brace myself for. Everything in the room worked. There were several weddings going on so we heard people coming back to their rooms at midnight or so but nothing too awful. The next day, we found that all the wedding guests were abuzz about the comfie sheets and beds! We loved the deli downstairs. Valet guys were great, as we were in and out. Front desk staff were very helpful. Full grocery store around the corner. At check out, staff gave me a print out with custom directions. Location is very convenient - you can walk south to the harbor (we walked to the National Aquarium) or north to the hip shops/cafes in Mt. Vernon. If you're not a walker, they offer a free shuttle service pretty much anywhere you'd want to go within the city (Fell's Point, Inner Harbor, etc.). Minor complaint - at one point two out of four elevators were down, but it was repaired quickly. And as I mentioned, check in area is small and can get crowded. Bottom line - we'd stay again.

We held our buffet dinner party for 45 guests in the Edinburgh Room which is designed to look like a room in Roslyn Castle in Scotland, I was told. Each room in the venue is decorated differently and reflects the Masonic influence. The website provided good photos of each function room. The catering staff was excellent and I was very impressed with their responsiveness. I would say that initially I did not receive responses, and being from Hong Kong, I alerted the banquet staff to check with their IT Dept. which they did and they found it was a problem with their ISP, which threw all HK emails into a Trash box. Once this was fixed, communications became excellent. So if you are communicating from an overseas location, you may want to keep this in mind. We chose wines we wanted to have served and the Banquet Staff was able to find and order these wines for us. We received a lot of positive compliments on the Sextant Menu we chose, especially the chicken and the crab cakes. Our guests went back for seconds. There was very little food left over. The Banquet staff has a good selection of colors for tablecloths and napkins. The Banquet staff manager (Kathleen) with whom I worked was fabulous in offering suggestions for table decorations and I really appreciated her hard work. Her staff was excellent and always present when needed. They wrapped up all of the desserts for me as well as the cake to take home at the end of the night.

We had a one day pre-conference at the Tremont. It was fantastic. The hotel has the grandeur of the beautiful hotels of last century. It has been renovated and kept up to standard. The room was very comfortable (King bed, living area and kitchen with microwave oven). Nicely decorated and all high quality fixtures in the bathroom. Flat screen TV's in the bedroom and living room. The conference room was unbelievable, the Edinburgh Room. Looks like something out of the middle ages but elegant. The other conference rooms were similar. They set us up with a beautiful room one night for a reception of about 50 people. A tour of the hotel (a former Masonic Temple) was very interesting: thanks Alexis. There must be about 30 floors. I was on the 15th and the view was nice. Elevators were always available and seemed fast. The Deli attached to the reception area is worth mentioning. It is something out of the mid 90's. Very well done and nothing junkie. The ladies working there are tremendous and seem more like old neighbors than workers. Talkative and kind. The one I seemed to bump into the most has been there for over 30 years. The food and baked goods are made on site. (meatball sub was so good I had it a second time!) I didn't use the gym but probably should have. Location is convenient. 10 to 15 minute walk to the Inner Harbor, about the same to get to Camden Yard and the Orioles games. Cost us about 18 dollars for a game. More to eat there but the sandwiches in the ball park were humongous. Valet parking is $25 a day so be aware of that. It may be cheaper to park elsewhere but it is very convenient. Many restaurants in the area as well as shops. What really put this facility over the top is the pride and service that the entire staff displayed the entire time i was there. I've been to the Ritz and it's comparable. Not as fancy, but the pride factor is right there.

Since I was travelling alone with two kids (10 and 4), it was important to feel safe, save money, and get around to see sights easily. The Tremont was perfect for all these things. I found on their website a deal that included valet parking, a free drink each evening, and $15 credit each day in the deli. When we arrived, we had a little difficulty locating the hotel, but we were given directions by someone around the corner. We were welcomed by the valet and the front desk staff; both were very friendly and helpful. We had a room on the 21st floor, and we found it to be quiet, comfortable (each bed had 9 pillows!), and very clean. The kitchenette (with a fridge, toaster, sink, glassware, and utensils) was very convenient, and the complimentary bottled water was a nice touch. The dressing area with an oversized safe was nice. I had no problems accessing the Internet from our room. The sitting area was comfortable. The bathroom was a little small but comfortable enough, and the freebies were nice. The housekeeping staff was friendly. She even remembered my daughter's stuffed monkey's name and greeted her the next day. With the $15 credit, I was able to get dinner for the three of us from the deli the first night (with a little left over for milk to keep in the fridge). The deli has a good selection of items, including microwave dinners, snacks, wine, sodas, salads, pastries, candy, and lots more. On our full day in Baltimore, we went downstairs to find the shuttle driver ready and eager to take us to the Inner Harbor. The aquarium was celebrating their 30th anniversary, so there were lots of things going in the Inner Harbor. When we were finished exploring, we called the hotel and they sent the shuttle driver to pick us up. We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant that night (to use my free drink vouchers). I had the grilled caesar salad and the crabcake appetizer for dinner. Both were fabulous and more than enough to make a meal. My kids had mini cheeseburgers. The bread was hard as a rock, so the cook sent out regular loaf bread cut in circles for buns. It worked well enough, although it was disappointing for them. On our second day, a really nice shuttle driver took us to Poe's grave and gave directions for walking back (at my request). It was an easy walk, and we felt safe. There are a lot of homeless people on the streets of Baltimore, but even as a woman travelling alone with children, I didn't feel threatened at any time. Checkout was easy. The staff member who checked us out was not as friendly as the others we encountered, but I assumed it was because she was busy. Before we left, I used the second $15 deli voucher to buy a large salad and snacks/fruit for the road, which was very convenient. Everyone in the deli was exceptionally friendly and eager to please the customers.

We usually stay for 3-5 days and always have a great time. This year we had the great misfortune of being saddled with your hotel. For the last four weeks in dealing with reservation issues and now with getting my cash deposit back, your staff have done nothing helpful. I have been given the run around, had charges mistakenly placed against my account, and have been a told a different thing each time I try to resolve an issue. I have been nothing but patient but I am beginning to get frustrated. Over Otakon we were in rooms [redacted] and room [redacted]. We only used the parking for one car - in room [redacted] . However, when I went to check out room [redacted] on Sunday, I was told I could not have my deposit back as somebody had used my cash deposit of $50 to pay for parking. This seemed like another bogus charge (much like the one of $168 that was placed against my debit card on Wednesday night when we arrived) as nobody in the room *had driven to Baltimore or owned a car*. I tried talking to Shanae about it and she said, \"Sorry, there's nothing we can do.\" A follow up call on Monday night after we checked out of room [redacted] and were on our way home yielded similar results, along with refusal to let me speak to a manager. Finally, later in the week, Ermonate checked into it, said I would likely get my money back, and promised me a return call within 24 hours. No call came. No attempts to follow up have yielded results. I have been put on hold, transfered to offices that can't help (such as Sales or Security) and been denied all attempts to speak to management about this issue. One gentleman said he would have a manager call me back by six the next evening but of course, that never happened. Never before have I stayed in a hotel that has had such unprofessional and unhelpful staff. I am deeply upset by how I have been treated over the last month. We are letting all Otakon attendees know about the behavior of your staff and the disappointments involved in dealing with them. It should not take two weeks of constantly getting the run-around to resolve a simple issue over a deposit. I would like a call back from management as soon as possible to resolve this issue before I am forced to write in to traveler's magazines and the like to see if they can provide any assistance. I am tired of dealing with your staff and would just like this issue to be dealt with. I'm sure $50 seems like very little to a hotel that most likely does such great business, but it's a lot to me. That's my gas money for this month and making ends meet without it has been difficult.\" If you're looking for a hotel with helpful and knowledgeable staff, this is not the hotel for you!

We drove in late afternoon, and had a pleasant and easy check-in. The room was a very nice, large suite. Really, more like an actual apartment than most of the suite rooms one gets nowadays. A small bedroom, bathroom, decent sized living room with an actual dining area, and a reasonably sized kitchen. The kitchen had a small fridge, reasonable selection of utensils and dishes. The room was clean and nicely furnished, with a fold out bed in the living room that was quite comforable. Very nice, comfortable bed in the bedroom. The wireless internet was free, and worked quite well. Adjacent to the lobby is a convenience store that sells a lot of the usual things, but also had some nice looking pastries and cakes, and a reasonable selection of beer and wine. Prices were room service like, however. Typically we would have stayed at one of the big chain suite hotels closer to the Inner Harbor, but they were either completely booked up or charging extremely high prices, so we went with the Tremont Plaza. The room and hotel were nice, but it was a bit further afield than I would like. The recommended Google Maps walk from the hotel to the Children's Museum took us right through the red light district -- that was a bit awkward! This was not the Tremont Plaza's fault, but it says something about staying in a more downtown location away from the Inner Harbor. The neighborhood wasn't that bad, even the red light district, but there were definitely some very seedy elements around. The aquarium was probably only a 15 minute walk away, but for a number of reasons we decided to check out early on Sunday morning, drive down to the aquarium and park, and then enter the aquarium when it opened at 9. The main motivation was being able to leave to go home directly from our time at the aquarium. It worked out well, and that early the crowds were not that bad. In summary, the room was considerably nicer than what you would get at one of the chain suite hotels closer to the Inner Harbor, and probably a bit cheaper, but next time I will probably try to book earlier and stay at one of the chain places.

The rooms have been updated and bed is unbelievably comfortable...the bathrooms have been redone and I have been told that they are going to refinish the tiling in each of the bathrooms - which will be very nice as the bath shower area is a fibreglass insert. I did see the updated bathroom in another room and they will be lovely once they are finished. The restaurant, Tugs had really very good food, but the service was lacking. There was not that many people and it took a long time to get lunch or even sweetner for our iced teas....I think once they tighten up on the restaurant service they will have a winning place to eat at. The front desk staff was very accomodating and very helpful. They were able to point me in the right direction for an offsite dinner and their recommendation was on-target. The area that this is in is definately \"downtown\" and I did have an issue with a panhandler that was particularly \"persistent\" and the bell staff took care of after it was made mention of it to them. The meeting rooms are really beautiful and historic - the only downside (which is really not much of a problem - depending on your group) that you have to walk to a different building via a hallway on the 5th floor.

I won't waste time reviewing the room, amenities, etc., since my reason for this review falls under \"OTHER\". #1. I used the hotel's valet parking during my stay. There were days at a time that I didn't use my car because transportation was provided to and from class. One particular day I did get my car and found that the shade to my panaramic roof was broken. I NEVER had this problem, and the shade was stuck in a position that I didn't leave it in. Apparently, the employee that parked my car decided to explore. He didn't realize that the shade works by remote, not by pulling. Anyway, I reported this to the \"manager\", and was told, \"we only hire honest and professional employees\". Needless to say, I was insulted. I was then interrogated by the \"head of security\", who proceeded to tell me how many fancy cars HE has. He also found it necessary to inform me of other \"luxury\" cars that come through? Please Note: I informed the staff that I was not seeking any damages. My car is under warranty and I was certain that I wouldn't be charged to have it repaired. I was able to speak to another manager who spoke to me in a more appropriate and professional way. #2. After departing for home, I noticed that my radio sounded a bit harsh. After going into my audio settings I noticed that my base volume was turned to 10+ (I had everything set to the middle setting). This may not sound like much of any issue, however, it was more confirmation that someone was having a great time exploring and experimenting in MY personal vehicle. I called and left a message for the manager since I felt strongly that she should revisit speaking with the staff. To date, I've never even received a call back. #3. During the remainder of my stay, some of the staff, including the first manager that I spoke with, was very smug to me. I felt as if I'd done something wrong by reporting what happened. It's not like I was asking for any compensation. #4. Another trainee reported her necklace stolen from her nightstand drawer during our stay. I don't know the outcome to date, however, as of the time we departed, nothing had been done. I am a regular on Trip Advisor and I plan many of my vacations, business trips, etc., based on reviews, good and bad. Besides fluffy mattresses, good food, indoor pools, etc., being treated with professonalism and respect is extremely important to me. Also, I think it's a shame that untrained, unprofessional, and untrustworthy employees, can make an otherwise nice place, a place of NO RETURN. What I endured was unacceptable and I hope there's improvement in the staff going forward. PS: There were several really nice employees like Damian, Lakia (restaurant), and the bartender (sorry I forgot his name).

I traveled with my husband, and our 3 children, ages 15, 6 and 4. This was one of the few hotels that I could find downtown that would accommodate 5 people in one room, AND provided queen beds instead of doubles. Check-in had a long line due to a wedding that night, but it moved very quickly, and the employee at the desk was efficient and polite. We got a room on the 30th floor with 2 queens, and our requested rollaway was at the door within minutes. We had a lovely view of the city, and we were very happy to discover that the windows actually opened. This was especially helpful since the room was VERY warm despite turning the thermostat all the way down. The kitchenette was a nice surprise. Bedding was some of the nicest I've slept on, and the down pillows were excellent. All the furniture seemed to be new, and the swiveling flat screen TV was a hit with our kids. We only encountered a few problems (in addition to the room temperature). The rollaway bed that we requested (for an additional $20 per night) came with only a bottom sheet, which was stained. When we opened up the blanket folded in the closet, crumbs spilled out along with a white pill! We called to have it and the stained sheet replaced, and housekeeping took care of it quickly. Another small problem was because of the VERY thin walls. I was awakened at 3:00 am by the extremely rude and obnoxious sorority girls in the room next door to us. They must have been in their kitchen, because it literally sonded like they were right in ours. I'm not sure why the hotel would place a family with 3 children (2 of them quite young) next to a group of partying teenagers. If we had been staying for more than 1 night, I would have asked to be moved. My last complaint has to do with Tugs Bar and Grill. We went for breakfast on Sunday, and it seemed like the staff had all been hired the day before. Everyone was very nice, but nobody knew what they were doing. The waitress gave my 3 and 6 year old water in a glass goblet, and when we asked for a child cup, we received DOF glasses from the bar! We finally got a bus boy to get us a cardboard cup with a lid...probably from the convenience store. My husband's eggs benedict came without the advertised asparagus, and my son's over easy eggs were cooked solid. Overall, I was pleased with our stay and what we paid.

Great proximity to John's Hopkins Hospital with a shuttle. The room was very comfortable clean and very roomy, with a good location to a Walgreens and a grocery store 2 blocks away. My mom was in John's Hopkins my sister was there to stay with my mother and she ended up in a car accident and had to go to the hospital. I was in another state at the time so I had to arrange a place for my sister to stay while she recovered from her car accident and was close enough to see our mom. After a quick review of places from The John's Hopkins website and trip advisor I called Tremont and spoke with Joann and explained everything that was going on and that I needed a room for my sister asap. The next day I arrived in Baltimore and I was very pleased at the room condition, cleanliness and the size. This is a great place for patients and visitors of John's Hopkins to stay or even if you are just visiting Baltimore. My sister rested comfortably and safely and was able to visit John's Hopkins daily. I also want to say thank you to the lady bartender at the hotel my sister would talk to when she went to get some food and a drink, you were great as well.

We got a special $99 rate for their studio suite and felt that was a really good value for the room. The studio suite was pretty large with 2 double size beds, a HUGE walk in closet that led to the very small, ventless bathroom. There was also a small kitchenette area that was enclosed. The walk in closet was larger than the kitchenette. The kitchenette had a small fridge (something was off with it because it froze all my drinks but still handy to have), a microwave, sink and coffee maker. There were also 2 sets of plates, bowls, mugs, glasses and silverware which were very convenient with the kids because we had our own breakfast in the room. Housekeeping cleaned the dirty dishes as part of their daily service. The bathroom was what i'd call serviceable. It was small, old and ventless and the towels were thin. My parents room's kitchenette was twice the size of mine (they were in room 2704 and i was in room 2707). So i think the 04 room line may be larger. There are 2 restaurants in the hotel. A full service one and a deli. The full service one (Tugs I think it was called) we went once for breakfast and did not return because the food was pretty lame. The deli wasn't that great either, but very convenient and reasonably priced if you want deli sandwiches. Overall customer service was good. They had several other functions there during my stay, so it seems pretty popular. Plus they are undergoing room renovations, which is needed because the carpeting was worn and stained in some spots and both the kitchen and baths need sprucing up. Although for $99/night, it was a good value and a decent stay. The self service parking garage next door was reasonable as well. We kept our car parked for the whole 4 days we were there.

We decided to stay overnight because we were attending the Otakon convention at the Balt. Convention Center (BCC). btw, Otakon is a convention for people who love Japan and the Japanese version of animation called ANIME. Good points: Friendly staff Relatively close walking distance to BCC On the free commuter circular (bus line) to BCC and inner harbor Very good gym and sauna on premises If you arrive early they will store your bags until your room is ready Mixed points A pool on premises - is complimentary but it's small and could probably only fit about 6 swimmers at one time. Also, it's located on the 4th floor to close to the street noise, which unfortunately includes lots of sirens The room - nice but old. Ours included a kitchenette. The toilet ran constantly and the shower was slow to drain. There were 2 doors between the bathroom and the sleeping area, so shutting both eliminated the noise. We were on the 24th floor and could still hear the sirens. I also thought the room needed another set of drawers as the was only one with 2 drawers. The beds were ok. Extras - The full breakfast is very good with generous portions, but not normally included with your stay; our price included 2 breakfasts per day. We paid $10 for our 3rd person which I guess is about average for Inner Harbor Baltimore. Valet parking is not normally included, but was in our price and the service was very good. The management has no problem in letting you know that if you don't want to pay for their parking, there is public parking available at a much lower rate and right next to the hotel. There's also a free shuttle available with first priority given to those guests who are either patients or relatives of patients of Johns Hopkins Hospital. I think they had in-room computer access, we saw a box of some kind and could only guess that it was for laptops since we didn't bring ours. The Bad: Housekeeping was slow to respond (an hour after our 1st request) and our towels weren't changed. We called about the running toilet immediately and again after we returned and it was never addressed. Since shutting the doors eliminated the noise we didn't call again. In the end: I would recommend this hotel on a conditional basis depending on what the person wants in a hotel room.

Quite spacious for a family of three, even four.

I cannot recall a more satisfying experience in an urban hotel than our stay at the Tremont Plaza Hotel. The hotel presented an excellent appearance upon our arrival. I admire a polished air, even more so on a Sunday evening. Staff was gracious and intelligent! Booking was just as it should be with our request for a \"quiet\" room on an upper floor well-accommodated. A special delight was the resort-style \"pantry\" making light refreshments available. The room itself was detailed and fulfilled every expectation and more, which demonstrates to me a genuine respect for the lodger. It was everything a suite has come to mean to the traveler - very roomy living areas with separate spaces for business and sleep The bed and bath were nothing short of superb. One more point: we paid almost twice as much the next night at a local \"big-box\" hotel that was recommended to us by our business contact and did not receive one-half the service and comfort we experienced at the Tremont Plaza Hotel.

But we enjoyed our stay, and particularly, the jazz at Tug\u2019s restaurant on Friday night. It is not actually in the restaurant but in a conference room across from the restaurant. The band was excellent and the drinks were reasonable. They serve food also. I would definitely recommend doing this if you enjoy jazz \u2013 the place was packed!

I almost didn\u2019t go back, even though I thought the food was good all three times. I decided to try it again because it is so convenient and the second and third times, the service was fine, so the person on the first day must have just been having a bad day or something.

Anyone who has ever had a baby who doesn't sleep very well can imagine how great this was, especially when facing a 2-week hotel stay. A couple of days into our stay, we asked for a fan to provide white noise (we were waking the baby, the hotel was quiet) and they gave us the fan from behind the front desk. One day it was raining really hard and the girl at the front desk lent me her personal umbrella for the walk to the convention center. We also needed a ride to the aquarium, which they provided free of charge (though they prioritize those going to John Hopkins, as they should). My son dropped his pacifier in the lobby and the bellhop brought it back up to our room. The people in the deli knew us by name and were just wonderful to us. They arranged corporate passes for us to go to the aquarium, saving us a lot of money (these aren't always available).

While the wedding was fabulous, the hotel was anything but. We had to be moved from our first room because it looked like my three-year old daughter had been placed in charge of cleaning the bathroom. We tried calling down to the front desk but we quickly learned that the phones in the rooms are for decoration only -- no one who works at the hotel ever picks up. We should have just packed it in, but the convenience of being near the wedding encouraged us to stay. In retrospect, I would have rather hiked in each day on foot from Glen Burnie. As problems arose (and they arose often), the staff exhibited an exquisite combination of apathy, ineptness and laziness that was truly remarkable. For example, the wedding party had a hospitality suite. Despite being reminded repeatedly that the suite needed cups and ice for the guests, the cups and ice were omitted. After the suite filled with 40-50 thirsty guests all unable to drink anything, we called down numerous times asking for someone to hurry up with the cups and ice. Eventually, we improvised and got them ourselves. A staffer finally showed up over an hour after we first called and clearly didn't care whether the room was on fire, much less if we had ice or were having a pleasant experience. Rather than having a dedicated service elevator, the staff uses the guest elevators. Since the \"staff floor\" is 18 (out of 36), you are guaranteed to pick-up and drop-off staff members on every elevator ride. Don't be in a rish, because you will be late. I finally had it when I called for my car on check-out. Amazingly, someone answered when I hit the \"valet\" button on the phone. (I had temporarily forgotten where I was staying and believed the phone to be real). When I asked for my car, I was told that I had to present my ticket. I said, \"of course I'll present my ticket when I come down, but please pull my car out so its ready.\" I was told that couldn't be done without first presenting a ticket. WHAT IS THE PUROPSE OF CALLING THE VALET IF THEY WON'T GET YOUR CAR OUT FOR YOU? After waiting for three elevators that I couldn't get in because they were filled with staff members, I got down to the lobby 15 minutes later to retrieve my car. I could not drive away fast enough. Simply put, this hotel is poorly run and the staff (with the exception of the valets, who were all very nice) was incompetent and dismissive.

The next day, we requested a room with 2 beds, we were told nothing was available until 2 days later (although perhaps they could have re-assigned us a new room as people were checking out?). We endured this room for two nights. Afterward, we were given room 506, a two-room suite. It was quite spacious, however the main room had no furniture (other than the Murphy bed). While we could overlook this, the real problem was the raw-sewage smell from the bathroom. The toxic stench could be considered a safety hazard to anyone with respiratory problems or severe allergies. Additionally, there was a lack of window treatment! With nothing to block the streetlights, it was like trying to sleep in broad daylight. We reported our concerns to the Front Desk staff, they appeared indifferent. After speaking with a manager, Paul M. We were promptly assigned another room, #3105. Finally, this room was a nice, suitable room for four people, with 2 beds, and furniture. At least our last night would be restful. The noteworthy issues for this room: the TV turned off/on its own and no water/plumbing for 2 hours. Other than these matters regarding guest rooms, the actual meeting/banquet rooms are quite impressive. I would certainly want to host or attend an event in those rooms.

We had a super early flight on a Sunday, but we were not able to check into the room early. We were able to leave luggage and go off to explore the city. Upon return to the hotel around 2:00, we were still not able to check in..woman told us \"4:00.\" We did get our swim suits on and head up to the pool. The pool is the only big negative thing I have to say about the Tremont as there is a huge generator smoke stack right on the side of the pool and all you can smell is very strong diesel fumes. I couldn't take it and headed back to the lobby to wait. While waiting, I noticed that others were being checked in, so I headed back up to the desk. The same woman could only say, \"not until 4:00.\" I went back up to the desk after witnessiing yet another couple check in and this time a male took care of me....he said that others were being checked in because they had higher end rooms and that as rooms became available, they would let us know.....then he looked on the computer and found a room. I think it is probably becaused I booked the room via Hotwire and this is why we were made to wait. Can't understand why they want everyone piling up in the lobby until the 4:00 deadline! Oh well. I did get a nice room on the 22nd floor and was very pleased with it. We were called at 10:00 p.m. by management that night telling us that the 22nd and 23rd floors had been booked and interviews would be taking place for a couple of days with people waiting in the halls. They offered to move us at that time or the next a.m. We decided it would be best to move and we were upgraded to a beautiful one bedroom on the 35th floor with a great view.....and we were given vouchers for breakfast the next a.m. as well for our trouble. I thought management handled that very well and was much appreciative to be moved instead of the noise we would have encountered staying in the old room. The room itself was very clean and I never felt squeamish. The bed was unbelievably comfortable with down/feather mattress pad, down comforter and great pillows. Frankly I would have rather stayed in bed all weekend! The bathroom was huge with a double sink and included Gilcrest and Soames products. The little kitchenette area was clean as well. The plumbing was quiet in this room, but we did notice that it was much louder on the 22nd floor. As well, the water pressure was not so great on the 35th floor, but we had very hard water pressure on the 22nd. So, I think it is hit or miss with these two issues. Of note, we left money on the table for the maid after the first night and it was not touched. I had to leave a specific note for her so she would take it. Bravo! The hotel's restaurant for breakfast was very reasonably priced and the food was great. The waitress was very friendly. Enjoyed breakfast. There is a different happy hour offering at the bar each night. It's a nice place to have a night cap if you don't feeling like walking to the harbor. There is a grocery store right behind the hotel as well as a Starbuck's. We opted to walk about a mile to Whole Foods Market to get a few things. The only other issue that might bother some people is that the hotel is a bit of a walk to the inner harbor and surrounding Baltimore neighborhoods such as Little Italy, Fells Point and Federal Hill. We must have walked 15 miles in three days. There are homeless/bums all over the city and it seemed worse this year. You just can't avoid them. I didn't feel frightened walking back from the ball games, but if it were a random night with no others out there, we might have felt worried. The City really needs to address this problem. If you are in Baltimore on a Sunday, there is a great farmer's market only a few blocks from the hotel. You could easily have breakfast or lunch at this market. As well, we went to Attman's Deli on Lombard for incredible sandwiches, Nick's in Cross Street Market in Federal Hill for crab, Vaccarro's Bakery for cannolli's and finally Kali's Court in Fells Point for crab and Kali's is the only place that I wouldn't return to. Of note, we took public transportation from the airport. We bought tickets for the light rail, but found out that light rail doesn't run until 11:00 a.m. on Sunday. So, we jumped on a bus that happened to be there and took the bus into the city. We had a map from a previous trip and didn't have a problem walking and finding the hotel from where we got off on the bus. The closest light rail station is Lexington Market, but I would not use that station at night as the surrounding neighbor is not great. Upon returning to the airport at the end of our trip, while waiting at the Lexington Station in the a.m., a kid hopped up on drugs did approach us, but my better half is a big guy and scared him off.

We arrived at the hotel at 4pm, the check-in time that was on our reservation. I was the only person in the lobby upon arrival and the front desk person was on the phone. As I approached closer I overheard her conversation was of a very personal nature. I waited for around 10 minutes before the front desk clerk acknowledged my presence. She did not hang up the phone she just asked for my information and continued talking on the phone. She looked three times and then told me she was having a problem locating my reservation. She turned her back to me and said into the phone \" i have to go, this guy is trying to get in without a reservation\". At this point I started to become upset. She left the desk and returned with what i can only assume was a manager. Who did three or four key strokes and the suddenly I was in the computer. We were given our room keys and headed upstairs. the room was tired, carpet was dingy and the bathrooms was overall not very clean. that aside the kitchen area was fine for our needs. The first two days of our stay was pretty much without events or issues. Other than asking for towels and having to call three times to get them. On our third day we left for a day in Baltimore and when we returned 6 hours later the room was not serviced. I called the front desk to ask for the room to be serviced. the front desk person was extremely happy and said she would have someone come right up. About 45 minutes later an employee showed up and asked if they had come up yet. I told them no and they left. Needless to say they never showed. In the morning I called for towels and they were brought up. When we left this day I stopped at the desk to ask about getting the room serviced. I was assured it would be done and the manager apologized. When we returned to the room again about 6 hours later, the garbage was emptied but the beds were not made, no towels were changed and the carpet had what appeared to be water spilled on it by the door. I called down to get someone to come up and the same routine followed from the night before. At checkout, I asked to speak to the manager. When I spoke with the manager I explained all that happened, she was apologetic. She didnt seem suprised or shocked. She took my bill and came back with another one a few minutes later comping me one night stay. I have to say i was shocked that this hotel was this bad and the service was so poor.

Getting the Reservation: Recently I had a group stay at the Tremonts. We had four rooms reserved. From the beginning there were signs of trouble. When reserving the rooms, the staff was very rude. We also had a hard time getting a hold of anyone as the phone is not always picked up. Getting Into Our Rooms: After flying across the county from the West, I arrived with a group of 12 individuals (with kids). We arrived at the hotel at 6:30pm. Check in was at 3:00pm. When we arrived at the hotel we were informed that our rooms were not ready. They were changing their entire computer system and they were experiencing problems. Fine, we understood and waited in the lobby. We were told that \"any minute\" we would have our rooms. A few minutes turned into 1 hr and 30 minutes waiting in a lobby. Upon talking with the staff numerous times we were always told \"any minute.\" We were not the only ones. We were in a lobby of about 12 other individuals with the same issue. Even though our group was first, everyone else was issued rooms before us. Management had no comment as to why this occurred. When we were issued rooms, all the rooms were not the what we had requested. Management fought with me until I showed a printed receipt from their email confirmation. Up until then, I was told by the manager that he had given me what I had reserved. That conversation ended when proof was given. Again, no apologies. The Rooms: The rooms are great if you just need a clean bed for the night. The rooms are older. All of our plumbing (four rooms) were labeled backwards so beware. Having a stream of hot water hitting you while you think it is cold is not fun! We had to call plumbing on one room as the faucet handle fell off. They did come and \"fix\" the problem, but it broke 10 minutes later. Service: Overall the service here is poor. Internet is free here, but we didn't have a cable. We called down for a cable and told it was \"on its way\" although we never received it. This hotel is independently operated so the manager always has the final word. In our case, the manager was not helpful at all. Nothing was every done to our bill. In general nothing was done at all. The manager had ample time to satisfy our complaints as we made him aware upon check in and check out. We were very glad we only stayed here one night.

Professional, elegant, happy to be there, greeted everyone all the time with a smile, very helpful and accomodating. There was a fire alarm during our stay and I ended up walking out of the building with some of the employees. They all knew exactly where to go, stayed calm, answered questions, and acted professional even though they were left unsupervised for a few minutes while everyone gathered outside. I work for a hotel, and I would hope my staff acted in the same manner if this happened at my property. Fires happen, we all know that.

First off there is never any parking in Baltimore. Second, there is REALLY no parking during Otakon. I had the valet park my car, which was wonderful so I didn't drive around looking for parking that doesn't exist. The valets and the bellhops were very friendly and kind. I'm sad to say I can't say that for the front desk staff. I was ignored most of the time, and when I wasn't being ignored they were being snippy with me. Maybe it was because I was in my Otakon costume or something, but that shouldn't matter, my money is as green as the next guest's. Just for a little experiment I'd like to go back there one day dressed in my work suit and see how differently they treat me. I had my accounts compromised 2 weeks earlier, as such, my bank shut my cards off while the fraud investigation is going on. They are supposed to give me new card numbers, but boy did they pick the most horrible day to shut the old ones off. I used an old one the day before, and it worked, so I wasn't sure exactly when they were going to be turned off. Well, when I tried to check into my hotel, the people at the front desk were really rude about how the card was denied. Well, duh, it was turned off, I knew it was going to happen, I just didn't know when. So there was this whole fuss how they needed another card in case of incidental damages or something like that. The room was already paid for online, while my card still worked... but they wanted another one! So I had to call my mother up and have her fax over copies of HER credit card. It was a big hassle over nothing! The room was already paid for, I was all by myself, all the cash I had was for the convention. They were trying to get me to pay $310 in cash to them for the room I already paid for online! If you think a single, white female roams around in Baltimore with $310 in cash in her pockets you should think again. Though the city was very crowded, even at night, because of the convention. It was a lot safer than normal with so many people at all hours. I did not get hassled by anyone while I was walking back to this hotel in the middle of the night. For all the other women traveling alone out there... be aware of your surroundings all the time know how many people are around you at all times and if you notice any unusual activity (people who are parked next to your car's driver's side and not getting out of their car immediately), stick to the main roads that have street lamps, don't talk to anyone you don't have to, don't stop walking for any reason, don't give money to the beggars sleeping on the benches near the fountain, stay away from people who are talking to themselves, and don't go into any parking garages without an escort. Valet service can save your life... When I got back to the room, I noticed there was a bachelorette party in the room across the hall... they had taped a sign up on the door. They weren't that noisy, I was surprised. I was so tired I took a shower and fell asleep immediately. The bathroom was ok. The tub needed to be recaulked, though, but atleast it was clean. There was a tiny kitchenette in my room also, which was nice. They gave me free water bottles, and free coffee packets. I wish they would've given me more creamer and sugar though. I thought for sure I'd get a continental breakfast the next morning. Well, they do serve breakfast, but it's not for free, which defeats the purpose of a continental breakfast in my opinion. I think for $310 for one night I should've atleast gotten a muffin or something. But whatever, I bought some peanut butter crackers the day before from a gas station. I went down to see if they would hold my bags for me for the day, dressed normally in jeans and a t-shirt, it was kind of cute how they didn't ignore or act rude to me that day. In short, if I was to do it all over again, I'd mix the valet and bellhop service with the Days Inn right in front of the convention center.

I would often return with no indication that housekeeping had been there except for a hastily made up bed, and the toilet rim left up, or a big wad of toilet paper floating in the bowl. - They advertise Gilchrist & Soames toilitries, but even in the deluxe rooms you get two generic black plastic bottles -- \"Conditioning Shampoo\" and \"Moisurizing Lotion.\" They feature the Tremont logo and \"Made in China\". - Housekeeping doesn't take away dirty dishes, and there's no straightforward way of doing your own -- no dishsoap, dishtowel, sponge, etc. - The plumbing is VERY LOUD.

The separate bedroom in the deluxe rooms would allow for some privacy and space if you were traveling with someone else. It's not a place I would recommend for a romantic getaway.

Finally, I rate accommodations based on their relative value, meaning that a youth hostel has as much of an opportunity to earn a \"5 out of 5\" rating from me as does the most luxurious hotel on the planet, provided that it is in the top tier of its accommodation class (in my opinion, of course). Given those guidelines, the Tremont Plaza Hotel is a good choice for the price. In fact, most of the positive aspects of the hotel have already been covered in other reviews, so there\u2019s no sense in repeating them here. However, I would like to offer an alternative view to some of the negative comments I have read in some of the more recent reviews. First, unlike some other reviewers, I found the front desk staff, concierge, and housekeeping staff all very friendly and helpful. I was at the hotel for five days, and throughout my stay, day or night, weekday or weekend, all staff members were great. I received recommendations on restaurants, directions to a variety of places, and efficient calls for taxis. Very good. Second, the internet connection in my room was fine. They provide an Ethernet cable to connect your laptop if you don\u2019t have one (inside the desk drawer \u2013 wireless only in the deli and lounge areas downstairs), and the speed is more than adequate. It is certainly faster than dial-up, and comparable to many public high-speed connections. Since there are too many variables that can affect connection speed, I think it is unreasonable to conclude that the hotel\u2019s connection is the problem, at least solely. (By the way, the TV reception and variety of channels were fine, too). Third, I stayed on the 34th floor (of 37), and I had no issues with long elevator wait times, neither during peak nor non-peak times. The longest I waited was about 2 minutes, and that was only once, during a very busy business Friday morning. Otherwise, the elevators were very efficient. On a related note, one of my favorite aspects of the hotel is its floor layout. There are four adjacent elevators along the west wall of a long narrow hallway, with the rooms surrounding them. Since there are only nine rooms per floor, none is more than a few feet from the elevators, which is especially convenient if you have a lot of luggage or limited mobility. Equally, the limited number of rooms and foot traffic also keep rooms quiet despite their proximity to the elevators. Very good layout. Fourth, regarding the shower/bathroom, I had very hot water, good water pressure, and was provided excellent amenities. Speaking of which, the hotel also includes two 17 oz. (500 ml) complimentary bottles of water, along with tea, coffee, and the USA Today (weekdays only). There\u2019s also a convenience store (7-11) and two drug stores (Walgreen's and CVS) within a few blocks if you\u2019d like to buy additional items to store in your fridge during your stay. Fifth, one reviewer mentioned the hotel being \u201cuphill\u201d from the harbor. In the strictest sense, I suppose that is true, but it is a mild grade. Again, I realize we all have different opinions, but concern of the grade from the Inner Harbor to the hotel is NOT a reason not to stay here. On the contrary, if this particular slope is too steep for you, then you won\u2019t be doing much walking around town anyway. I guess that\u2019s about it. In closing, the only reason I do not give Tremont Plaza a 5 out of 5 is because of the immediate surroundings. While appearing to be safe, they still aren\u2019t the best. Beggars do appear here and there and there is a seedy strip club district a few blocks southeast of the hotel. However, if it\u2019s any consolation, they are the friendliest beggars I\u2019ve ever met(!) and there is no reason you\u2019d have to walk through the strip club area unless you chose to. In short, then, I felt perfectly comfortable, but I can imagine some folks (e.g., elderly couples or females traveling alone) may feel more vulnerable walking around at night (day time is an absolute non-issue). Other than that, I highly recommend the hotel.", "Date": "November 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cCheck your sheets!\u201d", "Author": "HotelShark", "ReviewID": "UR4066715", "Content": "I'm currently in room 3509 and debating whether to move rooms. I checked in this afternoon and was met by a very surly attendant whom I will only identify by her first initial, J who was very unhappy about moving me into a King non-smoking which was what I booked originally. I finally did get in later that afternoon but was dismayed by the condition of the bed. As a reference, I have been travelling for the past three months and have stayed at Westin's to Hampton Inn's so at this point, I know what the value for my room should be and this was just not what I expected from the Tremont St. Paul. I was here earlier this year in April and had a fab room and don't get me wrong, they have made some great renovations to the hotel. The pub's great and the hotel is close to the Inner Harbor as well as a good number of restaurants..May I suggest Mick O'Shea's? The root of my problem is housekeeping. My bed had clearly been slept in and whoever cleaned the room before I checked in had just pulled the blanket and cover over, fluffed the pillows, replaced the towels and declared the room ready for check in. It's 11pm right now and I have just replaced my sheets. I went down to the front desk to complain and at that pont was exhausted so I changed my sheets myself, had to call back down for fresh pillowcases. In the process of changing my sheets, I pulled back the coffee stained duvet. I just had the night housekeeping staff come in and they too were horrified by what they saw and promptly replaced it. I asked for a manager to come up but the front desk said no one was present and wouldn't I just prefer to move rooms. Ummm, no..I just changed the freaking bed. I'm not about to go though that again. I was at the Tremont E Pleasant last night and this hotel is a step up but they have had convention after convention after convention come through so I wonder if they are going to adjust their standards as such and have people pass through and get as much money as they can while they sacrifice their standards. I paid full price for my room. I will not be staying here again.

Despite the fact that not all reviews were completely favourable we were quite happy with our visit We booked a 1 room suite and it was absolutely huge! Also had a fridge and microwave which was useful. The deli on the ground floor was very helpful for \"stocking up\" on little items and beer etc. Had breakfast and a drink in \"Tugs\" restaurant,but not particularly impressed. It was an easy walk to the harbor and not too far to walk back. Unlike some other residents we saw the shuttle bus on quite a few occasions and actually used it to take us to the Amtrak station. We enjoyed our visit to Baltimore,especially the harbor area and the water taxi trip. It is a good way to get a feel for the city without taking a formal tour. We got a \"tour\" of the Washington monument area from a very friendly local resident with a good knowledge of the city,which we found very helpful. I agree with a previous posting that there aren't a great deal of bars,restaurants and delis etc in the immediate area around the hotel,but we didn't find that a great problem.", "Date": "October 22, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Tremont Plaza Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60811-d93889-Reviews-Tremont_Plaza_Hotel-Baltimore_Maryland.html", "Price": "$161 - $230*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">222 St Paul Place</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Baltimore</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MD</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">21202</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "93889", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/0e/20/0e20549c6674088d95b7c526e8b701168large.jpg"}}

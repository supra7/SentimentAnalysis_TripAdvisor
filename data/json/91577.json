The kitchen was clean-no complaints there and all dishes, pots, pans, cutlery was provided. Didn't use microwave but the full sized fridge and dishwasher were nice. The drawback was with the range. It worked but not efficiently. Took a really long time to cook on the stovetop and it was hard to tell at times if the thing was working. The knob was funky, we couldn't always tell if it was off or on and that didn't give a complete sense of security I didn't mention it until after our stay was over because the place was fully booked and there wouldn't have been anything for them to do. But, it did make us late one day when breakfast took a little too long to cook. Hopefully they will fix this since it's part of the \"residence\" package. The location is great.

However, I guess there is always a first. This is the first time I've ever stayed at a R.I. that was a studio room. One of the very reasons we prefer R.I. is because I usually wake up early and my husband is a night owl, so it is nice to have a separate den/bedroom so that we don't disturb each other. But this was one big room, with one TV that swiveled between the den and bedroom area. Additionally, the canal view for which we paid extra was disappointing. One of the things we always look forward to is the evening happy hour. But when we asked about it, the manager said that they had problems with the happy hour so eliminated it. And not that this should be any big deal but they rarely have cookies at the front desk, unlike at the other R.I.'s. I know it sounds like many petty things but when you add them all together, it just wasn't as fun of an experience as is usual at the R.I. The one thing that didn't disappoint was the breakfast - good as usual.", "Date": "August 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carmel, IN", "Title": "\u201cCookie-cutter suburban hotel dropped into the gorgeous canal area\u201d", "Author": "indianatrails", "ReviewID": "UR18245142", "Content": "The area surround this hotel is absolutely gorgeous.

We might as well have been on the freeway in the suburbs. There is no seating on the canal level or any other treatment or features to engage guests with the canal. The canal-facing rooms have no balconies, and the windows were very dirty. We wanted to open them but they could only be opened about 3 inches, not enough to get fresh air or the sounds of the nearby fountains. What we did hear were the blasts of the other guests' air conditioning units, which are mounted right outside the windows and partially blocking the view. This was a cookie-cutter hotel designed for the suburbs, parking lot and all. No personality or charm whatsoever. The staff was exceptionally pleasant, however.

Problems: The \"Canal\" which is billed as so scenic is drained, so it is an icy muddy trench now. The smell of the hotel is mildly unpleasant, probably due to its age. Definitely needs refurbishment. Rooms are a little worn & faded with cracks in the bathrooms. The breakfasts are just so-so and the happy hour food is prison grade- overcooked mac and cheese, runny tacos, and sloppy joes made from yesterdays tacos with very littlle meat and a big bowl of frozen & wilted iceburg lettuce and potato chips constitute the fine dining here. Oh, and there's a nacho cheese dispenser to remind you that this is the Midwest. Bad. I don't care if the food is free- don't eat it. I am paying a rate of $150 a night, too much for what you get. The indoor pool is shallow, & small and they use alot of strong chemicals in the hottub which burn your throat. The good news is, the pool seems almost always empty- gee I wonder why?

The hotel is typical of other Residence Inns in that it is set up suite style with a full kitchen, living area and separate bedroom. The bedroom did have a door but it isn't a typical door that closes all the way or locks so if you are adults traveling with other adults you may want a little more privacy. Plus, the one bathroom is only accessible by entering the bedroom. The living area has the pull out sofa for the kids and a 2nd tv which is handy but like most sofabeds it is not terribly large or comfortable. My kids did okay but would have liked more room. The kitchen is well equiped with all the utensils you might need and includes a fridge, microwave, stove and coffeemaker. They also include the coffee, tea and microwave popcorn. We ate out for lunch and were able to reheat the leftovers for dinner. The hotel offers a free breakfast buffet that consists of the usual continental items plus hot items like eggs, sausage, waffles, etc. The location of the property was perfect for our needs. We could walk (about 6 blocks or so) to the basketball game and it was a short (5 minute) drive to the Museum of Art. The girl at the front desk was super friendly and printed out the Mapquest directions to and from (there are many one way streets downtown so returning was different.) We had a room on the canal but as previously mentioned it was drained so it was ugly but we didn't really care about the view or lack there of. They do charge for parking but it was under 10 bucks and is the norm for downtown. We brought our laptop and there was free internet access in the room. I think I remember seeing a public computer in the lobby as well. Overall we had a nice stay. The hotel was clean and the staff friendly. The amenities were very convenient for family travel. The hotel is not 4 star resort but we weren't looking for that this time so we were very satisfied.

On our first stay in July 2005, we received a two-bedroom suite facing the canal on the lowest floor. The view was very nice, and we really enjoyed our stay. Coincidentally, we were given the same room for our second stay in October 2005 and had an equally excellent stay. For our third and fourth stays, in April and November 2006, we requested and received the same room again. We once again experienced no problems. Unfortunately, our fifth stay did not live up to expectations. Previously, the hotel had not charged for parking in its lot, but this must have recently changed, as it was now $12. Apparently, it is now open to the public for parking also. We were somewhat unhappy to be suddenly paying $12 for uncovered parking that wasn't even right downtown, but we were willing to live with it. What we weren't willing to live with was our treatment at the front desk upon check-in. We dealt with a woman named Connie. I couldn't honestly say Connie was outright rude; she pretended to be pleasant and came across as rather condescending. She proceeded to \"welcome\" us by very insincerely telling us she was sorry but we would be unable to stay in the room we'd requested. She then gave us another room but quickly switched us to yet another for some reason she did not impart to us. We realized as we set off toward the room that it would not be facing the canal and returned to the front desk to ask if such a room was available. Of course, Connie told us it was not. When we reached our room, my mom was surprised to find it was handicapped, as Connie had failed to mention it. She should've given us this information since the the kitchen table only seated two and one bathroom contained only a shower rather than a bathtub/shower. Luckily we were flexible and did not expect to seat more than two for a meal. Nevertheless, Connie must have been able to sense our earlier frustration because a small box of chocolates was promptly delivered to our door. While this was probably hotel policy, it seemed like a shallow and inadequate fix for her unwelcoming attitude. The room was pretty clean, with only a bit of food still stuck to the kitchen table. In fact, housekeeping was very good for the rest of our stay. However, we encountered a great number of gnats in our room, especially around our bathroom sinks. We hadn't left any windows open, so we had no idea where they came from. My mom also had to dispose of a large red spider in her bathroom. We assume that had crawled in from a door left open down the hall, but we really didn't know. In addition, my bedroom did not have an alarm clock, and we never received a calendar showing the planned meals or area events that had always been provided. Probably the worst part of our stay was our noisy upstairs neighbor. We think it was one person, but he or she sounded like a herd of elephants. Like all travelers, we're used to some noise from other rooms, but we were constantly in fear that this person would fall through the ceiling as he thundered above. Our neighbor was virtually always home when we were and seemed never to sit down but instead to stomp very, very loudly across the room hitting everything in sight. Sadly, we couldn't call the front desk because we were sure Connie would tell him that we, in our specific room number, were complaining. We had no further contact with the front desk after check-in and avoided even walking by it. We were able to drop our key cards in a slot as we left the parking lot. After having had great experiences with the staff and accommodations on four previous occasions, we could not have been more disappointed. I would no longer recommend the hotel to friends, and I'm not sure I'd stay there again myself. My mom says she'd probably stay there again but only if she knew for certain she could get a room with a canal view. My advice to travelers is to look further. I can only hope that Connie is no longer working at the hotel if you do stay there. On our way down the canal, we passed the windows of our requested room numerous times, and each time the curtains were partially open and no lights were on. This led us to suspect that the room was unoccupied, and Connie had simply decided not to honor our request for some strange reason. That probably sounds paranoid, but I've never encountered anyone quite like her in years of staying at Residence Inns.", "Date": "July 26, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Residence Inn Indianapolis Downtown on the Canal", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g37209-d91577-Reviews-Residence_Inn_Indianapolis_Downtown_on_the_Canal-Indianapolis_Indiana.html", "Price": "$175 - $257*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">350 W New York Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Indianapolis</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">IN</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">46202</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "91577", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/fb/1f/fb1f35bb54df8518635f3c727e13a8435large.jpg"}}

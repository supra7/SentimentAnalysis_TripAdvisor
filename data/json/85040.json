We booked to stay at this hotel for several days last week which was ideal for our purposes, being so close to Dadeland Mall . However upon arrival we were dismayed to discover that the hotel is being completely renovated, floor by floor. Even the lobby has large floor-to-ceiling sheets of plastic hanging down, behind which the workmen could be heard. The Reception desk is a long table, which was shifted around to accomodate yet another large sheet of plastic. And this is where breakfast is served, at a few small cramped tables situated between the sheets of plastic in the lobby. On the bright side, the breakfast was decent, and plentiful - bacon, sausages, cereal, fruit, waffles, yoghurt, pastries. You had to hurry though, before all the seating was taken up.Our room was newly renovated, but the floor was dirty ,the furniture was dusty, there was no telephone book in the room nor any sort of hotel / area information, nothing at all. When I requested that the manager ensure the room was properly cleaned the next day, he became argumentative and confrontational - most unpleasant and rude. I was bothering him, it seemed.The following morning a member of the housekeeping staff was in the hallway - she asked me if I would like the room cleaned! Obviously the message did not get through . When I returned to the room that afternoon, the room had been cleaned- somewhat- if you overlooked the still- dusty furniture and the dried dirty marks on the floor where it had been washed without benefit of sweeping first. It seems that because the renovations are taking place, cleaning is a hit-and-miss affair.As we were out most of each day we did not have to endure the surroundings nor the unfriendly manager or receptionist for any length of time. However we would have definitely stayed somewhere else if we had been informed of the building work. We will never return to this hotel.", "Date": "Apr 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR355797271", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "SunnyNow"}, {"Content": "Great location Very good location for shopping, close to the airport, not far from Coconut Grove and easy access to the Florida Keys and Florida Turnpike.

We had a couple of nights at the Ramada just before our return flight to the UK, we'd had pretty miserable experiences in the airport hotels at Miami in the past and decided to go a little further afield. In my opinion, this was ideal in terms of location (just off the interstate 1) and only 20 mins from the airport. You also have the delights of the Dadeland Mall within walking distance and we found it to be less busy, and noisy than the airport hotels. To be honest it's worth going there for the free breakfast alone, not just the usual continental style - but with hot items such as bacon, sausage patties and eggs as well. With the exception of the food court in the mall and a surprisingly good chinese in the smaller mall directly opposite the entrance , there isn't anywhere to eat within walking distance.

This was the first hotel I stayed at in my 2 week visit to Florida, and I'm sorry to say it was the worst by a long way. Perhaps my expectations were too high having read the reviews on this site, but even so, at $150 per night, I expected better than this. The room I was given was very poor - the wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the curtains had holes in them, the bedcovers and sheets had cigarette burned holes in them, the fittings in the bathroom were utterly filthy, with thick layers of dust on the air vent and other fixtures, and the room was situated right beside a motorway off ramp, along which roared traffic all night long. When I spoke to reception about the traffic noise, I was first told I couldn't be moved because I had used the room. This was about an hour after I had checked in, and the time had not been spent using anything; rather it had been been spent sitting in a stunned miserable silence gazing at the third world 'comforts' of my room. The receptionist then appeared to change her mind, but then stated that I had one of the best rooms in the hotel, and that the other rooms I could be given would be even worse!Needless to say I moved hotels at the earliest opportunity.How this hotel gets such high reviews is utterly beyond me - the other Florida hotels I stayed in, just arriving off the street, were better, and only one had a higher nightly room rate than this one.My 2 star rating for this hotel is bordering on the generous side!", "Date": "Jan 18, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR152055811", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Safe, Clean, Good Deal I stayed at this hotel for one night while at a graduate school interview in Miami.

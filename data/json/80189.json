Having stayed here for a similar period in 2010 we were again not disappointed with our choice of San Diego or the hotel. We inadvertently booked a room without a fridge; however, the General Manager provided us with a fridge complimentary saving us $100+ which was a nice touch. The room was of a good size and standard, as before, with a powerful shower to match. The in-room safe managed to lock with our valuables in and refused to open; however, a call to reception brought the maintenance man who opened the safe and replaced the batteries within 10 minutes of calling! Ate at Adams Steak n Eggs (onsite) most mornings for breakfast and the food and service was superb as before. Ate at Albies Beef Inn (onsite) once \u2013 the food was ok but either the menu has changed or the range of choices was not as good as we remembered it! Pool was good, clean and warm; especially for mid-January. The only complaint this time was the location of the room. Last time we stayed in the block at the back of the property which runs parallel to the freeway and this seemed to have minimal road noise; however, this time we were located in one of the side blocks near the very front of the property which was very noisy at times from both the traffic and other inconsiderate guests!

We were given a room toward the back and we usually use earplugs anyway, so were not bothered by noise, except for a couple nights due to noisy neighbors above us. It was nice to have windows at both the front of the room and the back so we could enjoy a lot of natural light. The heated pool and huge hot tub were very clean and the decks provided a nice area to enjoy the beautiful weather. We chose not to pay extra for the micro/frig, but were happy to have use of them in the common area which also included a convenient, reasonably-priced laundry with comfortable lounge seating.

We were nervous after reading some reviews , but had a great deal for flight and lodging ( from MN) through Travelocity and decided it was worth any potential risk .

(note: There is also a small meeting room that had both a fridge and microwave that could be used by anyone in the motel ) We had an upstairs room , away from the road and never struggled with \"vehicle noise \" . Our room was large , clean , and well kept ...... the beds were very comfortable as were the pillows and the housekeeping was fantastic ..... we always had more coffee , towels , etc. We very much enjoyed the use of the large hot tub after a busy day exploring San Diego ..... never used the pool , but noted that it was cleaned each morning , had plenty of chairs for lounging ,etc. Another \"bonus \" of the Travelodge was the 2 restaurants and bar on site ..... there is a happy hour M-F that had drink specials and snacks ..... the bartenders are wonderful and fun to talk with ....in addition , we had the chance to enjoy the piano bar one evening ....... that was AMAZING ! We walked in as MN tourists and left feeling like part of a family ..... the piano player was fantastic both at the piano playing and the singing as well as including everyone in the bar to join in , sing along , etc...... FANTASTIC . We would be more than willing to return to this motel and are , in fact , working on getting another couple to join us for another San Diego / Travelodge vacation with us !

I should note that I am not the pickiest of people when it comes to motel/hotel rooms. As long as it is clean and safe, I'm basically happy. I stayed at this motel in a king bed room for 5 nights. The room seemed clean enough and I thought the bed was comfortable. Our room wasn't right next to the freeway, so the noise didn't bother me (I should mention that I am super sensitive to noise, so the fact that I didn't hear anything at all is impressive). The decor was basic motel decor--nothing I would decorate my house with, but not overly depressing or dated. The window in the bathroom was a little strange, but it never became a problem. I found the front desk staff to be very friendly and accomodating. We were able to buy Sea World tickets at the front desk, which saved us a long wait in line. This motel is also centrally located. We walked to the Fashion Valley mall for food and to catch the train to Old Town (which is definitely worth a look--very cute and great food choices!). It was about a mile, we just cut through the Town and Country Resort (where our conference was held). The only real negative to this motel was the pool. It wasn't heated and the hot tub was only luke warm. Pool seemed clean enough though. The best part of this motel is the breakfast restaurant, Adam's Steak and Eggs! Incredibly cheap--I never paid over $8 and on average only spent about $6. Fresh cream for coffee, everything tasted homemade, and the corn pancakes were the best I've ever had. I'm actually very picky about food (unlike motel rooms) and really, this was great food. The Pam-Pam restaurant up the street (connected to some other hotel, but I can't remember which) is also pretty decent for late night, standard \"American\" cuisine. All in all, the rooms are fine. They were cheap and suited our needs perfectly. Remember, this is a Travelodge, not a Hilton. Regardless of whether you stay at the motel or not, I would recommend Adam's for breakfast!", "Date": "July 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mission Viejo, California", "Title": "\u201cDissappointing doesn't begin to describe this place!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4995446", "Content": "The carpet was wet, the bathroom was dirty, the blankets had stains on them, the water in the bathroom sink was backed up and there were flys in the room.

I guess they give you what you pay for so in that respect alone, it's not \"terrible\". The place is in an excellent geographical location, again warranting better than \"terrible\", but pretty worn-out and didn't have a clean feel at all. The furniture is beat-up and dirty looking. The floor lamp had a stained shade. (How does this happen? Did a prior guest have a food or drink fight?) The lamp had obviously fallen over several times and the pole was bent and crooked. The front desk wasn't exactly inviting. The clerk at check-in obviously would have rather been anywhere but waiting on us. When we checked out in the morning, they had signs hand-written in blue marker all over the front windows warning people that there was no vacancy: \"No Vacancy, Means No Vacancy\", \"We have NO Singles, Doubles, or Even a Broom Closet!!\" The signs were rather terse and inconsiderately worded. I found them rather offensive. Based upon the signs alone, I would not return even with a reservation and I certainly wouldn't stay at another Travelodge if that is how they feel about their future guests; that they are a big bother. Maybe they should have invited the inquirers in to see if they could put them up at another Travelodge in the area. Instead, they were just chased away. The room appeared clean but upon closer inspection, it became obvious that it wasn't. We found used tissues between the bed headboard and the wall and found a piece of jewerly on the floor next to the bed. This leads one to believe that they don't vacume the carpet. If they had vacumed, they would have found the jewelery or at the very least sucked it up with the vacume cleaner. Therefore, I refused to walk anywhere without shoes. I began to wonder what else they didn't clean. Did they clean the bathtub, toilet or even wash the sheets? What kind of bacteria is growing in the swimming pool? The air conditioner vents were all broken and/or missing and the unit was so noisy and vibrated the window above it so badly that we couldn't even use it the first night. Since we were so hot the first night, I finally had to take the window screen out the second night and adjust the metal casement window in order to keep the rattling to a bearable level. In addition, the rental car bus storage facility directly behind our room spewed diesel fumes into the room when they warmed up the buses in the morning. The general noise level at the motel is also very disturbing. Constant loud talking, slamming of doors, and banging on the walls next door. We had a stranger knocking on our door in the middle of the night along with a phone call from another guest who couldn't figure out what room her friend was in. All-in-all, I wouldn't recommend this motel unless you don't care about cleanliness, noxious fumes or noise. However, if you are on a really, really tight budget, it might suit your needs.", "Date": "August 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "melbourne, FL", "Title": "\u201cgood and cheap\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2428316", "Content": "generally for a two star hotel, it was very nice. the rooms were clean. but don't let the bed bugs bite though. lots of parking space. the place was close to the nice spots in SD. the place was cheap for a weekend stay. always sold out.", "Date": "August 7, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Travelodge San Diego Mission Valley", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d80189-Reviews-Travelodge_San_Diego_Mission_Valley-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$64 - $140*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1201 Hotel Circle South</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92108</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "80189", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/38/7a/387a96a4f78690059cb5f7c1c29efda76large.jpg"}}

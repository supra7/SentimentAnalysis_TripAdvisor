We checked in with no problems at all, dropped our luggage off and left to go see the city. We actually didn't get a lot of time to see the property and its amenities but the staff were very helpful and the room was clean.

The hotel itself is quite nice, the lobby has a nice relaxing yet fun feel to it, and the rooms that I stayed in were very nice. The beds were very comfortable and adorned with nice white bedding. This last time we stayed in a one bedroom suite- which was really nice (marble in the bathrooms, nice furniture, comfy beds, mini bar). This Westin has a simplistic but high end feel to it. I have stayed a few other places in Chicago but I love the Westin Michigan Avenue because it is right on Magnificent Mile and close to a lot of attractions (Hancock tower is literally right across the street too). It is also very decently priced for a Magnificent Mile hotel. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning to visit Chicago.

Easy walk to the \"El\" trains as well. The room was on the small side, but very clean overall and nicely decorated. A problem with our air conditioning was fixed immediately. I was on the 15th floor at a conference rate, so it was somewhat cheaper - but better quality - than other conference-rate rooms I have had. We used the spa, which was of course overpriced, but the options and the service were great. See \"Corrine\" and check out the massage with the hot towels and optional scalp/foot therapy as well. Although overpriced, it was worth it. The fitness center also was well-supplied, had several machines, and had space every time I went by. Regarding the conference, I was not disappointed. The meeting spaces were the perfect temperature (They are usually too cold, even for a warmblooded person like me), and there were ample supplies. I was not a fan of the \"green\" aspect of the hotel, which offers you the option to eschew the daily cleaning of your room for a $5 voucher. NOT worth it!! Also, the lotion/shampoo/soap were not replaced until we had used them all. I like to conserve, but you do expect a fancy hotel to be, well, FANCY. We ate often in the Grill associated with the hotel. Food was good, but the whole place was way expensive. Expect to pay about twice the price of what you'd pay at home for a drink in a bar. We also used the mini-bar during our stay. It was never restocked. Just as well, but still... Also, the ice bucket was not clean upon arrival, nor was it ever emptied or cleaned afterward. I think the staff attentiveness is the \"downside\" of this hotel. Longish waits to check in and check out, and the area where you leave your bags after you check out (and before you leave for the airport) was not watched at all.

Having stayed in Westins prior to this, we were anticipating everything to be perfect; it was far from that. We reserved two rooms (Kings) and requested the rooms be either together or atleast near each other and that the have a view of Michigan Ave. The first of the two rooms was ready by the desigated check in time of 3:00; However the second room was not ready until 5:00! The first room assigned to us (1418) was unacceptable with paint peeling off the ceiling in the bathroom. This was not how I remember a quality Westin hotel. We were assigned a new room on the 15th floor; our friends were assigned a room on the 14th floor as we were told our request to have our rooms together could not be accommodated but they could offer us a late check out of 2PM. I will say as a concession, a bottle of Champagne was placed in their room which was a much appreciated gesture. When you say \"Westin\", you think \"Heavenly Bed\"...we had the very comfortable bed but we couldn't sleep because of all the chaos in the halls. Security had to be called to the room next to us for a loud disagreement and then 3am and 4am...loud and obnoxious \"guests\" in the hallways (aka drunk/rude people who show no respect for others)...I could hear other frustrated guests threatening to call Security. On another note, we were shocked by the way our vehice was driven in our presence...The valet drove our vehicle recklessly in the garage. I gasped watching him \"gun it\" in reverse; certain that he came within inches of hitting the wall.

The only bad thing at the hoteal is that they chrage for wireless. For parking you just need to drop your car in the same block where the hotel is located and they park it for you. When you need your car you need to dial an ext # and they bring your car. Depending on the time, it can take up to 20mins(especially when people check out after noon). I recommend this hotel.

For Gold and Patinum members, there is not a lounge offered at this hotel. Parking is $57 per day which is typical of other hotels right on Michigan avenue in downtown chicago and that cost is listed on their website if you look for it. It's just something to be aware of. There are also plenty of parking garages around the hotel and if you don't mind walking a few blocks you can park for $38 or so if you leave it parked and dont need it to get around. I feel this hotel completely relies on its location to keep people coming back. If you are looking for a luxury experience you will be disappointed and should choose another hotel.

I was very pleased with my choice as the room was clean, had comfortable beds, and offered a good workspace. My room also looked to have an updated bathroom and I was impressed with the spacious closet. Check-in and check-out were both speedy, and the front desk and bell staff were prompt, polite, and attentive. The location of this hotel is its strongest attribute, with a short walk, bus, or train ride to the heart of The Loop, and numerous retail and sightseeing destinations just outside its doors. While I did not have a lake view in my room, the view of Michigan Avenue in December was equally pleasing. That being said I did have some critical points. First, the room service menu was expensive even by downtown Chicago standards with numerous surcharges. The food was steakhouse fare and sounded good, but the restaurant was packed and I had arrived late at night after a long day of work and travel and would have preferred to relax with something light. Fortunately there are lots of restaurants within a few blocks so I took the opportunity to venture elsewhere. Second, I would have preferred free wi-fi in the hotel room. There was free wi-fi available in the lobby, but it was always crowded and did not offer any work spaces suitable for anything beyond checking email. They also took to piping loud pop Christmas music. I would recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a comfortable and basic stay in the Streeterville/Gold Coast area, but does not necessarily need the high levels of amenities or the glitz of a Four Seasons/Drake/Ritz Carlton as you spend more time on the town and less time in the room.

As a Starwood Member, you have several hotel choices when staying in downtown Chicago: Westin River North, Sheraton Chicago, W City Center, W Lakeshore, Four Points, and Termont Chicago. We have stayed in all of these SPG properties except the Termont (which is a newly acquired Starwood property). Overall, the Westin Michigan Avenue is a solid average hotel. It is your second best choice when staying at a Starwood property. Your best choice is the Westin River North. Here's some back-up information on our decision. Location - This hotel has the best location of any Starwood property in downtown. It is just steps from some of the best shopping in Chicago. Some of the higher rooms even have a lake view. Update Grades - As SPG Platinum Members, we have been upgraded during all of our stays. We were accommodated with wine, fresh fruit, and other amenities. This hotel treats their Starwood members very well. Clean and Well Maintained - Even though this property is older, it is clean and fresh. Rooms are updated and maid service is excellent. Rooms - We were given a suite with an adjoining bedroom during our recent stay. Large flat screen TV's and signature Westin bed were great. Starbuck's coffee and quick one cup coffee makers were handy. Refurbished gym was nice as it provided more options for tread mills, elliptical, and bikes plus free weights Hotel windows were older, leaked air and need replacement. Shower plumbing was noisy and water pressure was poor. We noticed their signature double headed shower heads no longer exist. Customer Service - Concierge was either not available or just not there. General phone service took several minutes to pick up. Bellmen seemed non attentive and not engaging with the guests. Please note it was Thanksgiving week which may have contributed to the less than noteworthy service. In summary, Chicago has some of the best hotels in the world. Unfortunately, if you're a loyal Starwood member, you have no luxury choices. No St Regis or Luxury Collection hotels exist. It time for Starwood to provide their members these options. We would like to suggest the conversion of the Westin Michigan Avenue as the first luxury SPG Hotel in the Downtown Chicago area.

Got worse. So after my guests arrived and an extremely confusing discussion with the front desk and valet, we were informed that self-park and valet were two completely different things owned by different companies. Which would have been fine, but by the time we learned this, there were cars backed behind us and we had virtually no option but to pay the $57/night valet. Further, I was told I'd get a better room the second night, and after calling to confirm in the morning, was informed that there was no other room available. So, yet another strike against them. We opt to grin and bear it. Finally, get back to the hotel later that night, and decide to shower - when dark brown water with black specks comes out of the spout. After calling the front desk, 30 minutes later an engineer shows up to tell us that they changed a pump and we can go ahead, as things were now \"fine\".

The elevators were a bit slow but it is a very large hotel so that was expected. The room was clean and comfortable although we did have an issue with the \"Green\" promotion going on where we chose to forego maid service in exchange for 500 Starpoints.

Also lots of large groups (including the Florida Marlins and dozens of foreign flight crews) were at the hotel so hopefully you don't get stuck checking-in behind these massive groups or convention-goers.

We called the front desk, and for the second time that evening, security came up to their room to speak with them. The security officer told our neighbors that we were the ones who complained. Our neighbors got revenge on us at 2:30 in the morning, by banging on our door and yelling. We called security for the third time, and the hotel offered us a new room, but at 2:30 in the morning, who wants to switch? After a night of no sleep and feeling very dissatisfied with the way the hotel handled the situation, we spoke to the manager (Shawn/Sean) at check out. The manager could not even look us in the eye, gave a simple apology, and did not care when we said we would never stay at this hotel again. I was shocked at how much he seemed not to care about what happened, despite the hotel mission statement of leaving guests feeling \"well-rested.\" I'm not sure where the people who work for this establishment were trained on customer service/security skills, but they failed miserably. We left feeling incredibly disappointed and angry with this hotel.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peoria", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and nice place to stay\u201d", "Author": "RunnerJess86", "ReviewID": "UR116668838", "Content": "This past winter was the second time my husband and I stayed at this property and loved it again. Growing up near Chicago and visiting frequently, I have stayed at MANY properties there, and this is one of my favorites. The location is great! I would definitely book a Michigan Ave. view room. I booked online through their website and got a great deal. I paid up front and got a two night stay on a weekend with a Michigan Ave. view PLUS parking for $170 total (parking is normally $50/day alone). I would highly suggest going on their website, as they usually have great online deals that you won't get through another website or by calling to book reservations. The lobby is nice and check-in was quick both times. One complaint I have is that I wish the concierge was around more/that they had more than one. We were there on a weekend and they disappeared after about 5:00 both nights. Plus, as there was only one, there is often a long line waiting to ask questions. We got just a standard room and it was nice for what we paid. The bed is comfortable, and like I said, our view of the street was great. The workout room is a tad small for the size of the building--about 5 or 6 treadmills, a couple Ellipticals and a couple bikes. While we were there, two treadmills also were not working. If it's nice outside, you can always just run outside I guess, but in Feb., that wasn't an option. Overall, I would definitely stay here again.

The Westin is known for their heavenly beds and we definitely slept well. The bathroom was a great size and had a huge vanity which was really nice.

The highlight of the hotel was the smiling staff and the service we received. Everyone we interacted with was super nice and very helpful.

Lake view is technically correct because I can see some lake, but can only see it either side of a large high rise building smack in the middle of the eyeline. OK, it ain't Westin's fault that the building is there, but perhaps partial lake view would be more accurate.

The other part of the bureau housed the refrigerator with stocked overpriced items. The bathroom was standard for a hotel room and appeared clean although the housekeeping staff never gave us an extra towel or soap or shampoo. Being a preferred member I also got free Wi-fi access, however, the wi-fi here was pathetic. I had faster service on my 3G phone than the wifi, it was a worthless benefit. A big beef I have with hotels is that the beds are not completely made. After sleeping in the bed once I once again found that the sheets did not reach the bottom of the bed and the mattress and the small mattress pad were exposed. I had to pull off all the sheets and covers so that the staff would correct it. Additionally, the Westin usually gives you extra pillows in the room, this Westin did not, however, housekeeping did provide us with a few extra pillows. Westin offers a workout facility in each of their hotels. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to some really nice hotel facilities and some not-so nice ones, this hotel ranks in the middle. They did provide dumbbells but had no cable machine and 4 plate type machines. There were also a couple of aerobic machines (treadmill/ellipticals) but not many. Our room did not have a view either. We overlooked another building across the way. As I stated in the beginning, the Westin Heavenly bed was the only plus to our visit. Would be stay here again? No, while we like Starwood properties, we would try another first. When you pay more money for a Starwood property, you expect higher service and quality.

Unfortunately, the interior is not. Traveling for the first time with our 16 month old son, we booked a suite for 4 nights using points, at 20,000 points a night. This is a LOT of points, to be clear. We expected something commensurate with that price point. Unfortunately, our room (rooms 1636 and 1638) was in disrepair. We weren't able to check in at 4pm, the room still wasn't ready. When it was \"ready,\" we found that whomever booked it before us had used it for some sort of party. The walls still had tape all over them from decorations, and sequins and sparkles were everywhere. These were the most shiny parts of the room. The furnishings and fixtures were old and cracked and chipped. The couch and pillows and curtains were stained and frayed. The wallpaper is ripped and worn. The bathrooms have no windows and no fan, so they are decidedly dank and the wallpaper is peeling. The \"suite\" was two regular hotel rooms with a connecting metal fire door-- the bed had been moved out of one room (which had a Murphy bed - cracked down the middle of the wood paneling -- also built into the wall), and a couch and an extra chair replaced it. In the past I traveled weekly for work and I used to be Platinum level with SPG, which is why we had the points to use at the hotel. I'm very familiar with the Westin hotels and their suites. This is not the quality I have seen previously and not what I was expecting, which was an actual suite, not two guest rooms with a connecting door passed off as for the price of a suite. Also, with a small child I had asked for a quiet room away from noise so that he wouldn't be bothered by noise and any noise from him would not bother other guests as much, and had explained my reasons for the request. They gave us rooms at the end of the hall, directly in front of the elevator. It's true that we'd be less likely to bother OTHER guests there, but apparently our own comfort was less of a concern. We also had lovely views of the offices in the Hancock building, which our room directly faced. We could not have gotten a less well-appointed suite if we had asked them to try. I may be more disappointed than I otherwise would be because over the years I was a frequent guest of the hotel for business and I remember it fondly as having lovely rooms that matched the high-end location. But I'm now realizing that those stays were several years ago, and the hotel has not been updated during that time. Things are just getting run down. The bright point of the hotel, other than the location, is the staff, most of whom were friendly and lovely and helpful with our young child. The hotel staff also did a great job of accomodating our requests for a crib and a small fridge for my son's milk and baby food. I've given this hotel 3 stars instead of 2 because of the location. But there are literally dozens of hotels within a few blocks in the same price bracket, hotels which are much more impressive than the Westin. This location used to be SPG's nicest property in Chicago.

When we were leaving our room, we made sure to lock our door. My friend and I specifically stood by the door to make sure that the door was closed and locked. When we returned that evening, the door was propped open and the only thing that was keeping it closed was bolt in the room. My friend kicked the door in just to make sure no one was in there. Thankfully we had our valuables in the safe. 2) We checked out the next day, and unfortunately one of us forgot a garment bag with some clothes in it. It was left on the bed. The destination from the hotel was back to our apartments in Chicago, no stops in between. Therefore when we called the hotel back, knowing for a fact that the garment bag had been left in the hotel room, Lost and Found stated that nothing had been found, there was nothing left in the room. Apparantly they spoke to housekeeping and whomever cleaned our room, stated that they didn't see anything either. BEWARE, everyone found this very questionable as to why the door would be propped open Saturday evening when returning to our rooms, and then of course the missing garment bag.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken the opportunity to connect with Ms. Samukeliso and expressed that we would appreciate she would be able to arrange for a complementary upgrade or a late check-out. Ms. Samukeliso was very professional, extremely responsive and wonderful to work with. Not only did she upgrade my parents to a higher floor Deluxe room, but also provided a late check-out. This made the overall Westin experience so much more special, my parents felt well taken care of and I would like to take this opportunity and recognize Ms. Samukeliso again for her contributions in creating an excellent Westin experience!!", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely does not live up to the \"Westin\" Brand ...

This hotel falls short in every measurable catagory. I read the other reviews and thought to myself.. ahhh they must have been mistaken...well I was wrong not the other reviewers. I contacted the Platinum Concierge team to schedule my arrival, I requested 2 rooms (adjoining) and on the Preferred Guest or club level. Well we arrived precisely at 3pm for check-in, there was a massive line which i couldnt understand at first,, but as I approached the front desk I was \"greeted'\" by a young lady named \"Sammy\" who had the worst attitude as she said \"welcome to Westin, how can I serve you,\" I smiled, provided her with the details and requested confirmation on my original requests. I was quickly told we'll we are sold out so I don't think we can accommodate those requests. I was confident the hotel was not filled at 3pm so I asked her to re-evaluate the room availability, miraculously she found 2 rooms as requested except she said there was not preffered gust floor or lounge... off to the elevators I went with my family to find 4 floor dedicated to SPG Preferred Guests... I returned to the desk where I spent the next 30 minutes trying to obtain the rooms I requested to no avail. I was told we were upgraded to 'lake view' rooms because of my status only to arrive in a room that was facing the back of the Drake Hotel and I could barely make out a sliver of the lake from our window. But hey it's New Years Eve and I wasnt going to ruin a good trip.... well the hotel and its staff did it for me ... the bed linen in the room smiled like gym socks... the bed had a huge dip in the middle...and the room wouldnt maintain its temperature. The next morning I called down to request additional towels and was once again \"greeted\" by Sammy....as I requested additional bathroom linens .. I tried to verify she was going to send someone to the room ... and there was no response on the line... I immediately dialed back and she answered again ... I asked if she received my request to which she replied ' I said yes, when we were on the phone before Mr. Last Name\" , I attempted to say I didnt hear you confirm and once again.. she had disconnected the line. Upon checking out I decided to change my Credit Card and was told I would have to contact the accounting office on Monday to do so. I decided I had enough and immediately packed up and departed. This property should not bear the Westin name, in any way shape and form!

It feels a bit more like a \"stereotypical\" US Sheraton than it does the slightly more premium Westin brand. The heavenly beds are great. The lobby feels like a Westin (i.e., slightly more stylish) but the other public spaces and the bathrooms feel a bit dated / institutional -- i..e, plastic toilet seats, old tubs, drab hallways. The surprise for me this time around was the extent to which service levels have declined. I accidentally left my toothbrush at home so asked for one after checking in. It took two calls and nearly 40 minutes for me to get one. Other service issues I noticed: - slow check out. Only one person working the front desk during the morning rush - room not cleaned until late afternoon - strange policy requiring a room deposit at time of check-in. Based on the sign at the front desk, this deposit isn't refunded until weeks after your stay My guess is that the property is struggling a bit and that they've had to make cut backs and implement the deposit policy to reduce their financial risk. I think the property is good value but would have a hard time saying it is above average.

However the moment had passed and we had lost faith in the hotel, they said that they would credit back the money that we had been over charged ( well in excess of $1150 per couple) , However when we got home and checked our bank account we found they had failed to credit us they had in fact taken the money again so we were now $2300 in arrears. We called the hotel who had suddenly lost their friendliness again and denied that they had done anything wrong, we had to get our bank to contact them and it finially took 5 days to get the money back.

However, we had a few issues with the hotel itself... We specifically requested a room with a view of the lake, this was a problem at first seeing that when we walked into our room, all we could see was the building next door, which was the Hancock Tower, but still, not what we were looking for. They couldnt change our room until 1/2 way through our stay. However once we were in the room with a view, our attitudes didnt change much towards the hotel. The staff was very friendly and always willing to help. However some employees didnt understand how the starwood point system worked and there was a rather big misunderstanding with that. We thought we could use our points to treat ourselves to massages, this was false information. We would have never spent that much money if we were told so in the first place. Other things about starwood that werent mentioned to us......the hotel has no pool but there is a pool somewhere for hotel guests to use for free, we were unaware of this until our last day of stay.

If we wanted to order fruit for our room, it would have costed somewhere around $18 if my math is correct, which frankly, is rediculus for a plate of fruit. There is also a shuttle from the hotel to and from Midway airport which we were unaware of.

This is a pet peeve of mine. Business hotels just nickle and dime visitors assuming all expenses will be reimbursed. A few weeks after checkout I recieved a $25 Charge on my Credit Card. After calling to question the charge the accounting departments \"guessed\" it was because I had packages deliver to the hotel. I have never been charged in any other hotel for sending packages for events in advance. They quickly removed the charge. One of our group members were delayed due to weather and flight delays. I did request late check in for my group but when my college arrived for his room he was sent to a local Sheraton because the Westin overbooked. I was in the lobby and noticed many other guests with the same issue. Weather happens...Chicago hotels should be ready for O'Hare delays and late arrivals. Besides the overbooking mishaps the Front Desk staff and staff who organized our group was very professional. Some colleges enjoyed the bar/steakhouse in the lobby for dinner. I went to the breakfast stand that \"Proudly Serves Starbucks\" but isn't really a Starbucks. The coffee was terrible and the banana sour. I wouldn't attempt the breakfast danishes.

We used the concierge desk a lot and they always had great recommendation and made most of our dinner reservations. One concierge was particularly helpful to us and her name was Marina. I asked Marina to order flowers for my wife and have them placed in the room before we arrived and she did a great job in taking care of my request and alos helping me pick out a special place to take my wife for an evening out on the town. Marina also sent a complimentary bottle of wine which we thought was very generous. When my wife walked in and saw the flowers, she was so moved at how beautitul they were. Thanks Marina. Overall, the hotel was the perfect place for this special occassion. My wife now wants to visit Chicago again for a long vacation and of course our choice of hotel will include the Westin. By the way, the name of the (heavenly)beds speaks for itself.

As with most hotels in metropolitan high-rise areas, the rooms are small. However, the decor, cleanliness and comfort were above average. Noise carried in from the hallway. It wasn't a disturbance to me, but I was conscious that noise from my room would also carry out into the hall. Privacy could be compromised. Their Heavenly Bed is heavenly - the best sleep of my life, but the Heavenly Shower was just a mirage as one of the showerheads didn't work at all, and the other wouldn't adjust the stream tension. With that said, on a scale of 1 to 10, those negative rate a 2 and the positive rate a 9.5. - so the negatives can easily be overlooked. I ate one meal in their restaurant, The Grill, and found it to be an overcooked frozen entree with a hefty price tag. Contrary to that, though, most of my other meals were in the meeting and banquet rooms and had been prepared and served by the hotel's catering staff. The service was white linen, and the presentation, variety and quality of the food exceptional. The sales or catering manager was present at all meals to greet us and make sure we were given the best of service (which we definitely were). The hotel's location was fantastic. This was my third trip to Chicago and this was easily the best place to stay. The Westin is next door from the Hancock Building, across the street from the Bloomingdale's shopping plaza, one block from the Water Tower, I could go on and on. Word of warning - the business center charges $2.99/minute for internet access. It's been a long time since I stayed at a hotel where this wasn't a complimentary amenity.

Last year (December 2007), I brought my mother and sister-in-law to enjoy the Westin Michigan Avenue. At 3am, we were awoken by a torpedo of ICE crashing through our window from the Hancock Building. It shattered our window and cold Chicago air came streaming in our room. After waiting bundled up in coats in our cold room for the manager to never call us back, we headed to the hotel lobby where we sat around for over an hour in our pajamas, waiting for the next move - are we going to another room or are they sending us to another hotel? Apparently other guests had experienced the same thing and they went to other hotels. We, the three of us, were put up in a king bed room where it was warm. The management advised us that they were slowly replacing all the windows on this side with safety glass. We were comped this night and given another night to stay. We accepted that this is out of the hotel's control with ice falling off a different building. Although we were taken back by the service by the management, we decided to try again this year. December 6th, 2008, we were placed in a very nice corner room. Beautiful room. We arrived after shopping that evening and realized there was no heat. The maintenance man was great and tried all he could to get the heater back working. 1 out of the 2 worked, but this was just not enough to keep us warm. The solution from the management - give us more blankets. We were given one extra blanket for my mother. Now, it's not like it was 30 degrees, but it was not warm and cozy, and for the luxury hotel they strive to be, I need to let you know our experience and why we really don't want to experience the Westin Michigan Avenue again. Please also take note that the maintenance men advised us that the windows were never replaced with safety glass or double pane glass and that the windows break as a \"common occurrence\". Until the windows are safe, I will advise against not staying here to my fellow friends and employees. This is negligence to not take all necessary precautions.

Our standard 350sq foot room had a big desk with lots of electrical outlets, new carpeting, and a view of Michigan Avenue. The bathroom was large enough and the shower had dual shower heads. The closet was small, with safe big enough for a laptop, an iron and board inside. There was a flat screen TV with 22 channels which included only 1 movie channel, HBO. In room movies were also available at a cost. Paper thin walls in the west tower (it may be different in the east tower) allow you to hear most everything going on out in the hallway or the next room. We even heard the phones ringing and alarm clock going off in the room next door. This is a 100% non smoking property, with a $500 cleaning charge for smoking in the room. Wireless internet access was free in the lobby, so there were always a large number of guests sitting in the lobby with their laptops and paperwork. The lobby was always very busy with guests. Internet in the rooms is $12.95 + tax for a 24hr period. However if you logged on before midnight of day 1, you were charged for a 2nd day if you logged on the next morning. Overnight parking was $48, A bottle of water in the room was $5 for 24oz. The hotel has a small work out room, but no pool. there is a \"Grill on the Alley\" restaurant off the lobby, and a breakfast room in the morning. Breakfast was ala carte, and very expensive. We did not eat in the hotel Grill, but had breakfast, and while the service and the food was good, it was pricey, $18 for the 2 egg breakfast. A wine reception was held in the lobby from 5:30-7pm. 10 minute complimentary neck massages were given on a first come basis. The hotel was very clean, however the 300 count linens on the \"Heavenly Bed\" bed were poly cotton and pilling. The top duvet was higher grade, and very lovely. Some of the towels in the bathroom were brand new, but not absorbent. Again, they were cotton blends, so it was like drying yourself with waxed paper. A few extra washings before using might have helped. The other towels were just fine. One very strange item I noticed...usually morning papers are complimentary, but in small print on the key holder it stated that the USA Today delivered to your room was .75. If you did not wish to receive it,, contact the front desk, and .75 would be deducted from your bill.

She came around the pod (very rare at most hotels) and showed us where our elevator was. We got up to our room to find we had been upgraded to a suite! There was a table of chocolate covered strawberries and a happy birthday balloon personalized with my friends name by the window. Best of all, there was a birthday card signed by everyone at the front desk. Even the front office director, Sean Vanger had signed it too! The whole night was so fun and breathtaking that we just stayed and enjoyed our room and the gorgeous view! The city is something we treasure and all the great buildings and the views are spectacular! On our way down to the lobby our housekeeper even said good morning and how was our night? As we got off the elevator the bellstaff was eager to see where we were headed and asked us if we enjoyed our stay. Although we were sad to leave, we decided to have them hold our luggage and walked to breakfast. The day was perfect and the staff couldn't be more helpful. If you want a truly amazing experience my friends and I recommend the Westin Michigan Avenue. And to make it a truly memorable one, just let your front desk agent or concierge know why you are there and they will take care of the rest! For all my special Chicago weekends, the Westin Michigan Avenue is our new hotel of choice!!

We had nothing but issues, issues, and more issues. It was the biggest problem that we had in all of our wedding plans. The hotel itself is nice, clean, and the beds are very comfortable. I have no complaints about the quality of the hotel and furnishings. Our first issue was that we were misled about the nature of the room block. We were reassured that when the initial block was filled, we would be able to add 5 more rooms at a time, no problem whatsoever. What they failed to mention was that they would hassle with us about the room rate. Next issue, my grandfather needed a handicapped room. The reservation was made 8 months in advance, and when he checked in....no handicapped room for him. Had to wait 24 hrs. for a handicapped room. Unexcusable. Next issue, multiple guests were not able to check in by 3 pm. One guest had driven from Canada and was not able to check into her room until 7 pm. This was because someone was still occupying the room. They reassured her this person would be charged. They did not however offer her another room, or offer anything to her at all! Again, unexcusable. Next issue, the gift bags I provided for the guests were not properly delivered to the right guests. I had provided a typed, very clear list of which guests were to receive bags to the bellman (this is the Westin's policy). I had to speak with the bellman multiple times about gift bags not being delivered. I should not have to do this the weekend I am getting married!! The biggest issue...they charge $2.50 per gift bag.

I personally think this hotel should be rated not much more than a 3. They don't even have a pool. The rooms are nothing special. Just your average size rooms. I ended up with a room with no view. Just a view of some sort of apartment building at the back of the hotel. The bathroom was nice and had an oversized marble vanity with a sink which I thought was a waste of space.

I generally am a fan of Westins. I can't say that I am a big fan of this hotel though. First, the positives. 1) Location. Perfect for our needs. 2) Comfortable beds. Now, the negatives. 1) SERVICE!! My wife stopped at the front desk on her way in from shopping and realized she didn't have her key on her. She requested one and went up to the room. Of course the key didn't work. The cleaning lady was at the room next door. She refused to help and insisted my wife use the house phone to call the front desk. She did this 30 minutes after she came in our room as we were leaving and had a conversation with my wife. Fine, whatever. So my wife proceeds to call the front desk to let them know that the key they JUST GAVE HER does not work. She asked if someone could come up with another key for her. They said no, that she would have to come down. Now, I would expect this reaction at a Red Roof Inn, but not at a supposed higher end hotel. Also, it should be noted that this was at 1:30 on a Monday afternoon. It was dead in the lobby, so being busy was not an excuse. All they had to do was have a bell man come up with a key. My wife certainly would have tipped him. Anyway, when I stopped by the front desk later that day to complain the woman that the desk said, \"I don't know why a bell man couldn't have taken the key up to you\". No sorry, instead an \"Oh well\". 2) The barking dog. Now, I really like dogs, but not when they are barking while I am trying to sleep a few doors down. Maybe something could be done to keep them all on the same floor. 3) Running toilet. After flushing the toilet it would run, very loudly, for about 10 minutes. I didn't call maintenance, so this is partially my fault. In summary, I don't know that I would stay here again.

My main purpose for visiting Chicago was to see the annual Air & Water Show which was scheduled for both Saturday and Sunday with the latter being canceled due to inclement weather. My last visit to this property was over 10 years ago and the hotel lobby has undergone a drastic overhaul since that time. There are many employees on hand and they are very active and willing to assist. The most appealing aspect to this hotel is the location, directly across from the John Hancock Building. There are many other hotel options in that area but I would return to the Westin without hesitation after this experience especially when the cost is factored into the equation. Another impressive part of my stay was the comfort of the bed. This was a treat. The comforter and sheets were equally warming while the mattress was firm yet smooth. As a light sleeper, I dreaded some reviews labeling this a noisy hotel. I didn't find that to be true. In fact, just the opposite. I had a room on the 16th floor and barely noticed any unpleasantness. The room was basic but spotless while the bathroom was spacious and pleasing. The lone negatives: the view was unappealing. Oh well, maybe that is a trade off since a friend stayed at the nearby Intercontinental Hotel and had a marvelous view of Michigan Avenue with the unfortunate accompaniment of typical blaring city sounds. My room at the Westin was at the opposite end of the spectrum: very peaceful but inferior view. Also, the TV channel selection was anemic and the quality of the picture was horrible. While extensive TV viewing isn't a priority when traveling it does have a purpose. I contacted maintenance and a worker arrived literally within five minutes, fixed an unattached cable in the back of the TV and though the result was better for some channels about half of the 20 or so channels offered had dismal image quality. By comparison, the Intercontinental Hotel had a vast selection of channels similar to what most guests probably have in their homes. The Westin needs an upgrade and overhaul here. Overall, a very pleasant stay.

Prior to this stay, I was a great fan of Westin hotels. Since this stay, I'm not sure I will ever stay at a Westin again. And I will definitely never stay at his particular hotel. As soon as I opened the door to my room (1752), I could smell a damp, musty odor, similar to what you might expect at a cheap seaside motel. I tried to phone the front desk, but the telephone didn't work. I went back down to reception and stood in line. When I finally got to the counter and explained the situation, the front desk attendant said that the smell was to be expected because of the humidity. He was completely unsympathetic and unapologetic. He did eventually assign me to a different room (650). This one also had a similar odor but it wasn't as strong as the previous room, so I decided to grin and bear it, especially as I wasn't getting any sympathy from the hotel staff. The next morning, when I tried to turn on a lamp, the neck of the lamp fell off in my hand. I had to reassemble the lamp myself. Then I tried to make a cup of coffee only to find that the coffee maker didn't work. The hairdryer didn't work either. It turned out that the electrical outlet in the bathroom was out of order. Also, the bathroom cabinetry was so badly scratched up, it looked like it had been vandalized. I didn't have time to report any of this as I had to get to my conference. When I returned to my room that evening, the room stunk. It smelt as if a sewer had backed-up in the room. That was the last straw. I waited in line for a third time at the front desk. This time I got a sypmathetic and professional member of staff (Sasha) who listened patiently, apologized, agreed that this is not what one should experience at a Westin, and re-assigned me to a \"renovated\" room on the other side of the hotel. The new room (1509) was small and dark, but smelt fresh and clean. Sasha was also professional enough to phone up later that evening to make sure I had settled into the room okay. Something her colleague at the front desk didn't have the courtesy to do the first time around. Unfortunately, this new room, was close to an elevator and was very noisy. I could hear the elevator scraping up and down the elevator shaft all night long. I could also hear everything that was happening in the hallway as if it was going on in my own room. By this point, I was fed up, frustrated and couldn't be bothered to complain any more, since there just didn't seem to be a hope in hell that anyone at this hotel would be able to resolve the situation. It's ironic that the hotel's literature says that they hope their guests leave relaxed and refreshed and they look forward to welcoming them back again. I felt anything but refreshed and relaxed. I have never been so glad to check out of a hotel before, and you could not pay me enough to stay at this hotel again. I have never had such a horible experience at any hotel, anywhere in the world. The Starwood Group should be ashamed that one of their properties operates at such a low standard. It is not cheap to stay at a Westin, and one expects a certain level of comfort and service, not a smelly or noisy room, rude staff, and furniture and equipment that is falling apart.

For that amount, it's not so bad, but I would have been very disappointed had I paid full price. From my experience booking with Priceline, no hotel has purposely given me a bad room for that reason. I think that may have been the case here at the Westin, however most of my complaints are with the hotel itself, not the room. I arrived at about 1 a.m. and was the only person in the lobby, other than the desk agent. I really loved the lobby and am not sure why. It didn't have anything out of the ordinary, but it did have a very sexy feel that made me regret staying here alone. The agent was friendly, and check-in was quick. Seeing as how it was so late, and I was clearly a weak, worn-out woman, I would expect the offer of help with my bag, but I did not get it. I don't utilize the bellmen anyway, but I have always at least been offered the service and found this a little strange. My room was on the fifth floor, and I found the hallways to be quite dingy. It looked like a budget hotel with scratches and a little dirt on the walls. My room was very close to the elevators, but I did not hear them. However, I could hear everything else that was going on. I'm not sure if this was due to thin walls or the fact that the doors to the room are so high up from the floor that they resemble fancy bathroom stalls. The room itself was one of the smallest I've ever had, and it had an old tube TV. There was no self-checkout which was annoying. The bed was huge and extremely comfortable, so that was the best part. The bedding was so heavy that when I pulled it over me, for a moment I thought a person had climbed on top of me. They offered 24-hour room service which I could not find on their Web site. I ended up not needing it after all, but it was nice knowing it was there. The view was awful, but I don't mark off for this because almost every hotel will have rooms that don't have views, and views usually cost extra. So, the sight from my window was a roof, a fire escape, and a poster of a naked woman in some guy's apartment. The room was freezing cold which was very unpleasant. However, I did find the temperature control hidden behind the curtains, and after that it was fine. Maid service was fantastic, and the woman cleaning my room was very nice, almost seeming happy to be there. Check-out was easy, despite having to go down to the desk to do it. I left my luggage at the bell desk which was very efficient both ways. When I left the hotel, I had scheduled an airport shuttle, but no one at the hotel knew this. I walked out with my suitcase and stood out front, and no one offered to hail a cab or help me. Again, it wasn't something I needed but something I'm used to good hotels offering. I used the business center which was outrageously expensive, but that's pretty standard. I did not eat at the restaurant, but it smelled good and had quite a crowd at all times. Overall, there was not much actually wrong with the hotel, but for the price it would normally cost, I expect much better.

Check-in: From Chicago O'Hare to the Westin was about $38 by taxi, and compared to the shuttle that you share with others for $18/pp from the airport, it was worth it to take a cab by ourselves. We arrived early at around 11am and was told that we could check-in but our room would not have a great view and was by the elevators, so we opted to go to lunch first and come back. We went to Giordano's which was about a 5min walk and Westin gave us a call about a half hour later while we were at lunch, notifying us that our room was ready. The room: We first got checked into a room on the 20th floor facing the lake which was nice, but was turned off when we entered the room and noticed the entire room/bathroom smelled like cigarette smoke, so we immediately called down and asked to switch our rooms. After being put on hold for about 5mins, we were given another room, two floors up from where we were and ended up being by the elevator but it had no smell of smoke which was acceptable. Like others, we felt that the room was very standard, compared to other Westin's we have been to which were renovated with newer furnishings and flat-screen tv's, but this room was not. It had a 27\" tube tv and very shabby furniture. But it was clean and the bathroom was nice but did not have the dual showerheads that we are used to at other Westin's. The towels also had a stingy glue smell to them when they got damp which kind of made us nauseous but other than that, no complaints. We were a tad disappointed considering we spent about $300/night for this room. The walls are extremely thin. The phone had rung while i was in the bathroom and came out to answer it and realized it was NEXT door's phone that was ringing.That's how thin the walls are. We also heard other people's doors opening and closing thru the night and the elevator doors as well so I had woken up a couple of times in the night, even with the Heavenly Bed. The location: Great location, close to all the shopping. There's the \"900\" across the street which is an enclosed mall of about 50-60 shops and then all along Michigan Ave., there's hundreds of stores including Macy's, H&M, Express, Victoria Secret, high-end shops and also a movie theater further down. Also,directly across the street is the John Hancock tower and places to eat beneath the street level. There's a cafe great for a quick bite for breakfast or lunch or gelato, a Jamba Juice and a Cheesecake Factory open till after midnight which we ate at twice. Overall, we would probably not stay at the Westin again because for the price we paid, we were disappointed and felt that we could do much better. I would def. stay in this location though because we were looking at the hotels by River North and when we passed by in person, they seemed nice but there was hardly anything to do over there i.e. eating, nightlife, etc. so staying on the Mag.

The rooms are a bit small though they have all the amenities one would need. We were on a SPG floor and had complimentary water in our room and access to fresh coffee down the hall in the mornings which was a nice treat (though we could brew in room as well). The bathroom was very spacious - the towels could have been a little softer but the robe was nice. The amenities were the typical westin ones - fine but not as nice as the ones at other Starwood chains (like the W who uses Bliss!) The crib delivered for our son was perfect and even had a little floor mat and blanket that came with it. The chaise lounge in our room was great. We liked the fact that the fridge was a regular mini fridge and not the new ones that practically record a fee when you open a door! The bed was the typical westin heavenly bed - duvet and pillows were great. For some reason the sheets on this one weren't as soft as on other westin beds, but aside from that, very comfy. The CD player/clock radio was nice - when we enetered the room soft music was playing which was a nice touch. One thing I noticed was that we could easily hear people walking down the hall past our room and in fact could hear the phone ring in an adjoining room as well. Luckily this happened more during the day. That said, my apologies to any of our neighbors who surely heard my son during his middle of the night wakeups... All in all it was a great getaway for us.

I was a little confused when the front desk person never referenced that I had selected that upgrade, but figured we would still be in a nice room. Upon entering the room, we were immediately disappointed. The great view we had was of the roof of the building next door. Also, I understand that in a city environment, the rooms are going to be smaller than the standard size room, but this room was ridiculously small. I have stayed in a hotel in Times Square that was much larger than this! On top of that, the front desk person made it sound like she was doing us a favor by putting us in a \"newly remodeled\" room. I am not sure what was recently remodeled, as the decor still appeared to be from the 90's and the room smelled of mildew and just had an overall dinginess that made us want to get up and out as early as possible every day. Paint on the ceiling in the room and the bathroom was bubbling and peeling, and things just looked old.

I calle the Westin and spoke to Kelsey at the front desk. I explained the situation and she said she would check it out and call me back. At this point, in the middle of my Brother-in-Laws wedding reception, I was waiting for a call from the hotel. Kelsey called me back and told me I DID NOT have two rooms reserved for Saturday. I had to leave the reception and return to the Westin to straighten things out. I arrive at the Westin, and spoke to the manager. I gave him our reservation numbers and he told me one of them was not valid and not in his system. He then called central reservations and after being on hold for 15 minutes finally found our reservation. The morning shift had transferred the reservation to my sitters name, but used her last name as her first.

Located right on the Magnificent Mile and across from great shopping and the John Hancock Building. Lots of restaurants, and great stores like Bloomingdales (across the street), Macy's,etc. There is also a great restaurant in the hotel called \"The Grill\" that has awesome steaks and heaping portions or everything. So, let's just say you won't starve. Now, our room: a one bedroom (rather small and has a king size bed, work desk, minibar, and a rather old fashioned TV. The bathroom is indeed outdated and has water stains, rikety toilet seat, falling grout and not even a proper towel rack. Steams up the mirrors as there is no fan. Our walls were paper thin and we could hear any and everything outside in the corridor and the phone ringing in the room next to ours. All the doors here automatically close and not quietly. We hear doors slam shut all day and night in our room all the way down the hall. It starts early in the morning to late nights. Bring ear plugs! Service: Maid service is very inconsistent. Sometimes they will replace the bottled water in the rooms ($5/small bottle), and sometimes they don't. Sometimes your disposable coffee cups are replace and sometimes they are not. Sometimes there will be plastic garbage cans and sometimes not. Other then that, they do come and do a decent job of cleaning the room. We left our laptops on the desk and they were not disturbed. A good sign. So security is not an issue. TV: Service is horrible. We were watching a movie half way and it got completely distorted and calling the hotel express service line was a waste of time. There was nothing they could do but they did say they would remove the charge. You also have to call them to reset the movie menu as it's not there when you first turn on the TV. Phone: Before we could make any calls or toll free calls, we had to call the same express service line to get them to reset the phone to allow that service. Suggestion: I would seriously consider spending your money on other great hotels that are close by here like the Hilton Suites, The Drake, and the Four Seasons which all are in the next blocks surrounding this hotel.

My advice to you? If you are to stay here, check your bill. And don't expect an apology from the staff. Also, the view from the rooms vary greatly - Ask for a good view: There are 2 towers: East and West: In the East tower - Higher-floor rooms on the North side have a view of Oak Street beach & the lake, all South side have views into the John Hancock building (you see a black window out your window).

It was there that we unloaded...just like a regular parking garage, although it did have a direct door through to the hotel.

Since I am a Starwood member, I read the reviews on the Westins, W, and Sheraton hotels in the area. After doing my reading I decided on the Westin Michigan Avenue and was pleasently surprised. If you are into shopping (which my wife I discovered-definitely is) this is the place for you. North Michagan Avenue, also called the Magnificent Mile, is a shopping mecca. The hotel is located at the northern end of the shopping district directly across the street from the John Hancock Building which has a nice lounge on the 96th floor (YOU MUST CHECK THIS OUT - pricey drinks, but great view and free to get in - just order one drink and hang out for an hour to see the city from high up). Sorry, I got side tracked...... I requested a deluxe room which gave me a Lake Michigan view. The rooms are very comfortable and they have \"Heavenly Beds\". I had never heard of this before, but I soon realized why they have that name. I think I had the best deep sleep in my life during my stay there. I could have stayed in their \"Traditional\" type room, which I was told is almost the same room except that you are on a lower floor and probably not the greatest view. My \"Deluxe\" type room was on the 23rd floor which gave me a nice view, however, there are buildings in front of the hotel which do obscure your view. You do not have a 180 degree view of lake michigan. Therefore, if you do not plan on spending too much time in your room, I would settle for the less expensive \"Tradional\" room. The bathrooms had a nice long corian countertop that was great for spreading your stuff out. Each room had high speed interent access. I unfortunately was not allowed to bring my laptop since this was supposedly a romantic get-away. Nonetheless, whenever she was in the shower, I would run down to the Busness Center on the 2nd floor to jump on their 2 available computers. There was a flat $2.50 charge for signing on and then $0.56 per minute fee which includes internet and printing. The hotel had a nice bar and restaurant, however, we opted to venture out and not eat hotel food. Across the street, on the 6th floor of the Bloomindale's building there is a really nice restaurant called the Oak Tree which had a great breakfast at a reasonsable price. I had egg benedict with a huge glass of milk for about $7. Their is a conciege desk in the lobby. They were helpful, but I was not too impressed with their selection of restaurants.

However, there are some real positives to this hotel: the location is superb; the fitness center is good; the heating system is responsive; the Heavenly Bed is pretty much heavenly.

I wanted to stay at the Peninsula, but could not afford 2 rooms there. The Westin seemed to be in the location that I wanted, so even though the reviews weren't that great - I booked it. The lobby is nothing to speak of, the rooms were small - but we had an awesome view of Michigan Ave. The rooms were clean, the beds were comfortable, the bathroom was pretty decent. This is not the best hotel I have ever stayed in, but definately not the worst (and I am pretty picky!!) So I would recommend this hotel to those people wanting to stay on Michigan Ave.", "Date": "December 4, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wichita, KS", "Title": "\u201cSo-So\u201d", "Author": "b2buck", "ReviewID": "UR2851553", "Content": "We spent two nights at the Westin Michigan Avenue last week. The location and the heavenly bed were great. The room was small. The heavenly bath was a joke. A curved shower curtain rod and a two headed shower in a old small tub shower. The first night we had to call maintenance because the pipe had fallen off the bathroom sink and was flooding the bathroom when you used the sink. It took them three trips to get it fixed. The restaurant was ok but nothing special. We will probably try somewhere else next time.", "Date": "November 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "Jed3", "ReviewID": "UR2817400", "Content": "We just returned from a 4 night stay for a pleasure visit.

I read so many reviews I didn't know where to stay. Went through priceline and my choice was made for me. I couldn't have made a better choice. We thought the room was great. It was clean and pleasant. I'm not sure why people complain about the size, it is a hotel room and we found it adequate in size. The \"heavenly bed and shower\" are just that and I mean it!! Seven pillows on the bed, it was great. I don't consider myself very picky re a shower but after I came home to my shower, I was missing the dual showerheads. I had read about the pricey minibar and agree. . . avoid it. Who needs it with so many great places to eat so close. The Cheesecake Factory next door was fun. Our favorite though was the \"Big Bowl\" just a few blocks away. Great thai/asian type food with stir fry bar. Can't wait to go back and take our kids. This was also close to American Girl Place and, practically next door to Water Tower Place. We also were right next to the elevator and had no problems. Rooms were quiet. Recommend if you want to sleep past 8am, just hang the do not disturb, the maid comes early. The staff was courteous, remember this is Chicago. Would not hesitate to stay here if Michigan Ave shopping is your goal. I also loved State Street ie. Marshal Fields, Carson Piere Scott and would love to stay that direction too.", "Date": "November 2, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, unfriendly front desk\u201d", "Author": "dzal", "ReviewID": "UR2765591", "Content": "I stayed at the Westin on Michigan Avenue October 15th-18th and although the hotel is well situated to shopping, John Hancock and Rush Street I found the front desk employees to be very unfriendly. The front desk employees seemed almost irritated whenever you went up there. The conceriege (Shirlene) was awesome, very sweet and helpful. The doorman and valet staff were also friendly. Do not try to purchase anything in the gift shop because the gal behind the counter will be ticked off that she has to stop reading her magazine to help you. Also, our phone did not work and I mentioned it to the surly woman at the front desk and she said she would have someone look into it-never happened.

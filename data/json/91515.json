This place is in need of a complete cleaning. There is a large vent in the ceiling of the center area of the suite. It was disgusting knowing the air was blowing through this filthy vent. In the bathroom, I can understand a stray hair or two. However, there were many long black hairs on the underside of the toilet seat. Gross! The pain in the bathroom was peeling pretty badly. We noticed the vacum cleaner used by the maid when it was parked in the hallway. It was certainly not a commercial quality vacum--it was the $30 Wal-Mart type. No wonder there was stuff that was not picked up on the rugs and elsewhere. We arrived late and went to grab a late-night dinner. Upon returning the door was locked. There is not a device to swipe your room key in. We had to buzz in. However, there was nobody around to answer the buzzer. We waited quite awhile outside. The owner apparently spent money on this place about 15 years ago and hasn't put anything into it since.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakewood, OH", "Title": "\u201cWell worth the 40$ for the room.\u201d", "Author": "chrisfromcleve", "ReviewID": "UR120569797", "Content": "This place is older and I would say that it could use a good vacuuming.. but that said, for the 40$ a night I spent I had a living area with desk, free wi fi, refrigerator, microwave, and king bed.

And the facet in the \"kitchen\" area was left running. Then at 4:00 in the morning the garbage truck came and it felt like the whole room was shaking.

My fellow business companion booked a non-smoking room but they did not have it when we arrived. Despite giving the front desk their cell number for the manager who was not onsite to call, he never did. They advertise free wireless Internet. However it was worthless as it kept going in and out. I called the support number based on the wi-fi card they had in the room only to find they don't service the hotel! Why then is the card & number in their rooms? The hotel staff could'nt say! Rooms are dimly lit and the two TV's had poor reception - good luck watching a baseball game if you want to see the ball! I had hoped to try the continental breakfast buffet at least, but it was sparse and with only 4 tables I had no place to sit even if I wanted to. If I was on my own dime I would have eaten the cancelation fee of a nights stay and left and checked in at a beautiful Hilton Homestead Suite a quarter mile away.

Upon entering this hotel we were greeted with a beautifully decorated lobby area. We were given a room on the 2nd floor (a suite). Our room was spacious and very relaxing after a day of travelling. A living room area with a sofa, armchair, coffee table, TV and desk. There was a sink area with microwave and frige. The \"bedroom\" was the best part - spacious, extra TV, big closet, beautiful new bed covers and pillows, a big window that opened. The bed was a king size and very comfortable. The room and bathroom were very clean and everything was in working order. Breakfast was 6am-9am in a lovely breakfast room that was clean, relaxing and tastefully decorated. It included coffee, juice, cereal, yogurt, waffles, omlettes, toast, fruit, pastries. Coffee was available with free cookies in the lobby. Our only regret was that we were just passing through and came and left so quickly. It's a great place, clean and comfortable and with a bit of charm often lacking in chain hotels.

The stay was very pleasant and there we had only a few minor complaints. The first was that the desk clerk at check-in was efficient, but never did smile. The other item of note was about the continental breakfast offered. Actually, there was a waffle station, there were omelets, pastries, juice, bagels, fruit, yogurt and cereal.

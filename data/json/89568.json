I've been wanting to take my 13yo to Boston for years but hotel prices are always high. Then, I noticed the $99 special for the Chandler Inn on TA Boston Hotels. It seemed at first like an inconvenient location (most people stay downtown, near the water, in Back Bay or Copley Square) but using Google maps, I found that it's only 2 blocks from the Back Bay station and there's a bus stop right around the corner. Little did I know how lucky we were... We arrived at 2pm and were warmly greeted by Gretchen Chauncey. I didn't realize that she was the General Manager. I noticed the TA certificate proudly displayed on the check-in counter and asked her if she would like a TA decal for the front window (she said, 'Yes, please!'). Although we were early, our room was ready for us and Gretchen noted that I had requested a higher floor (to avoid noise from the bar downstairs). The room was a bit small but very clean, with a nice bathroom and comfy beds. For that price, I think it was a great deal. As soon as we had dropped our bags, we headed out to Tremont Street for lunch. It's only 3-4 blocks away. What a great area for shopping and dining! Over the course of our 3-day visit, we ate at B&G Oyster Bar, Sibling Rivalry and the South End Buttery. It was so easy to walk to the restaurants and back. Having a 7-11 convenience around the corner was very nice too. While we were in town, an electric company transformer caught on fire and caused a widespread blackout in Back Bay. We were riding the metro at the time when we heard the news. Exiting the Back Bay metro station, the streets were pitch black. Residents were standing out on the street, talking about the power outage and sharing flashlights. We didn't realize how serious it was at the time. We made our way towards the hotel in the dark, using the dim light from my iPhone. Half a block away, like a beacon in the night (sorry for the cliche), Chandler Inn's lights were particularly bright! Lucky us -- the hotel was on a different electric grid and it had power. A whole 2 days later, I learned that the guests in the big and expensive Back Bay hotels had had to evacuate. No electricity and no hot water. I'm sure glad we were at the Chandler Inn. It felt like a home away from home. The front desk staff was always friendly and helpful, like family.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely Cannot Beat The Price!\u201d", "Author": "patraveler38", "ReviewID": "UR126051571", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at The Chander Inn for a long weekend recently.

The theater district is only a few blocks away and we had a plenty of wonderful restaurants to choose from for dinner each night. The neighborhood feels very safe, even at night and is clean and well kept. The rooms are small, but sufficient for the needs of a couple. They would most likely be too small for anyone traveling with children. The walls were a little thin, so there was a good bit of noise from the hallway mostly, as well as little from neighboring rooms.

The small space was very clean and seemingly well maintained. All this being said, I checked out before the second night because I slept so poorly on the first night of my stay. There was too much way noise from the inside of the adjoining guest room-talking and television sound poured through the wall until 5 AM. Add to that the sound of loud plumbing and slamming doors from down the hallway and I barely got a couple of hours of shut-eye.

There is a fancy coffee machine in the lobby where you can make cappuccino, hot chocolate, etc. The rooms are small (you are in downtown Boston, after all), but it was all the space we needed. The bathroom is very compact also. The bed was very comfortable, and the furnishings are modern and pleasant. There is no safe in the room (one thing that would've been nice... not that we had any problems). The front desk was friendly and helpful. We ate breakfast every morning at Francesca's Cafe (short walk away on Tremont). It was GREAT! In addition to plenty of yummy and healthy breakfast / lunch options, they have lots of specialty coffees and hot chocolates served in giant cups (practically bowls)! Not to be missed if you like that kind of thing! The service is good too. We really enjoyed the Metropolis Cafe for dinner. It is a cozy wine bar with great ambiance. We didn't have a reservation but a kind hostess found us a seat at the bar. This was actually great. We had a view of the restaurant, and the bartenders are attentive without being intrusive. Great wine selection and delicious food. We tried B&G Oysters one night and found it overrated and very expensive. It wasn't bad but it didn't live up to the hype or the price tag. The host and our server were very helpful though. I found people in Boston to be very nice! We walked the Freedom Trail, took the Duck Tour, and shopped on Newbury Street, all of which are within walking distance of the hotel. Very convenient not to need a car in downtown Boston + didn't have to worry about parking, either at the hotel or when out and about. Honestly, I was a little disappointed in the Freedom Trail and the Duck Tour... maybe the cold, gloomy weather had something to do with this. Newbury Street is very nice though, with lots of shops and cafes with outside seating. Anyway, if I am ever in Boston again, I will happily stay at the Chandler Inn again! It is so nice, convenient and affordable!", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service, Great stay at the Chandler Inn\u201d", "Author": "Reggie S", "ReviewID": "UR122250039", "Content": "I had Great service and the best recommendations at the Chandler Inn while I was in Boston last weekend.

All considered I was somewhat disappointed. While some of the disappointment might be attributed to bad luck, enough of my less than ideal experiences here were due to poor decisions by hotel staff to warrant this writing. First off, I arrived at the hotel at about 7pm. I communicated my two requests\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.that I have a quiet room and ideally have a firm bed (I knew this would be a long shot in any hotel). The attendant did make an effort to give me a room on the 7th fl (of 8) to hopefully limit street noise, and the bed was firm (for a hotel bed). Although I knew this was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcboutique\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hotel, I was still somewhat surprised at the small size of the room, and in particular the bathroom. Admittedly this might have been a result of my expectations being disoriented. The room was very nicely appointed given its small size, the TV channel selection was more than adequate (Direct TV), and the included wireless internet functioned as promised (with a password from the front desk). So what were the problems? When I arrived at the hotel, I noted how packed the streets were with parked cars. On-street parking looked to be a real long shot. As I was checking in to the hotel, I inquired as to parking options. The only option that was formally presented to me was a self parking lot about 3 blocks from the hotel. I was told that the hotel would validate my parking ticket and I would receive the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspecial\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rate of $27 for the period of noon to noon (NOT a rolling 24 hour period). Even though I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be parking the car until 8:30pm, if I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave the lot by noon the next day, I would incur an additional fee. Even having come from Manhattan, this didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem like such a good deal for Boston. I expressed my surprise, and insisted there must be better options available where the hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t receive a kickback. I was told that they receive no compensation for customers utilizing that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and there was no better deal. After dropping my stuff off in the room, I started a web search for parking options. Low and behold, the same lot the hotel directed me too offers online discounts of $19 for full 24 hour periods, and substantially less if you departed early morning or stayed for a shorter period. This deal required printing out a paper coupon. The next morning I called the front desk (different clerk) to inquire if they could print something for me, and they were accommodative. When I went down to the desk I directed the agent to the parking website, and he immediately deduced what I was going for\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6he then commented that he had a bunch of the vouchers already printed out. He handed one to me. The night shift clerk didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t volunteer didly about this and suggested there were no opportunities to lower my parking costs! This left a very bad taste in my mouth. As for the room, I immediately noted how warm the hallway leading to the room was. When I entered the room, the room was also warmer than I like. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the AC working. I went to the front desk to inquire, and the clerk came with me to my room to try to assist (\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for effort). We both fiddled with the handheld a/c remote control unit to no avail\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the fan in the unit wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come on. He suggested I open the window a smidge, but that would allow all the street noise in. Even though I relented, there was meaningful condensation on the window due to the extreme temperature variations. (It was very cold in Boston that night) I also learned how razor thin the walls were. My next door neighbors were a couple that was apparently MADLY in love and VERY ENERGETIC. I could make out every sound and/or moan she would make, and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tire out until 2:15am.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay, excellent value for money\u201d", "Author": "Paris-kitty", "ReviewID": "UR121693701", "Content": "I stayed at the Chandler Inn in October 2011.

There were many other pedestrians along the route we walked , who were eating dinner at local restaurants or having drinks at the outside tables. The hotel is also located approximately three blocks from the T station and there is a convenient store and laundrymat just down the street. As far as the cost goes, we saved a tremendous amount of money staying at the Chandler Inn. For the time of year we were in Boston, rates on other hotels can reach $300-400 per night.

Check-in went smoothly and we got into our room just after the 3pm check-in time. It was on the second floor close to the corner of Chandler and Berkeley and directly over the pub downstairs. The bathroom is basically a closet with a hand-washing sink and a decent sized shower. The room was on the small size but acceptable for a one-night stay. No closet, but place to hang things, nice tv and very modern furnishings. Overall it was decent but not exactly my taste. I felt that the place was overpriced for what we got especially when we were woken up several times during the night due to lots of noise from the pub downstairs and when they closed people stayed out on the street for quite sometime.

You open the door, step in, and directly on one side (meaning without taking another step you can reach it) is the toilet and directly on the other side is the stand alone sink, then in front of you is the door to the shower. I personally liked the but shd mention the design is a bit different (not sure how to describe it but Ill give it a go)- glass door that while you are in the shower lines up straight with the glass shower wall giving you a good amount of space to move around, then when you are not in it the shower door closes inside the shower cutting it in half giving you a bit more room in the bathroom. I did not have a problem with the water leaking out but could see how this may become an issue for some. Loved the toiletries they provided-smelled and worked great. Only problem was I had was had to slam the door to get it to shut (probably waking all our neighbors in the process). Price- Great price!

Takes you to all the major tourist and historic attractions, and is fully narrated. Boston is a beautiful city and the Chandler Inn is on a quiet, tree lined street, where you feel completely safe to walk around at night. The hotel locks it door after 10 pm and the front desk is manned 24 hours, to let guests in, and provide an extra element of safety.It is also close to train stations.

Since I'm a grad student, and coming from a university, I had to choose something that wouldn't be ridiculously expensive, especially considering I was going there by myself. Based on the reviews, and compared to other hotels in Boston, the Chandler Inn seemed quite decent, with the newly renovated rooms and all. The staff was very friendly, the rooms were exactly as shown on their website (I had a twin room), although a bit small by North American standards, everything was clean, internet was fast and the location was excellent. I was a little worried that the Hynes Conference Center would be too far to walk to everyday, but it was a quick 10-15 minutes walk. I found that the best way to get there was to walk 2 blocks on Chandler st, turn right on Dartmouth st, go through the Neiman Marcus (or the entrance next to it) and follow the directions through the various shopping malls. The only downside to this hotel is that it was noisy. I was staying in room 201, which is the first room on the first floor of the hotel, next to the staircase/elevators. Fortunately, I never really heard noise coming from The Fritz and I didn't have trouble sleeping at night. But the walls and windows were thin. If I wanted to stay in bed relatively late in the morning (past 8 AM), it was impossible. The people cleaning the rooms were loud (although, admittedly, quite nice) and the doors... oh man, the doors!! People need to learn to NOT \"bang\" the doors when going out in the morning. It seems there was no damper (or buffer spring) on them... *BANG!*. That's the only thing that drove me nuts, haha. I wasn't in my room very often and I assume that most people going there on vacation/business wouldn't be either. If you're looking for a simple, little hotel to stay in for a few nights, this is it.

It all depends on your budget and how much stuff you have to carry. We stayed for 3 nights and had one of the more expensive boutique rooms. The rooms are stylish and modern and are everything you need. There is free coffee in reception but breakfast wasn't included. Attached to the hotel is a bar, but its nice, friendly and there was no noise from the bar to disturb you. Parking is limited to the street but Boston isn't really a driving City. I would suggest arriving in Boston, do everything on foot and if you are travelling on get a car from Hertz at Park Plaza for when you leave ( again with-in easy walking distance from the hotel ). If you are doing this, take your bags to Hertz rather than leaving them at the hotel and driving back. We got lost in the one way system getting back to the hotel.

My room was small, dank smelling and had a 'queen sized bed' that was surely no larger than a double. The bathroom was appalling. It was tiny and the tiles were cracked and old. The shower had a pipe with a hole at the top rather than a real showerhead fixture. In general, there were no amenities to speak of - no tissues in the bathroom, not a pen / pencil or piece of paper, only an armoire style box for a closet. I could barely fit my suitcase in the room without tripping over it. The TV/Cable barely worked (very basic cable) and there wasn't even an extra chair to sit in save the plastic (yes plastic!) desk chair. Ick. I had hoped for a bit more. For an extra $20/night, I found a few nearby chain hotels. I am no luxury hotel gal but I couldn't stay.

The rooms are on the smaller side, but I already knew that by reading other reviews. I actually got to see both the 'standard' rooms and the 'boutique' rooms. We didn't feel the need to pay the higher price for the boutique, since we were just there a couple days siteseeing around Boston before traveling down to Cape Cod for a few more days. But as it turned out, the internet did not work in our standard room so they upgraded us to a boutique at no charge. Yes, both are pretty small rooms! You got to give up space for location sometime. I also highly recommend the Old Town Trolly tour. Even though you can walk to many of the sites from the hotel, the trolly lets you see much more, and really gives you a feel for the city. You get 2 consecutive days riding, and can get off and on at any of the stops as often as you like! It rained our 2nd day, so it sure came in handy.

I arrived at the Chandler (one block away from the bus station so a good start) to find that for some reason the third party booking company I had used had cancelled my reservation. The staff were fantastic. They checked me in with a calming drink while we waited to get a resolution where as they could have quite easily kicked me out on the street. On fixing my problem I found that the team there consistently provided me with excellent advice on where to dine, what to see in town, best forms of transportation and all and, in the case of the Night Porter, recommendations on classic and independent British Cinema. The room was spotless, and was always cleaned by the time I came back to the hotel after a days sightseeing and the location is very good. It's a ten minute walk to Boston Common for the start of the Freedom Trail and about the same to the Prudential Building for anyone planning to got up to the top of the Skywalk. There is also a T station just across the street. As already pointed out the Hotel doesn't have a restaurant attached to it and the only bar is a bit heavy on fellas (turns out it's a gay sports bar so that sort of figures) but the Berkley Cafe around the corner does wicked omlettes and a good cup of coffe. There is also all you can drink coffee in the hotel lobby. As for dining, I found that the staff at the Chandler had a range of local menus and were able to give restaurant recommendations and directions to make things a little easier. So I would definitely recommend the Chandler Inn to anyone. Compared to other local prices it was a snip at about $300 for 3 nights in September.

The room was rather basic (a bed, a wardrobe, a nightstand, a desk and a TV), but clean and pleasant. The bed was soft and comfortable. There are a few things that can be looked upon as drawbacks: - the air conditioning system is not particularly state-of-the-art. But, as it was not hot outside, 15 minutes of active conditioning was enough to cool the room and sleep well till morning. - it is sort of noisy in the evening/at night, as there is a bar downstairs.

It is obvious that they have put a lot of time and effort into making this hotel as nice as they can, and have done a great job. I have high expectations when it comes to travel in contrast to my value-seeking husband, so I was a little reluctant to stay at the Chandler Inn when he told me about it. I thought there was no way that it could be as nice as described at such low prices, but I was proved wrong. It was even nicer than what I had expected. The value cannot be beat, especially in such a convenient location. The decor throughout the entire hotel is very stylish, modern, & unique. The rooms are a little small, but they have definitely made the most of the space that they have. The rooms are extremely clean and neat. The furniture is brand new and very modern. The beds are very comfortable, with very clean linens. The room does not have a \"hotel\" smell at all. There is a nice flat-screen TV with DirecTV. There is an ipod player in the room. It is obvious that they have paid attention to details to make their guests' stays as enjoyable as possible. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the bathroom! They have also made excellent use of the small space in the bathroom. The walk in glass shower is very nice with room for 2. I would love to use some of the ideas from the bathroom in my own house. We had no issues with anything at the hotel. It was quiet. We never heard anything or anyone else. Check in and check out was quick and efficient. House keeping did a great job cleaning and replacing towels and toiletries. I must say that the Chandler Inn may not be for everyone.... if you are looking for a 5 star hotel luxury and that is your only standard, then this hotel may not be for you. I do have high standards but as a young couple, this was perfect for us. I LOVED the unique charm and didn't want to leave!

I assumed they went thru a renovation and that the photos on Expedia were old, so I went through with the reservation and requested a King bed. When we arrived, they had me sign in and on my reservation it was written in large letters \"EXPEDIA\". The elevator up to our room was done in all grey and opened up into a dingy stairwell from which you then enter a long hall to your hotel room. When we got into our room, Room 404, I was shocked by the size and look. It looked nothing like the rooms on the hotel's website. It was a creepy little room with stained carpet, very cheap furnishings, no luggage rack, no closet (just a tiny faux blonde wood laminated armoire), a polyester bedspread on a FULL-SIZE BED and a view of the office building directly across the street - out of one small window that was bolted shut and had an air conditioning unit that took up half the window. There was one outlet in the entire room and everything was plugged into it, so to charge a phone, we had to choose something to unplug. The light fixture in the ceiling gave off a depressing fluorescent hum and the bathroom was so tiny we couldn't put any of our toiletries in it, we had to keep them all on the only surface in the room - the small desk. The bathroom door had been painted so many times, that it didn't shut properly. We went downstairs and asked about another room as I had requested a King size bed, but was told they only had twins and queen-sized beds (ours was not a queen - but a Full...there is a significant difference). I suspected that they had \"Expedia\" rooms and that since we got a good price we were given this small, dingy room, but after reading other reviews, I guess they're all the same. I haven't stayed in such a depressing room since backpacking through Europe on a punishing budget. The only positive things were the location and the cleanliness of the room. One last note: it would be really nice if the older guys at the front desk were a little warmer; really, I mean, curt one-word answers don't cut it in customer service anymore. Just because people don't want to pay the truly outrageous hotel prices that seem to have become standard in the past few years, doesn't mean we deserve substandard customer service.

This time for 5 nights taking in a conference and some other business. I find it hard to understand the negative reviews this hotel gets. Sure, its a budget hotel - but you know that when you book it. With the Marriotts of the world @ circa $300 per night you are not going to get the Ritz for $150 per night in Boston. Regardless of what people have paid that is the 'going' rate. Don't use the hotels own site use one of the others - the rates are better. Yes the rooms are small and the bathroom smaller. I understand the guy who said the rooms remind him of his college dorm - but they are entirely adequate. The location is great (5 minutes to Backbay station or 10 minutes to Boyleston) with cafes around the corner, a CVS across the road and pizza and other food within a few minutes walk. The neighbour pleasant and non threatening and the hotel is clean. I've always found the staff pleasant and helpful. There appear to be some refurbished rooms (last time I stayed on the 8th floor in one) but I prefer the non-refurb room I stayed in the 1st time and this time as it has a desk. The free wifi works well but not, I guess, in all rooms as I've seen a few people sitting in the corridor with their laptops. Lets face it you are not going to stay here if you are on a corporate expense account. But as a budget choice in Boston I don't see much not to like.

You may need to do around 10-15 minutes of (brisk) walking to get to Boston Common and other sites of interest, but at least you're already starting out in a good part of the city. The room itself was average. We were a little unsure of what to make of the burn marks in the comforter, but the sheets and carpet were clean, as well as the bathroom. Also, we had (over the air-conditioner) a rather nice view of the street below. Essentially, the hotel looks slightly run-down, but for how clean it is, outdated decor isn't a problem.

It is about two blocks off the MM at Delaware and Mies Van der Rohe. The rooms are suites (as you can guess) and that is very nice. The rooms are comfortable and clean. They have two HD TVs in each suite. I have two, well three, well, four quibbles. 1) The internet is not reliable, particularly in the meeting rooms. I know they have upgraded it in the hotel because when I was there in November, I couldn't pick it up in my room and when I called the help number he actually advised me to try going into the hall to see if I could get it there. In my jammies? I think not. It was definitely better this time around, but still frustrating. 2) My second quibble is that on the morning of my departure, housekeeping came into my room and made up the bed and the bathrooms before I had checked out. I found this inappropriately intrusive. I still, for example, wanted to wash up and the used soaps had been thrown out. I ended up spreading a bath towel on the bed so that I could put my suitcase there to pack without messing up the linens. I had also assumed no one would enter the room and so I had left things out that I would normally have locked up. 3) I used the fitness center and neither of the televisions on two treadmills I tried worked nor did the heart rate monitors. The television on the recumbent cycle had so few channels and most were ESPN. Again, frustrating. 4) Fourth quibble, which is just insane, I know, but I really cringe at the upholstery on the sofa in the living room. It's straight up ugly and every time I check in, I hope that someone would have the good sense to change it, but sadly, no. The colors/rugs/drapes/etc. etc. are all quite lovely, but lordy, I do not like the sofa. All in all though, I like this hotel a lot. It's convenient, comfortable, a good value, the restaurant has yummy food, the bar mixes nice drinks.

The view is mainly of several residential towers, and we could see what one guy was grilling on his balcony at one point. The room itself was clean, but the wear is starting to show. Yellowing switch plates, peeling wall paper, toothpaste stains on the mirror frame etc. The 'king' bed (we have one at home, this was not a king size bed) was comfortable, and we slept well. The sofa sleeper was pretty lumpy and I doubt an adult would be comfortable, but our kids were ok with it. The staff were however quick to respond when we found our safe had not been left unlocked by the previous guest, and when we needed a new hair dryer because the old one was broken. We didn't eat here, the prices for breakfast were a little ridiculous ($14 for a coffee and a Danish?!).

The correct room was available on our arrival, and the room seemed clean, bright, and well appointed. It was also a fairly spacious room. Even though it was close to the elevator, the room was quiet. My father, my brother and I shared a room with two \"doubles\" (felt like queen-size) and a pullout couch. The room has a small wet bar which includes a sink, a refrigerator, a microwave (stored underneath, oddly) and a two-cup coffee maker (which was inoperative on our arrival but quickly replaced). The thermostat is near the window in the pullout-couch room, and had to be turned up to nearly 80F to achieve a comfortable temperature - a design/installation flaw the maintenance person assured me. Also, between the two rooms are double doors with ball catches at the top. One door did not have this catch - maintenance informed me they did not have the part to fix it. Not a huge deal but a little odd. The only somewhat major drawback was my brother reported (as have others) that the pullout was very uncomfortable. I cannot personally report on it as I did not sleep there. (Hey, I was paying for the room, I was sleeping in a real bed!) The doubles were really quite comfortable, on the other hand. Wired Internet didn't seem to work (the modem had been unplugged from power, but even plugged in it wouldn't connect). WiFi/Internet access wasn't free anyway. At a downtown Hilton in a major city, having to pay for Internet access is unreasonable. (On the plus side, I discovered the 4G-LTE signal was powerful and the one-time low-cost tethering program works well.) Another very over-the-top expense was parking. We had taken a cab to the hotel, but when family came to visit they found there is no nearby parking and the valet costs $35.00 for between 2-6 hours. (I think it was $27.00 for 0-2 hours and something like $50 for beyond 6 hours.) The family lives in town and said the cost was beyond the pale.

It features a relatively small, attractive and placid lobby. The front-desk staff is pleasant and efficient. But the rooms are what make this place such a good value for the money.

The cozy sleeping area is separated from the spacious sitting area, which features a couch, cocktail. lounger and work desk, as well as a bar area with a mini-fridge, microwave, sink and coffee service (which has Lavazza coffee and actual liquid creamer!). My bedroom featured an uber-comfortable king bed that I didn't want to crawl out of on a cold Chicago morning. It also contained a vanity area. And though the rooms won't win any contests for edgy design, the soothing earth tones and comfortable furnishings will be a welcome sight for a tired traveler. The spacious bathroom (with excellent shower pressure and Peter Thomas Roth bath products) could be accessed from the bedroom or the sitting room. Both the bedroom and sitting room featured flat-screen TVs, though the channel selection was rather limited. With so much good grub in Chicago, I didn't bother with the hotel restaurant or room service, which was typically overpriced. There's also a little lobby shop that serves Starbucks coffee.

As for the suites, I'd warn you not to expect a sprawling layout. The standard suite is as large as a regular hotel room broken up into two with a wall in the middle. The king size bed in the bedroom left just enough room all the way around to walk and that's about it. There are two plasma TVs, a microwave and a fridge to give you some options other than the exhorbitently priced restaurants. My complaints? The maid forgot to clean our room the first morning. After getting back after a long day and complaining at the front desk, it still took another two hours before it was done. Just our bad luck. Next on the list is the valet only parking at $50 a night with no local public garages running much cheaper than that. I hated to cough up a lung to pay for something we hardly used while there.

The rooms are standard hotel size, but they \"cut them in half\" to make a suite. It ends up being a tight experience, especially when you use the pull-out bed. The humidity in the room was noticeable. The a/c unto could not keep up with it, and it was noisy. Most disturbing is that in the bedroom, the windows are lower to to floor and open up inward toward the bed. For a family with younger children, say 2-6 years old, who may jump around on the bed, I envisioned our kids jumping up and then out the windows. Seriously, this is a poorly planned window design and a child up to about 40 pounds could easily slip through out the window. Needless to say, we kept the windows closed, and it was a stuffy, unpleasant room because of the poor ac unit. As to the rest of the room, the carpeting was worn and in need of a cleaning. Vacuuming was insufficient, so we wore our socks on the floor. Standard bath amenities. Be careful in the restaurant. They offer a breakfast buffet, but they are certainly willing to seat you 10 minutes before it is over, charge you for it, not tell you the end time, and then start cleaning it up and closing it before you finish your first plate. That was annoying. Restaurant service is exceptionally slow. They seem to have a lot of employees circling around and socializing in the restaurant, but they are not attentive to keeping the water glasses filled, and the food is average. The location of the property is very good near Michigan Ave. The pool is nice, but I think they need to work on balancing the chemicals as the water was persistently foggy. The exercise area is average, it is smaller than compared to nearby properties. Views are very good. Front desk staff very friendly. Towels and linens were more than half way through their life, somewhat worn. Overall, this is a budget-quality hotel, that is overpriced which they justify based on the location. I would probably not stay here again, mainly because the carpeting was worn and gross, and there was a lack of attention to detail such as restaurant performance and safety.

The positives: staff were friendly and helpful and the location is very convenient. The negatives: Spa was being renovated, which we weren't told about ahead of time and we were unable to use at all during our stay.

Sofa bed extremely uncomfortable, air conditioning system very noisy - some metal panel or something would bang each time the air kicked on and off, keeping us from sleeping well. In the bathroom, there was a big hole around the sprinkler in the ceiling and rough looking panel cut in the ceiling in both the bathroom and bedroom. ( TV in bedroom was not flat screen, not an issue for me, but this seems to bother some people so I am mentioning it. ) Now I know I booked the double beds, and had the sofa bed been reasonably comfortable they might not have been an issue for us, but I have to wonder on the decision to use double beds at all. Double beds might have been ok for two people in the 1700s, but not in this day and age.

The bedroom was small, but it was spearated by french doors from the living area, which was nice for privacy. Decor was kind of blah and very standard. I expected more from a Hilton in Chicago. We were only given 2 towels each day, and the room attendants replaced our towels even though we had them hanging on the rack, indicating we'd use them again. There were several elevators, though only one or two seemed to be operational. This hotel was ok for our purposes, needing two sleeping areas and some privacy and a decent price for our quick, last minute trip. Though, I was the one \"sleeping\" on the pull out couch and didn't really sleep. So, yes, a nice stay, nice location for shopping. But, I woudn't really recommend this hotel because of the \"suite\" factor. Just spring for a second room if you can afford it or be prepared to have a stiff back if you're the one sleeping on the couch. I probably wouldn't stay here on a return trip to Chicago, just because there's so many options and I'd like to try a different location for different activities.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Champaign, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel, great location, great price\u201d", "Author": "amandafrye", "ReviewID": "UR92243023", "Content": "I booked this hotel through priceline and ended up paying $63 total for the night.

The supervisor said they would be getting back with me. However, they never called back to check on anything or even apologize. I called back to the front desk and said I was not happy with the room.

They offered to have someone come and check out the room to make sure there were no bugs. That was something I could have done - and when looking at the vents in the wall that a roach could easily come through, it wouldn't have given me much peace of mind. Therefore, I said that would not help. The only other option they offered was to make a reservation at another hotel. This is what I ended up choosing. No bugs so far at the Millenium Knickerbocker.

Then they kept the 14.95 and released the 200.00. This certainly affected my attitude from the start and caused me to pull back what I would have spent in the city.

Although the hotel looks beautiful, I would avoid staying here, no matter what, because what happened to us was not an aberration, but a result of hotel policy. They called us just after midnight, when we were about 10 minutes from arriving and told us the hotel was oversold and that our room was not available. Their solution was for us to come in and get our \"walk slip\" and then take it to another hotel in the suburbs near the airport. We were to pay full price and the other hotel was not a suite, but a room with one bed. So $250 bucks for a room comparable to what we could have booked for 75 bucks. I told them that staying in a room on Michigan Ave, in a suite with a pool and spa on the 30th floor is a bit different from a roadside motel in the suburbs. The person calling told me, \"since the city is oversold, that is all we can offer.\" I explained that we had booked weeks in advance, that we were following each other in 2 cars in a city we didn't know well after midnight and that we had already driven over 600 miles that day and we were quite tired, so trying to find another hotel and then having some of us sleep on the floor was a real inconvenience. I asked for a second room, or to be booked in a downtown hotel and they simply repeatedly said, \"Sir, I am only authorized to put you in this room.\" We were moving from California to Virginia and we were very excited to stay at this hotel, because the suite allowed my college age son and his finace the pull out sofa in the living room, while our 5 year old could just sleep in the king with us. The location is great and we had lived there when oldest son was a toddler, so we were going to show them the area and to go to the Cubs game the following day at noon. So we were very bummed about not staying downtown. I began to feel very sorry for the employee who had called us because she let slip that she had done this several nights in a row and that she was very embarrassed about this hotel's policy about over booking. She clearly understood that we were not going to be able to find another downtown hotel at this late hour. When I went on the hotel website to make a complaint to the central office, I was surprised to see that the Hilton site has a tab for complaints about overbooking of their hotels, so this is clearly an ongoing problem for this chain and in particular this hotel. Fortunately, we usually stay at Marriott's and since we have \"gold status\" from business travel, they were able to find us a hotel in the suburbs with 2 rooms for 75 bucks per room. We finally got to our room at 2:20am. I stay about 75 nights a year in hotels, which is not usually fun, but if you book in a nice hotel, the service is usually great and in the 21st century, you can certainly expect a room to be held for you when you arrive if you've made a reservation with a credit card, after all if you don't show for any reason, they will certainly charge you for the night.

Well it is both. It is frequently the best price in the area and it is right off the Mile. So if price and location are your top priorities then stay here. If you are traveling with kids you are likely attracted to exactly those qualities - trust me you will not be alone the hotel is full of kids. I don't mind the kids - but I'd never stay here again. When I booked I reserved a king suite. I did that because I wanted a king and a work area. I'm traveling for business and I needed to work in the room. I check the Hilton zip-in check in box so that I would not be delayed. I arrived to find the hotel was a disaster. The woman at the desk was pitiful.After 10 minutes of typing into her computer she called the manager who pointed out that the system was locked up and her computer needed to be restarted. I asked about the zip in folders which at most hiltons let's you avoid this kind of issue. I was told \"we don't do that here.\" I don't know what that means - this one hotel in the Hilton chain is rebelling against efficiency? (and if that is what they intended they are a raving success). When I finally got a room key and went to the room it was a double. I called the desk and was told the hotel had nothing but doubles. Now if you understand how Hilton's zip in system works you know immediately that this hotel must be managed by middle school dropouts. I was then told that the double room was an upgrade and I was lucky not to be charged more (???). I was later able to talk to a day shift manager who agreed that his night clerk was an idiot and he adjusted my bill. so I guess I should be happy that I didn't have to pay the premium that I had agreed to pay for a king room since I didn't get one. The room itself was a sad little affair. There were 2 double beds (not queens so if you're taller than 5'6\" enjoy the dangling feet experience) plus a sofa and a dresser and a desk and a coffee table and another table. Picture a garage sale - that's what the room looked like. The space was way too small for the amount of furniture stuffed in the room. Then there was the fridge. Since they advertise a fridge in the room I guess they figured they better stick one in there. Since the room was a junkyard anyway there wasn't much worry about where to put it. So it's by the door. I mean right by the door - as in when you enter the room be careful not to trip over the fridge. Seriously - this is a pigsty of a hotel. The one bright spot was room service - the food was decent and the service was good (and since there is so much crap int he room there were lots of places to set the tray down. When I left in the morning the day shift seemed pleasant - a lot more competent that the night shift. perhaps mine was an unusual experience - but I'll never stay here again.

When we arrived I was able to check in and get my room keys from the check-in machine in the lobby, which saved us a lot of time since there was a line at the Hilton Hhonors desk. We were in our room in a flash and ready to settle in. The first thing I noticed when we walked in the room was the nice living area of the suite. There was a wet bar in one corner, along with a desk, a couch and a flat screen TV. You could access the bathroom and the bedroom from the living area. There were three in our party: my sister in law, my seven year old daughter and myself. My daughter loved the flat screen TV, and it wasn't long before she found the Cartoon Network! The bedroom area of the suite was really small. There was just enough room to walk around the beds. There was also a door from the bedroom to the bathroom. Having the dual access to the bath was nice. We didn't have to plow through our mess in the bedroom to get there! There was also a TV in the bedroom. The bathroom was also tiny. With 2 1/2 women trying to get ready it got a little crowded. I ended up setting my compact mirror on the desk in the living area so my SIL could get in the bathroom to shower. A vanity separate from the bath would've been nice. Our service was, for the most part, stellar. All of the employees were friendly and cheerful. The concierge was helpful, but not exceptionally friendly, but all of the people we spoke to at the front desk were great. We didn't try the restaurant, but were able to redeem our free breakfast coupons in the little coffee shop in the hotel. You gotta love Krispy Kreme doughnuts! The only glitch we ran into was on our last night there. It was a Saturday night, and my daughter wanted to hit the pool. The pool was to close in 30 minutes, but I thought we could get in a quick dip. When we got in the elevator, it wouldn't go to the floor where the pool was. I called the front desk, and they assured me that my key card should work, and to just try again. We tried again, to no avail. I called the front desk again, only to be informed that the pool had closed for the night. I was a little peeved because it was supposed to be open another 30 minutes, but there wasn't much we could do about it. Overall we had a great stay. The bellmen were great and very helpful. The hotel was convenient to Michigan Avenue and there was a bus stop just down the street about a block.

We knew that this bed was not king sized, and we were not about to stay in the tiny little bed, so we asked for the manger on duty. The manger accompanied us to see another room, and when she returned to our room, she realized that the bed in our room was indeed smaller. She did move us to the other room, but it was a pain to repack and lug our belongings to the new floor. We wondered how many other rooms were being advertised as having a king size bed that instead had one like the one in our first room. The manger did give us breakfast coupons, which was very nice of her, but it does not change the fact that if you ask for a king size bed, you might get stuck instead with one of the small ones ( looked like a double) Be sure to ask about this if you call for a reservation. And, check it out once you get into the room. There were a few other problems as well--the air conditioner did not work, and the room was as hot as hades during the night. Bathroom bulb was burned out and not replaced during our stay even though we left a note for housekeeping. The pool is very nice- although a bit small. It was warm and enjoyable for swimming. Because of its small size though, the number of children in there with their parents made it difficult to manuever and stay out of the way. All in all, we found this place just OK.

The hotel was extremely busy and crowded when we arrived. It was Labor Day weekend, and I believe there was also a wedding going on at the hotel, so this didn't surprise me. I think, however, they could have done a better job preparing for the crowd. We arrived in a cab with a lot of luggage and were unable to get a bellhop or any hotel employee to help us with our bags or even hold the door open for us as we carried them in. We struggled to get all our luggage past the crowd of people on the sidewalk in front of the door and in the lobby and then had to wait almost 10 minutes in line at the front desk. Some other frustrated people tried to use the automated check-in instead of waiting in line, but it wasn't working properly. Not the best first impression. We finally got to the front of the line, and the staff member who checked us in was friendly and helpful. We were initially given a smoking room (not the hotel's mistake) and were quickly moved to a non-smoking room when we asked. Unfortunately, the room they put us in had no lights in the bathroom. Both light bulbs over the sink had burned out. When I called the front desk about this, I was told that they were out of stock of those light bulbs and wouldn't get any in until the following week. I was a little upset about this, especially since it seemed that the staff member was basically telling me there was nothing they could do about it. I asked if we could be moved to another room that had lights in the bathroom, and he said he would have a manager call me back. A manager never called, but they did send someone up to bring us one lightbulb, which was apparently taken from the bathroom of some other room. So at least we had some light in the bathroom...but it seemed a little ridiculous that they weren't prepared for something like that when they knew they would have a full house for Labor Day. We had no other problems during our stay. It was very quiet at night. The rooms were clean and reasonably spacious, and the beds were very comfortable. The staff was generally pleasant and helpful. As I said before, the location was great. The fact that all the rooms are suites is also a bonus if you need an extra bed. I also liked that the room had a separate vanity (which I had to use for getting ready in the morning since we had very dim bathroom lighting), a microwave and little refrigerator. There is also a coffee shop and a restaurant (open all day) in the lobby of the hotel, and the stay includes free use of their pool and fitness center. Having one burned-out light bulb in the bathroom for the duration of our stay seemed to be a minor issue, especially since I got an excellent rate on the hotel room for Labor Day weekend as part of a group rate for a wedding. If, however, I had had to pay the regular price for the hotel room, I think I would have felt a little ripped off. You don't expect something like that from a hotel like this. In sum, the service was ok, the place was clean, comfortable and in a great location, and it was just fine for a discounted price ($160/night).

Hilton Suites are the best of both worlds - the facilities of a proper hotel and the amenities of the type of place that usually caters to business travelers. For instance, a Hilton Garden Inn will have a fridge and microwave, while a Hilton hotel won't, but Hilton Suites have not only a fridge, microwave, and little sink, they also have the sitting area completely separated from the bedroom. Even if you plan to spend a lot of time out sightseeing, it's always nice to come back and plop down on your sofa in front of your flat-screen TV and pull a cold soda or bottle of water out of the fridge and relax. Then there's the service. I have found that front desk people at Hiltons are frequently more friendly and helpful than at the other major chains I use. The guy who checked us in was an absolute sweetheart, more helpful with tourist hints than the concierge was, and really interested in the success of our stay.

Room was ready when I arrived at 9pm sunday night. Room was half way up the tower with a glimpse of the lake between the buildings. It was near the elevator but very quiet. The room is a two room suite with a living room with desk, flat screen tv, wetbar, and sofa. The bedroom had a king bed. This room was excellently outfitted for the business traveller. It was the first room I stayed in where I could work on the laptop, eat room service, and channel surf through the TV, all at the same time from one sitting location. The desk was large and had a pull out table for dinner. So no clearing off the desk for the dinner. Moreover, the TV was on a wall next to the desk so I could watch the tube inbetween emails and bites of dinner. The bedroom was small, just big enough for the king bed and too small for a regular door. Mine had skinny french doors which was odd, but they worked fine. The bathroom was spacious and everything worked well. My only complaint was that they forgot to make up my room while I was gone all day at work. I came back at 9pm the next night to find the room as I left it in the morning. I called the operator and the maid service was sent immediately and they quickly replaced my towels etc. The rooms are recently renovated and they look really nice. Also the hotel has windows that open which means you can get fresh air. This is getting more unusual these days for high rise hotels and it was much appreciated by me, especially since the new furniture and carpet in the room still has an odor and thus the rooms can use a bit of airing out from the new materials. Another small issue was that I needed a credit card receipt because I paid in advance. Hilton did not email me any receipt and the hotel could not give me the information. So I had to call Hilton after my stay and ask for a receipt. They were able to email me the receipt within an hour of my phone call and I was able to submit with my business expenses. Staff was friendly and helpful. I would stay there again on another trip.", "Date": "April 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat room; great staff\u201d", "Author": "marcene", "ReviewID": "UR7394130", "Content": "During Easter break we stayed 2 week-nights at the Hilton Suites and found it very comfortable for 2 adults and 2 kids (ages 10 & 13).

Sauna control was broken but didn't really miss it. We did not hear any disruptive noise during our stay. As others wrote, be prepared for expensive parking at hotel (we traveled by train & taxis). Restaurant at hotel (Mrs. Parks Tavern) was very spendy for breakfast ($3 for kids milk; $3.50 for apple juice); we only ate there because of a promotional coupon. Cheesecake Factory nearby is good, but very busy (70 min wait). Make reservation then wait back at hotel!

The room was not a 2 room suite, but we had plenty of room for a family of five (2 adults, 3 children). Two double beds and a pull out sofa. Had a great view on the 26th floor of the John Hancock Building. Also microwaves and a mini refrigerator were complimentary which is a great plus with kids. Pool was OK and room service was fine.

The cab fare from O'hare was $45 dollars and valet parking was $43 per day. On Saturday 3/31I we took cab from hotel to field Museum which cost $19 plus tip. Therese no street parking around downtown Chicago so by mid day I decided to rent a car. We had dinner at a Cheesecake factory restuarant upon our return across the street in the Hancock tower. On 4/1we took a trip to a Harrahs Casino in Joliet which is about a 45 minute drive. The hotel has no in room safe so i stored several electronic devives in my hard side samsonite TSA approved luggage. Upon return I went to pack for departure th e next day the lock was broken on one side. I filed a report with hotel security and made a follow up call but have heard nothing. We went to an early lunch at The Signature Room on the 95 Floor of the Hancock Tower which has a lunch buffet for $18.99 M-S excluding drinks and dessert.

We booked this hotel due to the proximity to all the tourist sights in chicago and we were not disappointed! The hotel was fantastic, all the staff were very polite and their service was second to none. All the services provided by the hotel were good, the restaurant was reasonably priced and the food was delicious. The bar also had no faults and was suitable for a quiet drink, with the bar staff being always attentive to your needs while making you feel very welcome. The pool (although we didn't use it) looked good and gave you a view over the lake which was impressive! But the best part of the hotel for both of us was the room, it was spacious but comfortable consisting of a living area with microwave, fridge, coffee machine, plasma tv, a well equiped bathroom, and a bedroom with the WORLDS MOST COMFORTABLE BED!! Let's put it this way I would never get up for work if this was my bed at home!! The hotel is in walking distant or a short taxi ride for shopping, restaurants, and all the major tourist sights. I would recommend to eat at the Cheesecake factory situated under the John Hancock building, the banana cream cheesecake for dessert is a must! Follow this up by a drink in the signature lounge (at the top of the John Hancock building) for the most breath taking night-time view of the city. I also recommend a visit to the Lincoln Park zoo its full of great animals and its free!!
